Juan Martinez (SFS ’20), the former transition chair of the Georgetown University Student Association senate, is the new GUSA president, effective Sept. 16, replacing Sahil Nair (SFS ’19), who resigned Sept. 11.
Martinez was sworn in Sunday and will serve as president for the remaining 2018-19 presidential term, culminating when the next president is sworn in, which historically has been the first week of March.
GUSA has not yet formally announced Martinez’s presidency.
Nair resigned Sept. 11 after senior members of the GUSA executive, including Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19), resigned amid misconduct allegations against Nair.
No complaints had been filed against Nair through the Title IX office or the Office of Student Conduct, he wrote in a May 28 email to The Hoya. A university spokesperson confirmed that, as of May 2019, Nair was not the subject of any complaints through either office nor had he been found responsible for any violations of the Student Code of Conduct.
Per GUSA bylaws, Martinez became president as a result of vice president and chief of staff vacancies, after Rahman and former Chief of Staff Aaron Bennett (COL ’19) resigned Sept. 14 after GUSA senators demanded resignations of GUSA senior executives at an emergency senate meeting Sept. 11.
Currently, the GUSA executive branch includes Martinez and policy chairs, who were appointed by Nair’s presidency and confirmed by the senate.
Martinez will appoint the next vice president, to be confirmed by a two-thirds majority in the senate. The confirmed senate elections will take place after Sept. 30, when freshman senate elections fill the currently vacant positions, according to Martinez.
At the presidential swearing-in Sunday, the GUSA senate also passed a resolution that emphasized the need to disseminate resources offering support for students after Nair’s resignation.
The senate resolution also included a letter that issued an apology to GUSA senior executives and the student body for demanding resignations at the emergency senate meeting Sept. 11.
“The actions of the GUSA Senate on Tuesday, September 11, 2018 were brash and filled with emotion. The GUSA Senate moved immediately to vilify members of GUSA, rather than focusing on supporting survivors and being cognizant of the effects of our words,” the statement reads. “To those whose resignations we demanded, we apologize for acting immediately and harshly without a more clear, thorough discussion.”
Martinez affirmed the sentiments published in the senate letter and said he is committed to helping move GUSA forward through his remaining term.
“The letter speaks about this, but just making sure that we’re not blaming people now, we’re not pointing fingers, we’re creating GUSA into a space of healing and making sure we can heal for the rest of this term and hopefully really change the culture of GUSA,” Martinez said in an interview with The Hoya.
Bennett appreciated the senate’s apology and said he was confident in the way he and other GUSA executives responded last week after Nair’s resignation.
“When it became clear to those of us in GUSA leadership that our then-president had lost the support of student communities and was the subject of student concerns, we acted promptly and in good faith – notifying appropriate parties of our concerns, including the Administration,” Bennett wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “Our intentions were always to protect the safety, privacy, and rights of those involved as well as the interests of student advocacy on campus.”
The senate resolution, which passed in a 14-to-1 vote by the senate, urged that the Women’s Center, Counseling and Psychiatric Services, Health Education Services, Project Lighthouse, the Title IX Office, the LGBTQ Resource Center and other campus resources be promoted to the student body and all community members.
Though a joint effort by senators, the resolution was introduced by Transition Vice Chair of the Senate Patrick Walsh (SFS ’21) and co-sponsored by Transition Chair Eliza Lafferty (COL ’21), as well as GUSA Senators Samuel Appel (COL ’20) and Claire Smith (COL ’19) to reflect on the emergency senate meeting last week. Walsh and Lafferty became transition vice chair and chair respectively under Martinez’s leadership.
“The motivation for it was just to clarify some things, talk about how we felt on Tuesday at our emergency senate meeting,” Walsh said. “We were in a pretty emotional state as well, it was all happening very fast, so some statements were made that seemed hasty and the biggest regret that we have is that we didn’t start anything with the providing of resources.”
Bennett expressed his support of the senate resolution in ensuring students have access to resources on campus.
“I deeply appreciate the GUSA senate’s apology for its hasty actions on September 11,” Bennett wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I understand and share the senators’ concerns for ensuring a safe campus community and reaffirm their resolution on available resources for the student body.”
Rahman echoed Bennett’s support of the senate resolution and hopes GUSA will continue to advocate for the student body to create impactful policy.
“My hope is that GUSA will continue to tirelessly serve the student body. There are voices in student government here that deserved to be heard on policy, loud and clear,” Rahman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These are voices that want to make an impact and will make an impact. We hope that students at Georgetown will keep on utilizing GUSA as an avenue for advocacy and change on this campus.”
Over the coming weeks, Martinez will meet with GUSA leadership, policy chairs and students on campus to develop a platform that widely encompasses students’ concerns.
“I didn’t campaign for this obviously … but my goal is to make sure that policy chairs are being recognized and that their input is being heard,” Martinez said. “I cannot tell you 100 percent what students need on campus. I will be sitting down with students in the following weeks to talk about what GUSA can do to build a platform that is representative of our needs as a body.”

A petition urging Georgetown University to revoke the honorary degrees of Cardinals Theodore McCarrick and Donald Wuerl for their roles in widespread reported sexual misconduct within the Catholic Church has been signed by 1,376 individuals.
McCarrick has been under fire since June, when allegations of sexual misconduct against men and boys surfaced against him. Wuerl was found to be involved in covering up sexual misconduct in August when a Pennsylvania grand jury report was released that detailed seven decades’ worth of such misconduct in Pennsylvania churches. Students at Georgetown have been pressuring the university to take a stronger stance against McCarrick’s and Wuerl’s actions, but the university has yet to take action.
Ten students delivered the petition to University President John J. DeGioia’s office Sept. 14. The petition calls for the university to revoke the honorary degrees of Wuerl and McCarrick, to condemn church leadership for its role in covering up the abuse, and to demand the resignation of Wuerl. Other Catholic institutions, including the Catholic University of America and Fordham University, have already rescinded the degrees previously bestowed upon McCarrick.
“As a Jesuit university, Georgetown is obligated to speak out against injustice, especially when our own leaders in D.C. neglect that duty,” the petition reads.
Both Wuerl and McCarrick, having served as archbishops of Washington, developed relationships with Georgetown University. Both received honorary degrees from the university — McCarrick in 2004 and Wuerl in 2014 — and McCarrick collaborated with Georgetown’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, speaking at several of their events.
On June 20, the Archdiocese of New York removed McCarrick, former archbishop emeritus of Washington, from public ministry after an investigation found that the allegations that he had sexually abused a minor were credible.
Multiple accusations against McCarrick surfaced in the following month, and he resigned July 28, The New York Times reported.
After the Pennsylvania report came out Aug. 14 detailing seven decades’ worth of sexual misconduct across the state of Pennsylvania, Wuerl was implicated for his actions while he led the Diocese of Pittsburgh. Wuerl led the Diocese from 1986 to 2006, before becoming archbishop of Washington.
Wuerl, facing pressure over his role in allowing abuse to continue, is currently meeting with the pope to discuss the resignation he submitted in 2015, as all bishops are required by church law to do when they turn 75. The pope has not yet accepted Wuerl’s resignation.
Austin Rose (COL ’18, LAW ’21), in collaboration with Grace Laria (SFS ’19), Max Rosner (COL ’18) and Tomás Álvarez Belón (SFS ’18), started the petition three weeks ago after his first efforts to encourage the university to respond to the Pennsylvania report and to accusations against McCarrick produced no results.
Rose said he was motivated by a personal connection to the systematic abuse in Pennsylvania.
“I was really upset about the sex abuse report largely because at least one member of my family was abused by a priest named in the Pennsylvania report,” Rose said in an interview with The Hoya. “I initially reached out to some members of the administration, sent them an email along with a couple of fellow alums cc’d on the email to see if they would take action. Then they were kind and respectful to me as far as responding, but to the best of my knowledge they didn’t do anything.”
Laria said she is disappointed with the university’s response and saw the petition as a way of holding the university accountable.
“While individual members of faculty and staff have been supportive as I’ve processed this anger and disappointment, to not see a response at the university-level is disturbing and frankly makes no sense to me,” Laria wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I view my signature on this petition as a way of holding Georgetown accountable to affirming its commitment to caring for the whole person and taking a strong stance against the prevalence of sexual assault on our campus.”
DeGioia wrote to the entire Georgetown community condemning the sexual misconduct within the church Sept. 4.
“We have an immediate and urgent need to engage in the work of ‘cultural change’—to create a context in which the most vulnerable among us will be safe and protected, to create a context in which the abuse of power can be identified and eliminated,” DeGioia wrote.
“President DeGioia’s message to the community earlier this month shared that the University has initiated processes to address the deeply troubling revelations about Archbishop McCarrick and those contained in the Pennsylvania grand jury report. This includes an honorary degree review process,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Both Catholic Women at Georgetown and Knights of Columbus have publicly shown support for the petition.
Erica Lizza (COL ’19), president of Catholic Women at Georgetown, said she supports the petition because she believes that responsibility now falls upon the public to hold the church accountable.
“The fact that this pattern keeps resurfacing shows the Church hasn’t fully addressed it, and ordinary Catholics need to show that preventing abuse is important to them,” Lizza wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Catholic Women at Georgetown and the Knights of Columbus are hosting a Eucharistic Holy Hour for victims of sexual abuse Friday to encourage further reflection.
“I hope that the Eucharistic Holy Hour encourages more of the Catholic community on campus to reflect and discuss this moral catastrophe,” Lizza wrote.
Rose said that though rescinding the honorary degrees may not be the most substantial action, it still sends an important message to the community.
“Revoking the degrees send the message that there’s absolutely zero tolerance, that we are not going to accept excuses for that kind of behavior,” Rose said. “This is an easy thing to do, and there really is in my opinion no excuse for not doing this.”

A man was arrested Thursday in the killing of Wendy Martinez (GRD ’12), who was fatally stabbed while jogging in Logan Circle just before 8 p.m. Tuesday night.
The 35-year-old woman, who lived in Northwest Washington, D.C., was attacked on the 1400 block of 11th Street NW at approximately 7:56 p.m., according to the Metropolitan Police Department.
Anthony Marquell Crawford was charged with first-degree murder in the killing. He was arrested Thursday afternoon in a park one mile north of the site of the stabbing. Court records show that he had used synthetic drugs that can cause deranged behavior, according to The Washington Post.
Martinez stumbled into a nearby Chinese takeout restaurant after the assault, according to The Washington Post. Surveillance video from the restaurant shows Martinez entering the restaurant and collapsing, according to USA Today.
Bystanders called 911, and an ambulance brought Martinez to a nearby hospital, where she died from her wounds.
Police suspect the attack was random, according to CBS.
Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) tweeted Thursday offering her condolences to Martinez’s family.
“We hope that with today’s arrest, Wendy Martinez’s family and friends can begin to heal peacefully,” Bowser wrote in the tweet. “Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.”
The suspect was captured on surveillance video, according to the MPD.
“I would say that this is one of those types of unsettling incidents that sometimes happen in large cities, but it seems like a singular incident,” D.C. Chief of Police Peter Newsham said in a press conference Wednesday. “What the motive was, we don’t know. The best thing we can do right now is identify the person that was responsible.”
Martinez attended the University of Florida for her undergraduate education and received a Master of Arts in Latin American studies from Georgetown University, according to NBC4. Martinez became engaged last week, her family said in a statement Wednesday, according to NBC4.
“Wendy Karina Martinez was the light of our lives. Not only was she an avid runner, but she was a devout Christian, a wonderful friend, and a driven professional. Everything you hope that a daughter and a friend could be,” her family said in a statement. “She was also excited to be planning her upcoming wedding to her fiancé, Daniel Hincapie. They were engaged just last week.”
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted out condolences about Martinez’s death. She was born in Nicaragua and raised in Florida.
“The death of Wendy Martinez is so senseless, tragic & heartbreaking,” the tweet reads. “Now the life & career ahead of her was cut short. Can’t even begin to imagine the pain those who loved her are going through.”
Martinez was the chief of staff at FiscalNote, a local technology management company. FiscalNote CEO Tim Hwang issued a statement reacting to the news of Martinez’s death and highlighting her vibrant personality, according to Roll Call. 
“The entire FiscalNote family is shocked and deeply saddened to learn that Wendy Martinez, our Chief of Staff, was killed last night,” Hwang wrote in a statement. “Wendy was an invaluable member of our team and a vibrant member of the community. Our thoughts and prayers are with Wendy’s family and friends.”
Logan Circle has a low crime rate compared to the rest of Washington, D.C., with violent crimes reported very infrequently in the area, according to The Washington Post.
This story was updated at 1:43 a.m. to reflect that a man has been arrested in the case.

UNITE HERE Local 23, the labor union representing Aramark employees, along with two former Aramark employees of Bulldog Tavern filed a lawsuit Aug. 20 against Epicurean and Company for alleged workers’ rights violations.
Plaintiffs Edward Williams and Lisa Moriolé are filing suit with Unite Here Local 23 against Vigor Restaurant LLC, the name of Epicurean and Company, for allegedly violating the 1994 Displaced Workers Protection Act, a provision in D.C. that allows displaced workers to retain employment through a transition employment period.
The contract for Bulldog Tavern switched to Epicurean and Company around July 27, when the on-campus restaurant shuttered its doors without prior notice, according to the lawsuit. The former Bulldog Tavern employees, who were employed by Aramark, suddenly found themselves without work when the Tavern contract switched, Unite Here Local 23 Vice President Josh Armstead said in an interview with The Hoya.
“We’ve worked hard to create a high standard, and we as the workers here are very interested in maintaining that standard,” Armstead said about the union.
The lawsuit alleges that Epicurean and Company did not meet the requirements of the Displaced Workers’ Protection Act, which states that employees of eight months or longer must be offered their jobs under the new contractor for at least a transition period of 90 days. After the 90-day transition period, the new contractor can evaluate the employee’s performance and determine whether to retain them.
However, Gabe Berger (COL ’21) — a student in Georgetown Solidarity Committee, a workers’ rights and social justice advocacy group — said Aramark workers at Bulldog Tavern told GSC they were not offered back their jobs at the establishment after Epicurean and Company took over.
Although Aramark offered employees positions at other Aramark locations, Epicurean and Company did not immediately offer Bulldog Tavern employees the opportunity to continue in their positions, according to GSC members.
“It is good news that every worker who wanted to keep their job has now been be rehired,” Berger said in an interview with The Hoya. “It is still very concerning that there was a long waiting period — when you’re trying to treat people with dignity, you don’t leave them in limbo over how they’re going to bring in enough to put food on the table for weeks.”
The employees were eventually offered their positions at Bulldog Tavern, but by then, many had sought other employment, Armstead said. Last year, Bulldog Tavern had a staff of approximately 20 to 30 employees, Armstead said, but only about 10 wish to return for this academic year.
“We have quite a few who do want to come back and enjoy the standard they were used to, when there was a union shop,” Armstead said about employees who chose to leave Bulldog Tavern under the new contractor.
Epicurean and Company said in a statement that it offered positions to Bulldog Tavern employees after Aramark offered them positions at other campus locations.
“To our understanding, Aramark offered positions within campus to all Bulldog employees in order to avoid displacement,” Epicurean and Company said in a statement to The Hoya. “Epicurean offered employment immediately after receiving the list of employees and before any hiring had taken place.”
Georgetown University spokesperson Matt Hill also said Epicurean and Company took the appropriate steps in its placement process.
“All Aramark hourly employees employed at Bulldog Tavern were offered positions in other Aramark food service locations on campus. Epicurean also offered positions to all hourly employees who worked at Bulldog Tavern and gave them the opportunity to return before moving forward with its hiring process,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Armstead attributes the low employee retention rate to lower wages offered by Epicurean and Company compared to Aramark. Epicurean and Company offers a starting wage at $14 per hour and $3.89 per hour for tipped employees, before benefits, according to Bulldog Tavern Manager Marta Bertolo. These wages exceed the Washington, D.C. minimum wage of $13.25 per hour and $3.33 per hour for tipped employees.
Bertolo said that, with benefits, Bulldog Tavern exceeds Georgetown University’s Just Employment Policy minimum total compensation for university and contractor employees of $16.77 per hour.
“We have and will continue to abide by all laws and regulations of the District of Columbia and Georgetown University’s Just Employment Policy,” Bertolo wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Just Employment Policy applies to both university employees and university contractor employees.
“Georgetown University is committed to ensuring workers are treated fairly under our Just Employment Policy and expects contractors at the university to comply with the Just Employment Policy and the law,” Hill said.
Epicurean and Company echoed Bertolo’s statement, maintaining that it offered Bulldog Tavern employees the same wages and benefits offered to other Epicurean and Company employees, which satisfy the Just Employment Policy.
“We make it one of our main priorities to maintain a safe, respectful, and rewarding environment for our employees and will continue to do so in the future,” Epicurean and Company said in a statement.
Epicurean and Company has faced civil lawsuits before. In 2015, a woman filed a lawsuit against a restaurant janitor and Epicurean and Company for damages related to an incident in which the janitor peered under the woman’s bathroom stall at Epicurean and Company — an action for which he was prosecuted. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2016.
A 2012 lawsuit filed against Epicurean and Company by three former employees alleged that the employer violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and District of Columbia Minimum Wage Revision Act, failing to keep accurate employee timesheets and provide the appropriate overtime rate. A similar lawsuit was settled between Epicurean and Company and four former employees in 2010, a collective action case related to unpaid wages.
“Epicurean has a history of being an abusive employer and the onus is on them and the onus is on the administration to prove they no longer are,” Berger said.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) proposed legislation to ban the possession of 3D-printed plastic guns and other undetectable “ghost guns” Monday.
The Ghost Guns Prohibition Emergency Amendment Act will amend existing legislation to prohibit the registration and possession of ghost guns, or unregistered firearms without serial numbers, in the District. If the act is passed, charges for possession of a ghost gun will be equivalent to those faced for possession of any illegal handgun, a crime punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment.
The act will clarify District legislation on the status of a ghost gun, defining it as an illegal firearm, D.C. Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice Kevin Donahue told The Washington Post.
“The purpose of the legislation is to make it crystal clear that a firearm manufactured in a 3D printer with plastic material is treated with the same rigor as our laws that govern the use and possession of traditional firearms,” Donahue said.
Ghost guns are often homemade and as a result bypass background checks and other regulations that would otherwise carry a record of the weapon. While production and possession of the guns is permitted under current federal law, owners must acquire a license to manufacture the guns for sale or distribution.
On July 31, a federal judge temporarily blocked the dissemination of blueprints providing instructions on how to build guns using a 3D printer after Defense Distributed, a Texas nonprofit organization, planned to publish the schematics online, according to The Washington Post. Despite the court’s actions, blueprints are available for sale to the public and the documents can be directly purchased from the organization in the form of a flash drive.
Although ghost guns are not prohibited under federal law, the law prohibits the manufacturing of firearms that are undetectable by a metal detector used at security checkpoints — a 3D-printed plastic gun containing no metal could be found in violation, according to The Washington Post.
As a result of the advanced capabilities for weapon making created by the advent of 3D printers, the Bowser administration saw a need for D.C. laws to be updated to reflect the changing technology and ensure the safety of D.C. residents, a representative from the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice said in an interview with The Hoya.
Under existing D.C. legislation, ghost guns are not susceptible to seizure by law enforcement officers, unlike illegal handguns, which involve extensive tracking. Since the unregistered firearms cannot be seized, the Metropolitan Police Department does not keep track of the ghost guns they encounter, according to a representative from the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice.
D.C. is one of several jurisdictions nationwide which are debating measures imposing restrictions on self-built plastic guns following the federal ruling in July. Federal legislation that will prohibit the possession of ghost guns is waiting to be heard in Congress, according to The Washington Post.
The introduced amendment is part of the District’s ongoing process to expand restrictive gun laws in response to technological advances, Bowser said.
“From requiring stronger background checks to raising the purchase age, Americans want common-sense gun reform that makes it more difficult — not easier — for guns to fall into the wrong hands,” Bowser said in a Sept. 17 news release. “As technology around the production of undetectable guns advances, our federal government must take action to protect Americans from senseless gun violence.”

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) opened 223 affordable housing units, 50 of which were allocated specifically to grandparents raising grandchildren, in the Mount Vernon Triangle neighborhood Sept. 13.
The housing community, called Plaza West, is located at 1035 4th St. NW and 307 K St. NW. In addition to the residential units, the development features more than 9,500 square feet of “outdoor recreational space,” according to a Sept. 13 news release.
The development also contains a library, a kids’ activity space, a fitness room and a community room.
The new housing units represent the District’s first affordable housing project targeting families in which grandparents are raising grandchildren, which are commonly referred to as “grandfamilies.” D.C. is the ninth city nationwide to create grandfamily-specific housing. The other cities offering such housing are New York City, Boston, Chicago, Phoenix, Ariz., Hartford, Conn., Baton Rouge, La., Milwaukee, Wisc., and Kansas City, Mo.
The number of children being raised by their grandparents has risen nationwide as a result of the opioid and heroin epidemic, according to the American Bar Association.
Plaza West will offer housing to residents from a wide variety of D.C.’s population, according to Bowser.
“As our city continues to grow and age, we’re committed to making investments in innovative programs — in housing, education, childcare, and more — that will set our families up for success,” Bowser said in the Sept. 13 news release. “Plaza West is an example of how we are ensuring residents and families of all backgrounds and income levels have access to safe and affordable places to live across all eight wards.”
The District has over 4,300 grandparents raising children, according to the Plaza West website. One-third of DC grandfamilies are living in poverty. Officials estimate around 1,000 D.C. grandfamilies need subsidized housing.
The 50 grandfamily units will be available to those earning 30 to 40 percent of the Area Median Income — or $22,650 to $30,200 — according to WPGC Radio. In addition to the grandfamily units, 173 units will be allocated for families earning 50 to 60 percent of the Area Median Income, and 11 units will go to clients of the Department of Behavioral Health, according to the Sept. 13 release. The grandfamilies are anticipated to pay 40 percent of market rent for the units.
“The Plaza West design and programming is intended to create a grandfamilies ‘residential village’ that is rich with activities, on-site resources, and connections to the services on-site and in the nearby community,” according to Plaza West development partner Mission First Housing group, a group consisting of six nonprofit organizations that work to build affordable housing.
Some attributes of the housing units have been tailored to focus on grandfamilies, including appropriately sized apartments for intergenerational families, social services case management, child development programs and a grandfamily-rich social group to support the specific challenges of grandfamilies.
The community will also provide services geared towards physical and mental health, academic support, legal aid, financial literacy, access to necessities such as food, furniture and clothing, job training and employment, according to Mission First Housing group.
According to Mission First Housing Group, the development cost $90 million.
Mission First Housing Group collaborated with a number of private and public partners to create Plaza West, including the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development, D.C. Finance Agency, Golden Rule Plaza Inc. — a nonprofit subsidiary of Bible Way Church — and the Henson Development Company.

Seth Owen (SFS ’22) appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Sept. 11 after gaining national attention in July when a fundraiser for his Georgetown tuition after he was kicked out of his house for refusing to attend his parents’ church went viral.
After Owen, who is gay, refused to attend his parents’ church in Jacksonville, Fla., due to the church’s anti-gay messaging. Owen’s biology teacher, Jane Martin, started a GoFundMe fundraiser to raise money for his Georgetown education. The campaign ultimately raised more than $140,000.
Cheerios teamed up with the Ellen Show to give Owen $25,000 to start a scholarship to help other students facing adverse conditions pay their college tuitions.
In an interview with The Hoya, Owen discussed his experience on the show, as well as reflections on adjusting to college life after his story was picked up by multiple news agencies.
How did you get to be on the Ellen Show? 
They picked up my story because it went viral. I’m sitting down one day and I get a call from Burbank, California. And I thought, “Oh, this is odd.” So, I answer the phone, and the guy said, “This is Alex from The Ellen Show.” And I said, “Excuse me, did you just say The Ellen Show as in Ellen DeGeneres?” And he goes, “Yes.” So, I’m like, “Can you give me a moment because I’m in tears.” I just interviewed with him, then I interviewed with the producers. It was wild that we were setting up the date for the show.
What was it like to meet someone that you spent so much time looking up to?
 The most shocking part was that we spent time, a lot of time, hugging when I first walked out. One of the producers warned me. He was like, “Don’t sit there and acknowledge it. Just walk out there straight to Ellen.” Because, while on stage, I am using my time that we could be talking. I was really impressed that she spent so much time giving me a hug that was eating up our stage time. It really, really meant a lot to me. I felt extremely loved and supported when she was giving me that really nice, long hug. They only showed, like, half of it when they aired the show. She gives the best hugs. She smells amazing. Her perfume is, like, perfectly selected. Her eyes are extremely blue. Absolutely gorgeous. It’s very easy to talk to her, too.
What was your reaction when Ellen gave you $25,000 to kick start this scholarship?
I think the video showed that I was extremely shocked. That’s what I’m using to start the scholarship for this year. I’m extremely excited to get that under way. I’m so blown away that she and Cheerios gave that to me to start the scholarship, put their faith in me to start a scholarship so undecided.
What do you mean by “start the scholarship”?
I’m actually in contact with some lawyers in Jacksonville who are starting nonprofits. We are in the process of starting a nonprofit organization to run the scholarship fund for kids in similar situations, but not limited to the LGBTQ+ community. We are looking for people who show a capacity for resiliency and are putting in a lot of hard work, but just need a little extra help to make it to their dream school. Whether that’s a four-year college, a community college, or a career and technical education school.
How did you get the idea to make that fund? 
I wanted to do it when the GoFundMe really started soaring. I wanted to take the extra money and put it towards a scholarship. Some of my mentors were very encouraging to the idea and reminded me of my privilege as a white student that I received. I received extra help that students of color would not have received. I feel that it is my obligation to give back and make it more equitable.
What do you hope people can learn from your experience?
For kids in similar situations, my message — I would have to quote Mrs. Brown in her TED Talk and the power of vulnerability, when she said, “Tell the story of who you are with your whole heart, and that what makes you vulnerable makes you beautiful.” I think that it could potentially help another kid to just be comfortable in who they are and not conform to the pressure around them.
What has it been like for you, transitioning to college, and having your personal experience be broadcasted in such a public way?
It is extremely scary. I didn’t want my story to be out there at all. Before I sat down for my first interview, I told my coach, I said, “Georgetown is not worth this. I am not going to do this. I am not going to put my story out there. I am not going to cause this public shaming to my parents. I’m not doing it.” That was never my intention. However, my coach told me that I had been given a platform that other kids might not have the opportunity to have. It was my responsibility to use that platform to benefit other students.
How do you feel about it now, personally?
I do not regret it. I am extremely glad that I was able to help at least one kid. I’ve had many students reach out to me, saying that they are going through something similar and appreciated my courage in telling my story and that it helped inspire them and helped them through. I’ve even had family members reach out to me and say that they drew strength off of my willingness to share. I think that, however few or however many people benefitted from it, it was worth it.

Wonder how his relationship is with his parents is now.
According to the original article, he was never kicked out and decided to leave because he didn’t like his family’s Christian beliefs.  The real reason seems to be his parents wouldn’t or couldn’t pay for Georgetown.

But Seth’s plans to attend Georgetown University this fall were waylaid by something that has nothing to do with academics: His home life, or what’s left of it.
Seth is essentially homeless. By choice, his father would say. Seth moved out in February after refusing to attend the family’s conservative church, Pecan Park Baptist, on Jacksonville’s Northside.
“I said, ‘I can’t go back to that church.’”
The message from the church had long been personally hurtful, because Seth is gay. But that’s not the only thing that prompted him to stop attending. He recalls sermons about women being inferior to men, or children being required to submit to their parents – no matter what.
“A member asked, ‘What if they’re being abused?’ and [the pastor] said the Bible doesn’t make an exception for abuse. Even then, they are to obey their parents.”
For Seth, the cumulative message was unacceptable. “I cannot sit there in the pew in silence accepting that,” he says.
Leaving the church wasn’t simple. Seth’s entire family is involved – his father’s the deacon, his mother the treasurer, his oldest brother a former pastor.
“My father looked at me and said, ‘Biblically, we have the right to stone you for what you’re saying,” says Seth. “And I knew it was done there.”
Seth’s father, Randy Owen, doesn’t deny making the comment. He merely observes, “I’ve made that comment to every one of my children — that in the Bible, in Biblical days, that a disobedient child, that they would stone him.”
And Randy Owen says he didn’t force his son move out.
“As far as kicking him out because he wouldn’t attend the church we attend — that’s a lie,” the senior Owen said in a phone interview. “I made clear we are not kicking him out, but we worship as a family. He’s allowed to live here as long as he worships the same way we worship.
“He chose to pack his bags and move out.”

The Bowser administration announced its commitment to several new initiatives to combat climate change, including a transition toward zero waste and the development of net-zero carbon buildings, at the 2018 Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco on Sept. 12-14.
Represented at the San Francisco summit by Director of the Department of Energy & Environment Tommy Wells, the Bowser administration reaffirmed Washington, D.C.’s support for sustainability as a signatory of both the C40’s Net Zero Carbon Buildings Declaration and August’s Advancing Towards Zero Waste Declaration.
The 3-day summit brought together leaders, companies and citizens from around the world to celebrate environmental achievements and work to create sustainable solutions to pressing climate issues such as land and ocean stewardship, healthy energy systems and inclusive economic growth.
Bowser pledged to enact regulations ensuring that new buildings operate at net-zero carbon by 2030 and all existing buildings meet the same standards by 2050, joining 18 other cities worldwide with its declaration, according to a Sept. 13 news release.
This commitment to net-zero carbon buildings will play a major role in mitigating the effects of climate change, Chair of the D.C. Chapter of environmental advocacy group The Sierra Club Mark Rodeffer said.
“Because buildings account for about three-fourths of the greenhouse gas emissions from DC, making our buildings more energy efficient and increasing their use of renewable energy is the key to reducing emissions in DC,” Rodeffer wrote in an email to The Hoya.
D.C. also committed to reducing the amount of waste produced by citizens by 15 percent, cut the amount of waste sent to landfills and incineration by 50 percent, and raise the diversion rate to 70 percent by 2030, according to an Aug. 23 news release. In addition, the Bowser administration plans to increase community-led efforts against climate change.
The District continues to seek out initiatives allowing for both economic growth and environmental progress, Bowser said.
“Our progress over the last decade shows that it is possible for a large city to grow and prosper while simultaneously shrinking its carbon footprint,” Bowser said in a Sept. 13 news release. “DC will continue to invest in and support programs and policies that put us on a path to a greener, more sustainable, and more resilient future.”
This announcement follows last month’s release of D.C.’s new energy and climate action plan, Clean Energy D.C., which details the District’s environmental goals, as well as the specific policies and actions it intends to implement in order to promote energy efficiency and a sustainable future.
Clean Energy D.C. is a major component of the larger Sustainable D.C. plan, which outlines actions that the D.C. government plans to carry out in all sectors of society, including governance, the economy, education and the environment, to improve economic growth, equity and opportunity in the District.
The District has long worked to become a leader in the fight against climate change, working to cut its carbon footprint by almost 30 percent since 2006 and implementing progressive green building policy, according to the Sept. 13 news release.
In 2017, after President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, Bowser renewed D.C.’s commitment to the agreement through a Mayor’s Order.
“Our values didn’t change on Election Day. The effects of climate change are already here, and without proper planning and collaboration, they will be catastrophic,” Bowser said in a June 5 news release. “It is in the country’s best interest to take climate change seriously, and as the nation’s capital, we have a special obligation to create policies and implement programs that protect our environment.”

Students are working with Georgetown University administrators to find a long-term location for the Love In”stall”ation, a one-day art installation created October 2017 in the wake of anti-Semitic and misogynistic graffiti found in LXRHall and Village C West in September 2017.
On four separate occasions, swastikas were graffitied on surfaces in several Georgetown residence halls. Swastikas were found twice painted in an LXR bathroom, alongside violent threats against women, as well as in an LXR elevator. An additional swastika was carved into an elevator in Village C West.
In response, Percy Metcalfe (SFS ’19)and Rebecca Kuang (SFS ’18) and Nina Young (SFS ’19) created the Love In“stall”ation to counter the vandalism. The inspiration for the art installation developed from a midterm project the group had during “Media, Arts, and Culture: Fueling War or Creating Peace?,” an upper-level culture and politics course taught by adjunct professor Honey Al-Sayed.
Based off Paintack, a German campaign which sought to transform swastikas throughout Berlin into other illustrations using graffiti, the art piece is a bathroom stall that was on display for one day in Red Square on Oct. 17, 2017. While it was on display, students were encouraged to write positive messages of acceptance on the stall.
The materials for the project were provided by the Office of Residential Living and Georgetown University Student Association. The project’s organizers had expected a bathroom stall that had recently collapsed in the ICC, but instead, Residential Living constructed a new stall specially for the project. The rest of the materials were provided by GUSA.
“Res Living essentially built a bathroom stall for us in Red Square,” Young said. “GUSA supplied the markers and paint and all the different stuff that students used to draw on it.”
The piece has since sat in GUSA’s Leavey Center office, but the creators are now advocating for it to become a permanent installation at the university.
“This piece could only be created through the kind thoughts and intentions of every Georgetown student who advocates against hate speech and anti-Semitism on campus,” Young wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is representative of a collective culture that does not stand for hate on our campus. That is why it deserves a place.”
Young, a main proponent for the project’s permanent installation, said she feels it speaks positively to the character of Georgetown’s student body.
“It’s a great testament to the fact that students at Georgetown, despite being incredibly busy, are super supportive,” Young said.
The 11-month gap between the work’s installation and the renewed push for permanent exhibition stems from Young’s absence from campus last semester while she studied abroad, she said.
The project was relocated to the GUSA office in the Leavey Center during her absence. Upon her return to campus this summer, she began working with Katie Heather, the associate director of residential education, to have it installed permanently on campus.
“We have had a couple of meetings about it, and I’ve reached out to a lot of different people, and it seems like it’s gonna happen,” Young said. “But I don’t know, because right now it’s under review by — apparently, the President’s office has a committee that decides whether or not student artwork can be displayed on campus.”
Where exactly the project would stand is still up in the air. If approved, it will likely end up outdoors, although that plan presents the risk of damage from weather, Young said.
“If we did put it somewhere outside, somewhere where I feel like it would fit in — somewhere like Alumni Square or something like that — I worry that it would be damaged, so I’d probably have to get some wear-and-tear primer for it if we were going to put it outside,” Young said. “But I’d be perfectly willing to do that.”
When the installation appeared in Red Square, it was monitored by students involved in the project who encouraged passersby to write positive notes on the stall, according to Young.
“I think we were out there for eight hours, or something insane,” Young said. “The entire stall ended up getting covered in really nice notes, drawings, messages. We felt like it was a success.”
Although Young was not a member of the group that thought of the idea for the initial class project, she was the strongest voice pushing for the project’s implementation, Metcalfe said.
“Nina — she’s a doer, and literally within an hour of the class ending, she was like, ‘Let’s do this,’” Metcalfe said.
Metcalfe credited Young with the rapid installation of the project in October, which was accomplished just a week after the project was due for Al-Sayed’s class.
“I think [Nina] knows that if you don’t do something really fast with Georgetown bureaucracy, it just never happens,” Metcalfe said. “So she was like, ‘Go, go, go, go!’ And she went, went, went, went.”
