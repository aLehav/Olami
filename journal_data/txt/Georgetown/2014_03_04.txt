To chants of “climate change now,” more than 1,000 people, most of whom were college students, marched from Georgetown University’s Red Square to the White House on Sunday, protesting the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.
Students from more than 100 universities participated in the protest, according to the event’s organizers. Eckerd College, located in St. Petersburg, Fla., sent the most students, at 40, while 10 Georgetown students participated.
The protest march started in Red Square at 10 a.m. and by 3 p.m., over 300 protestors had zip-tied themselves to the White House’s North Lawn fence, while 60 other protesters lay on a mock plastic oil-spill, awaiting arrest by Park Police and the Secret Service. The protestors spent the afternoon demanding the government’s abandonment of the Keystone XL pipeline.
The Keystone XL pipeline, if built, would begin in Canada, running 1,200 miles from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Neb., pumping up to 830,000 barrels of tar-sands oil a day.
The group primarily responsible for organizing the protest, XL Dissent, calls tar-sands oil an “absolute [ecological] disaster” on its website and is opposed to the pipeline and its subsequent transportation of large amounts of oil through American communities for fear of spills and irreparable ecological harm.
The protest, which was nonviolent, started at Georgetown as a symbolic gesture toward President Barack Obama’s speech on climate change, delivered from the steps of Old North in June.
Michael Greenberg, a sophomore at Columbia University and one of the key organizers of XL Dissent, traveled with 20 other Columbia students to D.C. for the weekend.
“These events are crucial … but it is to say that Obama’s rhetoric has been less than truthful and his rhetoric hasn’t matched his actions, and it’s things like this that are so crucial for holding him accountable,” Greenberg told The Hoya.
XL Dissent’s rhetoric runs contrary to a State Department report released in January, claiming that the construction of the pipeline would not significantly alter greenhouse gas emissions and that transporting oil through the pipeline would be a safer and more ecologically sound alternative than moving the oil by rail.
Obama, who has remained mostly mum on the construction of the pipeline, is set to make his decision within the coming months after the State Department concludes its assessment of the proposed pipeline and Secretary of State John Kerry makes his suggestion.
Chris Wager (SFS ’17) of GU Fossil Free saw the XL Dissent protest as a way to get involved with something he felt passionate about after coming to Georgetown from Houston, Texas, a city connected to the oil business through its large port and numerous refineries.
“I’ve always been into environmental movements and climate justice, especially coming from Houston where the oil business is huge and a lot of poorer communities are being affected,” Wager said. “I’ve seen where these people live, and how there’s this huge refinery within a football field of where their kids go out and play.”
Wager, who saw the protest’s starting point — just minutes from where he lives in New South — as a selling point to participating, lamented the seemingly small turnout of Georgetown students. According to Wager, the 10 students who participated are all involved in GU Fossil Free.
“Since it was starting five minutes from where I sleep, it was, for me, a chance I really couldn’t pass up,” Wager said. “I would have liked to see more people from Georgetown, but I’m not sure why there seems to be this ambivalence toward climate issues on the Georgetown campus.”
Caroline James (COL ’16), also a member of GU Fossil Free, echoed Wager’s disappointment with the number of Georgetown students in attendance, highlighting that of the 10 who marched in the protest, only three were arrested — herself included.
“I would have liked to see larger turnout, especially since there were students who came from all over the country in busloads,” James said.
Varshini Prakash, a junior at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a lead organizer for XL Dissent, started the march by addressing the crowd that had assembled in Red Square by megaphone.
“Pollution, violence, starvation — all of these will only be exacerbated if we allow this pipeline to take its course,” Prakash said. “We have an opportunity to fight for the health and the security and the survival of people everywhere. … This is what we’re truly fighting for.”
Prakash said her passion for environmental activism began with her participation in an earlier Keystone XL protest in February 2013 and has since taken off.
“This is the first youth civil disobedience we’ve had focused on students.We are the frontline communities for the future of climate change,” Prakash told The Hoya. “I see this as the beginning of what’s going to be a pretty intense fight for young people and their fight for their future.”
The protest route traveled from the university along O Street, before making its way to Wisconsin Avenue. From there the march traveled along M Street, eventually connecting to Pennsylvania Avenue and arriving at the White House at 11:30 a.m. According to Greenberg, XL Dissent, with the help of D.C. Action Lab, had acquired the proper permits for the protest and had the Metropolitan Police Department block off intersections along the protest route.
Jenna deBoisblanc, a native of New Orleans, La., and a recent college graduate, has co-founded two environmental nonprofits: 350 Nola and 350 Louisiana. After surviving Hurricane Katrina in 2005, deBoisblanc began lobbying for the environment in any way possible.
“I went to any and every climate change protest I could,” deBoisblanc said. “Now, the movement is accelerating.
For the protest, deBoisblanc dressed as Captain Planet from the popular 1990s cartoon of the same name and expressed interest in getting arrested by the end of the day.
“More arrests get attention,” deBoisblanc said. “It empowers people.”
By 6 p.m. deBoisblanc was one of the 371 arrested in front of the White House, while James was number 340.
“A lot of the people whose justice we’re fighting for and who will be affected by this pipeline could not afford to be at the protest today. I felt like what I was doing was the least of what I could possibly do for these people,” James said. “Even though we were tired and cold and wet it was still very empowering.”
Aly Johnson-Kurts of Smith College in Vermont saw being arrested as the only way to provide a clear message to stop the construction of the pipeline.
“We need to escalate it. I’m coming here today because we’ve exhausted the traditional modes of creative change, we’ve written letters and called our legislators. … It’s not enough to get change on infrastructure projects like the Keystone Pipeline,” Johnson-Kurts said. “The tactics have to match the scale of the issue.”
Protesters who were arrested had to pay $50 bail, with some waiting more than six hours before being cut off the fence and processed by the police.
“This was an opportunity to make a statement very peacefully and get the attention of President Obama,” James said. “If everything worked the way it was supposed to with our government this direct action wouldn’t be necessary.”
On Monday, XL Dissent protested in San Francisco with plans to continue until its voice is heard by the administration.
“The question is, whether Keystone gets approved or not, what’s the battle going to be next?” deBoisblanc said.

Toward the end of February, flyers featuring the hashtag #dbkgu began to appear around campus. On Monday, the group responsible for the flyers revealed the phrase’s meaning through the social media advocacy movement Dangerous Black Kids of Georgetown University.
The Facebook page and accompanying Tumblr and Instagram featured photographs of black students on campus alongside their accomplishments and accolades.
For participants, the page creates a forum to present their identity without societal filters.
“I’m 6-foot-2, I was a football player in high school, I’ve always been really big, and I look kind of scary to some people, so the campaign was interesting because that’s been a big part of my life — trying to go past looking like a thug all the time, no matter what I’m wearing,” Itua Uduebo (SFS ’17) said.
Next to Uduebo’s photos — one in a suit and one in jeans, a hat and a hooded jacket — a short bio lists his accomplishments: high school varsity football captain, co-moderator of his high school’s diversity alliance, National Achievement Scholarship semifinalist, AP Scholar with Honors and member of the International Relations Club, Club Rugby, UNICEF and Georgetown Scholarship Program at Georgetown. Similar photos and bios accompany posts for over 100 other students.
Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson (SFS ’14) thought of the campaign after viewing a Huffington Post article that featured a photo of a child hugging his father’s neck with the hashtag #dangerousblackkids. The campaign is meant to demonstrate how society wrongly perceives members of the black community as dangerous, especially in light of killings of black young people such as Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis, who was killed in a dispute over loud music.
“It just dawned on me, that’s how society perceives black people: as being dangerous,” Corbin-Johnson said. “The message I was trying to get across is, whether you are really dressed up, or whether you are casual, and regardless of your accolades, because of laws like Florida’s Stand Your Ground, a lot of society is only going to perceive you as a #dangerousblackkid, when in reality you do so much for society, and you’re not a threat to society at all, but it’s just because of the color of your skin that people have a certain perception about you already.”
The focus on the contributions black students have made to Georgetown emphasized the disconnect between the phrase #dangerousblackkids, which recently trended on Twitter, and reality.
“Mainly it was just to show people the positives and the accomplishments that we’ve made because there’s so many negative stigmas and stereotypes that are forced upon African-Americans,” participant Courtney Maduike (SFS ’17) said. “The entire goal of the movement was to recognize all of the black people that are doing good here at Georgetown and doing good in society — they don’t have to be seen as dangerous or as delinquents, all these negative things they think about us. It’s just to showcase the positives.”
Currently, the Facebook page has more than 600 likes, and many students shared photos of participants in support of their accomplishments.
“I didn’t want to share all my accomplishments onto my page because I didn’t want it to seem like snobby or arrogant, like, ‘Look at all she’s done, she just wants people to brag about her,’ but I realized, it’s not about me,” said Maduike, whose bio lists her experience as her high school’s student body vice president and varsity basketball team captain and her membership in the IRC and Delta Phi Epsilon Sorority at Georgetown, among other accomplishments. “There’s a bigger message behind it, and I don’t know who it might reach and I don’t know who it might affect, but it’s just to, once again, for people to gain awareness for all the successes that we have in the black community, so I just shared it.”
This effort comes on the heels of December’s Being Black at Georgetown University, or #BBGU, Twitter protest, which spawned similar movements in the university’s Latino, Asian and disabled communities.
“It was really overwhelming with all the notifications, people sharing pictures, people liking pictures, so I guess I was surprised by how many people approved of the event,” Celeste Gee (NHS ’14), who helped put participants’ descriptions together, said.
The campaign, which also features portraits of nine non-black allies without accompanying descriptions, received widespread support.
“It brought the black community really close together because everyone was really involved in it, and it also gave people who aren’t black the opportunity to get to meet different people,” Corbin-Johnson said.
The Dangerous Black Kids of Georgetown University page launched at a time that other social media campaigns, such as #itooamharvard, seek to create dialogue about racial issues on college campuses.
“It’s been really awesome because I feel like the photographs in juxtaposition with the information that we provide about each student are very empowering, especially because of all these social media campaigns that are currently being led by various universities,” said Cat Skolnick (COL ’14), an ally who took photographs of the participants. “It’s kind of cool to be part of that greater movement.”
However, Georgetown’s adaption of the theme focused on positive accomplishments of black students, rather than experiences with discrimination or racism, which has been the focus of other movements nationwide and was part of #BBGU.
“This is more about our successes and our accomplishments, which I like,” Maduike said.
Going forward, those involved hope to continue the social media campaign and possibly start events associated with #DBKGU.
“I just want to bring this even more closely to campus, just doing things like maybe taking over Red Square and putting the pictures on the walls, and just have the hashtag there and one sentence just describing what we’re doing, so it’s kind of a satirical campaign. And then hopefully getting other campuses involved like [American University] or Howard [University],” Corbin-Johnson said. “It’s just a campaign to paint black people in a good light.”

While many private universities nationwide are rapidly growing their administrations, Georgetown is bucking the trend with just a 1.5 percent increase in its full-time staff-to-faculty ratio between the years 2003 and 2011.
Among member schools of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education, a group of 33 of Georgetown’s peer institutions, there was an average 9.2 percent increase in this ratio during that period. The University of Notre Dame, which is not a member of the COFHE, is also included in this statistic.
President of the Faculty Senate Wayne Davis, who conducted a study on Georgetown’s administration’s growth, attributes Georgetown’s deviation from the national trend to the university’s priorities.
“All of our administrators have a keen sense of the importance of the academic mission here, and they’re not interested in padding their own budgets and making life good for themselves,” Davis said. “They really want to put every bit of resources we have into making the university better as a university.”
Per the COFHE, U.S. private colleges and universities experienced a 27.9 percent increase in the staff-to-faculty ratio and a 50 percent increase in the staff-to-student ratio, on average, between 1989 and 2009.
Conversely, Georgetown’s staff-to-student ratio saw a 5.2 percent decrease between 2001 and 2011.
“It looks like the university is being run as effectively and as prudently as anyone could hope for,” Davis said.
By limiting the growth of the administration, the university is able to allocate more funds to its academic mission.
“We always try to maximize what we can do with our resources. With a need-blind, meet-full-need admissions policy, we have always striven to keep costs as low as possible,” Vice President for Finance David Rubenstein wrote in an email. “We also rigorously prioritize when it comes to spending decisions so that key academic needs are at the forefront.”
Although Georgetown’s administration is not expanding as rapidly as that of peer universities, aggregate salaries of fulltime staff increased by nearly $100 million between 2001 and 2011, a 76 percent increase. Aggregate full-time and part-time faculty salaries also experienced a significant 67 percent increase during this period, rising by about $70 million. The consumer price index rose by 27 percent during this time.
Additionally, student salaries rose on aggregate by 89 percent during this period, which the university views as a positive trend.
While university salaries grew faster than inflation, the wage rate in Washington, D.C., increased by 45 percent between 2001 and 2011. Since the university tends to recruit staff locally and recruit faculty nationally, the D.C. wage rate has had a greater impact on staff salaries.
“In order to remain competitive with other employers, we need to fund staff salaries so that we compete effectively for recruiting and retaining staff,” Rubenstein said.
The university had a 34 percent increase in student population from 2001 to 2011, influencing staff and faculty salaries.
The university is also committed to cutting costs by utilizing technological advances.
“We try to take advantage of new technologies in an ongoing way,” Rubenstein wrote. “For example, we have been moving key administrative information systems related to human resources, benefits, pay roll and finances to cloud-based services, which means we no longer have to run mainframe computers.”
Despite Davis’ findings about the low rate of administrative growth, many Georgetown faculty members believe that a disproportionate amount of funding is actually directed towards growing the school’s administration.
At an adjunct professor’s panel in February, theology professor Ori Soltes expressed his displeasure with administrative financial influence and discredited the opinion that both administrators and adjuncts are contributing to a lower quality of collegiate education.
“Don’t put the fat that universities endure, made of administrative, overfed individuals … in the same pot with adjunct faculty, that is dedicated, that is underpaid and that, for the most part, provides students with a fine education,” Soltes said.
However, Davis refutes this claim.
“If you go to random faculty on the street, they’re all going to say that one of the big problems here is that we have a huge increase in the number of administrators and that’s where all the money is going. That just isn’t true,” Davis said. “When you look at the aggregate data that actually hasn’t been the case. It’s good news for everybody that the money is being spent well.”

A nationwide survey of 1,400 pre-law students by Kaplan Test Prep found growing support for a two-year law school program, as opposed to the standard three-year curriculum, and increased opportunities for clinical experience in courtrooms.
According to the survey, 58 percent of the students favored the change to a two-year program, and 97 percent favored increased amount of clinical experience in law school.
Georgetown University Pre-Law Society President and Founder Adam Kaldor (COL ’14) discussed the effects of switching to a two-year plan.
“It would cost a lot less obviously, although if they cut it down to two years, they’d probably make the school year longer and bring the cost up for each year. It’d still end up costing significantly less, I’m sure,” Kaldor said.
The change to a two-year program would remove the pressure for many law school graduates to pursue careers with large salaries to pay off student debt.
“Because people would have less student debt, they might be willing to go into the public sector and do more pro bono work or the types of law where you’re helping people and might make a little less money. You might be a little more willing to do it since you’re not $150,000 plus in debt,” Kaldor said.
The idea to switch to a two-year model originated with President Barack Obama’s call for education reform.
“It was during a press conference and [the] president made an off-the-cuff remark and said that he would be in favor of law schools moving to a two-year model to get students out in the workforce sooner and make legal education more affordable for students,” Jeff Thomas, executive director of pre-law programs at Kaplan Test Prep, said.
Thomas discussed the implications of the change to add more clinical opportunities.
“Many schools have opportunities for an externship at their school, and a lot of law schools are offering even more of those by partnering with additional law firms or government agencies to let students practice with real clients,” Thomas said. “The change really comes down to finding more ways for students to get this kind of experience and maybe even mandating that students avail themselves of those particular clinical options.”
Kaldor demonstrated support for providing students with opportunities for clinical experience.
“I think it’s great because it gives you more hands-on experience. Clinics give you practice and prepare you for a job better,” Kaldor said.
However, any change to the law school curriculum cannot originate within law schools themselves because the curriculum is set by the American Bar Association.
“[A change] is not allowed because the American Bar Association has to mandate the regulation. The Bar Association will have to make a sweeping reform to what they mandate schools to do,” Thomas said.
However, Kaldor has doubts about the likelihood of such a large curriculum change.
“I think it [a switch to a two-year program] would be pretty hard to implement. A lot of schools are pretty set on their three-year program,” Kaldor said.
“The process for changing legal education is a fairly involved one. The American Bar Association has oversight given by the Department of Education to regulate what happens in law schools,” Thomas agreed.
The third year of law school has a much more open curriculum than the first two years — much of which would likely be cut if the change were made.
“In the first two years they tend to work you very hard, and the third year is generally pretty easy, although that’s also the year that people are doing clinics and law reviews, so the third year is a little bit up in the air and I could see why people may want to cut it out,” Kaldor said.
According to Kaplan, 319 Georgetown seniors applied to law school in their most recently recorded year. Kaldor favors law schools offering the option of a two-year program but not across-the-board change for all law schools.
Law students currently have the opportunity to graduate in two years by way of an accelerated program in which summer sessions are incorporated. However, they must take the same number of credits as the three-year program requires.
Maggie Cleary (COL ’14), who will attend the University of Virginia School of Law in the fall, weighed in on the prospect of a two-year program.
“A two year program may seem advantageous because you save a lot of money and you’ll go on to get a good job and get out of debt faster,” she said. “I’m 22, so one year’s difference isn’t that important for me, but I do see law school as more of a trade school, what with all of the intense studying and classroom time learning hard facts and approaches. That lends itself more to a two-year experience I think.”
However, Glenda Dieuveille (COL ’14), who plans to enroll at the Georgetown University Law Center in the fall, preferred the status quo.
“I’m not interested in a two-year program because it’s less time to make internship connections, to engage in networking. I just feel like it might be harder to find a job once out of school, especially considering the high supply of law school students,” Dieuveille said. “Also, I don’t like thinking of law school as a two-year trade school because law is more than a trade to me, it’s a way to become a better person and positively change my environment.”

This year Georgetown has joined the ranks of 14 other American universities after officially partnering with the Pat Tillman Foundation in order to offer select student veterans a scholarship as part of the Tillman Military Scholarship Program.
“The goal [of the program] is to help our current generation of military veterans excel in their efforts to become leaders and serve our communities and our nation,” Georgetown Veterans Office Coordinator David Shearman said.
Tillman was a NFL safety for the Arizona Cardinals, before enlisting with the United States Army Rangers in 2002, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He served two tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan before dying by friendly fire on his second deployment to Afghanistan. Tillman was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action.
Established soon after his death in 2004, the Pat Tillman Foundation has played a major role in investing in military veterans and their spouses through supporting their education.
“If you think about it, the goals the Pat Tillman Foundation has for its TMS program—academic excellence, character, leadership and service to the nation and the community — go hand in hand with Georgetown’s Jesuit values,” Shearman said. “So it makes sense that Georgetown and the Tillman Foundation would want to support each other in those goals.”
Georgetown’s partnership with the Pat Tillman Foundation reflects an increasing trend of veterans becoming more interested in pursuing their academic goals at the highest level.
“Veterans have been traditionally underrepresented at the nation’s top undergraduate private schools, but that is beginning to change,” Georgetown University Student Veterans Association President Zach Zimmerman (MSB ’14) said. “Veterans are becoming more interested in schools they previously thought were unattainable to them, which is probably why Georgetown is trying to make the financial process more accommodating to this new demographic of applicant.”
The Pat Tillman Foundation has provided a total of $4.6 million to 290 military students from 85 different universities. The foundation hopes to help potential leaders cultivate their skills and intellect with this financial aid.
“The Tillman partnership can help veterans take advantage of increased opportunities without the possibility of accruing upwards of $100,000 in debt,” Zimmerman, who served in the Marine Corps from 2006 to 2010 in Iraq and Afghanistan, said.
Beyond the financial aspect, the scholars program provides diverse summits, workshops and community service activities that instill a spirit of leadership and service in participants.
“This scholarship is not just about the money,” Shearman said. “It’s about investing in a diverse group of leaders who are committed to serving others.”
Each year, 60 students are selected as Tillman Military Scholars from the thousands that apply. Georgetown anticipates a significant number of veteran students will apply.
“The response I’ve received so far indicates that we will have a very strong applicant pool of Georgetown students this year,” Shearman said.
University individuals have applied for the scholarship since it opened in 2009, but this year marks the formalization of the university’s relationship with the foundation. Six Georgetown students have been designated TMS scholars in the past. Among the requirements for university partners is that the institution must have an active veteran student organization, support services designed for veterans and provide counseling, psychological and disability services.
In 2012, David Dixon (GRD ’15), Alex Brown (MBA ’13) and Brandon Stone (LAW ’15) received Tillman scholarships for Georgetown studies, while alumni Dan Feehan (SFS ’05), Peter Koziol (GRD ’06) and Kathleen Merkl (SFS ’05) won scholarships to fund degrees at other institutions. Dixon felt his graduate education would be beneficial to his work in the Marine Corps.
“Although service members swear on their lives to defend the Constitution, many don’t know the fundamentals of our representative republic,” Dixon, a doctoral candidate in political science, said in a Georgetown press release.
This partnership strengthens Georgetown’s efforts to help veteran students achieve their academic goals and learn leadership skills in a civilian setting.
“This partnership with the Tillman Military Scholars program is a good indicator that Georgetown has made significant progress in providing support to veteran and military students in the last several years,” Shearman said.
Georgetown also has plans to create a Veterans Resource Center on campus, which will provide more staff and resources to assist veterans.
“The university’s administration has been an incredible partner for GUSVA and has been receptive all of our veteran initiatives,” Zimmerman said. “This partnership is Georgetown not only saying ‘we accept veterans’ but ‘we want veterans.’”

United Feminists are in the midst of an annual Sex-Positive Week at Georgetown University, which runs from Feb. 26 to March 5.
The week is dedicated to conversations and events about sex-positive feminism, where students are free to express their sexual selves and learn about others’ expressions of sexuality.
Established in 2009, Sex-Positive Week has been an annual event for the United Feminists, and initially drew ire from groups such as the Knights of Columbus. Despite past controversy, United Feminists has retained its Student Activities Commission funding.
“We are trying to make it seem like that’s the norm. We feel like our presence is needed and we will work harder with the administrators to keep our spot here on campus. … We’re not going anywhere,” United Feminists Co-chair Sofia Ladner (NHS ’16) said.
This year’s coordinators worked to make their presence felt through several events and advertising.
“With Sex-Positive Week we definitely are just trying to make an open dialogue about consent. We know that that’s really difficult here on campus with a Catholic identity,” United Feminists Co-chair Kimberly Blair (COL ’15) said. “We are not promoting sex; we are promoting expression, consent and dialogue.”
The theme of sex positivity also allows the week to address other issues that might be avoided on campus.
“What sex positivity talks about is some of the things we shy away from [like] talking about sex workers and workers’ rights, talking about transgender and sexuality … just a matter of talking about it and getting more knowledge,” Ladner said.
The week began with a social media campaign that included hashtags like #HoyaSexa, #SexPositiveWeek and #SexPositive. The hashtag campaign occurred on both Facebook and Twitter but did not receive the response United Feminists expected.
“It was not the full-fledged response that we wanted. Right now, it’s a big campaign week, so we were competing with a lot of other hashtags,” Blair said. “A lot of people are still afraid to address sex positivity.”
United Feminists also led a trip Saturday to Jordin’s Paradise, a studio that offers a pole fitness class. Around 20 students participated in the class, which was followed by a discussion on exhibitionism and a performance from the instructor at the end.
The week also features a movie showing of “Our Bodies, Our Minds” on Tuesday night followed by a discussion with Kathleen Guidroz, a professor in the sociology department. The movie focuses on feminists who work in the adult entertainment industry, ranging from prostitutes to exotic dancers. The narratives from the women in the movie serve to demonstrate the unusual perspective of these women and their emphasis on freedom of expression.
“One thing we need to keep in mind is that people’s experiences in the sex industry are never entirely negative nor are they entirely positive,” Guidroz said. “[The industry] is not something that should be seen as shameful or inherently wrong.”
The United Feminists and Guidroz hope that the discussion will give students a more educated look at the sex industry and just encourage conversation around the topic.
“I hope people come out and watch the film and listen to what the individuals in the film have to say about their experiences. … [Sex positivity] is more than college students talking about college students’ sexuality, but [is] also a larger social issue with people like sex workers,” Guidroz said.
The final event of Sex-Positive Week is GSPOT-light, an open-mike night at Uncommon Grounds on Wednesday evening. The night is dedicated to conversation about self-expression and sexuality.
“We just want it to be known that if you come to this spot, you can just have self-expression. You can perform a Beyoncé song, your own poem or just say the word ‘sex.’ We just want to make people feel liberated and positive about the issue,” Ladner said.
Some students felt that although the week brings important topics to light, discussion should not be restricted to a particular timeframe.
“I think it’s a great idea, I think that generally feminism is not something that leaves an English classroom discussion, and it’s good that it’s being talked about … in terms of social light,” Eliza McCurdy (COL ’17) said. “But obviously, the classic complaint about that is it’s something that shouldn’t be restricted to a certain week or to a certain amount of time, it should be something that eventually becomes regular and normal.”
Multiple members of the Knights of Columbus declined to comment for this article.

Georgetown University sponsored a panel of ambassadors from Mexico, the Philippines and El Salvador to discuss immigration reform for the 20th Annual McCourt School Policy Conference at the U.S. Capitol this past Friday.
Although the McCourt School of Public Policy was endowed this year, it continues the conference series of its predecessor, the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, albeit with a different name.
Each year, millions of immigrants move to the United States in search of job opportunities, a higher standard of living and advanced education. Many have left Mexico for Texas, the Philippines for Hawaii and California, and El Salvador for other parts of the United States. As a result, immigration reform has become a key political debate in U.S. politics.
The ambassadors discussed how U.S. policy affects their countries, touching on social and economic effects, both positive and negative.
Neil Ruiz, whose career at the Brookings Institution focuses on international migration, served as the moderator for the event. In his introduction to the panel, he mentioned both the reasons that drive migrants from their countries of origin and those that pull them to the United States.
“Policy choices in the [United States] really focus on the inside, but we haven’t really looked at U.S. immigrants basically facilitating exchanges between two countries. … U.S. immigrants are economic ambassadors that contribute to two economies simultaneously. Immigrants contribute to the U.S. economy by providing highly skilled or highly labor-intensive work,” Ruiz said.
Although the immigration system is highly regulated with caps on visa and green card distributions, an increasing amount of immigrants are choosing to enter the United States illegally, causing the topic to become a heated point of contention. Per the Salvadorian ambassador, thousands of illegal immigrants live in fear of being sought out by officials and sent back to their native countries that are often immersed in economic hardship.
Many of these immigrants come from Latin American nations. Each of the three ambassadors at the conference about his respective nation and its government’s attitude toward immigration in the United States.
“This is a U.S. domestic issue, and we understand that, but we have, of course, a responsibility [to] our Mexican nationals,” Ambassador Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza of Mexico said. Mexico is aware of the border patrol issues, which was a query brought up by a Georgetown student in the conference’s question-and-answer segment. Icaza seemed confident, drawing upon statistics that showed a decrease in illegal immigrations over the Mexico-southern United States border.
“In 2012, this number came down. … In the 2013 fiscal year … Mexicans [migrating] were stable,” Icaza said.
Icaza maintained the changes will shape American society in years to come.
“The [United States] will grow more than Mexico demographically. … The U.S. population will grow 46 percent. … Latinos or Hispanics will grow 163 percent. … This will be a totally new shape of U.S. society, which is [actually] already here,” he said.
Although many Americans see the negative consequences of immigration domestically, the speakers cited consequences faced by the country of origin, with the loss of professional and skilled workers.
“Migration has its negative impacts on the Philippine social fabric,” Ambassador Jose Lampe Cuisia Jr. of the Philippines said.
Ambassadors also pointed out that immigration changes citizens who return to their native countries.
“When you see people going back to Mexico from the [United States] … the way they engage with the community is totally different. … They actually teach us [Mexicans] a lot, and are better citizens, and help their communities to do better in the sense that they were already doing that when they were here [in the United States],” Icaza said.
The speeches delivered by the ambassadors attempted to demonstrate the complexity of immigration from the nation of origin’s standpoint. “No matter if you are pro or against immigration, the [U.S. immigration] system needs to have reforms,” Ambassador Rubén Zamora of El Salvador said.

Associate professor of theology Terrence Reynolds discussed the ambiguity of moral certainty in a world of diverse perceptions for the 40th anniversary lecture of the Liberal Studies Program in the Faculty Club on Friday evening.
Reynolds highlighted the difference in conclusions reached by profound thinkers, such as Aristotle, Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill, who used reason to try to search for morality.
“With these three thinkers relying on reason alone, you end up with three very, very different ethical theories. So if you were to say, lets find the common ground in reason, the three finest thinkers of whom I’m aware wind up in different places,” Reynolds said.
Reynolds said that religion, used as the basis for searching for morality, cannot unravel these differences.
“You could say instead, let’s not rely upon reason alone, let’s go into the source of real certainty and rely upon a god of some kind to get us to moral certainty. Of course, the problem with that would be on which god you want to rely,” Reynolds said.
He also spoke about the problem of relying on your conscience in order to make moral decisions because your conscience may not be reliable. He told a story of a childhood friend named Fred who would steal cars but rationalize it by saying that he “borrowed cars.” Later on in life, Fred’s conscience changed and he once again thought it was wrong.
“For a long time, Fred’s conscience thought that borrowing cars was wrong. He went through some discomfort changing that position. Once he moved to borrowing cars, his conscience rationalized, justified, he wasn’t really stealing cars he was borrowing, and it was not a big deal and he felt comfortable,” Reynolds said.
This malleability led Reynolds to question its reliability.
“So when you and I realize our conscience is the final judge, the final arbiter in what you and I will do in life, the question you ask is really how reliable is it? Can you really trust your conscience?” Reynolds said.
Reynolds claims these differing conceptual schemes have moral implications.
“So now we say, the moral life then becomes much more complicated because in a sense, when we realize that there are people who see the world in ways I don’t see them because they don’t interpret the world the way I interpret it,” Reynolds said. “In the midst of all that, if you and I have different theoretical bases for ethics, we have different practical responses to questions, if we have different conceptual schemes, how in the world can we talk about moral certainty?”
His solution to this uncertainty is to approach truth by experiencing and embracing the diversity of concepts and views of different people.
“I could take into my own understanding concepts more like the ones I’m listening to. I can take in new ideas,” Reynolds said. “I don’t want to say that you therefore find the moral truth, but I want to say you approximate more and more in that way something resembling authenticity. You’re not just a product of someone else’s thinking.”
Attendee Warren Wilson (SFS ’15) agreed with Reynolds’ critique of the idea that morality and ethics are clear-cut and final.
“I think professor Reynolds was right to criticize the very naive perceptions that things are simple,” Wilson said.
Wilson additionally questioned the political implications of this moral ambiguity.
“If we are all so very different, how do you make policy decisions and how do you adjudicate because we are not all pulled in one direction?” Wilson said.
Another attendee, Agree Ahmed (SFS ’15), enjoyed Reynolds’ discussion on conscience because he has not had the chance to discuss this subject in his classes.
“You are exposed to a lot of discussion centered around reason, but it hasn’t been, at least in my academic experience, brought back to the conscience and the fact that there is like that kind of inner dialogue and you think about your actions through that rather than through reason or like logic,” Ahmed said.

The School of Nursing and Health Studies Academic Council held a gala in Copley Formal Lounge to benefit Saint Aloysius Gonzaga Secondary School in Nairobi, Kenya, on Feb. 22.
Founded in 2003 by Fr. Terry Charlton, S.J., St. Al’s supports children affected by HIV and AIDS.
“Over the years, fellow Jesuits, faculty and staff from Georgetown have gotten to know Fr. Terry and have had the opportunity to visit the school and bring back to our campus information about the good work that is being done in Nairobi,” NHS Associate Dean for Enrollment Management Marianne Lyons said.
All of the children had lost at least one parent to the disease and are in situations of financial instability as a result, according to NHS Academic Council co-Chair Antonia Kopp (NHS ’14).
In addition to bestowing full tuition scholarships on many, St. Al’s provides all students with meals, uniforms and books. The annual cost to send a student to St. Al’s is $1,200. In the past several years, the school has grown significantly, from 56 students to a current figure of nearly 270 students. The school has the capacity to instruct over 400 students.
Georgetown programs, often affiliated with the Medical Center, have attempted to ameliorate the AIDS crisis, abroad and in the District. The university also played host to The Global Fund’s conference on medical epidemics, including HIV/AIDS, in December, amid President Barack Obama’s commitment of up to $5 billion of U.S. funds to AIDS relief.
“After the four years there [in Kenya], a lot of the students go on to go to college here [in the U.S.], but they are expected to come back in the long run and settle in Kenya. They also have to do a period of service in the community,” said Kopp.
In January, the NHS Academic Council partnered with the Georgetown AIDS Coalition to host the Unity Live event, featuring various on-campus performing groups. The concert was able to collect more than $2,200 from ticket sales, enough to fund tuition for two students at St. Al’s.
The council’s goal was to raise enough money, through its various events, to send eight students to St. Al’s. The second annual gala, which attracted close to 200 students, raised nearly $8,000 in ticket sales, nearly reaching the desired amount of $10,000.
“Both this year and last year we had a past student from St. Al’s come and speak. This year we had someone from Milwaukee who is a past graduate and is working as a nurse now,” NHS Academic Council co-Chair Jamie Schlarbaum (NHS ’15) said.
Both Kopp and Schlarbaum discussed how they were excited that so many students outside of the NHS came to the event this year.
“We are trying to make this a campus-wide effort, and we want everyone to feel included,” Schlarbaum said.
In the coming months, there are plans to host another donor event to try to raise more money for the school. Donations will go directly toward the funding of scholarships, uniforms and food.
“Our connection with St. Al’s directly reflects our school’s values of excellence, respect and diversity, social justice and value of the common good,” Lyons said.

A petition from the D.C. Justice for Survivors Campaign circulating throughout the District in support of the passage of the Sexual Assault Victims’ Rights Amendment Act of 2013 is making waves among student activists on Georgetown’s campus.
Originally proposed in June 2013 by D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson and Councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), SAVRAA would provide more oversight of MPD in sexual assault cases via the Office of Police Complaints, ensure that sexual assault survivors have an advocate present on their behalf at medical examinations and interviews with law enforcement and that communications between the two parties are confidential, require the Metropolitan Police Department to process rape kits more quickly and specify that sexual assault survivors are not to be charged for rape kits. The bill is scheduled to come before the D.C. Council in spring 2014.
The introduction of SAVRAA partially stemmed from a January 2013 Human Rights Watch report that alleged that the Metropolitan Police Department had been mishandling and incorrectly documenting sexual assault cases in D.C.
According to the 196-page report, titled “Capitol Offense: Police Mishandling on Sexual Assault Cases in the District of Columbia,” MPD had been misclassifying sexual assault cases as lesser offenses and failing to properly investigate the cases, leaving the prosecution no choice but to throw the cases out.
MPD, however, objects to some of the Human Rights Watch report’s allegations and subsequent conclusions drawn from it.
“A lot of what they said in their report was inaccurate,” MPD Commander George Kucik said of the report.
DCJSC has proposed three amendments to SAVRAA: the elimination of a current exception to the victim’s right to have an advocate present for cases where the advocate would be detrimental to the purpose of the exam or interview, the requirement of regular case review by a Sexual Assault Response Team or an expert and the establishment of an external consult to aid MPD with sexual assault investigations.
With nearly half of its members sexual assault survivors themselves, DCJSC wrote these amendments based on the experiences of sexual assault survivors as well as sexual assault experts who work in the legal system. The advocacy group includes members of the D.C. chapter of the National Organization for Women, the D.C. Rape Crisis Center and Collective Action for Safe Spaces.
“This is really a chance for survivors to have their voices heard in the process, which isn’t something that happens often,” CASS Communications Director Renee Davidson said.
Kucik stressed MPD’s commitment to creating a safe space for sexual assault victims to work within the system.
“The department is willing and trying to change what we need to change to make our investigations better and to ensure that victims are treated properly during our investigative process,” Kucik said.
Susan Mottet, president of the D.C. chapter of the National Organization for Women, expressed skepticism that the MPD is engaging in thorough case review and appropriately investigating cases.
“The point is the cases are not being all documented appropriately and investigated appropriately, and until that happens, we have rapists running around loose on our streets with impunity and no one is safe,” Mottet said.
Kucik, however, said that MPD has made improvements in regard to how the department handles sexual assault cases.
“Upping our training is one big thing, and then we’ve also looked at our personnel, members we believe probably not a best fit for a sexual assault unit. We are putting them elsewhere and replacing people with other detectives that we think are a better fit for a sexual assault unit,” Kucik said.
Kusik responded to DCJSC’s three amendments, taking issue with the rigidity of the amendment that would allow no exceptions to the victim’s right to an advocate.
“We’re not married to the language that’s in there right now about the exception. We just want to still have some flexibility for those — we just can’t always predict what’ll happen,” Kucik said. “If somehow an advocate began to interfere with an interview or something, we would just want to have something where we’d have something in place to deal with it.”
Mottet stood by the amendment’s necessity.
“A trained advocate wouldn’t create any problems with the process or the bill,” Mottet said.
According to Kucik, while MPD is in full support of the case review requirement delineated in the petition, the department is still in the process of figuring out how to approach it more efficiently.
“At the end of the day, we agreed for the review, to do the review. We’re totally on board with that,” Kucik said.
Sexual Assault Peer Educator and president of College Democrats Chandini Jha (COL ’16) created a simplified version of DCJSC’s petition on Change.org to circulate around Georgetown to raise awareness of SAVRAA among college students.
“For now, I think that both of our petitions have kind of the same overarching goal of getting SAVRAA passed. I created this student petition because I wanted to really get students informed on the issue and get signatures in a way that’s more efficient than I think what the DC Survivor’s petition is,” Jha said.
Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14), who advocated for the passage of the Violence Against Women Act last year, approached Women in Politics Co-President Kayla Corcoran (COL ’15) on behalf of College Democrats for help in distributing the petition.
“The mission of WiP is to advocate and empower women in and outside of the political sphere both on campus and off campus. WiP felt that passing along the petition urging the D.C. Council to pass SAVRAA was not only well within the bounds of our goals for the organization, but it was also necessary,” Corcoran wrote in an email.
Jha’s petition has reached 236 signatures, and it will continue to be circulated until early April.
“I think this will actually make a pretty big impact, and I think it’s been pretty successful just because in a smaller locality like D.C., city council members pay a lot more attention when they get petitions with several hundred signatures or over a thousand signatures because it isn’t common to see petitions of that magnitude,” Peterson said.
Women’s Center Director Laura Kovach also voiced her support for SAVRAA.
“Statistically, we know that women aged 16 to 24 experience sexual assault at rates higher than any other population based on age. We have a large number of college campuses in the District, and there needs to be a commitment to services, resources and justice for survivors, and SAVRAA is a step in the right direction for everyone, including our college students,” Kovach wrote in an email.
Davidson expressed optimism about DCJSC’s relationship with MPD moving forward.
“There have been promising signs. We think that they have an understanding that the community really, really is expressing a need for this, so I am hopeful, and I am hopeful that they will pull through in this, but we will see when the bill gets marked up … and that’s when we’ll know for sure where folks stand on the issue,” Davidson said.

NATASHA THOMSON/THE HOYADPS officers Roy Eddy, left, and Victor Johnson monitor activity on campus in the department’s Village C West office.Since the consolidation of positions within the department and the hiring of Jay Gruber as chief of police in July 2012, the Georgetown University Police Department — known colloquially as the Department of Public Safety — has changed in students’ eyes from mainly a “party crasher” to a valuable source of support for student safety.
In the year and a half since these changes took effect, GUPD has increased its presence on campus and in the Georgetown neighborhood while at the same time a notable drop in on-campus alcohol violations has been seen.
Under Gruber’s leadership, DPS changed its name to GUPD in spring 2013, symbolizing its increased emphasis on its role as a police force.
“DPS encompasses several meanings including values related to management and environmental safety,” Gruber said. “We wanted to focus on our core mission as community police officers in providing safety and security as a police department.”
Since Gruber’s tenure as chief began, the department has seen a marked reduction in non-arrest alcohol violations, from 444 violations recorded in 2010 under the leadership of former Chief of Police Rocco DelMonaco to 211 violations in 2012.
The decrease in alcohol violations is part of the university’s recent efforts to curb off-campus social life through the elimination of the single keg limit for on-campus parties and the institution of a policy allowing of-age students to consume alcohol in the outdoor areas of Village A and Henle Village.
As alcohol violations decrease, burglary rates have been on the rise, with burglary reports increasing from only 20 reports in 2007 to 27 reports in 2009 and 55 reports in 2012. According to Gruber, however, reports have recently declined, which he attributes to GUPD’s efforts to inform students and parents about the importance of locking doors.
“I know that recently our burglary numbers have gone down quite a bit because of the multifaceted approach that we’ve taken to reduce the number of burglaries,” he said.
Gruber feels that GUPD’s perception among Georgetown students has changed for the better.
When Gruber was hired, the department eliminated the position of Vice President for Safety, which had overseen public safety, environmental health and safety and emergency management, in favor of more direct relationships between the department and university leadership.
“I think that was to reduce a layer of accountability, reduce a layer of communication, I think the university thought there was too many layers between the key players and university leadership,” Gruber said. “I’m very comfortable with the way it is now. I like having direct rapport among the university’s leadership.”
Environmental health and safety and emergency management were placed under the authority of Chief Operating Officer Chris Augostini, and Gruber’s position was placed directly under Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson.
“[Gruber] has been responsive and engaged with students through the Student Safety Advisory Board and regular meetings with GUSA leadership. He has done an outstanding job balancing the concerns of students and our neighbors as the co-chair of the Georgetown Community Partnership Committee on Safety and Student Life,” Smulson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“We’ve had very little negative interaction with students and student leadership. There was a perception that we are ‘party breakers’ in the past, but I think the perception has changed in the past 18 months,” Gruber said.
Gruber also identified neighborhood relations as an area he sought to improve.
“We’ve established a far better relationship with the neighbors over the past year as there’s been improved and more coherent communication to us from them. They use the university help line to get information across officers and neighbors very quickly, which prompts a much faster response. I think this helped a lot,” Gruber said.
ANC Neighborhood Commissioner Craig Cassey (COL ’15) testified to the progressive relationship between the Georgetown neighborhood and GUPD.
“Regarding how DPS is viewed by the community, most neighbors recognize them for what they are — extra feet on the ground ensuring students and other community members are safe. The work DPS does benefits all, and the community at large seems to appreciate that,” Cassey wrote in an email.
Irene Kim (SFS ’14) remembered disliking DPS as a freshman, but said that as an off-campus resident she has cultivated an appreciation for their work.
“I think the student-DPS relationship has become one of mutual tolerance over the past four years. As an underage freshman, I used to resent them for crashing parties, but I admit it’s reassuring to have them watching over us now that I’m living off-campus,” Kim said.
Gruber credited improved community and student engagement to initiatives such as bi-semester student roundtables in partnership with GUSA. The police chief has already participated in two forums during the 2013-14 school year and is expected to take part in the third installation of the forum, to be held March 5 in Sellinger Lounge.
“Some of the changes that have come after I’ve been here, I’m just working to better community relationships, community partnerships… there’s crime, but make the university feel like a more inviting place for students to live and students to learn. I want students to be on campus and feel comfortable,” Gruber said.
According to GUSA Undersecretary of Student Safety and Health Guillaume Cossard (COL ’14), Gruber’s participation in on-campus activities, such as the dunk tank on Georgetown Day 2013 and the creation of a dorm-liaison program to partner GUPD officers with designated dorms, speak to Gruber’s perception as an interactive chief.
“Gruber’s very, very receptive of student voice and student reporting, and he’s absolutely working for us, in my opinion, more so than the administration. He values really highly what the students have to say, and he’s trying to be less of an enforcer,” Cossard said.
Michael Ng (COL ’15) said that he has noticed an improvement in GUPD interactions with students recently.
“Their Code of Conduct and the way they approach students has improved. When I was a freshman, they didn’t seem to conduct themselves as professionally as I hoped they did. They lost their patience a lot, but now that’s changed,” Ng said.
Not every student, however, has seen Gruber’s influence across all levels of the department. Micaela Deitch (COL ’15) recounted an uncomfortable experience she had with a GUPD officer recently.
“A DPS officer was giving me a ride once, and there were a lot of students out in the street drinking, and he was making a lot of disparaging remarks, and I think he like called one a moron, and even though he wasn’t mean towards me, he was very – I didn’t like his attitude towards students,” Deitch said.

Georgetown University Law Center recently announced the establishment of the Honorable George J. Mitchell, L’61 Professorship in Law and Public Policy. The professorship was created to commemorate Mitchell’s time at Georgetown, as well as his subsequent career in public service as a Democratic senator from Maine.
Professor of constitutional law David Cole was selected to serve as the inaugural professor.
“It’s a huge honor to be selected for this chair,” Cole said. “Sen. Mitchell is one of Georgetown’s superstars, a national hero and perhaps the most important international peacemaker of our time.”
The professorship will honor the work of Sen. Mitchell (D-M.E.), one of the nation’s most respected public servants. Mitchell spent 15 years as U.S. Senator from Maine, acting as the Senate Majority Leader from 1989 until his departure in 1995. Some of his efforts include the 1990 reauthorization of the Clean Air Act, the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the creation of a low-income housing tax credit program.
The professorship will be endowed through the donations of J. Clifford Hudson (LAW ’80), CEO of Sonic Corp., and Lee Miller (LAW ’73), global co-chairman of DLA Piper.
Miller emphasized his support for the professorship in light of Sen. Mitchell’s distinguished legacy.
“Sen. Mitchell has worked tirelessly to advance the cause of human rights and to seek creative solutions to global issues,” Miller said in a press release. “His lifelong work reflects Georgetown Law’s values and underlying principles of commitment to public service and active engagement in the global community.”
After his time in the Senate, Mitchell went on to serve as a special advisor to President Clinton, ultimately brokering the Good Friday Agreement between Ireland, the United Kingdom and the political parties in Northern Ireland. Mitchell currently serves as partner and chairman emeritus at DLA Piper.
“It’s more than a bit daunting to assume a chair associated with such an accomplished and respected man. I only hope I can live up to its name,” Cole said.
Law School Dean William M. Treanor voiced his support for Cole’s selection.
“David is a superb choice to fill this professorship. We are all proud to have David as our colleague,” Treanor said in a press release.
Cole has taught at Georgetown Law since 1990 as a professor of constitutional law, national security and criminal justice. Known for his commitment to public justice and his advocacy for civil liberties, Cole has briefed or argued in seven Supreme Court cases. Additionally, he does pro bono litigation and regularly writes for The New York Review of Books and The Nation.
Cole said that he recognizes the opportunity this professorship presents and hopes to use it to further Georgetown’s hallmark values of social justice.
“I will continue to teach, write and advocate for justice for the most vulnerable,” Cole said. “I am deeply grateful to Georgetown for its Jesuit-based commitment to justice.”
Originally scheduled for Mar. 3, Cole’s inaugural address has been postponed until further notice due to inclement weather.
