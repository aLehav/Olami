Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D-At Large) introduced separate legislation that would legalize recreational cannabis use for adults in the District
Bowser announced her bill, The Safe Cannabis Sales Act of 2021, on Feb. 26, while Mendelson proposed his Comprehensive Cannabis Legalization and Regulation Act of 2021 on March 1. If either piece of legislation is passed by the end of the year, the first legal sale of recreational cannabis could occur as early as October 2022. 
Both bills would legalize adult-use cannabis, provide for the automatic expungement of records with certain cannabis convictions and allocate tax revenues from cannabis product sales toward different causes in the District. 
Mendelson was not aware of Bowser’s bill nor its anticipated release date, according to Lindsey Walton, director of communications at Mendelson’s office.
“The Chairman used inspiration from California, Massachusetts, Illinois, and several other states that have legalized the use of recreational cannabis,” Walton wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Co-signers of Mendelson’s legislation include Councilmembers Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5), Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Brooke Pinto (D-Ward 2), Christina Henderson (I-At Large) and Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3). 
Mendelson’s bill would impose a 13% tax on recreational cannabis sales. The bill also includes plans to automatically expunge cannabis-related arrests and convictions and to launch a public education campaign surrounding cannabis usage. 
Bowser’s Safe Cannabis Sales Act of 2021 includes a 17% tax on adult-use cannabis and cannabis products. If passed, the bill would also require certain cannabis convictions to be automatically expunged.
The Safe Cannabis Sales Act of 2021 is centered around safety, equality and justice, according to Bowser.
“Through this legislation, we can fulfill the will of D.C. voters, reduce barriers for entering the cannabis industry, and invest in programs that serve residents and neighborhoods hardest hit by the criminalization of marijuana,” Bowser said in a Feb. 26 press release.
Within the first fiscal years, recreational cannabis sales are projected to incur hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue, which would be redirected back to the D.C. community under the provisions of both bills. Bowser expects to allocate over $5 million in tax revenue with her bill’s funding allocation and projects these revenues will double by fiscal year 2024. 
Mendelson said he prefers his bill, which he describes as more equitable than the mayor’s.
“The strategies in our bill are thought through to look at goals in other states and to be more effective in accomplishing them. And the mayor’s bill doesn’t do that,” Mendelson said in an interview with the Washington City Paper. 
The District’s current laws, passed in 2014, dictate that adult citizens can grow, possess and gift cannabis, but not sell. 
As chairman, Mendelson determines which committee a bill is directed to and can prioritize his own bill. Some news publications have speculated that Mendelson and the six fellow council members who have signed as co-introducers may have an edge over the mayor’s bill.
Despite differences between their proposed bills, both Bowser and Mendelson emphasized justice for those most impacted by the criminalization of cannabis, according to Mendelson.“Importantly this bill centers reinvestment on, and creates opportunities for, the people and communities that were hit hardest by the War on Drugs,” Mendelson wrote in a March 1 tweet.

A student-led working group calling for the abolition of university police amid ongoing complaints of hyperpolicing on campus is requesting greater community support and involvement in the group’s advocacy.
The Georgetown University Police Department Abolition Working Group was established by the Georgetown University Student Association senators last October, according to GUSA Senator Makayla Jeffries (COL ’23), who first organized the group. The working group is a subcommittee of the Policy and Advocacy Committee.  
While the working group ultimately hopes to abolish GUPD, it is currently focusing on engaging with the university and educating the Georgetown community, according to GUSA Senator Ace Frazier (MSB ’23), a member of the working group. 
“We really want to be entirely prepared because people don’t really understand sometimes how abolition works,” Frazier said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “They think that it’s just immediately getting rid of and trying to force out whatever thing that you’re against or thing you are trying to change, but in reality, it starts a lot more with preparing and building up what’s going to replace that thing beforehand.” 
Calls for abolition come amid ongoing complaints of hyperpolicing, specifically from students of color who have shared experiences of unnecessary surveillance and excessive use of force from GUPD. Despite these experiences, there has only been one formal complaint against GUPD since 2014, which involved someone who was not a member of the Georgetown community. 
Following the killing of George Floyd last summer, students also circulated a petition calling for the university to cease all relationships with police departments amid nationwide protests against police brutality in attempts to support Georgetown’s Black community and combat racial injustice.
Recently, the working group has been researching preventative measures and alternatives to policing, including ways to protect communities through education and mental health support systems, according to Frazier.
“We are really solidifying our own knowledge on the subject and what actions can be done by the university before making any direct acts to abolish or get rid of GUPD,” Frazier said.
The working group is hoping to present a proposal to the university detailing alternative solutions to GUPD by April, according to Jeffries.
“I ran for senator on the platform of abolishing the police because I think we should abolish the police, both in universities but also just generally,” Jeffries said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I never want the university to feel like abolition is impossible because they lack the imagination.” 
GUPD is working to better engage with the Georgetown community and encourage an equitable environment, according to Associate Vice President for Public Safety and Chief of Police Jay Gruber.
“The Georgetown University Police Department is committed to continuing to improve its processes and procedures, engaging with the campus community, and listening and responding to feedback to ensure there is no racial bias in its actions as it seeks to provide a safe campus,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
GUPD officers have been required to participate in training on reducing bias in policing, racial justice and community engagement since 2016, according to Gruber. 
“GUPD works 24/7, 365 days a year to protect the University from crime and numerous threats, and responds to thousands of calls each year to support students, faculty and staff who are in need,” Gruber wrote. “We also recognize that keeping the Georgetown community safe includes constantly working to eliminate structural racism and any form of bias in its operations.”
No matter how much GUPD reforms, many students in the working group believe it is beyond repair. In addition, the working group is also advocating for expanding programs that already exist at the university, such as hiring transformative justice practitioners in health education services and providing a hotline for mental health crises, according to Jeffries.
“Successful abolition depends on communities of care, and it’s not just about tearing down white supremacist systems,” Jeffries said. “It is also about, how can we depend on our community to mitigate harm?” 
To support mental health, the university launched HoyaWell, a new telehealth resource aiming to provide more virtual mental health services to students during the COVID-19 pandemic in January. The university also hired temporary mental health counselors last spring to offer free counseling services specifically to BIPOC survivors of sexual misconduct.
As students continue to raise concerns about GUPD’s practices, the working group hopes the Georgetown community will recognize police violence goes beyond physical assault, according to Jeffries.
“Just because a Black or Brown student on this campus has not been physically assaulted by GUPD, that doesn’t mean that GUPD isn’t actively enacting violence against Black and Brown people on this campus,” Jeffries said. “I feel like every time I hear a story about GUPD from someone that is Black and Brown, it is traumatic, and that is violent.” 
The working group is now calling for greater student and community involvement as it continues to advocate for reform, according to GroupMe messages.
Although abolition is a long-term project, establishing support systems and providing resources to the community is still important and necessary work, according to Jeffries.
“I do not even know if I am going to see abolition at this university by the time I graduate, which is fine,” Jeffries said. “But at least for me, and I know for a lot of people in the working group, the work will never stop. The work for abolition, the work for getting resources for people, the work for building communities of care, that is never going to stop. We are all just in it for the long haul.”

So abolishing something does not mean “immediately getting rid of” it, but rather “preparing and building up what’s going to replace that thing beforehand”? Gee, so when slavery was abolished, Lincoln really just wanted to build some other form of forced servitude? I think what Frazier means is REFORM, not abolition. Honey, if you do not think there should be police on campus, you’re in the wrong group.

Getting rid of something and replacing it with something else is not reform. Every time something integral to society is abolished it’s replaced by something else – slavery was replaced by free labor. Also, many universities don’t have or need police on campus. Sorry about it.

Political and spiritual beliefs can motivate noncompliance with COVID-19 prevention measures in rural communities, such as mask mandates and social distancing guidelines, according to a recent Georgetown University study.
Emily Mendenhall, professor in the School of Foreign Service, authored the paper “A Spectrum of (Dis)Belief: Coronavirus frames in a rural midwestern town in the United States,” which was published Feb. 9. The paper explores reasons why COVID-19 preventative response measures have not been evenly adopted by people across the nation, especially in rural communities. The research focuses on rural Dickinson County, Iowa, Mendenhall’s hometown, and analyzes various reasons residents cited as to why they were choosing not to follow health guidelines.
The study surveyed people who said they did not follow health guidelines, finding that political and cultural identities were an extremely important factor influencing people’s belief in the seriousness of the virus. Many cited mask-wearing guidelines as an infringement on “personal freedoms,” as well as conspiracy theories echoed by former President Donald Trump that the deadliness of the virus was overblown or would magically disappear after the election.
Rumors and conspiracy in remote communities can be linked to the lack of transparent, honest leadership from government officials, according to Mendenhall. 
“I was fascinated to see just how little control the public health authorities had. I was just blown away at how political the response was,” Mendenhall said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
“When policy fails, people try to make sense of things. Having a strong federal response is the great equalizer — it enables people to have something to follow and guide them.”
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government’s public safety mandates have been inconsistent and generally lack proper enforcement. This issue is more prominent in rural communities across the country, where the majority of voters voted for and subscribed to former President Trump’s personal response to the pandemic, which often countered the suggestions and mandates of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
A stark political urban-rural divide has come into focus in recent years, and rural counties voted in even greater overwhelming numbers for Trump in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016. Rural Americans are less likely than their urban counterparts to follow COVID-19 prevention measures, according to a study published by the Texas A&M University School of Public Health. Although early outbreaks of COVID-19 were mainly concentrated in cities and suburbs, per capita cases and deaths in rural areas have surpassed metropolitan areas since August 2020, according to The New York Times.
Administering the study was a deeply personal experience for Mendenhall, who was inspired after observing the difficulties Zach Borus, her brother-in-law and a co-author of the study, faced while organizing and leading a pandemic response plan for Dickinson County, she said.
“In the D.C. area, everyone was really cautious and staying at home. People were wearing masks, and if you weren’t following accepted guidelines there was some sort of social surveillance where everyone was trying to keep the community safe,” Mendenhall said. “When I got out to Iowa, no one was wearing masks, and it kind of felt like there was no virus. I was just curious to see what people thought and why they weren’t wearing masks.”
The consequences of ignoring COVID-19 prevention guidelines can be especially deadly for smaller areas like Dickinson County that lack the hospital capacity or critical health care resources needed to deal with an outbreak. As a result, a disproportionate amount of the worst virus outbreaks have occurred in remote counties with fewer than 10,000 people, mostly in the Midwest and Mountain regions.
Political fissures can easily undermine the response capabilities of the medical and scientific community, no matter how obvious the danger may seem based on scientific evidence, according to Mendenhall. She pointed to the fact that the United States was ranked as the most prepared nation to respond to a pandemic in 2019 by the Global Health Security Index but drastically failed to meet expectations in its response.
“You can know everything there is to know and be better prepared than anyone else and still fail when you don’t have political support for your response,” Mendenhall said. “With the deepening political fissures, public health and medicine were too slow to recognize dissonance.”
Mendenhall’s study provides valuable insight for how rural public health practitioners can reframe public health measures to protect their communities, according to Borus.
“As a family physician and public health practitioner in the study’s focus community in the rural Midwest, I feel honored to have been a part of this project,” Borus wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Its in-depth qualitative interviewing of such a diverse group helped tease out the cultural, political, and social barriers to full buy-in for our public health efforts around COVID-19.” 
Scientific misinformation in future crises can be combated by implementing nationally coordinated response measures that prioritize educating people about science and policy, according to Mendenhall.
“Doing this study showed me that doing more public engagement is important and we need to do what we can do to normalize science and make it accessible and easy for people to understand,” Mendenhall said. “Policy matters because when cultural alignment and groupthink take over, it can be really complicated to make any headway towards a collective goal.”

The Georgetown University McDonough School of Business is helping middle school students from underrepresented groups navigate the college application and financial aid processes in a new program aimed at increasing diversity at top-tier colleges.
The MSB founded Georgetown Reach last fall. The program offers various workshops and classes to help high-performing eighth-grade students in the Washington, D.C. area who might miss college opportunities due to socioeconomic status or other personal factors. Classes and workshops cover topics like college planning and preparing for the college application process.
Underrepresented minority and low-income students in D.C. lack access to information and resources about higher education, according to George Comer, Reach co-director and a professor in the MSB.
“One of the things we found was that those who have greater resources pay upwards of five figures for private college consulting to help them navigate the college admissions process, and that’s what we find one of the biggest gaps to be,” Comer said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.
Before founding Reach, Comer organized annual tours of Georgetown’s campus for local students and their families to see the campus and meet professors. During their visits, students and families were given the opportunity to talk to Bonnie Montano, Reach co-director and a professor in the MSB, about the college admissions process. 
In the fall, MSB deans asked Comer and Montano to make the program official, according to Comer. The university has recently begun a push for greater minority representation on campus, according to Montano.
“What we noticed was that there weren’t that many people from diverse backgrounds applying, so we, along with MSB deans, decided that Georgetown Reach would try to increase the applicant pool for underrepresented minorities by spreading awareness,” Montano said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.  
Since the program began in September 2020, Reach has hosted monthly virtual events for the 36 eighth-graders currently enrolled. These events introduced students and parents to the program and provided them with introductory college counseling. 
Reach recognizes that preparing for college applications is a lengthy process, and therefore the program aims to work with students until they graduate high school, according to Montano. 
“The reason why we are targeting eighth-graders is because there are counsellors in some high schools that won’t talk to students about college until they are juniors, and if you haven’t taken the correct steps before this point, it is already too late,” Montano said.
Beginning this summer, the program plans to host a virtual writing class for students entering ninth grade. In the fall, Reach students will participate in a one-day, on-campus event that will allow them to tour the university, attend a lecture and interact with university community members. 
Reach also plans to incorporate mentorship into the program, pairing Georgetown undergraduates with students in the program. These mentors will serve as resources to answer questions, give advice and act as role models for these students. Furthermore, they also aim to engage families by providing support for parents navigating the college admissions and financial aid processes, according to Comer.
“Parents are very uncertain about the college process given all the information that exists on the internet, and there’s also the lack of clarification or even communication from school counselors,” Comer said.
Reach’s help and support is crucial in providing readily available information to all students and families, according to a university spokesperson.
“Through Georgetown Reach, our faculty are ensuring that young people and their families in our D.C. community know that attending a prestigious university is within their reach when they have the right tools and information at their fingertips,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Reach will continue to engage with more students from throughout D.C. in hopes of fostering diversity in elite college admissions, according to Comer. 
“It has been such a wonderful opportunity to be able to provide a program that fosters diversity at a time where diversity has become a priority and to be able to help Georgetown continue to be the top-tier university that it is,” Comer said.

These days, Tianna Mobley (COL ’20, GRD ’22) spends much of her time combing through the Library of Congress’ digital archival database, scouring primary documents to learn more about the legacy of slavery in Washington, D.C.
As a graduate student in the Global, International and Comparative History program, Mobley has studied the influence of slavery in D.C. This year, she joined the White House Historical Association, an organization founded by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961 to educate and provide public access to information about the president’s residence, as a historical fellow. In 2016, the association launched the fellowship Mobley is taking part in, “Slavery in the President’s Neighborhood” inspired, in part, by First Lady Michelle Obama’s 2016 Democratic National Convention speech in which she said, “I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves.”  
As a fellow, Mobley’s primary job is to conduct and publish research about the history of slavery in the White House. Her first article, titled “Prominent African-American Women and the White House” and published through the White House Historical Association’s website Jan. 27, discusses the role of Black women throughout the White House’s history. Her next article will focus on the history of anti-lynching activism in the White House and is expected to be published in March, Mobley said.
After enrolling in history professor Chandra Manning’s course “Finding D.C. Civil War African American Sites” in 2019, Mobley was inspired to learn more about the history of slavery in the District. Mobley began to learn more about the legacy of slavery in the District, including how enslaved people were once paraded outside of the White House, she said. 
“We started thinking about what was unique about slavery in the District, like the fact that slaves were paraded in front of the White House, for example,” Mobley said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “That is what got me interested in the idea of slavery and the White House. I now have the opportunity to work on this project where I’m actually thinking about the history of slavery in the president’s neighborhood.”
Mobley’s work with the fellowship began with research about understanding the role of enslaved people in the construction of the White House. 
“It’s about understanding that national paradox: the fact that the U.S. portrayed itself to be the beacon of liberty and represents the White House as the people’s house, and yet it was built by enslaved individuals,” she said. 
In 1792, under direction from President George Washignton, both enslaved laborers and white wage-earning craftsmen worked to construct what would become the president’s official home, according to research by Lina Mann, a historian involved in the White House Historical Association’s initiative. 
Mobley’s research demonstrates the ways history can benefit society, according to Marcia Chatelain, a professor of history and African American studies at Georgetown, who taught Mobley in her course “Race and Racism in the White House.” 
“We don’t just study the past for the sake of the past; we examine the past because it makes us smarter, more empathetic, and far more nuanced in our thinking,” she wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Presidential history is the history of slavery in the United States and using the White House as a text for studying slavery is incredibly creative.”
As an aspiring historian, Mobley said her time as a fellow has provided her a chance to further explore a topic she is passionate about and educate the broader public. 
“For me, one of the first and biggest reasons I was drawn to this fellowship opportunity was the fact that it allowed myself, as an African American woman, to finally actually view the White House as the people’s house, as a place that is representative of people who look like me as well,” Mobley said. “Previously, I hadn’t really viewed it in that light. That’s what I hope other people who look like me will be able to get from this project: the ability to identify with the White House and national history in a different way than they thought possible.”

Washington, D.C. expanded COVID-19 vaccination eligibility March 1 to include residents aged 16-64 with qualifying medical conditions amid complaints of technical difficulties with the District’s vaccine portal. 
The new requirements expand eligibility to residents with chronic medical conditions, including certain heart conditions, cancer, asthma and diabetes. The expansion marks the District’s transition into the next phase of vaccine distribution: Tier 1 of Phase 1C, which also allows food service staff, commercial and residential property maintenance workers and a variety of additional essential employees to receive the vaccine. 
In response to the new eligibility requirements, Georgetown University is advising university community members to stay informed about eligibility conditions, although the university does not have its own supply of vaccines, according to Dr. Ranit Mishori, interim chief public health officer and professor of family medicine.
“We urge any member of the Georgetown community who is eligible to be vaccinated to take advantage of vaccination opportunities provided through your healthcare provider, or state or local government,” Mishori wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are working to develop an approach that enables Georgetown to assist the DC government in its mission to provide the vaccine to as many people as possible in the District, including our university community.”
Community members should continue to take other COVID-19 safety precautions, according to Mishori.
“In addition to getting vaccinated when eligible, please remain vigilant in following all health and safety guidance, including wearing a mask, keeping at least six feet apart, avoiding indoor social gatherings, respecting quarantine requirements and meeting testing commitments,” Mishori wrote in a Feb. 23 email to Georgetown community members.
Since the initial rollout of vaccines in December, D.C.’s vaccine supply has been unable to meet eligible populations’ demands, and available vaccine appointments fill quickly, often privileging those with time, information and internet access, according to D.C. Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt.
“Initially, we got a lot of feedback, often not positive, about the standing time about when we release appointments,” Nesbitt said during a Feb. 18 D.C. Health press conference. “Nine a.m. doesn’t work for everybody. We have people who have jobs that they can’t come off of their job assignment to go to the website and claim appointments, and so we’re going to attempt to be flexible for that.”
In response to these concerns, the updated vaccine registration portal will notify groups of residents from the week’s priority ZIP codes when appointments become available. The registration process will also be accessible at times other than the usual 9 a.m. openings each week. 
Despite these changes, D.C. residents continued to face challenges with the vaccine appointment registration process, experiencing technical difficulties including faulty CAPTCHA verification, difficulty verifying eligibility and website crashes on the vaccination portal when new appointments opened to Wards 5, 7 and 8 on Feb. 25. 
District leadership apologized for the technical issues and assured residents efforts were being made to address the problems, according to a statement from Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) team.
“We know how stressful of a time this is, and we regret that this unfortunate situation occurred on a day when many of our residents with chronic health conditions were newly eligible for vaccination appointments,” the statement reads. 
To account for the difficulties, the District opened another batch of 3,500 appointments to priority districts Feb. 27.
Residents ran into continued complications Feb. 26 and Feb. 27 again, however, citing issues like CAPTCHA code verification problems, error messages, a broken phone hotline and website crashes. 
Even after moving beyond the frustrating CAPTCHA code verification screen, it was difficult to secure an appointment Feb. 26, according to Rachel Kerr (COL ’24).
“I think eventually probably a lot of people just gave up, and so then the website was a bit faster, so we got through. It was just incredibly slow, and then by the time we got on, there were still appointments available,” Kerr said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We tried a bunch of locations, but by the time we had tried them all, all the appointments were gone.”
