Andrea Jaime (NHS ’17) brought her focus and passion to her studies of health sciences, her desire to help others and her friendships.
A human science major who dreamed of one day becoming a doctor in the Army, Jaime died from a case of bacterial meningitis on Tuesday at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital. She was 19.
“We wish to express our gratitude to the many people who have sent their thoughts and prayers to us during this time of tragedy and despair for our family,” Jaime’s family wrote in a statement released through the university Thursday. “Andrea was a blessing to our lives and will forever live in our hearts.”
Jaime was born in Bogota, Colombia, and graduated from Coral Gables Senior High School in Miami, Fla., in 2013. In addition to her studies in the School of Nursing and Health Studies at Georgetown, Jaime had completed training for the Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service last semester and passed her REMT test and GERMS practical exam. She was offered a position at the Glen Echo Fire Station in Bethesda, Md., with training set to begin this week.
According to her friend Lena Snow (NHS ’17), Jaime was passionate from a young age about helping others and practicing medicine.
“It was her passion since she was a little girl, it’s what she wanted to do. I just think it’s really incredible how much she knew that at such a young age, that that was her calling,” Snow said. “She totally had the personality for it. … She would have been an incredible doctor. She would have been able to get the information out of the patient effectively and politely, and I can just totally see her in medicine. It’s just really unfortunate because she would have helped so many people.”
Jaime’s roommate, Cecilia Skakel (COL ’17), agreed.
“She really cared about the people around her, and I have no doubt that she would have been an amazing doctor,” Skakel said.
Jaime was fascinated with medicine and often spent time studying independently, according to friend and classmate Marjia Jannati (NHS ’17).
“She loved anything health-related,” Jannati said. “Even when we were studying in [Regents Hall] really late, she’d tell me that she’d sometimes watch surgeries or sometimes watch strange case studies shows and medical shows. She was really into helping people, and she couldn’t wait to get out and start helping people.”
Jaime was a member of the Georgetown University Grilling Society and the Georgetown Scholarship Program, and was interested in joining Hearts for Heroes, an organization that provides financial and spiritual assistance to returning veterans. She participated in Community Scholars, a five-week academic summer program for incoming freshmen, and was a Gates Millenium Scholarship recipient.
Jaime also loved to exercise, and was on the varsity soccer and varsity volleyball teams in high school. At Georgetown, she particularly enjoyed running with friends.
Jannati said that Jaime was always there to motivate her while they worked out together.
“She’s very energetic, she is a hard worker,” Jannati said. “She would always say, ‘You can’t slack off.’ We had a plan to work out, to study, to get things done or go to Yates. If she makes a plan, we’re going to do it. She was always determined and she always had goals in mind and she followed through.”
Jannati recalled the regular runs that she would take with Jaime to the monuments.
“Every time we got there, toward the end, I’d say, ‘I’m tired. Can we slow down and walk this part?’ For her, it was like, ‘No.’ She’d run the hardest in the last 10 minutes,” Jannati said. “I think that sums her up a little bit because she always pushed hard at the end. It didn’t matter if she was tired, she still pushed on.”
Mansi Vohra (NHS ’17), another close friend, said she remembers a moment she shared with Jaime on a particularly scenic run on a trail along the Potomac.
“It was one of the most beautiful trails I have ever been on. … Just like being there with her, and taking it in, and going on an amazing run, that will always be my favorite memory because it was just such a beautiful trail with such a beautiful person,” Vohra said. “I’m probably going to go running there again just to remember her.”
According to Vohra, Jaime’s dedicated, hardworking attitude was present in both her social and academic life.
“She was such a hard worker, because she just pushed herself when she went to the gym, pushed herself in the classroom,” Vohra said. “She had a goal of being a doctor, and nothing brought that goal down. Not a bad grade, nothing.”
In addition to being a hardworking and focused student, Jaime is remembered as bubbly and optimistic, even when it came to her rigorous course load.
“Her closest friends will remember her as someone who was honest and forward, but with such a humor that you were guaranteed endless laughter when you were with her,” Sandra Martinez (NHS ’17), a friend of Jaime, wrote in an email. “She was someone who knew how to have fun, whether that was at a Saturday night party or a Saturday night in Lau.”
Jaime became close friends with her peer adviser in the NHS Madhav Paul (NHS ’16), who noted her enthusiasm and her infectious laugh.
“If she would get excited about something, it would just be all of a sudden and all at once and she would just explode with excitement and start talking about it,” Paul said. “She would go off on tangents and her enthusiasm was really contagious. Every time she would explode like that, you couldn’t help but laugh and just appreciate how much she was talking about whatever she was talking about.”
The university held a prayer service in remembrance of Jaime on Tuesday evening in Dahlgren Quad. University President John J. DeGioia, Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., Rabbi Rachel Gartner and Center for Multicultural Equity Access Assistant Director for Academic and Student Support Services Cinthya Salazar spoke at the service.
“In the NHS, we pride ourselves on being so small and being such a small community. I think the majority of the 2017 class of the NHS was at that vigil,” Snow said. “We were all there for each other. In our classes, there’s definitely a somber mood.”
Those close to Jaime stressed that the memory of their friend will live on with them.
“I will not say, ‘She was loved.’ She is loved, because the love of her friends and family has not diminished because she is gone,” Martinez wrote. “It is still present and will remain with us.”

this is shameful says 
September 21, 2014 at 12:55 pm
This obituary goes against the wishes of Andrea’s parents and essentially is an example of media capitalizing on tragedy for their own benefit. The Editorial staff of the Hoya should be ashamed of themselves and exercise better judgment in the future.

The case of meningitis that led to the death of Andrea Jaime (NHS ’17) on Tuesday was bacterial, Assistant Vice President for Student Health Services Jim Welsh confirmed in a meeting with Jaime’s Copley 5 floormates on Thursday night, followed by a university-wide email alerting the Georgetown community of the diagnosis.
According to Welsh, Jaime’s case of meningitis was caused by the meningococcal bacteria and was of serogroup B.
Meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes near the brain and spinal cord, is typically caused by either a bacterial or viral infection.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, viral meningitis is usually not as serious as bacterial meningitis and generally lasts seven to 10 days.
Bacterial meningitis requires immediate medical attention and can lead to a variety of health problems such as brain damage, hearing loss or learning disabilities.  There were approximately 4,100 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States with about 500 fatal cases each year between 2003 and 2007.
At the meeting Tuesday, Welsh offered all residents of the fifth floor of Copley Hall the option to take a single 500 mg dose of Ciprofloxacin, a prophylaxis antibiotic, to prevent the transmission of the disease in case they had been exposed. Slightly under half of the approximately 70 residents of Jaime’s all-girls floor showed up to the meeting, and most students chose to take home the antibiotic.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone who has had close personal contact with someone diagnosed with bacterial meningitis take the antibiotic, defining close contact as household members, child care center contacts, and anyone exposed to the patient’s oral secretions, such as through kissing or sharing a cup.  Welsh said that the proximity of living on the same dormitory floor was not defined as close contact.
The university also kept the Student Health Center open until 2 a.m. early Friday morning instead of its usual 6 p.m. Thursday closing time to allow students concerned about meningitis to seek antibiotics.
Between 50 and 100 students visited the Student Health Center on Thursday night, according to health center employees, with many visitors saying they chose to seek preventative treatment to be cautious.
Welsh said that the university originally gave the antibiotic just to a small group of individuals who had lived in close contact with Jaime, such as her roommate and her close friends, before they received confirmation of the meningitis as bacterial.
“We were advised at that time by the Department of Health and by the hospital that doing a wider offering of Cipro didn’t make sense because there was no evidence of this bacteria. And now that we know that there is, in my conference call today with the CDC, I asked them about [Copley 5], and I described to them exactly what the living arrangements are like on the fifth floor,” Welsh said at the meeting.“And to be perfectly honest, they didn’t say you must take an antibiotic. They said it would be OK to offer the antibiotic to the residents of that floor.”
Possible side effects of the antibiotic include nausea, mild diarrhea, stomach pain, dizziness and headache, according to information distributed to Copley 5 residents by the university. The antibiotic is also prescribed to treat many other ailments. Although many American teenagers receive a vaccine for bacterial meningitis, there is not currently a licensed vaccine in the United States that protects against the serogroup B strain.
Welsh initially informed the campus community Wednesday that it was unlikely Jaime’s case of meningitis had been bacterial, writing in a university-wide email that “to date, all test results in this case are negative for bacterial meningitis” and that “each day that passes without positive bacterial growth in the tests further decreases the likelihood that this was a case of bacterial meningitis.”
Tests of the meningitis at Georgetown University MedStar Hospital produced uncertain results, and the university sent the results to the CDC for further testing, which confirmed a bacterial diagnosis.
“The CDC ran some tests that were not available at the hospital or at the District of Columbia Department of Health that confirmed that this meningitis was caused by meningococcal bacteria,” Welsh said at Thursday night’s floor meeting.
The strain of bacterial meningitis identified by the university is the same type that was present at Princeton University, Drexel University in Philadelphia and the University of California, Santa Barbara, last year. According to the CDC, eight cases of meningitis were confirmed at Princeton and four were confirmed at USCB.  At Drexel, the one confirmed case of meningitis last March was fatal. “[The CDC] got special permission to offer that vaccine at both schools when it was determined that the outbreaks were ongoing and more cases were likely to occur,” Alison Albert, health communications specialist for the Division of Bacterial Diseases at the CDC, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Welsh said that there have been no other cases of meningitis on campus.
“It is the only case of meningitis that Georgetown has, and we have no evidence that there is an outbreak,” he said.
One confirmed case of meningitis is not necessarily indicative of an oncoming outbreak. According to the CDC, only about 2 percent of cases of meningococcal diseases are caused by outbreaks, with the remainder of the cases occurring sporadically.
According to the CDC, there is no environment risk to Georgetown students, and no further action will be required of the university regarding the fifth floor of Copley.
“With just one case, there’s not much that would happen,” Albert wrote. “If it is meningococcal meningitis, antibiotics would be offered to close contacts of the person who became ill. And it’s common to just see one isolated case with no more cases occurring or leading to an outbreak.
The last confirmed case of bacterial meningitis on Georgetown’s campus occurred over 20 years ago, according to Welsh.
In the email sent late Thursday night confirming the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, Welsh and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson advised the community to follow stringent hygiene measures and delineated potential symptoms.
“Signs and symptoms of bacterial meningitis can include high fever, headache, vomiting or stiff neck,” the email read. “Signs and symptoms of a bloodstream infection, which these bacteria can also cause, can include vomiting, chills, rapid breathing, or dark purple rash. These symptoms can develop over several hours, or they may take a few days.”
After experiencing a cold for two weeks, Jaime discovered Friday that she had 105-degree fever. Mansi Vohra (NHS ’17), one of Jaime’s close friends, took her to the emergency room Friday.
“They gave her an IV and they gave her ibuprofen for the pain, and she was released from the hospital because her fever had climbed down to 98.6 degrees, and then on Saturday she was fine,” Vohra said.
Jaime woke up Sunday morning experiencing body aches and other flu-like symptoms. She returned to the hospital, where doctors gave her a spinal tap and confirmed that she had meningitis.
Students, including floormates, have taken the medication and visited the health center to be safe.
Aaron Ravin (COL ’17), a Henle resident who spent time with one of Jaime’s former roommates this weekend, visited the Student Health Center at 11:30 p.m. Thursday but did not end up taking the antibiotic offered to him.
“The guy at the health office assured us her roommates and friends had all been tested and no one had come back as having had it,” Ravin said. “The health office was willing to give out the antibiotic to anyone who wanted it for peace of mind.”
Casey Nolan (COL ’17), a Copley 5 resident, said that the floor meeting settled her concerns.
“I was a little worried at first because bacteria was one of the deadliest forms, but then when [Dr. Welsh] explained how difficult it us to catch it, I figured I’m probably OK,” she said.
Lauren Gilmore (NHS ’17), another resident of Copley 5, agreed, but said that she still plans to take the antibiotic as a precaution.
“I would rather be safe than sorry,” she said.
Anyone exhibiting symptoms, which can occur suddenly, is advised to immediately visit the Student Health Center or visit the nearest emergency room.

I was sorry to hear about Andrea’s death.  She was much too young to be taken.  The fact that the cause was bacterial meningitis and the offering of cipro is troubling.  In addition to the side effects mentioned in the article, the fluoroquinolones (cipro, floxin, etc.) have a black label warning of tendon problems, including rupture.  There have also been cases of peripheral neuropathy caused by this class of antibiotics.  Of course, if it is the only antibiotic that will treat this type of meningitis, it makes sense to use it.  However, people should beware of these particular side effects.

With Mr. Smith’s Sept. 1 move to K Street, M Street’s piano silence has finally been broken with the Sept. 12 opening of Georgetown Piano Bar.
Staffed with the former employees, managers, and pianists from Mr. Smith’s, which moved to restaurant Chadwicks’ former location at 3205 K St., the new piano bar, at nightclub Modern’s former location of 3287 M St., will feature a larger, bright red, electric piano and a more spacious building that will allow more bar-goers to enter at once.
“Our piano is bigger because Modern is a much larger space. It’s Mr. Smith’s piano on steroids. It’s large enough that even two pianos could play at the same time,” said Gene McGrath, former Mr. Smith’s manager and co-owner of the Georgetown Piano Bar.
When Mr. Smith’s employees caught word that the restaurant would be closing after the property owner tripled the rent, several of them, including McGrath, made the switch to Georgetown Piano Bar, not knowing that the owners of Mr. Smith’s were planning to open up at Chadwicks old location, after Chadwicks closed Aug. 31.
McGrath said that the new bar includes more seating in order to appeal to large groups of Georgetown students and other M Street patrons.
“It’s great for groups, and that’s really what we are now equipped to do. If 20 or 30 people show up from the university, if the baseball team comes down, the football team, or any organization wants to come in, they actually can fit and won’t have to leave anyone outside,” McGrath said.
Due to Georgetown’s strict liquor moratorium, which limits the amount of bar licenses available to around 70, Georgetown Piano Bar jumped on the opportunity to purchase Modern’s liquor license when the nightclub closed in the spring. Although former Modern patrons will recognize the round bar in the center of the room, McGrath was quick to note that the basement space that used to be Modern has been otherwise transformed.
“While it’s the same space, when you come inside, you won’t recognize it as Modern,” he said.
Ben Rosse, a new waiter at Mr. Smith’s who was not at the old location, said that his restaurant and bar still expects to see Georgetown studentsat its K Street location, but did admit that the restaurant has seen a drop in business since its move.
“I believe that we will attract Georgetown students,” Rosse said. “We still have a decent amount of Chadwicks regulars coming in, like every day, but business-wise, it’s definitely been a little slow.”
According to McGrath, Georgetown Piano Bar also has yet to see a significant customer base from Georgetown.
“We would like all the students to come in and say hello, and we would like to establish with them the same relationship that we had down the street,” he said.
Tessa Pulaski (SFS ’15) noted that while she was not particularly attached to the restaurant side of Mr. Smith’s, she was intrigued by the larger space available in the piano bar.
“I’d like [the bar built around the piano] because the last one used to get super crowded, and that sounds like a better layout,” she said.

Continuing campus dialogue about recent police brutality and protests in Ferguson, Mo., faculty and students discussed race and the law on a panel in Copley Formal Lounge on Wednesday.
The panel was part of the larger event “Ferguson Teach-In,” which included a dinner and roundtable discussions between faculty and students, performances and video presentations from students, and a conversation on what is next in Ferguson, where tensions boiled over after a police officer shot and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in August.
Wednesday’s events followed a previous panel discussion between professors and a student-led vigil for Ferguson that took place in late August, slightly over two weeks after Brown was shot.
The panel in Copley Formal Lounge, called “Voices on the Ground,” featured Jamelle Bouie, a staff writer for Slate Magazine, Deloris Wilson (LAW ’16) of the Georgetown University Black Law Students Association, Director of Civic Engagement and Politics for the Center for Popular Democracy Katrina Gamble, Jiva Manske of Amnesty International and sociology major Brandon Anderson (COL ’14).
The panelists shared their stories and experiences with racism in America. Gamble described how people of color are sometimes pulled over by police offers more often and given tickets, perpetuating the cycle of poverty as lower-income individuals struggle to afford to pay the fine. If an individual is pulled over again without paying previous tickets, he or she will be prosecuted.
“You’re criminalized. You’re put in jail for basically being black and poor. The bench warrant system in that area is a really good example of intersections of both the economic oppression and the racial oppression and its interaction with the law, how it suppressed those communities,” Gamble said. “It is very much a modern day debtor’s prison for people of color.”
The panelists were unanimous in their critique of police brutality and racial profiling, a problem seen not only in Ferguson but also throughout the country.
“We have created a system where if you are black or brown, if you are low income, you essentially no longer have Fourth Amendment rights. You are subject to the police force, essentially at every stage of your life, and that’s a problem,” Bouie said.
Wilson pointed at the problems within the Fourth Amendment, which states that the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”
She noted that the words “unreasonable” and “probable cause” gave police officers room to exercise subjectivity in their decision, which she believes to be a flaw in the amendment and indicative of the failure in the field of law to protect citizens’ rights. After reading old cases in her law school class, Wilson said she has become somewhat disillusioned by the law.
“You’re in a class of 120 people, and probably 117 of them really believe in a law and look up to the law, and see the law as their saving grace and the foundation of all that is right and true in the world,” Wilson said. “But those, mainly for the few individuals that are black … the law is not necessarily the saving grace for me, because I have seen the law fail me on multiple occasions.”
Manske, who travelled to Ferguson when the riots broke out, said that the images of violence played on the news were not what he witnessed while on the ground.
“All I saw was non-violent protest,” he said.
He pointed to the power of the police to instigate violence at their disposal.
“I didn’t see anything that was instigated by the protesters, and I think that that’s something that’s important to recognize because police officers have an obligation to police protests and a whip to facilitate protests,” Manske said.
He described how the scrutiny of the victim Michael Brown reveals a deep flaw in American society.
“The fact that Mike Brown has to prove his worth in being a victim of a shooting, that’s indicative of that broader structural racism in the society that we live in,” Manske said.
Hannah Gerdes (SFS ’16), who attended the event, commended how it offered further opportunities for students to get involved, such as the BLSA’s goal to hold “500 Meetings for Justice.” Aiming to promote conversations about race and police brutality, the BLSA has launched a twitter hashtag, called #roadto500, encouraging members of the community to ask for 500 meetings on these issues.
“With the reputation of these kinds of events in our country, it’s really frustrating to sometimes feel like no one’s listening to each other, we’re not getting anywhere,” Gerdes said. “So even just small steps that they gave — the panelists gave — are very encouraging and I think hopefully it’s something multiple people can get on board with.”
After the panel, Wilson said that she thought the event was a success. At the beginning of the four-hour event Copley Formal Lounge was packed, but by the last hour the crowd had dwindled to about 15 people by the last hour.
“I hope to see more of these, and I think with the Black Law Students Association and Georgetown Law, our Road to 500 initiative, will definitely help propel people to host events like this, so we can see more in the future,” Wilson said.

Georgetown will hold a symposium on the Ebola crisis on Tuesday in the Intercultural Center, featuring various doctors, policy makers and experts on infectious disease and global crises.
One perspective that the symposium will highlight is that of microbiology and immunology professor Daniel Lucey, who just returned from three weeks in Freetown, Sierra Leone, as part of the Ebola emergency response. He will soon return to Liberia, where he will work with Doctors Without Borders.
While on site in Freetown, Lucey gave training sessions twice a day on how to properly use personal protective equipment to prevent infection while treating patients. Lucey said that the lack of resources and poor equipment created some large health challenges and concerns.
“There’s no air conditioning, of course, and it’s summer in Sierra Leone and it’s the rainy season but it’s just hot, hot, hot. You put on all this equipment and you begin sweating profusely before you ever set foot into seeing the patients,” Lucey said.
“We have these little flimsy gloves that tear easily. We have goggles that have been re-bleached so many times that you cant see out of them, plus you sweat so much that they got fogged up but you don’t have any anti-fog spray. How can you work if you cant see?”
According to Lucey, many of the doctors and health care providers he worked with had friends and colleagues who lost their lives from Ebola. A group of nurses who have lost many colleagues to the virus travelled over five hours to attend the training session.
“To me, it’s very humbling offering this training to health care providers who already have colleagues who are dead from the virus, but they knew what they were getting into, because now everyone knows what Ebola does,” Lucey said.
Lucey said he hopes that the symposium will allow experts to learn from one another and collaborate in new ways.
“So many people at Georgetown have done so much good over so many years, and preparing and responding to not just infectious disease, but other humanitarian crises not related to infectious diseases and not necessarily related to health,” Lucey said. “It’s wonderful to be able to collaborate and play to this synergy of strengths that Georgetown has.”
The four-hour event will include opening and closing remarks and two panels entitled “Historical, Social and Political-Economic Reasons for the Devastating Impact of the Ebola Virus in West Africa” and “Where do we go from here: Greater Implications of the Ebola Crisis.”
The symposium will also include a Skype call with the president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who was scheduled to speak here at an African business forum in August that was cancelled as a result of the epidemic.
John Monahan (CAS ’83, LAW ’87), senior adviser to University President John J. DeGioia for global health and a senior fellow in the McCourt School of Public Policy helped plan the event, and said that he hopes it will help educate members of the community about the virus and its implications.
“The Ebola outbreak in west Africa is a catastrophe that has received widespread attention and that has profound health, social, economic and political consequences,” Monahan wrote in an email. “As a result, the planning team believed that a symposium would provide students, faculty and others with an opportunity to learn more about Ebola epidemic, understand why it has unfolded in the manner that it has and consider ways to mitigate the terrible impact of the virus on west African communities.”
Steven Radelet, the Donald F. McHenry Chair in Global Human Development and director of the SFS Global Human Development Program, also helped organize the event and said that Georgetown’s diverse faculty will help provide a robust variety of perspectives on this issue.
“There are just a lot of students and faculty and others in the university community that are concerned about this, interested in this, want to better understand what’s happening and better understand what they can do,” Radelet said. “We thought that this was a good opportunity to bring together the various people that are working on it in different ways to try to inform the broader university community about what’s happening, why and where it might go.”
Radelet said that he hopes it will help motivate attendees to take action.
“Our goal is twofold, that the Georgetown community understands what is happening and the seriousness of what is happening, not only for West Africa, but how it effects all of us in some ways,” Radelet said. “The second, beyond just informing us better, at least for some people, it will spur them to more action of encouraging a greater response, whether it’s fundraising, writing to members of Congress, asking the White House to do more or encouraging a stronger public response so that people and organizations around the world will accelerate their efforts to move forward. That kind of action can be really powerful.”
The event is sponsored by the School of Foreign Service, Georgetown Law Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, McCourt School of Public Policy, Department of Biology, Office of the Senior Vice President for Research and Office of the President.

Plans to build a new Interfaith Prayer Center on Georgetown’s campus are in the works because of a growing need for an interfaith space sparked over the past few years, according to Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J.
“At present we are assessing the limited options for the location of the center. We need space which is accessible for students, yet quiet enough for a prayer center,” O’Brien wrote in an email. “We imagine space big enough for several prayer rooms, a common gathering area, and a kitchen. Our hope is that the center will be an inter-faith gathering space for all students, both for prayer, study and conversation.”
A list of locations for potential construction will be available mid-semester after further planning between Campus Ministry and the Office of Planning and Facilities Management.
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner mentioned plans for the center in Washington Jewish Week last week, saying the Interfaith Center would offer more space and lounging area for students.
Gartner told Washington Jewish Week the Jewish Chaplaincy would have to raise $1.5 million to contribute its share to the center.
According to O’Brien, Campus Ministry has already begun fundraising, but the exact cost of the center is to be determined.
“This is a multi-million dollar project, the exact cost will be determined when the plans are fixed,” O’Brien wrote.
Further student involvement will also follow more exact planning, O’Brien said.
“We are working to develop a permanent Interfaith Prayer Center that will meet the growing needs of our Jewish, Muslim and Hindu students in the future and continue to fulfill our longstanding commitment to respect the faith traditions of all of our students,” O’Brien wrote.
Members of the Interfaith Student Association said that they are supportive of a center, which would increase awareness of the group’s work.
“We have a problem of visibility,” Bassam Sidiki (COL ’16), co-chair of the ISA said. “We really do need a center because, as co-chair of the ISA, what I’ve noticed is people on Georgetown’s campus are so ingrained in their own faith tradition and feel so comfortable in it that they don’t feel the need to explore other traditions.”
Sidiki hopes the center will not only draw religious students, but those questioning their spirituality or faith identities.
“Not everyone, even if you are for example, Muslim or Jewish, actually goes to the services of their particular faith tradition on campus. [There are] some who are still exploring, and I feel like the center should target those people who are exploring this question of seeing their own identity in terms of faith,” Sidiki said.
Niki Khandheria (NHS ’17), interfaith chair for the Hindu Student Association, agreed.
“Interfaith is not just about religion, it’s also about having conversations with people who are not religious. I feel like sometimes those students don’t have a space where they can go and think and reflect on spirituality and religion,” Khandheria said.
Khandheria also said while there is room for progress, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu students are well accepted at Georgetown.
“Even though Georgetown is a Catholic University, I still feel that Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist and Muslim students have very vibrant communities. As the interfaith chair for the Hindu Students Association, I don’t feel a weaker presence compared to other faith groups on campus,” Khandheria said.
The ISA currently meets in the Jewish prayer space, Makom, in the Leavey Student Center, as does the HSA. Khandheria and Sidiki agree that specified interfaith space would help further the mission of the ISA.
“The goal of the ISA is not only to stress similarities between faith traditions but also the fact that we can live together despite our differences and we can learn to disagree respectfully,” Sidiki said. “I think if a center like that is there, that would be a really good place where students can do that.”

The D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities launched the second public art exhibition of the 5×5 Project on Sept. 6. The exhibition, an art festival which cost the DCCAH $500,000, features pieces from 25 artists at various locations around the city, and they will be on display until December 2014.
The five curators, Lance Fung, Shamim Momin, Justine Topfer, Stephanie Sherman and A.M. Weaver, were selected through a competitive process during which an expert selection committee reviewed and selected the artists’ projects, in 2013. Each curator selected five pieces to display, giving the 5×5 arts festival its name. There are 5×5 art projects located throughout D.C., including at the National Gallery of Art, the Lincoln Center and in Dupont Circle.
DCCAH Executive Director Lionell Thomas said that the curators were specifically chosen to bring different perspectives to the neighborhoods of the city and engage with their art communities.
“Each of the five curators has been partnered with various D.C.-based programming and community partners in order to engage a variety of constituents throughout the city,” Thomas wrote in an email. “Some of the artists have taken up temporary residence in the very neighborhoods where they have installed in order to engage with the community.”
In addition to community engagement, Thomas said the 5×5 Project aims to draw attention to major social justice issues affecting the Washington, D.C. community and the world at large.
“Major global issues that are addressed in 5×5 include social justice, environmental, racial identity and perceptions, heroic acts, racial and global politics, gentrification and displacement, history and of course artistic freedom,” Thomas wrote.
The festival first launched at the Cherry Blossom Festival in 2012, when it reached all eight of the city’s wards and attracted over 5,000 residents and visitors. Thomas deemed the festival a success and credited it with expanding the District art scene by inspiring similar exhibits and working with community organizations such as Sasha Bruce House and Town Hall Education Arts Recreation Campus.
“One thing for certain is that D.C. is emerging as a city where its residents demand a lifestyle that includes world class arts and cultural experiences and outlets,” Thomas wrote in an email.
With this second installation, Thomas said he hoped the projects would continue to introduce more people to the arts and provoke strong responses from the community.
A found-art storefront installation by Abigail DeVille, a black artist from the Bronx, received backlash from its surrounding neighborhood in Anacostia for being offensive and aesthetically displeasing. Deville said that the work, criticized for resembling junk, was intended to be an image of the Great Migration of black Americans forced north to escape the Jim Crow South and of gentrification.
“It’s one of our main thoroughfares, and people walk down the street and look through the window and see what appears to be junk,” D.C. Councilmember Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) told The Washington Post. “It’s embarrassing.”
The DCCAH agreed to respect the wishes of the neighborhood and take the art installation down.
“We don’t expect everyone to love all of it, and we respect the views of those that vocally oppose some of the aesthetic and messaging that the work conveys,” Thomas wrote.”This is what 5×5 is about — it is an artistic and conceptual means of revealing beauty and prompting discourse. 5×5 breaks new ground for what public art could and perhaps should be.”
Czarina Ramos (COL ’16), an art minor, said the project offered an important contribution to public art in Washington, D.C., by promoting local artists.
“It’s fabulous that we have a really thriving art collection, dealing with, of course, the National Gallery with all of its Renaissance art and art from all over the world. I feel like local artists, at least from a Georgetown student’s point of view,we don’t get a lot of exposure to those kinds of movements,” Ramos said. “It really brings together all parts of D.C., all wards, and it gives a chance for D.C. to highlight all of the different styles and perspectives of the artists that come through here.”

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced the launch of a pilot program Sept. 9 that allows riders to make mobile payments. Although the pilot program will not officially begin until January 2015 and will only be available at select metro stops and bus routes, it could become the standard method of payment if the program proves successful.
A collaboration between Metro and Accenture, which creates high-performance technology for businesses, the program allows riders to pay for transit using near-field communication technology, which involves radio communication between mobile devices by tapping two devices together. With the app, riders can pay for their trips with specific smartphones, NFC-enabled watches, federal ID cards and various credit and debit cards, according to a WMATA press release. The metro app will be made possible with Apple’s release of the iPhone 6, which will be able to make mobile payments.
“[This] means new fare gates that can allow passengers to pay with Google Wallet, credit cards with chips, etc.,” WMATA spokesperson Caroline Laurin wrote in an email. “Once the technology has been tested to our satisfaction, we will begin introducing the technology across the system.”
Installation of the new fare gates will begin in October. Shady Grove, Eisenhower Avenue, Bethesda, Pentagon City, Pentagon, Ballston, Gallery Place (7th & F), Farragut West, Navy Yard and Suitland are the 10 metro stations selected for the launch along with six Metrobus routes. The pilot hopes to involve at least 2,000 riders.
“We plan on rolling out the pilot in the coming months in 10 of our Metrorail stations as well as on 37 buses and a small number of parking garages,” Laurin wrote. “This is just a pilot and will only impact the customers who are participating in the pilot.”
Some Georgetown students are hopeful about the increased accessibility provided by the program because they frequently use the metro to commute from campus to internships and jobs.
“I was constantly refilling my SmarTrip Card and missing trains to and from work to stand at a kiosk and refill my card,” Sara Margolis (COL ’16) wrote in an email. “It would be convenient to be able to refill my SmarTrip from my phone on my walk to work and save myself a few minutes and get on the first train.”
Eliza Dong (MSB ’15) agreed, adding that it would help save time in lines at popular metro stops.
“The lines at Rosslyn can be crazy,” Dong said. “And when I forget my metro card, it would be nice if I can just swipe through using my iPhone.”
Earlier this year, the WMATA announced that they will phase out paper farecards in favor of SmarTrip cards over the next 18 months. Michael Mischke (SFS ’16) said that he thought that the convenience of the SmarTrip card eliminated the need for an app.
“I intern three days a week, so I take the metro pretty frequently. I already have a refillable Metro card, which is very convenient. Since I can put a lot of money on the card I can go for long periods without refilling it, so I don’t really think about it,” Mischke said. “I don’t see any particular need for a metro app.”
If the pilot program is successful, WMATA plans on installing and replacing all old fare gates starting as early as 2017.
The metro system in Austin, Texas developed a similar app in November 2012 called Capital Metro, which allowed users to purchase fares from their smartphones.
“The replacement of outmoded technology is expected to result in faster, more reliable fare payment for thousands of riders each day as they travel through Metro’s rail, bus and parking systems,” WMATA wrote in a press release.

Cab-hailing app Hailo implemented a limited time discount program on Sept. 8 that cuts weekday fare prices by 50 percent for D.C.-area rides taken between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Hailo, a free app co-founded by three taxi drivers which allows users to order taxi rides through their smartphones, is aiming to increase the use of traditional cab services in light of increased competition from Uber and other services. The discount follows shortly after digital dispatch service Uber’s decision to permanently slash UberX fare prices by 15 percent effective Aug. 18. As the D.C. Taxicab Commission standardizes D.C. taxicab fares, Hailo will pay out of pocket for this temporary program, though the company did not specify an end date for the promotion.
“It would appear that Hailo is attempting to compete on price to drive customer demand,” D.C. Taxicab Commission spokesperson Neville Waters said.
The app currently operates in five metropolitan areas in the United States, including a location that encompasses Washington, D.C., and its suburbs in Arlington, Va., Alexandria, Va., and Prince George’s County, Md. The company competes against both traditional cab companies such as Curb and Yellow Taxi and ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft.
While ordering a cab through Hailo dispatches a standard D.C. taxi driver, Uber and Lyft dispatch drivers in their personal vehicles. According to Hailo North America Co-President Kevin Hatfield, Hailo is the more secure option because of the rigid licensing procedures in place for taxicab drivers, while Uber has recently come under fire for not properly screening its drivers.
“We think of it as creative disruption,” Hatfield said to In the Capital. “The push is to be fair and equitable with fully licensed drivers.”
Hatfield added that Hailo targets customers who prefer taxis over private vehicles, as Uber and Lyft have faced challenges from city councils for being an unlicensed taxi service.
Publicity for the promotion included an appearance from Jimmy McMillan, who rose to fame in New York as the founder of the Rent Is Too Damn High Party, on Sept. 8 in front of the Verizon Center.
Students offered mixed reactions to the promotion.
Justin Abello (COL ’17) said he felt his familiarity with Uber would keep him loyal to the service.
“I don’t think Hailo’s fare cut will really affect or change my preference for riding Uber,” Abello said. “I’d definitely look into it, but I’d still probably use Uber because my friends and I have all been active users of it so far.”
On the other hand, Gayoung Jeong (SFS ’16) expressed enthusiasm for the discount program but added that the timing of the discount was less attractive for students, compared to other prospective users of the app.
“Even though I usually find the need for a cab or Uber in the evenings, if I have to go out somewhere during the times when the discounts are in effect, I’d definitely consider ordering a cab,” Jeong said. “It’d be better, though, to offer the same discount prices during evening rides.”

Rev. John W. Padberg, S.J., delivered a lecture in Dahlgren Chapel to mark the 200th anniversary of the restoration of the Society of Jesus on Thursday afternoon. Padberg delineated the history and evolution of the Jesuit community in the United States, and highlighted how the suppression of the Jesuits impacted the development of the society.
Padberg is director and editor of the Institute of Jesuit Sources in St. Louis, Mo., which has published numerous books on the history and spirituality of the Society of Jesus. From 1975 to 1985, he served as president of Weston Jesuit School of Theology, a national theological center in Cambridge, Mass. He also served as founding president of the international Conference of Catholic Theological Institutions.
The lecture was the first in a series of lectures that are planned to further address Jesuit history and spread its core values. Vice President of Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., introduced the lecture, which he believes will foster a greater interest in faith on campus.
“We inaugurate the first of the many sacred lectures to come, on a range of topics which, as in days of old, construct and instruct and encourage our faith,” O’Brien said.
University President John J. DeGioia, who spoke at the event, emphasized the paramount significance that Jesuit values and history have on the Georgetown community.
“Without the persistence of the early Jesuits who endured suppression and the restoration, Georgetown would not be here and live to this day,” DeGioia said. “It is a privilege for Georgetown to be a part of this living, enduring tradition.”
In his lecture, Padberg highlighted the main reason for the suppression of the Society of Jesus in the late 18th century.
“Nationalists and regalists saw the Jesuits as an obstacle to establishing the church as an instrument of the state and subordinating it,” Padberg added.
Padberg discussed the three phases to Jesuit history — suppression, first informal phase of restoration and formal restoration. Suppression occurred mainly from 1759 until 1773, during which the Society of Jesus was outlawed and more than half the members of the society were dismissed. In 1814, the pope restored the Society of Jesus.
Although many Jesuits were suppressed, Jesuits today consider this period as an important stepping stone that placed the Society of Jesus on a path to spread their values farther than before.
“Suppression was good for us. It was good for us as a church,” assistant professor of history Rev. David Collins, S.J., said. “It transitioned us from a mission to a church.”
Archbishop John Carroll, S.J., the founder of Georgetown, lived among the few Jesuits after the suppression, He was disappointed by the status of the Society of Jesus in the United States and began forming groups and meetings to systematically organize a church and a society.
“A group of priests begin meeting in White Marsh, which is currently Washington, D.C. They tried to figure out what this new church would look like. They decided there to establish Georgetown and other educational institutions,” Collins said. “This is where everything started and began to expand.”
The informal restoration of the Jesuit society transitioned to a formal restoration in 1814. Conversations about how to organize and expand the Society of Jesus took place, and exiled Jesuits from Europe swarmed to America to help the cause.
“Suppression placed us on an apostle trajectory,” Collins said. “Suppression and restoration were among the best things that could have happened to us.”

The Georgetown University Student Association created a Multicultural Council this year to foster a robust interaction with cultural groups on campus.
The Multicultural Council played a large role in the platform of current GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) during the executive race this past spring. Tezel and Jikaria placed an emphasis on giving a larger voice to students and organizations representing cultural diversity on campus.
According to Multicultural Council Chair Eng Gin Moe (SFS ’16), GUSA has not always reflected Georgetown’s cultural diversity, with certain cultural groups lacking full representation.
“Student government, by definition, is supposed to represent each and every single person on our campus,” Moe wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We, however, see that cultural groups and the multicultural community have not been well-represented in the policies and mindset of past GUSA administrations.”
The council is comprised of six representatives, chosen based on their prominence in their respective cultural communities.
“We are also in constant interaction with people from those [cultural] communities,” Deputy Chair Rodrigo Gonzalez (SFS ’15) said.”The Multicultural Council has six representatives and we pick those representatives based on their involvement in their communities. … And we pick in order to really connect with those groups and with those people.”
Ayodele Aruleba (COL ’17) is a representative from the African Society of Georgetown,
“My experience as a coordinator on the council has been great because I get to interact with a group of student leaders that put great value on working with cultural groups and the greater campus community to bring the issues surrounding multiculturalism and diversity on campus to the forefront of Georgetown,” Aruleba wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Any cultural group on campus is also able to choose a representative to take part in council meetings to speak about any issues their group is facing.
“Each group commits one person, one of their own in the community, to come to a larger group meeting where hopefully every single cultural group at Georgetown will be represented and then can air their opinions about the state of things,” Gonzalez said.
The council also seeks to help with collaboration by serving as a resource for each cultural group, including providing guidance for event planning. At the beginning of this semester, the council worked with Welcome Week to put on the World’s Fair, a major collaborative event between cultural groups on campus.
“We put them in contact with the people they want to talk to and then hopefully they’ll put on a great event and it will be for the better off of the greater Georgetown community,” Gonzalez said.
One main issue that the council plans to change this year is the Student Activities Commission’s funding structure. Currently, SAC dedicates 40 percent of each student group’s budget for food events, which according to Moe, can be problematic.
“This food calculator can hurt cultural groups for two reasons,” Moe wrote. “First, cultural groups usually have food at a higher percentage of their events due to the importance of food to many different cultures. Secondly, cultural food can and often does cost more than Domino’s pizza. As a result of these two issues, the low priority on food can be a barrier to cultural groups.”
According to Moe, the council is working with Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson to create a group that may create cultural funding group.
The council hopes to make concrete changes over the course of the semester, according to Gonzalez.
“The aim is for this to not be all talk,” Gonzalez said. They plan to have continuous interactions through four biweekly working groups that deal with topics such as academics, funding, student life and cross-cultural collaboration.”
Brilliantly British Club President Beatrice Fabris (COL ’16), along with other club leaders, gave feedback to the Multicultural Council throughout its development and said that she is hopeful about the role the new council will play on campus.
“We think it’s a great idea to promote cultural engagement, particularly with all the diverse cultures that Georgetown has to offer and especially because every culture has its own sort of regimented tradition and what have you, it’s nice that there is a unifying body that in theory is representing us all,” Fabris said.
Aruleba said that the council allows student clubs to have more of a voice in student government and on campus.
“The Multicultural Council has done a very good job in giving people who are a part of cultural clubs unparalleled access to the leaders within GUSA,” Aruleba said. “Having people who are involved within the various cultural communities around campus as a part GUSA has created a line of communication that will continue to be an integral part of the success of the Multicultural Council.” 
 Correction: A previous version of this article stated the Multicultural Council hosted the World’s Fair. The Council worked with Welcome Week to put on the fair, but was not a host.
