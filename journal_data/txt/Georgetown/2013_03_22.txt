Nearly four years after University President John J. DeGioia launched an Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness, the university’s senior administration — composed of deans and executive leaders, including the provost and vice presidents — remains dominated by white males.
Of the 13 individuals listed under executive leadership on the university website, three are women and one is black — making the executive leadership 77 percent male and 92 percent white.
Of the 12 deans, two are black and one is Asian. Walsh School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster is the only female dean.
In total, of the 25 top administrators at Georgetown, four are women, three are black and one is Asian.
The representation of women in the senior administration is much lower than in the student body, of which 55 percent is female as of spring 2011.
The racial breakdown of the senior administration, however, is roughly equal to that of the student body, with the notable exception of the lack of Hispanics in the senior administration, which make up seven percent of the student body. As of spring 2011, 61 percent of Georgetown students were white, 7 percent Hispanic, 6 percent black and 9 percent Asian.
The senior administration of The George Washington University shows greater gender diversity. Three of their nine vice presidents and three out of the 10 deans are women.
However, GWU lags behind in racial diversity. Currently, the university has two black vice presidents but no deans of any racial minority.
Jamie Martines (SFS ’13), director of outreach for Georgetown University Women in Politics, noted that while an increasing number of women across the nation are receiving college degrees and promotions to middle-management positions, few successfully reach the highest echelons of their respective organizations.
Martines believes that the Georgetown should make it a priority to increase female representation.
“I hope that in the future, Georgetown will look at the resources available to women who are looking to advance their careers and make sure that the university is doing everything it can to make the playing field as even as possible for everyone,” she said.
Despite the disconnect between the representation of women in the student body and in the senior administration, Rosemary Kilkenny, vice president for institutional diversity and equity, points to recent additions of women to the administration, such as the hiring of Lisa Davis as the vice president of University Information Services, as a bright spot for diversity progress. Davis is the first woman to hold that position.
“Her appointment bodes well for women generally as their representation grows in science and technology fields,” Kilkenny said.
With the student population of the Georgetown University School of Medicine now 51 percent female, Kilkenny believes that Davis’ appointment indicates the university’s acknowledgement that more women will be pursuing careers in science and technology.
Kilkenny also said she found recent trends to be promising for racial diversity, noting the hiring of two black deans, David Thomas of the McDonough School of Business and Edward Montgomery of the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, and Martin Iguchi, an Asian, as the dean of the School of Nursing and Health Studies.
Within executive leadership, however, Kilkenny remains the only black administrator.
Kilkenny identified two of Georgetown’s core values — community in diversity and social justice — as driving factors in the university’s pursuit of institutional diversity.
“These values are reflected in efforts undertaken by the university not only to recruit women and minority persons to all sectors of our community but also to retain individuals from these groups and provide an environment in which they can thrive, succeed and grow,” she said. “We recognize that we are not a perfect institution, but we remain aspirational in our goals and do the best that we can to embody [these] deep-held and deep-felt values. The university will continue to pursue this course in a collaborative, energetic and aggressive manner.”
Aya Waller-Bey (COL ’14), co-chair for the Student of Color Alliance, remains unconvinced of the school’s dedication to this initiative.
“The lack of diversity within the senior administration is frightening but not shocking,” Waller-Bey said. “I think Georgetown needs to reevaluate its commitment to diversity in all areas and aggressively pursue the recruitment of more diverse administrators to assist with making decisions on this campus.”
Martines agreed, saying that the university’s decision-making bodies should represent student interests.
“Students need to feel like their interests are being represented at the highest levels of university administration,” she said. “If the diversity of the student population is not reflected at the highest levels of decision making, then something needs to change.”
Jacqueline Mac, program coordinator at the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, echoed the sentiment for diversity among leadership.
“It is important to me to see senior administrators who look like me, to serve as role models,” Mac said. “In my work with CMEA, I think about whose voices have traditionally been silenced and unheard, and I think about how to ensure that they are included. I encourage my students to do the same because being inclusive means having a place and a voice at the table.”

The university revealed pending plans to construct a dorm across from Reiss Science Building at two planning sessions on Tuesday with design firm Sasaki Strategies and developer Forrest City Enterprises.
The plan will likely replace the university’s original proposal to convert the Leavey Hotel and Conference Center into student housing.
“The more we explored it, the more roadblocks we encountered,” Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said. “It met the idea of expediency, but it didn’t meet the long-term goal of what would be the best student life available.”
Morey also cited the hotel’s strong cash flow as a contributing factor to the decision to abandon the project.
In the planning session, Morey and other university administrators proposed seven potential locations but noted that the site across from Reiss, which would be triangular in design to match the shape of the plot of land and feature glass facades, is the frontrunner.
Plans to build the dorm on campus are part of the university’s effort to meet the requirement of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement that 90 percent of students be housed on campus by fall 2015.
Some members of the audience were concerned that the new dorm would eliminate open spaces on campus.
“Of the things you’ve presented today, the thing I hate is the triangular new dorm [across from Reiss],” Yates Field House Director Jim Gilroy (COL ’72) said. “Somebody brought up the need for more energy on campus. I don’t think we need more energy. The idea of building another canyon to walk through for more energy — I just don’t see it.”
Sasaki Strategies Director Gregory Janks acknowledged Gilroy’s concerns but said that he was confident that the plans would leave all parties satisfied.
“I think if we have a very nuanced, very sensitive, very thoughtful design approach, we really think that there are possibilities to…advance and enliven the space. The building can make a significant contribution,” Janks said. “The overall point is each site has its challenges and opportunities, and of the 100 people in the room I’m sure there would be 100 different opinions about what would be the best site.”
Administrators also proposed repurposing student group offices in the Leavey Center for student housing, a plan that former GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) criticized.
“Granted, currently, [Leavey] isn’t structured very well to actually accomplish the goal of being a center for student life, and there’s a lot more long-term planning that would need to go into that, and so I agree with what was said about using other spaces currently to be more expeditious about getting more beds on campus,” Gustafson said. “I really, really do not like trying to convert offices because a lot of those offices are the only student offices on campus.”
Gustafson added that the New South Student Center renovation would already put additional pressure on organizations to find office or meeting space.
The other proposed options were to expand Henle Village or Southwest Quad, purchase the emptyKober Cogan Building — which has been vacant since May 2010 because of hazardous levels of mold following a steam leak — from MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and to construct dorms on the parking lot by McDonough Gymnasium or on Harbin Plaza.

While Pope Francis was installed as the 266th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church on Tuesday, University President John J. DeGioia watched proudly among the U.S. presidential delegation to the Vatican.
“I don’t know what I did to deserve the honor,” DeGioia said. “It was an incredible honor to join the vice president and the delegation.”
Over 100 official national delegations attended the Mass, including the U.S. group, which was led by Vice President Joe Biden and included House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Governor Susana Martinez (R-N.M.) and DeGioia, all of whom are Catholic.
DeGioia said that his selection may have been related to Francis being the first Jesuit pope and Georgetown’s status as the oldest American Jesuit university.
“It’s one way of acknowledging the role we’ve played in America over these last 225 years,” he said. “I view it more as I was invited because of my role and that it was really Georgetown that was being acknowledged here.”
DeGioia learned of Francis’ elevation while in New York for meetings about the Big East realignment and was notified shortly thereafter that he was being considered for the delegation.
“The next day, I had a voicemail on my phone and I listened to it, and it was Vice President Biden, and I said, ‘Oh, I’d better call back,’” DeGioia said.
DeGioia boarded Air Force Two on Sunday morning to fly to Vatican City and toured St. Peter’s Basilica with Pelosi while in Rome. He also accompanied Pelosi during meetings with diplomats and met with Laura Boldrini, the president of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, a house in the Italian legislature He also met with Georgetown alumni and Americans studying at the American Academy in Rome.
On Tuesday, DeGioia watched as Pope Francis greeted a crowd of at least 200,000 in St. Peter’s Square for his installation. The pope spent about half an hour making his way through the crowd, blessing many of the babies and the disabled at the barriers.
The new pope then led a Mass and gave a homily about St. Joseph as a protector and the duty that all leaders have as protectors of their people and of creation. He urged the audience to serve with goodness and tenderness.
“It was a very moving experience,” DeGioia said of the Mass. “It was more of a visual experience in the sense of just watching and seeing how he carried himself. But then I had a chance to read the homily, and what I think is most powerful is that he chose the Feast of St. Joseph as the day for his first mass. You see the convergence right now of a whole bunch of dimensions from his background.”
DeGioia added that the event seemed to be simple and low-key when he first took it in and that he was ultimately touched by the message Francis delivered to the audience, which focused on the fundamental need to serve.
“The key message is this message that St. Joseph was a protector and for all of us to protect one another and through protecting one another, the Church,” DeGioia said. “That’s a very powerful message for where the Church is right now.”
According to Chester Gillis, a theologian and Dean of Georgetown College, this message indicates the direction in which Francis seems to want to take the Church.
“Do I think he’s going to be a really progressive pope theologically? No,” Gillis said. “But his personal values are just terrific. Just look at the impression he’s made. … He’s let out some of the air of the pomp and circumstance of Rome.”
However, Gillis added that Francis would soon face difficulties when he tries to exercise his freedom.
“People in these positions are stressed. He’s going to find out how demanding the papacy really is,” Gillis said. “Everybody notices every move. I hope he has his humility and his openness and his passion, but my suspicion is he’ll have to do less of that as he goes along — not because he doesn’t want to but because the job is so commanding.”
Gillis also noted that Francis may face some opposition from the historically powerful and hierarchical establishment in Rome if he seeks to reform the Church’s structure.
Fr. John O’Malley, S.J., a history professor, said that Francis’ history as archbishop of Buenos Aires as well as Jesuit novice master should help him motivate the Church to better itself. O’Malley said that Francis made his attitude clear through his homily.
“I think he was sending a message of basics and a message of where Catholicism, I think, is strongest and has a wonderful leadership role in the present,” O’Malley said. “Mainly, peace, the environment and care for marginalized, sick and poor. … He kind of suggested that we’re all in this together.”
The diversity of the audience at the Inauguration reinforced the notion of community and togetherness. Among others, Pope Francis warmly welcomed Argentine President Christina Kirchner, with whom he has had a strained relationship in the past, and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, the first Greek Orthodox Patriarch to attend a papal inauguration since 1054.
Both O’Malley and Gillis said that this signaled a willingness to engage in international and interreligious dialogue and that his message applied to leaders both secular and Christian.
DeGioia said that this attitude opened the door for discussion and reflection on the flight home.
“The vice president came back and spent quite a bit of the flight talking to us about things,” DeGioiasaid. “He really wanted to talk about issues we were wrestling with here at Georgetown.”
DeGioia added that the delegation was truly grateful to have taken part in such an historic occasion.
“To be there for this purpose — for this moment — was such an incredible honor,” DeGioia said. “I don’t think they could’ve picked four people more appreciative.”

The history of LGBTQ organizations both at Georgetown and the Law Center is one of lawsuits, setbacks and perseverance. To gain university recognition, GU Pride launched a lawsuit that was decided by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in 1987. And OutLaw, theLGBT organization at the Law Center, commemorated the25th anniversary of the court decision mandating its recognition at an event Wednesday evening.
Frank Liao (LAW ’13), current president of Georgetown Law’s OutLaw, an LGBTQ student group, opened the event by noting the growth of his organization. With more than 150 members, OutLaw hosts regular events to discuss contentious issues, such as their most recent debate on bisexuality and public policy.
“The last 25 years have brought us a lot of positive changes, including a very supportive administration,” Liao said. “All of this change began with one case.”
Law Center Dean William Treanor said that Georgetown has progressed in its commitment to gay rights in ways that he said were inconceivable in 1980, when the lawsuit was launched. He emphasized the critical role of faculty in supporting the LGBT student groups at the time despite warnings that the effort was futile.
“Where we are today is a product of history, is a product of courage, is a product of leadership,” Treanor said.
The event, which was sponsored by the Georgetown Journal of Gender and the Law, consisted of a discussion of the case and two panels. The first panel, “History of Gay Rights Coalition,” reviewed the proceedings leading up to the lawsuit. Lorri Jean (LAW ’82) was the leading student plaintiff during the case. She is currently CEO of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, the world’s largest LGBT organization, and was named one of the 50 most powerful LGBT people in the nation and one of the 100 most influential people in Los Angeles. Today the Law Center gives an award to graduating students for excellence in service to the LGBT community in honor of Jean’s efforts.
Jean said that this “true David and Goliath story” began when fellow student Clinton Hockenberry approached her about starting a group for gay students at the law school. When University President Fr. Timothy Healy, S.J., vetoed approval of the organization, Jean and Hockenberry hired a lawyer to defend their rights as protected by the D.C. Human Rights Act. The court ruled against them.
“I was surprised to find that while there were many gay and lesbian students, only three of us were out and there was no LGBT organization,” Jean said. “Honestly we didn’t even realize this was going to result in legal action at all, let alone a law suit that would last almost nine years.”
Despite trepidation, Jean and Hockenberry decided to appeal the decision. But the hostility did not end in the courtroom. There were several reports of violence and assaults on campus against those involved in the case as well as accusations that they caused a rise in cost of tuition. Jean said she received many threatening messages.
“Had we realized then all the forces that were aligned against us, the struggles we would have, the cost, the backlash we would face, much of it fomented by Georgetown’s administration, I don’t know if we would have had the courage,” Jean said. “The case and its history are important. They shouldn’t be forgotten or minimized just because it may be painful. It is an indisputable fact that the history of this case is not a positive reflection upon the history of Georgetown. But much of what the university is doing these days is, including this symposium.”
The case focused on a failure to agree on the distinction between recognition and endorsement.
Tensions continued to be high during the appellate process, during which Richard Gross, lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the Gay Rights Coalition at the appellate level, filed for contempt and suggested that Healy be arrested for failure of compliance.
Gross said that the ugly battle was worth their efforts when the D.C. Court of Appeals eventually ruled that Georgetown could not deny gay student groups the same resources as other student organizations.
During the panel, Gross said he has never been so proud to have worked on any case as a lawyer. He remembers the celebration he held once the case had been settled.
“When they left my son asked, ‘Dad that was a great party. Where were the gay people?’ And I thought that was a wonderful summary of what we had begun to achieve at that point,” Gross said.
GU Pride President Meghan Ferguson (COL ’15) attended an event on Tuesday where Jean also spoke about her experiences.
“Until this point, few people knew what really happened during the lawsuit and what it was like for the students involved; we as LGBTQ students at Georgetown were missing that crucial part of our history,” Ferguson wrote in an email. “Now that we better know the struggles that students before us went through, we can appreciate where we are now, but also recognize that we are a part of a legacy of student activism around LGBTQ issues that got us to where we are now, and that we need to continue in order to make this campus as safe and open as possible.”

While local gourmet grocery Dean & Deluca attracted media attention when it was forced to close its doors because of a high number of critical health code violations, it is not the only area restaurant to have performed poorly on Department of Health inspections in the past year.
Booeymonger, Wingo’s and Los Cuates, all popular local dining destinations for Georgetown students, were among those cited for critical health code violations within the past year.
Booeymonger, a sandwich shop located at 3265 Prospect St. NW, was cited for four critical health violations in 2012, all of which were corrected on site.
“They cited us for food contact service area cleanliness,”Booeymonger’s manager Punny Wellaje said. “We clean the surfaces every night. … When [the inspector] came in, we were busy.”
Los Cuates on 1564 Wisconsin Ave. NW was cited for ten critical and 14 noncritical violations last April, of which five and three, respectively, were corrected on site. The citations included improper food temperatures, mold in the ice machine and cleaning solutions’ being stored in between food items, among others.
“The key is keeping clean,” restaurant manager Luis Merchant said. “The work areas have to be cleaned after every shift.”
Wingo’s, located at 3207 O St. NW, was cited for four critical health violations in March 2012, including improper holding temperatures, lack of proper date labels and improper food separation — all of which the restaurant was able to correct on site.
None of those businesses had to close their doors in light of the health inspections because most of their critical violations could be corrected on site. Food establishments that have six or more critical violations that cannot be corrected on site must be shut down, according to DOH policy.
After a routine health inspection in early February revealed eight critical and eleven noncritical violations, Dean & Deluca, which is located at 3276 M St. NW, was forced to close until it could correct those violations.
Among the grocery’s citations were those for including proper cooling procedures, rodent droppings and improperly installed plumping and toilet facilities.
The deli layout was rearranged and the store opened the following day, although the outdoor cafe remained closed. Katy Foley, an account director at Michelle Lehmann Communications, which represents Dean & Deluca, later cited nearby construction as the main cause of the health violations in a statement.
Wellaje did not believe that the construction outside Dean & Deluca excused the violations.
“If you have violations, it doesn’t matter what is going on outside,” Wellaje said.
Mike Arthur, manager of Wingo’s on 3207 O St. NW, felt much the same way.
“We had major construction [on O Street], and … the rats are everywhere,” Arthur said. “You have to have all your trash in containers. You have to wash, to keep everything clean. You can’t give them a reason to come into your store.”
Arthur believes Dean & Deluca is blaming construction for a far larger issue — food cleanliness.
“Dean & Deluca, if you’ve been in it, there’s food everywhere. There’s stuff on the floor,” Arthur said. “It’s not a good excuse that construction turned up the rats — no, they were there the whole time. I’m sure they had lunch all the time there.”
While health inspections can be tedious, Arthur believes that they are ultimately beneficial for restaurant owners and the public alike.
“I want them to come,” Arthur said. “I think a health inspection every day would be great. I have no problem with them coming to Wingo’s because we’re doing everything right.”

The Obama administration unveiled a new policy in support of open access to federally funded research Feb. 22.
The policy requires all federal agencies with annual expenditures over $100 million to make the results of their research open and free to the public within twelve months of publication.
Although Georgetown faculty and staff consider the new policy an ideological success, some did not believe that the measure would enhance the quality of their own research or cut costs associated with purchasing scientific journals.
“We [taxpayers] paid for this research,” Gwen Owens, head of Blommer Science Library, said. “It should be available to the public, but it doesn’t affect how Georgetown is going to be buying our journals.”
Chemistry Department Chair YuYe Tong agreed.
“Overall I think it’s a great idea because all of the research is supported by taxpayer money and in principle should be made available free for people,” Tong said.
For faculty, however, the new policy does not do enough to improve access in a constantly transforming field.
“The National Science Foundation originally really wanted deposits within six months, and publishers really objected to that,” Owens said. “When you’re working in the sciences, not to be able to get your hands on something for a year is just too long a time to wait.”
Because of the time sensitive nature of scientific research, Georgetown libraries will continue to subscribe to the same journals they did before the new policy went into place.
One potential benefit to the measure, however, will be the increased opportunities for recognition for faculty.
“Some studies show that the more accessible your journal articles are, the more frequently they’re cited. The frequency of citations is a way people use to evaluate an author’s work,” Owens said.
He doubted, however, that the policy would address journal costs, whose increase in recent years have caused her concern. From 2006 to 2011, the price that Georgetown paid on average for a chemistry journal subscription increased by over 24 percent while that for a biology journal shot up by over 40 percent.
“It might cut into [the science publishing companies’] market a little bit, but the large research institutions are still going to have to have the cutting-edge research as it’s published,” Owens said.
In the last fifteen years, a few companies within the journal publishing industry, such as Elsevier and Wiley, have gained huge market power.
Owens said that the move to publishing journals online has forced smaller journals that do not have the infrastructure to publish electronically to approach large publishing firms for assistance.
The reduction in the number of firms is one reason that Georgetown pays around $6,000 to $7,000 per journal subscription.
“There’s a lot of consolidation going on, and it’s getting pretty scary because within about five years, I would say that 80 to 90 percent of the scientific publishing is going to be in the hands of four or five big publishers,” Owens said.
Richard Weiss, a professor in the chemistry department and an editor of the American Chemical Society Journal, thought the new policy might generate more uproar from the largest scientific publishers.
“The publishers are the ones who are going to scream and cry and complain [over the policy],” Weiss said. “Places that will probably suffer most will be the for-profits because they will no longer be able to withhold their information.”
Weiss cited smaller institutions that cannot afford expensive general subscriptions among the categories of the public who would benefit from the policy.
However, he agreed with Owens that the rising cost of scientific journals would likely continue to be a problem.
“There’s a lot of money to be made in the scientific publishing industry, and as long as there’s a lot of money to be made, there will be people who will try to find a way around whatever restrictions are placed upon them,” Weiss said.

Though they do not play on varsity teams, six freshmen are focusing their free time entirely on sports through the Georgetown Sports Analysis, Business and Research Group.
According to founder and President Nik Oza (MSB ’16), the club will educate students about sports analysis, which uses statistics to explain and predict different aspects of sports, such as the success of individual plays during a game and player draft and salary decisions.
“It’s just objective framing of sports and objective data, not necessarily going with your gut,” Oza said. “It’s trying to look at what is actually happening, what are the trends, how do you apply probabilistic thinking, how do you devise some statistics modeling techniques and find out what’s actually going on.”
The group will work with the Cawley Career Education Center to provide internship opportunities, conduct independent statistics research, send members to conferences discussing sports analysis and regularly update a sports analysis blog.
Oza founded the club in January and hopes to gain recognition by the Student Activities Commission next semester.
“All throughout the college process, I was thinking whatever college I chose that didn’t have a sports analysis or business club I would start that because that’s what I want to do,” Oza said. “Georgetown’s kind of a unique situation because we have the sports management master’s program and we have sports marketing in the business school for undergrads, but we don’t actually have an undergrad group yet.”
The club currently has 15 active members and about 40 names on its Listserv.
Oza is the only club member with significant experience in sports analytics, though members expressed their desire to learn more about the subject.
“What we’re hoping to be able to do is think for ourselves and put out some analysis of our own and form our own opinions. I think that’s why I got involved, to be a thinker in the sports world and not just a reader,” Vice President of Communications Peter Barston (MSB ’16), also a sports columnist for The Hoya, said. “A lot of us are in that same position where we’re kind of new to the whole analysis, which I think makes it such a great opportunity because we’re breaking in, we have a real passion for it and we’re learning as we go along.”
According to Oza, many club members are seriously considering a career in sports analysis, which could entail conducting team-side analysis, working for a league, doing market and data analysis, getting involved in the fantasy sports industry or pursuing the new industries opened up by new media and technology, such as tablets.
“I think that the best part of this is that we all have a passion for this, and this is what a lot of us want to do,” Knuth said. “We want to get into the sports industry because it’s not going to stop growing, and this club has such a great future because there is such a high demand for it.”
A career in sports analysis is a good alternative for sports fanatics who do not have the athletic ability to actually play, club blog writer Carl Yedor (COL ’16) said.
“Growing up, I played a lot of sports, but I didn’t necessarily get the athletic ability to actually make it in the big leagues, so I wanted to be involved in some way,” Yedor said. “Getting involved with analytics is a great way to try and get yourself down the path to maybe being a general manager for a team, and maybe in the box rather than looking at the guy in the box.”
According to Vice President of Technology Xavier Weisenreder (COL ’16), sports analysis is still a relatively new field that only began to seriously develop in the 1990s.
“Pre-1990s, it was just people who were kind of involved with the sport but weren’t really thinking analytically, more thinking with what they see, so this is really a new trend in analytics and the qualitative side to sports,” Weisenreder said.
Board members said the club could go in many different directions.
“We don’t want to seem intimidating with any of the advanced statistics because we’re really just starting off, and we’re just looking for anybody,” Weisenreder said. “We’re looking for people who are passionate about it, who want to learn about it and who can work with us to get off the ground. We’re really open to anything.”

With GeorgetownX — Georgetown’s component of Harvard’s online learning platform edX — scheduled to launch with two massive open online courses next fall, the university has arranged to fund the program through fundraising channels targeting education and technology.
While Harvard has focused its capital campaign on edX, Georgetown will not fundraise for the program through either the annual fund or the Campaign for Georgetown, according to Vice President for Advancement R. Bartley Moore (SFS ’87).
The university, like its edX partners — which include Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — is currently contributing funds to the program, which is still in its initial stages.
“Each of the member institutions is expected to fund a … designated level of advancement in the edXplatform,” Moore said.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said that information about the amount of Georgetown’s contribution is not available.
Provost Robert Groves emphasized the importance of increased fundraising for edX.
“All consortium schools can benefit from faster software development and improved services made possible from more staff resources,” Groves wrote in an email.
University administrators believe that the benefits of edX, including other universities’ contributions to the program, are worth the additional cost to Georgetown.
“We impart now, as a newer member, from all the commitment that [Harvard and MIT] already made,” Moore said.
Groves agreed.
“While there is no direct revenue, as a partner, Georgetown benefits from the technology created as part of the platform and the sharing of data on how students learn best,” Groves wrote.
According to Moore, the university’s two new major technology initiatives — the Initiative on Technology Enhanced Learning and the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship — andedX are interconnected. CNDLS supports ITEL, which in turn supports edX.
“The investment we make in ITEL will directly complement the effort that the university is making to generate edX-ready curriculum and content,” Moore said. “[ITEL] focuses on accelerating and broadening the way in which the university’s existing curriculum incorporates new methods, including technology enabled methods, to enhance and enliven the learning experience for students inside and outside the classroom.”
According to Moore, most of Georgetown’s contributions to edX come from targeted donor outreach. Traditional fundraising methods, like alumni giving through the annual fund or the capital campaign, are more focused on student life and scholarships.
“Development officers, employed by the university, cultivate relationships with donors, actual and prospective, and then solicit them for gifts,” Moore said.
Moore added that these gifts tend to be larger and span multiple years.
However, convincing alumni — used to the traditional, intimate classroom learning experience — to donate to an online platform open to thousands can be difficult, Moore said.
“We still have a lot to learn about how the university’s donors will embrace something like edX,” Moore said. “The university’s commitment to it is full and unqualified, but we are finding that it takes a lot of education and a lot of conversation to sufficiently familiarize alumni and other donors to edX so they understand fully how it fits into the future of the university and our vision for it.”
Moore added that CNDLS and ITEL’s success indicate promise for edX.
“What we have found … is that when we talk about CNDLS and ITEL about getting the maximum benefit and leverage of technology for the more familiar, on-campus learning experience that so many of our donors recall so fondly, they react very favorably to that because they want Georgetown to continue to be among one of the very best in higher education in terms of the quality of the student learning experience,” Moore said.
Some alumni expressed this hesitation to donate to something unfamiliar.
“[I’ll] probably watch and perhaps participate in the experience myself before I give money to the program,” Joanna Wilson-Choi (SFS ’02) wrote in an email.
Nevertheless, Moore acknowledged edX’s youth.
“Part of edX is experimentation. It’s about acquiring skills and capacity to deliver teaching and learning effectively online, because we know we are going to have to do more of that in the future and do it very well,” Moore said. “But at the same time, we are going to be figuring out what the relationship of that work is that will remain the core of what we do, which is live, in-person learning on a residential campus.”
Other edX partners include Wellesley College, the University of Toronto, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Texas at Austin, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Australian National University, McGill University, Rice University and Delft University of Technology.

Inspired by their own experiences as prospective students, 250 volunteers will introduce 400 high school seniors to the Hilltop this weekend.
The two-day event is first of three weekends organized by the Georgetown Admissions Ambassadors Program for accepted students. This weekend is for students who have been accepted through early action. GAAP weekends for students accepted through regular decision will be held April 12-13 and April 19-20.
Emma Spicci (MSB ’16), who attended a GAAP weekend last spring, said the warmth and positivity she noticed in Georgetown students when she visited prompted her to join GAAP this year. She will be greeting prospective students and leading tours.
“My own GAAP weekend was what convinced me that Georgetown was the place for me. Every student I met greeted me with a smile and was always willing to provide helpful advice,” Spicci said. “Just as my GAAP weekend persuaded me that I wanted to be part of the Georgetown community, I hope I can convince other future Hoyas to join us as well.”
According to GAAP faculty advisors and admissions officers Rob O’Rourke (COL ’07) and SarahHadjian (COL ’11), nearly 1,200 prospective students attend the weekends in total, approximately 70 percent of whom subsequently decide to attend Georgetown.
“There are so many great aspects about Georgetown it almost sells itself, but it’s our job to coordinate all of those resources and put them all together to make one cohesive weekend to showcase Georgetown,” GAAP Vice President Danny McDonough (SFS ’13) said.
The 13-member GAAP board began planning the weekends last year. Activities will include campus tours, a welcome reception in Gaston Hall, icebreakers, student and parent panels, separate lunches for each school, dorm tours, faculty lectures, a mini-student activities fair and neighborhood tours.
Although GAAP student coordinators work with the admissions office for logistical support, the weekends are entirely student-run.
“We provide logistical support as needed but think it [is] so important for the weekend to reflect the vision of our students, who are so invested in showcasing the best of the Georgetown community,” O’Rourke and Hadjian wrote in an email.
GAAP volunteers do everything from blowing up balloons to sitting on student panels, GAAP President Murphy Kate Delaney (COL ’13) said. Delaney added that volunteers are encouraged to provide participants with genuine reflections on their Georgetown experiences.
“The GAAP volunteers are really giving their honest perspective of Georgetown,” Delaney said. “They’re genuine students who are extremely passionate about the Hilltop”
Student volunteers participate to share their Georgetown experiences with future students.
“I’m the kind of kid who was not 100 percent sure about coming to Georgetown because I just didn’t know a lot about it,” Andrew Lyu (SFS ’16), who will run icebreaker groups and give tours this weekend, said. “The whole idea of a Catholic school scared me and my friends and my parents. The whole vibe at Georgetown was not what I expected, but I love it, and I want to be able to share that with people who are considering Georgetown in the future.”
GAAP publicity captain Paige Johnston (MSB ’16) said she aims to convince prospective students that Georgetown is a good fit for them.
“I want them to have the same feeling that I had that you’re making the right choice by choosing Georgetown,” Johnston said.
Along with organizing GAAP weekends, the GAAP board is responsible for calling accepted students, organizing online chat forums, holding winter receptions and managing the GAAP Facebook group for the incoming class.
Many freshmen who attended GAAP last year said it was what convinced them to commit to the school.
“I think Georgetown did a really good job of presenting the school in a way that you feel like it would be like your home, like you would belong,” Jennifer Da (COL ’16) said.
Meg Franzetti (COL ’16) said that GAAP’s emphasis on Georgetown’s unique location in D.C. was what convinced her.
“They gave this one speech about not going to a liberal arts college in the middle of nowhere. They said that Georgetown’s in the middle of everything, and that’s why you should come,” Meg Franzetti(COL ’16) said. “It was just a lot of high energy, and that’s when I first met some of the people that would be my classmates, and I fell in love with it.”
