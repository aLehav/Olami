After a storm of criticism from Catholic organizations, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius’ speech to the Georgetown Public Policy Institute drew a small protest and a heckler Friday morning.
Sebelius, whose department drafted the Obama administration’s controversial contraceptive coverage mandate, spoke about the importance of making tough public policy decisions in order to move America forward.
“Ultimately, public policy is about making difficult choices,” she said. “People have deeply-held beliefs on all sides of these discussions, and you, as public policy leaders, will be called on to help move these debates forward.”
During the speech, a heckler interrupted Sebelius, shouting, “You’re a murderer!” The protester was quickly removed from the ceremony.
The controversial appearance also sparked a small protest of about 10 participants outside of the front gates of the university. Their signs criticized the university for its departure from Catholic values.
