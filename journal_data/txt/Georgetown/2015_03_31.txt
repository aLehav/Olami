The Office of Undergraduate Admissions accepted 3,202 applicants to the Class of 2019 for an overall acceptance rate of 16.4 percent, a rate that remains steady from the previous year. Decisions for the regular application cycle were mailed out Friday.
Georgetown received 19,481 applications to the Class of 2019. While 912 of the applicants were admitted early, 2,290 were accepted as part of the regular decision process. The overall acceptance rate for both early and regular decision cycles was 16.4 percent, nearly identical to the 16.6 percent acceptance rate for the Class of 2018. While the acceptance rate for the Class of 2015 was 18 percent, the rate has hovered around 16 percent for the last four years.
“We pulled back a little on the early number from the previous year, so it does mean that we would have therefore taken more in the regular decision. But we ended with fewer overall, so there weren’t that many more in the regular rate,”” Deacon said.
Georgetown College and the McDonough School of Business both had acceptance rates below 16 percent. The College accepted 1,839 students at a rate of 15.9 percent, a decline from last year’s 16.3 percent, while the MSB admitted 530 students at a rate of 15.7 percent, lower than last year’s 16 percent. The acceptance rate for the MSB has dropped precipitously since it was 22 percent for the Class of 2014.
The School of Foreign Service accepted 627 students at a rate of 17.6 percent, nearly on par with last year’s 17.5 percent. The School of Nursing and Health Studies accepted 206 students at a rate of 19.7 percent, higher than the 17.5 percent acceptance rate for the Class of 2018.
All 50 states were represented in the accepted class, with at least three from each state except for North Dakota, which had one admit. As happened last year, California, New York and New Jersey were the top three states represented, with 377, 368 and 266 students admitted respectively.
Women comprised 55 percent of the admitted class, while men comprised 45 percent.
In a small increase from last year’s 10 percent, 11 percent of the admitted class self-identified as African-American, while 17 percent identified as Asian-American and 12 percent as Hispanic-African, the same percentages as the previous year.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) said that although the changes were small, college admissions reflected overall changes in the demographics of the country.
“It’s hard to be able to say any dramatic difference from one year to the next. There are some inexorable trends that are under way that continue. To some extent, college admissions in truly national universities is a microcosm of what’s going on out there in the country,” Deacon said. “You’ll see continuing shifting more toward states that are further away and not in the northeast.”
Nine percent of the admitted applicants were foreign citizens, originating from 72 different countries. Last year, admits came from 64 countries. Instead of the notorious thin envelopes of acceptance sent to domestic students, foreign nationals received emails informing them of their acceptance Saturday.
The acceptance rate for the 737 legacy students that applied was 37 percent, consistent with the 36 percent rate for the Class of 2018.
The overall goal for the final size of the class is 1,580, the same as previous years and consistent with the cap of 6,675 undergraduates determined by the 2010 Campus Plan. While the anticipated yield rate for accepted students, or the percentage of admits who decide to attend Georgetown, is 45 percent, Deacon said that interest, determined by number of college visits, among other factors, and likelihood of enrolling were not used as a factor in Georgetown’s admission decisions.
“The most common, disappointing issue is how many colleges are using interest as a factor, so that if they believe you’re not likely to enroll, they won’t admit you because that affects their yield,” Deacon said. “There are fairly elaborate tools that businesses have developed that will model your class out for you and tell you who to admit and not to admit, as opposed to just simply taking the best people, which is what we’re doing.”
Similarly to previous years, Deacon anticipated that 50 to 75 students would be released from the waitlist and approximated based on data from previous years that 1,200 students would initially accept spots on the list.
While schools often enlarge their waitlists as a sugarcoated way of denying applicants, Deacon said that Georgetown did not do so, noting that the average SAT score of students on the Georgetown waitlist was 1429 out of 1600, nearly identical to the average of 1436 for the admitted class.
“One of the trends that we have been seeing this year is that a lot of colleges are putting a lot of people on waitlists,” Deacon said. “[For Georgetown] this is not a polite way of saying no. … By not playing games with the numbers, we have very predictable numbers about how many students we will likely take off the list.”
Waitlisted students will receive final decisions by May 15. Transfer decisions will be released on a rolling basis until June 1. Deacon estimated 150 transfers would be accepted.
Accepted students have the opportunity to visit Georgetown the weekends of April 10 and April 17 as part of open houses run by the Georgetown Admissions Ambassadors Program. Their final enrollment decisions are due May 1.

I find it interesting that either the Hoya – or whoever supplied the graphic – did not bother including the percentage of white students admitted. Why were they not included? What would they have been referred to as? Would they have been referred to as European-Americans or just as white? Let us not forget that people of Asian, Hispanic and African decent have been in this country just as long as those of European decent, if not longer. In a time when the media, government and society has begun the slow process of identifying micro-aggressions towards black americans in particular, perhaps we should also look at how people of all races, colors and ethnicities are identified — what mirco-agressions exist there? Are we trading one for another? Is the notion of attaching the continent someone’s decedents are from to their Americanness as a form of identification, which considered to be politically correct (when we do not do the same for the whites), actually a micro-aggression?

Joe, it’s important to recognize that they did not publish the acceptance rate of any particular race. The chart I’m assuming you’re referring to was showing that 11% of all admitted students were African American, 17% were Asian, and 12% were Hispanic. These are not the acceptance rates for each of these groups.
Secondly, these groups are historically underrepresented minorities, so the intention was to show the effect of diversity initiatives and Georgetown’s efforts to give equal recognition to members of these groups that have faced addition adversity as a result of their race. I’m sure that this is no way an attempt to belittle minorities, but rather show their achievements. In 2010, 26.6% of Hispanic Americans and 27.4% of African Americans lived below the poverty, in contrast with only 9.9% of whites. We should therefore celebrate the accomplishments of those who have had additional hardship in their lives and were able to reach the same levels as those who had a privileged early life.
Let’s not make this into a conversation about the political correctness of racial terminology, and instead focus on the messages that were actually being expressed by the writers.

Are these statistics for the Class of 2019 or 2020?  Are the current seniors the class of 2016?  Juniors, Class of 2017; Sophomores, 2018; Freshman, 2019 and therefore accepted high school seniors would be the class of 2020, right?

Now that women are overrepresented among the undergraduate population, I’m sure the university will take steps to increase diversity and seek more male enrollment.
Males are now a marginalized group on campus, not surprising in today’s PC world.

Shaw Field, home of the Georgetown men’s and women’s soccer teams, got a taste of the international spotlight last week when it hosted Lionel Messi and the rest of the Argentina national soccer team.
For a still undisclosed fee, the team used Georgetown’s facilities Tuesday through Thursday generally during the afternoons in preparation for its friendly exhibition match against El Salvador on Saturday at FedEx Field, which it won 2-0.
As part of the practices, players from Georgetown’s men’s soccer team assisted the training sessions, both as active participants and ball-fetchers.
“It was a tremendous opportunity for our student-athletes to see some of the best players in the world and to have the experience of a lifetime by training with them,” Assistant Athletics Director for Communications Michael Carey wrote in an email.
Hundreds of fans flocked to campus to watch practice and catch a glimpse of their favorite players.
Although Shaw Field was closed to the general public, both students and fans from near and far watched from the perimeter of the field and from the Leavey Esplanade. Prior to practice starting, families played pickup soccer on Kehoe Field and tried to position themselves to get autographs.
The Argentinian national team was the runner-up in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, losing in the final to Germany, but many fans expressed that they were just there to see forward and Argentina captain Messi, the highest-paid player in sports, four-time Ballon d’Or winner and star of FC Barcelona.
“I came to see Messi because he’s the best player in the world,” Alex Marotte, a 14-year-old from Pittsburgh, Pa., said. “Better than any I’ve ever seen.”
Matt Parks (GRD ’16) attended practice Thursday and watched from atop the Leavey Center.
“I just really appreciate that we have one of the best athletes in the world and the runner up in the World Cup here,” Parks said. “It was such a cool experience, even though we were watching from far on the ledge.”
Georgetown has previously hosted the U.S. national men’s soccer team and professional teams from Major League Soccer, including the Los Angeles Galaxy earlier this year.
With so many fans coming to campus to see Messi, the Georgetown University Police Department was faced with security concerns regarding crowd management.
“We were concerned about fans coming to the event since he’s a pretty popular soccer player,” GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber said. “We hired some contingencies to provide security to the perimeter of Shaw Field and for the ingress of the team to the field, and of their outbound leaving the field.”
Despite the security presence, around a dozen fans ran onto the field as the players were preparing to leave, at the end of practice Wednesday. No students were involved in the incident, and no arrests were made.
Max Cohen-Casado (SFS ’18) went to all three days of practice and witnessed the incident on Wednesday.
“I was very upset because the people that ran onto the field got all their jerseys signed, whereas the fans waiting patiently behind the barricade didn’t get anything signed,” Cohen-Casado said. “The fans that ran onto the field didn’t receive any sort of punishment other than being told to leave.”
Following the incident, GUPD increased security for Thursday’s practice, setting up barricades and preventing fans from getting as close to the field.
Despite the increased security, Tatiana Shashou (MSB ’17), who attended Thursday’s practice, described how fans still tried to break through and get on the field.
“It looked like tons of supporters had come far just for Messi, because there was a mix of not only students, but children and adults all wearing Messi shirts in support and excitement,” Shashuo said. “It was completely blocked off to a point where we saw two men try to make a run for it before being tackled down by a police officer and escorted out.”
Gruber praised his staff for the job they did during the event.
“Nobody was placed under arrest, nobody was barred from the university,” Gruber said. “There were no incidents that truly would have concerned me. We handled a large crowd pretty effectively.”
On Friday, a crowd of around 30 people had gathered by 2:15 p.m. and continued to grow steadily in anticipation of the scheduled practice. However, practice on Friday occurred at FedEx Field instead of Shaw.
“Argentina was holding a press conference for international and local media at FedEx Field, and they chose to hold practice there at the same time,” Carey said.
By 4 p.m., the fans had all gone home in disappointment, save for two still hopeful boys wearing Lionel Messi jerseys, kicking a soccer ball back and forth in front of Shaw.

OWN IT and the Georgetown Office of Public Affairs hosted the second annual OWN IT Summit Saturday in Gaston Hall. The women’s conference aims to bridge the gap between young women and working professionals in a variety of fields.
Approximately 800 attendees from Georgetown and universities around the country including Yale University, University of Notre Dame and Johns Hopkins University attended the summit, which featured over 80 speakers and panelists.
The Hoya conducted exclusive interviews with five of the speakers. The interviews have been edited for clarity and condensed for print.
Danielle Brooks is an actress who attended The Juilliard School and now plays Tasha “Taystee” Jefferson on the Netflix original series “Orange Is the New Black,” which is in its third season.
What advice would you give young women interested in acting?
Brooks: I say go for it. Go full throttle for it. If you’re still green, get educated. There’s so many schools out here; it doesn’t have to be Juilliard. There are so many colleges that can give you what you need where you are. Go get some education. Educate yourself, and go for it.
How do you think that your character, Taystee, in “Orange Is the New Black” is exposing problems for women in the prison system in America?
Brooks: Taystee, you know, she is a child of the system. She has been in and out of prison her whole life. As we see in season one, I believe, she goes in and out. The reason she does is because in prison she had a home, she had a family, she had food on the table and that was comfortable for her. And that’s a problem that we’re having that, where do these prisoners go for rehabilitation? Where do they go to figure out how to live when they get out? And we don’t have enough of that. So I feel like, that’s really the purpose of Taystee when it comes to talking about the issues of the prison systems in America.
Mary Jordan is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist for the Washington Post who served as a foreign correspondent for 14 years in over 40 countries.
What’s your advice to young women interested in pursuing journalism?
Jordan: Learn how to write. Work hard. Read everything you can, and go for it because there’s never been more opportunities in journalism, actually. There are many more platforms now. You can blog and you can do radio and you can do print journalism. You can do video. There are a lot of places for people who are curious and just know that it’s a fun job. I always feel like it’s grad school. First, I was in Japan and learned everything about Japanese politics, and then I moved to Mexico and learned everything about Latin American studies, then London and learned about the British parliamentary system. I think journalism is so great, because it’s basically just learning every day and meeting really interesting people.
Norah O’Donnell is a print and television journalist who works as the co-anchor of CBS This Morning, and previously worked as the Chief White House Correspondent for CBS News.
What’s the biggest challenge to be a woman in journalism and how would you encourage young aspiring female journalists?
O’Donnell: I think there are very few challenges for women in journalism. I think it’s a great field for women to enter because it’s largely a meritocracy. If you write a good story, if you investigate something and break a news story, that’s going to be recognized. So, I think many of the talents that women have, which are interests in how policy affects people’s lives, answering the question of why something is, which is the heart of journalism. Those are well-suited to some of the skill sets that many women already have and I think journalism is a great field for women. We need more women in leadership in journalism, and that will take time, but I’m firmly convinced that we are at a turning point. Having met many of the women at Georgetown, I’m confident that we are going to have equality in terms of leadership in journalism very soon.
Megan Smith is the chief technology officer to the United States and was formerly the vice president of GoogleX.
What is the role of U.S. Chief Technology Officer and how have you adapted it?
Smith: The official job is to advise the president and his team on how to harness the power on data efficiency in technology on behalf of the nation. It’s a flexible job. It’s not like you’re supposed to run NASA or run IT websites for the government, it’s really an architecture job and a policy job. …
One of the areas we focus on is the American people. How do we help with skills or entrepreneurial access and what people are able to do, STEM stuff for youth and coding at school and that whole range of things to support the American people and top innovators can also help other people get into innovation. We call it “Innovation Nation,” it’s our nickname. Programs like Tech Hire that we launch that are helping people use code boot camps to get into. There’s five million jobs open in the country, so we’re trying to help people get into the tech jobs there.
What advice would you give young women interested in the technology field?
Smith: The universe doesn’t really divide the subjects up. In school you’re learning science, math, and English and history and music. Being fluent in all those different things is very powerful. … As a student, take a lot of time to sample some things and not shut the door because of stereotypes. Even in children’s television they have some crazy stereotypes. Out of every four characters on kid’s TV only one’s a girl. In STEM fields, only one’s a girl out of five, and in computer science cast on TV it’s fifteen to one. Which is not true for the industry, but it creates this bias in what you think you should do. And then you see classes skewed. But coding is just following instructions like following a recipe or following a list of things to do. Learning how to use that to make things and have impact on the world is really important. We sometimes make people afraid of tech. The way that we teach it, we make people feel dumb and bored and not have people teach by learning. You learn to read and write. But when we teach tech stuff, we teach all these facts, we don’t let you discover or make or invent.
Kara Swisher is a technology journalist who serves as the executive editor of Re/Code, a tech news and analysis website.
As moderator of the Innovation Panel at the summit, what were you trying to get across?
Swisher: Innovation can come in many forms and where is it going. And we have to think very hard as to how we can stay as an innovative country. The U.S. is a leader in technology and innovation but it’s going to lose that fast to China and India and countries that are doing some amazing things. The question is, are we educating our people in a way that is necessary to keep that going, are we providing visas in a way to bring in talent from all over the world, do we have enough focus on the fact that this is going to differentiate ourselves and bring us into the future for a better country and a better world.

Former U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Rajiv Shah highlighted the importance of development to American foreign policy in a lecture at the Lohrfink Auditorium Monday.
The lecture, sponsored by the Office of the President, was part of the Global Futures Initiative, launched in January to encourage the university to engage in conversations about global issues over the next four semesters. As each semester focuses on a different theme, the issue for this semester is the future of development. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and Chief Economist Kaushik Basu have previously given speeches as part of the initiative.
“We’ve engaged in thoughtful and nuanced discussions on factors that shape efforts to alleviate poverty and improve the human condition in a world marked by complexity,” University President John J. DeGioia said in his introductory speech at the event.
Shah served as USAID’s administrator from 2010 until earlier this year. Upon leaving the organization on March 1, he joined the faculty of the School of Foreign Service as a distinguished fellow-in-residence, primarily engaging with the Global Human Development Program led by former USAID Chief Economist Steven Radelet.
“We’re deeply grateful to have the opportunity to engage with [Shah] now as a member of our community,” DeGioia said. “In his commitment to innovation and development, Dr. Shah’s work considers that same question and reflects that same spirit of thoughtful engagement in action toward the common good.”
Shah began his address by outlining the importance of development to American foreign policy.
“It is important to recognize that development policy plays, and has played especially in the last decade, a much larger role in how American projects combined military, diplomatic, and development rights-based power around the world,” Shah said.
Highlighting examples of important development projects, such as health and education reconstruction in Afghanistan, refugee camps in Jordan and earthquake rebuilding efforts in Haiti, Shah explained that in the coming years, the developing world would provide an opportunity for the United States to create real change.
“A greater number of our foreign policy crises, policies and opportunities will emanate from fragile states, and the fight against extreme poverty, which is increasingly concentrated in these states, will become an increasing part of how we defend ourselves, how we build connections around the world and how we build a global economy that really has an on-ramp for the 1.1 billion people that still subsist on a dollar a day or less,” Shah said.
Shah highlighted particular successes of America’s development mission until now, noting advances in global health and child survival rates, new technologies, education and the fight against global hunger, which was addressed by the Feed the Future Initiative launched by USAID in 2010 to ensure food security.
“There are a handful of things that we do very well in projecting development leadership around the world, and they often have to do with health, hunger, water access, education, investing in people, investing in children,” Shah said.
Shah then moved to criticizing the U.S. development policy. He advocated for the United States to support infrastructure projects in developing countries and focus on climate resilience strategies to prepare for natural disasters.
“I believe in the next 10 to 15 years, if we don’t do the next things better, in a more creative and imaginative way, we will then cede 60 years of American leadership to a group of emerging economies that are already starting to come together to organize new ways of doing things,” Shah said. “In the process, I think we’ll end up with … an America that is not as connected to the frontier parts of the world with anything other than our military.”
One of the primary anecdotes Shah discussed was that of the Ebola epidemic, the devastation of which he attributed to inadequate data and preparedness. When real-time data on where cases were occurring began streaming into government offices, the tide turned against the disease.
“Good data makes all the difference,” Shah said.
Shah concluded his lecture by acknowledging his hope for the future of development policy in the United States.
“When America offers leadership in development and humanitarian affairs, it changes the way the world sees and interacts with us but more than anything, it helps our own politics come together to do some extraordinary things,” Shah said. “We actually have a political system that could support a far bigger and much-needed role of development in our foreign policy.”

Thirty years ago, 14 students and seven leaders embarked on the inaugural First Year Orientation to Community Involvement program at Georgetown University. Put together by the Center for Social Justice in 1986, the program has since more than tripled to its current size of 54 participants and 16 leaders per year.
FOCI celebrated its 30th anniversary March 28 by bringing together students, faculty, alumni and friends for a day of activities, including an alumni reflection panel, a FOCI service activity and an evening reception and gala.
The intensive, week-long pre-orientation program is open to incoming freshmen and transfer students and is a chance for first years to immerse themselves in Washington, D.C., through the promotion of social justice and community service.
Monica Gibbons (NHS ’16), a FOCI leader captain in 2014, said that the program pushes students to go beyond campus and encounter the city in a way that brings about solidarity and emphasizes social justice in the larger community.
“The goal of FOCI is to bring a diverse group of students from all over the country and with different backgrounds to a week of learning about the city that they are about to be immersed into for the next four years, and to look at the issues that the places in the city that you are about to live in face,” Gibbons said.
Center for Social Justice Associate Director Ray Shiu said that FOCI allows for students’ personal growth before they even step foot in a classroom at Georgetown.
“FOCI participants actively engage in community service; discover and reflect on the diverse populations, perspectives, and roles in the Georgetown and D.C. communities; develop the capacity for leadership; and become part of a community committed to personal growth through service and reflection,” Shiu said. “FOCI’s activities address a wide variety of social justice issues.”
FOCI was founded in 1986 after the idea was proposed by a group of Georgetown students, including Dr. Mark Fox (CAS ’87), who was inspired to propose a program after attending a service and community engagement conference at Princeton University.
FOCI leader Tessa Pulaski (SFS ’15) said that preserving the program’s history at this milestone is an important task.
“Thirty years means we have been involved in trying to get Georgetown students more off campus and more into D.C. for a long time,” Pulaski said. “Thirty years is a good time to think about what the future of the program will bring because a lot of the program has been built off of really strong institutional backgrounds. I hope that moving forward, we keep that history super close.”
Pulaski also said that the program is highly valued at Georgetown, serving as a place where close relationships among participants and leaders are formed.
“I think it tries to start difficult conversations before you even get to Georgetown about race, class, privilege,” Pulaski said. “It tries to expedite these conversations that might happen for Georgetown students only during their junior or senior years. I think FOCI can bring in a very diverse group of people that makes the conversation start happening at an earlier time, and I think these are critical conversations to be having.”
The FOCI community remains large and expansive, consisting of both current students and alumni. Several FOCI alumni are professors at Georgetown, including Soyica Colbert (COL ’01), Brian McCabe (SFS ’02) and Dinaw Mengestu (COL ’00). Meanwhile, many other alumni have pursued careers in social justice.
Daniel Wassim (SFS ‘18), a participant of FOCI this past year, said the program has been influential in shaping his future at Georgetown.
“FOCI provided me with meaningful friendships even before orientation, and it undoubtedly shaped my journey here at Georgetown by instilling in me a sense of duty for my community,” Wassim said.

The Japanese government is considering donating $5 million to the Walsh School of Foreign Service to fund an endowed chair in Japanese Studies, who will teach both undergraduate and graduate students.
The donation, if approved by the Japanese government, will be part of Japan’s annual budget to be released in April.
“We are honored to be considered for this chair — to be one of the universities that is considered for this chair — and we hope to get it,” Director of Asian Studies Victor Cha said. “But nothing is certain yet. If we do, it would be a major accomplishment for our Asian Studies program because it really has grown dramatically over the past five years or so. So it would be fantastic if indeed we get it.”
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Columbia University are also being considered for the donation, according to Cha. However, SFS Interim Dean James Reardon-Anderson said that he is hopeful the donation will be granted to Georgetown, but added that he was unsure of their decision-making process and criteria.
“I think it’s very, very likely at this point that we will get this funding,” Reardon-Anderson said. “They [the Japanese embassy] have been quite forthcoming, and we have been in close contact with them, and I think everything is on track.”
The Embassy of Japan declined to comment on the proposed donation.
Around 60 students are enrolled in the Master of Arts in Asian Studies Program, housed in the SFS, according to Reardon-Anderson. An additional 20 to 25 undergraduate students per class year are pursuing an Asian studies certificate in the SFS.
The SFS currently does not house any chairs in Japanese Studies, although the College houses the Nippon Foundation Chair in Japanese Studies. The Nippon Foundation Chair, held within the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures, was founded about 20 years ago and is currently held by professor Kevin Doak, who which oversees the study of the Japanese language. On the other hand, the new chair would focus on Japan’s place in global affairs and international politics.
Japanese history professor Jordan Sand said that the endowment from the Japanese government will improve scholarship in Japan at Georgetown University.
“Japanese studies doesn’t have enough people,” Sand said. “That’s why this [endowment] is so important. We really need beefing up. We have a superb language program, and we have a small group of — I’d like to think — very good professors. But we don’t have as much resources as we need.”
The talks with the Japanese embassy began about a year ago and have been led by international relations professor Michael Green, who holds the Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Cha and Asian Studies Program administrative specialist Kathleen Fisk, according to Sand.
“I don’t think we have seen something like this [endowment] that’s directly funded by the government before,” Cha said.
However, Cha said that the fact that a foreign government will potentially fund Georgetown has no bearing on the intellectual freedom or freedom of speech of the university.
In 1980, Kuwait endowed the Sheikh Sabah Al Salem Al Sabah Chair in the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies with a $1 million donation.
In 1990, a 10-year grant from the German government established the SFS BMW Center for German and European Studies.
Once a donation is made, the donor does not have control over the professorship other than the field of study the chair will specialize in, according to Cha. Georgetown staff would have full control over the selection and search process of the chair.
Georgetown’s offering of Asian Studies opportunities has been steadily increasing over the past several years. One major addition was the 2012 launch of the SFS’s Master of Arts in Asian Studies Program.
Another improvement was a pilot program launched this year, titled “The Georgetown-Japan 2020 Initiative,” which gave undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to work on Japanese research and travel to Tokyo to present at a public conference and attend various government, think tank and academic meetings.
“Asian studies has just grown exponentially and interest in Asia has grown exponentially over the past couple of decades,” Sand said. “In many ways we have to play catch-up. … The demand was huge and it felt really pent up.”
Cha said that the demand for Asian Studies is in large part due to President Barack Obama’s “Pivot to Asia” strategy announced in 2013.
“Georgetown has been pivoting to Asia even before the Obama administration pivoted to Asia,” Cha said. “We look at people who apply to our program and a couple of other top programs on Asia, and I think we are ranking pretty highly up there right now.”
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be in Washington at the end of April to meet with Obama and address a joint meeting of Congress. The university has been in discussions with the Japanese embassy about the prime minister’s schedule but no decision has been made on whether he will visit Georgetown University, according to Reardon-Anderson.
Abe’s speech to Congress will be the first time a Japanese leader will make such an address, emphasizing the increased importance Japan has in U.S. foreign relations.
“I think that [the endowment] is so important because East Asia is so important, because Japan has a very strong relationship with the United States — a very unique one,” Sand said.

In response to the effect of disproportionate levels of homelessness on LGBTQ youth, a new youth shelter is the first of its kind to offer protection for transgender youth in the District.
Ruby Corado, an advocate for LGBTQ rights, heads Casa Ruby, a nonprofit organization that currently provides meals, case management, legal counsel and other basic services to the LGBTQ community. Now, Corado is opening a shelter particularly for trans youth.
According to the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 19 percent of trans people have been homeless at some point in their lives, while 10 percent of transgender people have been ejected from their homes due to their gender identity.
However, despite the prevalence of homelessness among this population, 29 percent of trans people reported being turned away from shelters because of their gender identity. Even when they are accepted into shelters, 55 percent said they experienced sexual harassment at a shelter, according to the Washington Post.
Corado, a trans person who identifies as a woman, previously experienced homelessness, saying at an event in October that being an immigrant trans woman made it difficult for her to find housing.
To combat the problem, Corado received a $380,000 grant from the D.C. Department of Human Services in November, which she used to secure a three-story house on Georgia Avenue NW that will house 10 to 12 people between the ages of 18 and 24.
“Here, you will not be hungry,” Corado said in the Washington Post. “You won’t be tired from a bad night of sleep. You will be rested and full, and you will be ready to work on your future.”
The problem of homelessness is not limited to the trans community; it affects the entire LGBTQ population. Although LGBTQ youth only make up seven percent of the overall youth population, 40 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ, according to the Huffington Post.
Luke Brown (COL ’17), who co-led an Alternative Breaks Program trip that explored the issue of LGBTQ youth homelessness and visited homeless shelters in New York City, noted that shelters often treated these clients with disrespect.
“I think what surprised me the most was the inability of mainstream housing organizations to address the particular needs of their LGBTQ clients, especially since these clients are a plurality,” Brown said. “Housing discrimination is still rampant, with LGB individuals having to wear particular clothes to mark them as other or even being verbally and physically assaulted within some shelters.”
Brown said that this disregard was amplified in the interactions of shelters with trans people.
“These issues are compounded within the trans community,” Brown said. “Many trans youth are assigned rooming based on the gender identity officials project onto them or that their birth certificates indicate.”
GU Pride Media Manager and Historian Campbell James (SFS ’17) explained that LGBTQ youth constitute a high portion of the homeless because of continued stigma attached to the identity.
“I still think that there’s a lot of fear and kind of a stigma around being LGBTQ especially if you’re a person of color,” James said. “If you feel like you’re really different from the mold or from what you think is a normal person, it’s hard to find your place to belong.”
The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently announced legal action to make shelters more secure for LGBTQ citizens, particularly for trans youth. Among these reforms, HUD announced that single-gender homeless shelters receiving federal aid could not refuse a person in need based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
James said HUD’s actions are a good first step to ensuring fair treatment of LGBTQ community.
“I think that [the HUD legislation] probably was geared towards the LGBTQ community and trans youth,” James said. “That’s a really, really great inclusive move by HUD to make sure that no young person can be turned away from a safe place to live because of their gender identity.”
Corado’s new shelter will combine the security of a shelter with the services of Casa Ruby, offering job training and counseling to those who seek shelter there.
According to James, the new shelter represents an important step in addressing the problem of homeless transgendered citizens.
“I think it’s really touching and incredible to see Ruby Corado’s youth center turn into a homeless shelter,” James said. “It shows that she’s been gaining a lot of momentum in being a really strong activist for LGBTQ youth in the city.”

What started as a few conversations with the homeless of Boston in the summer of 2014 soon turned into a life passion for Andrew O’Brien (COL ’18). The injustice of homelessness spurred O’Brien to create a magazine featuring interviews with individuals experiencing homelessness entitled “Profiles of D.C.’s Homeless.”
O’Brien began the project in September as part of “Ethics of Entrepreneurship,” a Georgetown seminar that provided students with $1,000 to create an entrepreneurship project that addresses a social issue.
According to O’Brien, the issue of homelessness is so ubiquitous in D.C. that it is often neglected.
“When I got to D.C., I saw many people experiencing homelessness everywhere I went. After a while, I realized that I had stopped noticing them as much, but they were still there of course, and that’s the problem: when you’re surrounded by something, you see it without truly feeling it. The absurdity of homelessness is lost in its ubiquity,” O’Brien said.
For two and a half months, O’Brien interviewed and photographed people on the streets of Georgetown who were experiencing homelessness, then edited the content into a magazine.
“[I] started talking to all the homeless people I met, getting their stories, building bonds and eventually saw what a great thing it would be to tell their fantastic stories to everyone, to make people realize that these individuals, who they may walk by everyday, are as full of life and love as anyone [they]’ll ever meet,” O’Brien said.
After completing the magazine, O’Brien contacted the National Coalition for the Homeless hoping to promote his magazine. The coalition provided funds to print 125 initial copies.
O’Brien plans to distribute his magazine to as many people as possible through Amazon and tabling on campus. He plans to charge $10 per copy. The profits will be used to help fund Solidarity Press, a publishing collective that O’Brien created for this project.
O’Brien said that he hopes to expand Solidarity Press by cooperating with socially conscious businesses.
“To keep Solidarity Press sustainable while spreading the word on innovative social change, I’d very much like to begin coverage of social businesses [that] make a profit while still ensuring the well-being of all stakeholders from production to distribution, like Misfit Juicery or Atla Gracia,” O’Brien said.
Director of Community Organizing for the National Coalition for the Homeless Michael Stoops said that he was very impressed with O’Brien’s initiative.
“It was one of the quickest, most successful turn-around projects that I’ve ever seen a student do,” Stoops said.
David Pirtle, a speaker for Faces of Homelessness, a bureau of the National Coalition for the Homeless which helped O’Brien profile his interviewees, praised O’Brien’s magazine for not perpetuating stereotypes about homeless people.
“The typical lazy reporter will go out and interview the first homeless person he sees and then say that they represent all homeless people,” Stoops said. “[O’Brien] understands that the homeless population is not monolithic.”
O’Brien said that he never had to intentionally avoid stereotypes, and that his interview subjects covered a diverse range.
“People have said that they’re surprised at how different all these profiles are, and people have asked me if I approached this with any angle to avoid stereotypes,” said O’Brien. “The truth is that I never had to intentionally avoid stereotypes for the simple reason that these homeless stereotypes don’t exist in reality.”
O’Brien approached his subjects by offering them water, then discussed political or housing issues with them. Eventually, O’Brien asked if they wanted to be profiled in his magazine.
“To be honest, if I were in their shoes and some college kid came up to me and asked for my life story after a bit of small talk, I don’t think I would have been as kind,” O’Brien said.
O’Brien said that he was surprised by how frankly his subjects spoke about personal issues.
“It was amazing how quickly my talks with the dozens of people I interviewed proceeded from small talk, to talking about incredibly personal subjects, like past abuses and failures, which would eventually be included in the magazine,” O’Brien said.
Pirtle, one of O’Brien’s interviewees, was particularly impressed by O’Brien’s interviewing skills when it came to discussing emotional memories.
“He was always able to get past the regular spiel … and really get into the heart of the story,” Pirtle said. “I think sharing stories like these is the most effective way to build empathy for a population for whom people don’t have a lot of empathy.”
At Georgetown, O’Brien is a board member of Georgetown Homeless Outreach Programs and Education. He moderated their most recent event, “Issue of the Month: Homelessness is a Women’s Issue.”
O’Brien has been awarded the Figge Fellowship, an initiative in the Catholic Studies Program for undergraduates interested in dialogues about faith and social issues. He said he saw the fellowship as an opportunity to further investigate the role of faith among homeless individuals.
“I wondered how the public’s perceptions and misconceptions of homeless individuals might affect the formation of this kind of faith within the homeless population,” O’Brien said. “That’s what I’m studying now: stigma and faith.”
Ultimately, O’Brien said that he hopes to make readers aware of the complexities of the issue of homelessness.
“New and artistic representation of social justice issues is key in getting people to rethink these familiar problems, to see them in a new light,” O’Brien said.

Three GU Fossil Free members are pleading against charges by the Office of Student Conduct issued March 25 on unauthorized access to restricted spaces and failure to comply with university and law enforcement officials.
They received the sanctions after protesting at World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim’s lecture on global warming at Gaston Hall two weeks ago.
After Kim finished his speech, GU Fossil Free members Elaine Colligan (SFS ’15), Patricia Cipollitti (SFS ’15) and Chloe Lazarus (COL ’16) walked onto the stage with a banner quoting a statement Kim had previously made on climate change. Director of Student Conduct Judy Johnson and several Georgetown University Police Department officers physically escorted the three students off the stage.
On Friday, Colligan, Cipolliti and Lazarus met with Johnson to discuss the alleged violations of the Code of Student Conduct. The charges could result in a $25 fine related to unauthorized access and housing probation for the failure to comply with university officials.
Johnson declined to comment on the specific incident, but emphasized that student resistance to university officials and law officers is a violation of the Code of Student Conduct. The group vocally resisted requests to step down from Johnson, and after five minutes of dialogue, left the stage.
“The student code of conduct outlines behaviors, consistent with community standards, that are considered violations of the code. For example, engaging in behavior that does not adhere to the directives of a university official or a law enforcement officer is a violation,” Johnson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The three members are currently challenging the charges on the grounds of free speech rights that are guaranteed by the Speech and Expression Policy. The charges made by the Office of Student and possible punishments are “adjucated based on the nature and severity of the behavior and the sanction, which typically may be imposed for a first time violation of a single regulation,” according to the Student Conduct Sanctioning Guide. Disciplinary decisions and sanctions can be appealed. In the appeals process, an administrator or Hearing Board reviews the original record and supporting documents. A sanctioned group can only appeal once.
Section II, Part E of the policy states that, “expressive activities planned and executed with the intention of protesting an event, policy or other concept can take place in all campus locations, regardless of whether the space has been reserved for that purpose, as long as the actions do not violate other university policies, disrupt university business, or curtail the free speech rights of others.”
Cipollitti said that she maintains that GU Fossil Free abided by the university’s speech and expression policy, which states that students may protest events, “as long as the actions do not violate other university policies, disrupt university business or curtail the free speech rights of others.”
“[Johnson] kept indicating that this was an issue of student conduct and not free speech and we kept replying that we were abiding by the university policy, the free speech policy, and therefore these charges based on the Code of Student Conduct were inapplicable to us, so it was kind of a back-and-forth,” Cipollitti said.
According to Cipolliti, the three will continue to argue against the charges, in hopes that the university would comply with its free speech policy.
“We are prepared to defend our right to free speech, which has been a topic of conversation in the past year at the university and because we hope that the university will uphold this right and we hold it in good faith that they genuinely abide by the university’s mission and commitment to the free interchange of ideas,” Cipollitti said. “We think that the consequences will be consistent to that.”
Speech and Expression Committee member Sam Kleinman (COL ’16), who was present at the meeting, said that Johnson did not seem interested in hearing the three students’ defense. Kleinman, as a member of the committee, was at the meeting to serve as a witness and advocate for the group througout the process.
“[Johnson] was pretty dead set and pretty convinced that [the students] were ‘guilty.’ She seemed rather upset and vexed that those three folks from GU Fossil Free didn’t admit that they had done something wrong,” Kleinman said. “At one point, she said and I quote, ‘I don’t want to get into a debate with you,’ toward the end of the meeting.”
Kleinman said that he supports GU Fossil Free in expressing their beliefs through the freedom of expression.
“This is clearly a matter of expression and not code of conduct,” Kleinman said. “This is a free speech issue and I am still staunch in my belief along with [GU Fossil Free] that [they] had every right to be on that stage.”
Hoya Staff Writer Jack Bennett contributed reporting.

There’s a problem with Fossil Free’s argument. They claim protection under Section 2, Part E … but they apparently did not keep reading to Part F. Part F, “Entrance into University Buildings by Protestors,” clearly states: “Protestors may not enter a building if that space has been secured for a speech to be given in that building. For example, the Healy lobby is often used for entrance to speeches in Gaston Hall. In that case, the protestors must remain outside the building in a space previously designated by the Center for Student Engagement, the Office of Campus Activity Facilities, the Department of Public Safety and the Office of Protocol and Events. This policy applies to any buildings where a major event or speaker is hosted.” 
Now on one hand, I don’t think this applies because what they were doing really wasn’t protesting at all. (Leading me to be even more confused about why they felt the need to literally climb on stage to “show support” to Kim, but I digress…) However, IF you’re going to claim protection under Part E, which is called “Protest of Events,” then you MUST be prepared to follow all sections regarding protesting. By that logic, they shouldn’t have even been in Healy Hall, let alone Gaston Hall, let alone the stage. 
Besides – From what I know about protesting (and I’ve been part of climate change protests before), part of the deal is accepting the punishment that is dealt to you. That’s why the 350.org protestors went to jail after standing at the gate of the White House. You didn’t see Bill McKibben arguing with cops about why they shouldn’t arrest him. Part of the meaningful nature of the non-violent protest is maintaining the moral high ground, ALL THE WAY THROUGH – even through punishment.

The Dude says 
April 1, 2015 at 1:31 pm
Neither Kleinman nor Cipollitti appear to have any commonsense.  Both think Fossil Free were engaged in legitimate protest and did not violate university policy despite their actions clearly violating University policy, the text of which is even quoted in this article.  
And whether they realize it or not, they are also saying disruptive actions like Fossil Free’s should be an option for those who disagree with any and all future speakers, opening the door to having students on stage, interrupting and in effect silencing the speeches of every invited guest from now on.  Do students really want that to happen to everyone who visits?  
A $25 fine is not enough.  That they’re even appealing that tiny amount is a sign they’re not willing to sacrifice or suffer the consequences of their beliefs, something those really committed to a cause are willing to do, and expect, if they’re not being hypocrites  These girls (I won’t call them women b/c they’re obviously not adults) use fossil fuels all the time.  The only positive is their names are online now and a potential employer will see them with a simple Google search.

Jennifer Huang Bouey, an associate professor of international health at the School of Nursing and Health Studies, received a $50,000 grant to conduct a one-year study on the risk factors and best practices against the HIV epidemic in Washington, D.C., from the District of Columbia Developmental Center for AIDS Research.
Bouey received the grant as part of the D.C. D-CFAR’s Pilot Awards Program, which seeks to provide funds for HIV investigators to assist them in their research. In addition, the organization offers grants to one or two pilot studies per year which they select through a highly selective peer-review process.
The D.C. D-CFAR is a federally funded initiative that aims to promote HIV/AIDS research to end the epidemic in D.C. The organization is composed of six universities and institutes, including Georgetown University, American University and the Children’s National Medical Center.
Bouey said that she hopes her research will increase awareness and support for individuals in D.C. with a high risk for HIV.
“I am very happy to receive this funding as it marks the start of a new direction in my research,” Bouey wrote in an email. “It takes a long time to foster a rapport to work with local communities that serve high-risk populations. This D.C. D-CFAR funding in a way confirmed the success of our longtime effort to create an academic community team in Washington D.C. to work with this marginalized population at high risk for HIV.”
NHS Interim Dean Patricia Cloonan, said that Bouey’s research would continue the NHS’s mission of serving marginalized communities.
“As she expands her focus to include our local community, it is great that she has received this funding to support her work,” Cloonan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our school seeks to advance the health and well-being of all people with a particular attention on the underserved and marginalized.”
Bouey’s previous research includes seven years of community-based work with rural-to-urban migrant women in China. With this one-year pilot study, Bouey plans to build upon her research in the context of the United States.
“Migration and sexual violence are two precursors highly correlated with HIV and STI among female commercial sex workers worldwide,” Bouey wrote. “The relationship between these factors has not previously been explored in urban areas of the United States and the impact of such violence on the biological plausibility for STI and HIV infection has not been well established.”
Bouey stressed the importance of the pilot study in D.C., a center of commercial sex work where there is a high risk of STI and HIV infection for female residents and travellers.
“The nation’s capital has already been identified as a hub for commercial sex work along the East Coast corridor,” Bouey wrote. “This is problematic given the city’s high HIV prevalence rates, among the highest in the United States. Thus, women travelling into this environment to engage in sex work may face a greatly increased risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Developing interventions that can effectively reach this travelling population and gather data from them are urgently needed.”
The project will involve a multidisciplinary team of experts in community and behavioral research, immunology, gynecology and epidemiology from Georgetown and George Washington University. The team will also work with long-time local community organization Helping Individual Prostitutes Survive, which promotes the health and rights of drug users, sex workers and their communities.
According to Bouey, the pilot study will cover a range of research methods, including both qualitative and quantitative approaches to gathering data.
“We will start with qualitative focus group discussions and in-depth interviews,” Bouey wrote. “The interviews will help us obtain firsthand data from community organizations, public health agencies, policymakers, and female sex workers. We also provide HIV/HCV testing and collect immunology biomarkers.”
Bouey also said that the bridging of these various types of research methods is important not only in obtaining data, but also in serving as a model for future multidisciplinary research.
“Research involving the collection of biological material has encountered low participation rates, due to a history of unethical public health research in the United States,” Bouey wrote. “Our study will serve as a model that bridges bench science, behavioral research and community participation to develop a ‘best practice’ model that will eventually benefit both scientific research and marginalized high-risk populations.”
Manavi Bhagwat (NHS ’16), one of Bouey’s students who will take part in the upcoming pilot study this summer, expressed her excitement about working more closely with Bouey.
“I’m incredibly impressed,” Bhagwat said. “When she described the project to me, I was pretty amazed at the fact that she was able to translate her experience in international health to the D.C. area and work on a project so close to home. I’m sure she’s going to be very successful with her project.”

The university’s newest study space, the Carroll Parlor, reopened Thursday on the first floor of Healy Hall after being converted from an art show room. Dedicated to senior undergraduates, the study space features three tables with seating for about 25 people.
The room previously was used as a showplace for significant items in Lauinger Library’s collections, and a number of paintings from the collection still adorn the walls of the study space. However, most items were moved to various other locations around campus to accommodate the new space.
Three members of the Senior Class Committee, including Chair Bridget Mullen (COL ’15), were present at Thursday’s opening to receive an honorary university seal dating back to about 1900. The seal, a replica of the ones decorating the ceiling of the Carroll Parlor, was presented by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Provost Robert Groves to commemorate the opening.
“Carroll Parlor is a really historic space on campus, and I think we all know, especially students who have been here for four years, that space is at a premium at Georgetown,” Mullen said. “So it really means a lot to have a space that is dedicated specifically to seniors.”
The new study room, located next to the Campus Ministry office, was proposed by the Campus Life Working Group in 2013 and renovation of the space began in late 2014, according to Olson.
Olson said that the new study space is a symbolic reflection of the university’s emphasis on undergraduate education. Though a number of graduate study spaces exist on campus, this is the first uniquely undergraduate space dedicated to seniors.
“I’m personally excited that this will be a special place for senior students to spend time to study together, to make special memories in their final year on the Hilltop,” Olson said.
Groves said that the room is symbolic not only in its purpose, but also in its location in Healy Hall.
“This is prime real estate if you don’t know that,” Groves said. “People would kill for this room; you got it.”
The study room will remain open whenever Healy Hall is open, from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day. Olson said that though the room is intended for seniors only, there will be no security measures or enforcements to check that only seniors study in the room.
“We’re not going to sort of kick other students out, but we wanted to send a message about what the space is,” Olson said.
Olson said three main people were responsible for turning the former collection space into an undergraduate study area: Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Jeanne Lorde, School of Nursing and Health Studies associate professor Joan Riley and alumnus Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14).
Groves said that he is hopeful the study space will cement the importance of academics at Georgetown and be a resource for generations of students to come.
“I think this is just a dynamite use of this space,” Groves said. “When tours come by, we can say there’s scholarship here going on at Georgetown.”

The crumbling staircases located between the Intercultural Center and the Jesuit Cemetery are currently undergoing renovation after delays stalled the construction of new staircases for months, according to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey.
“We made several attempts to repair the steps which were unsuccessful,” Morey said. “The condition of the stairs continued to deteriorate beyond repair and needed to be replaced.”
Repairs on the stairs were stalled during the colder winter months because temperatures need to be at least 45 degrees for the masonry work to be completed in a quality manner, Morey said.
“Our schedule targeted an early April start,” Morey said. “The project is not delayed and is currently on schedule. Other campus construction initiatives have no impact on this project.”
Morey said that there is no estimated cost yet because negotiations with contractor proposals are ongoing.
Though the staircases immediately adjacent to the cemetery are closed, a secondary staircase located less than 100 feet away still provides access to Red Square and the rear of Copley Hall.
Plans for replacing the steps began this past winter when university began the design and contractor bidding processes. With the design now complete, work began last week to demolish the old steps.
“We have integrated the new campus pavement standards conceived by the master plan into the design,” Morey said of the new staircases.
The staircases were demolished to prevent students from using the crumbling steps on the previous staircases. Though the steps were cordoned off, students were still using the stairways, according to Morey.
“Pedestrians simply move the racks and used the steps in spite of them cordoned off,” Morey said. “We considered this a safety hazard.”
Chris Rellas (COL ’17) said that though the current staircase closures are an inconvenience, there are plenty of other ways to get around campus.
“I don’t think it’s that big of a deal,” Rellas said of the closures. “We have a lot of problems on campus, and we obviously can’t make them all perfect. … I’m sure they’ll get around to it.”
On the other hand, Elizabeth Humphrey (COL ’17) said that the staircase closures have affected her daily commute across campus.
“In the past these steps provided my route to class, the gym and Regents,” Humphrey said. “Having no access to the steps, I now take a longer route through the ICC and use elevators more. Walking past the graveyard used to be one of the best parts of my day.”

Georgetown Business Improvement District will open a visitor’s center for the Georgetown neighborhood in the lobby of the Georgetown Park shopping mall this April.
The center, which will be located across from specialty foods market Dean and Deluca at the corner of M and Potomac streets, is part of the BID’s 2028 Action Plan, a list of 75 actions to invigorate the Georgetown neighborhood.
BID Director of Communications Rachel Cothran said the purpose of the center is to attract visitors to the Georgetown area and provide information for their stay.
“Ultimately, the goal is to provide a welcoming experience for visitors to Georgetown, provide helpful tips and resources, and to encourage discovery of the neighborhood: its history, unique physical environment, and diverse shopping and dining options,” Cothran said.
Cothran added that the new center will emphasize Georgetown’s history and entertainment options for tourists.
“The Georgetown Visitor Center will set the stage for the best possible visitor experience in a neighborhood that has long been a destination among both domestic and international visitors to Washington, D.C.,” Cothran said. “The visitor center will help provide an overview of the Georgetown neighborhood, from its history to what there is to do today. From there, visitors will be better prepared to create their own Georgetown experience.”
The BID is currently recruiting 40 to 50 volunteers from the community to work as “Georgetown Ambassadors” and help with a variety of tasks, including greeting visitors and providing orientation information.
While the online application stresses that volunteers should already be knowledgeable about the area, the BID will provide training on Georgetown’s history, as well as amenities and services that the neighborhood provides, including lodging, food, entertainment, recreation and transportation.
Cothran said that Georgetown students’ familiarity with the area makes them ideal volunteer candidates.
“Georgetown University students have the curiosity and passion for the area that we seek in our recruitment of volunteer Georgetown Ambassadors. We would really love to have [a] GU student contingent on this team,” Cothran said.
Georgetown University Student Association Undersecretary of Neighborhood Relations Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) said that although the BID has not yet reached out to GUSA about the possibility of volunteer work by Georgetown students, she is optimistic about this potential relationship.
“I believe this could be a great opportunity for increased engagement in the Georgetown Community,” Hinerfeld said.
She added that volunteering at the visitor center could be an option for students to work off their sanctions for conduct cases.
“Currently, many students receive sanctions hours for conduct cases, which are often resolved by participating in events such as the neighborhood cleanups,” Hinerfeld said. “Volunteering at the visitor center could serve as a welcome alternative for completing sanction hours and would likely provide a better opportunity for direct involvement with the local community.”
Tyler Welsh (COL ’18) said he would be interested in volunteering and that student involvement at the visitor center could be mutually beneficial for the campus community and greater Georgetown neighborhood.
“I think it’s a good idea. I think that the Georgetown community could benefit a lot from learning about the Georgetown campus and vice versa, so I think I would be willing to volunteer to talk about Georgetown because I love it a lot,” Welsh said.
Rahul Desai (MSB ’17) echoed Welsh, noting that increased interaction between students and community members could assist negotiations for the 2018 Campus Plan.
“I think getting student volunteers at the visitor center is a good idea because it might help bridge the gap between the town and Georgetown,” Desai said. “If the townspeople actually appreciate student volunteers and get to know them on a personal level and students understand the concerns of the residents, then we might be able to come to more effective compromises in regard to the campus plan.”

President of the Communities in Schools network, Daniel Cardinali (SFS ’88), delivered a keynote address on sexual identity and the role of Jesuit values in LGBTQ issues at the second annual IgnatianQ conference on Sunday.
This past weekend, IgnatianQ hosted several guest lectures, panel discussions and workshops to promote dialogue on LGBTQ issues in the context of Catholic values.
Cardinali’s speech, which took place at the Healey Family Student Center, was entitled “How Jesuit Spirituality Unleashed a Gay Man’s Commitment to Social Justice.” Cardinali runs the nation’s largest dropout prevention organization, which serves more than 1.3 million disenfran-chised students each year.
Cardinali began the speech by addressing his own struggles in coming to terms with his sexuality as a young man in high school and in his early years of college.
“I broke a part of my identity and put my sexuality away, and focused on excelling in the world,” Cardinali said. “I was unable to respond to my sexuality, and I was constantly frustrated as I realized that school rewards those who are straight.”
After he graduated, Cardinali traveled to Nicaragua, where he gained experience working with impoverished rural communities. According to Cardinali, this experience prompted him to further seek enlightenment through social justice work.
Cardinali said that he became more conscious of his religious identity after his involvement with a Christian ministry in New York, where he witnessed the interactions between the members of the ministry and the community.
“I took care of the sick and sometimes sat with them for hours. I also met people in the commu-nity who gave [it] all away to support the efforts. When asked why, the person responded that ‘it’s the community’s ministry and I depend on them,’” Cardinali said. “This led me to see this connection of human dignity to the larger community [of] people who do not just focus on their own work or empire, but who allow the community to prosper with them. If you really love people and care about them, you give them opportunities to be who they are.”
Cardinali cited his three years of involvement in Jesuit community service as an experience that shaped his views on the role of Catholicism in the community.
“As a Jesuit, I was gifted with a set of opportunities to give back to the world. It prepared me for what I do now,” Cardinali said. “I realized that being gay and being Catholic … can go together, as long as we believe in the dignity of [the] human person. Overtime, we would be able … to have the courage that [it] takes to make changes.”
Towards the end of the talk, Cardinali shared with the audience his thoughts on finding self-identity and reconciling it with one’s religious roots.
“If you believe that God is in the world, and that he never abandons, it is our life journey to discover that. There are tools to discover that, and once we made that discovery, it will prepare us for the world in unimaginable ways,” Cardinali said.
IgnatianQ organizer and GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15), who helped bring the conference to Georgetown, said that Cardinali’s speech on his experiences can be very valuable to people facing similar struggles.
“He was wonderfully open, and free to reflect on that experience without any sort of censorship, which you really don’t get very much at all in LGBTQ work in the Catholic context, so I’m really grateful to have someone that has [as] unique [a] position as Dan,” Lloyd said. “It was obvious that his talk was both sharing narratives of bringing these two pieces of his identities together, but also counseling us to see how our pieces could fit together all and all.”
Samuel F. Boyne (SFS ’18), who attended the event, found it very meaningful for Georgetown to host a conference that focuses on LGBTQ issues within the Catholic community.
“I think that IgnatianQ was an essential event to host at Georgetown. As a school dedicated to educating its students on being men and women for others, the messages for which the conference stands for coincides with our Jesuit values,” Boyne said. “Specifically, as it is vital for students to come together in an environment like this to discuss the intersection of faith and the LGBTQ community, I think that the keynote speakers did an excellent job in setting the premise for thought on the development of this progress. Overall, the opportunity to speak openly about these issues is a definite step forward.”
