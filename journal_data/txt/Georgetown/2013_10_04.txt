In the back of Mark Regnerus’ lecture on “the mating market” Thursday night sat a small but readily visible group of students wearing GU Pride T-shirts and holding rainbow flags.
The group, representatives of Georgetown’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, intersex, asexual and ally community, attended the event, which was sponsored by Love Saxa, to protest Regnerus’ invitation to campus and his past research on “family structure,” which criticizes same-sex parenting.
“We feel that all Georgetown students, faculty and staff have the right to feel safe here on the Hilltop, which is our home,” Carly Rosenfield (COL ’14), one of the protest’s organizers, said. “We would thus like to encourage our classmates to think about the implications of bringing to campus speakers who have expressed prejudicial opinions for those of us who are personally affected by these assertions, such as Dr. Regnerus’ study condemning same-sex parenting.”
Love Saxa, housed in Campus Ministry, works to combat sexualized culture on campus.
“We get a lot of messages from the media on sexuality and the hookup culture, and we don’t think it’s conducive to healthy sexuality,” Love Saxa board member Abigail Galvan (SFS ’14) said. “We feel that it is important to be present to provide a range of different perspectives on gender and relationships in order to foster constructive dialogue that affirms all identities.”
J. Capecchi (COL ’14), another student who helped organize the LGBTQ presence, was critical of Love Saxa.
“From what I see of their programming, it seems very well-intentioned but very heterosexist, cissexist and plain old sexist,” Capecchi said. “I can’t say whether [Regnerus] is or why his study is anti-gay, which is why we’re going in with a positive presence. We’re not there to attack him. We’re there to make sure people aren’t being oppressed.”
The presence at Thursday’s event was organized independently of GU Pride, but the organization does intend to protest another Love Saxa event next week about marriage.
“Me and some other queer people noticed that both events revolve around queer issues, but they aren’t through any queer people,” Capecchi said. “Nothing about us without us. We want to be present, not to derail anything but to make them aware that we are here on campus.”
According to an October 2012 interview with the conservative organization Focus on the Family, Regnerus, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, maintains that his study is not intended to prove the “inherent inferiority” of gay parents. Love Saxa board member Emile Doak (COL ’14) and Galvan also said that although their group promotes heterosexual marriage, they do not intend to oppose or combat Georgetown’s LGBTQIA community.
“Love Saxa does believe marriage is between a man and a woman, but we have not invited Dr. Regnerus to speak about that issue,” said Doak. “We don’t exist to counter the LGBT community. We welcome and encourage their attendance at our events. We like to see this more as a dialogue than as a divisive thing.”
Regnerus’ talk Thursday concerned his research on recent changes in relationships and the role of contraceptives in these transformations.
“The mating market split into two forms. You could be interested in sex now and not have to worry about getting pregnant,” Regnerus said. “Now there are more men interested in sex than marriage and more women interested in marriage.”
Director of Adult Faith Formation Ennio Mastroianni addressed the LGBTQIA group’s quiet presence when introducing Regnerus.
“We are one people here,” he said. “There’s no us and them. … We’re all hopefully people of good will trying to discern how to move forward as a community.”

Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E urged the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board to reject MedStar Georgetown University Hospital’s proposal for two office trailers Monday during its monthly meeting.
The trailers, which would provide 1,200 square feet of space for 10 to 12 staff members, would be located on an outdoor brick podium off of the Concentrated Care building outside of the ambulatory surgery waiting area.
“As our clinical programs continue to grow, we are faced with a number of space constraints,” MedStar spokesperson Marianne Worley wrote in an email. “In this situation, we need to accommodate our expanding transplant program.”
To deal with the hospital’s crucial space concerns, MedStar has already begun moving certain departments and offices away from the Reservoir Road main hospital building. According to Worley, some clinical departments such as psychiatry and non-clinical departments were moved out of the main location. In addition, the outpatient pediatrics department will move to a separate building, located at 4200 Wisconsin Ave. NW, and pediatricians will commute between the two buildings.
Although the hospital itself is not considered a historic building, because it is located on the Georgetown campus, which is located in the Georgetown Historic District, the Historic Preservation Review Board must approve any work. The project also had to pass through the ANC 2E before reaching the historic board.
ANC 2E Chair Ron Lewis found issue with the indefinite nature of the trailers’ lifespan. While MedStar representatives said at the meeting that the trailers would be strictly temporary while the hospital continues to pursue long-term options, it was unclear how long they would need to be used, with estimates reaching two years.
Lewis argued that the trailers run counter to the neighborhood’s historic nature. While ANC 2E has previously received requests for temporary trailers for construction, those were trailers whose timeline of use was specified, unlike those in MedStar’s proposal.
“These are just trailers to house staff that we felt probably should be housed somewhere else in the campus area because trailers just don’t fit with the historic district look, particularly when they could be there for years,” Lewis said. “We also think the hospital, if they looked at it, could come up with a better solution.”
While the passed version of the ANC 2E resolution rejected MedStar’s proposal by a 5-1 vote, ANC 2E Commissioner Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14) voted against the proposal. Although Prindiville said that he understood the council’s concerns about the historic nature of the neighborhood, the temporary space needs of the hospital outweighed this particular issue, particularly because the trailers would not be visible from street level.
“I think there was a legitimate case made that the trailers were necessary for the ongoing operations of the medical service of the hospital,” Prindiville said. “The real idiocy is that [the trailers] can’t be seen … perhaps they could be seen by the medevac helicopters, but I don’t know from what vantage point they could really be seen.”
Lewis, however, argued that whether the trailers could be seen or not was irrelevant to the discussion. If the trailers were visible from street level, the proposal would go in front of the Old Georgetown Board, instead of the ANC 2E.
“If it’s not visible … it’s not as bad, but it still doesn’t fit in the historic area as indefinite duration working space,” Lewis said.
Student commissioner Craig Cassey (COL ’15) was sick and not present at the meeting.
Lewis said that the Historic Preservation Review Board would most likely put a lot of weight into the ANC’s recommendation.
“The law says they … have to listen hard, and if they disagree, they have to explain in a rational way why they disagree,” Lewis said. “We think the principle is strong that this is not something that should not be encouraged or permitted in this historic area.”
If the Historic Preservation Review Board rejects the proposal, Worley said that MedStar would continue looking at other possible offsite locations and that it would work with the community to develop alternatives.
“MedStar Georgetown University Hospital always looks for ways to resolve issues with its community and its representatives in a cooperative and collaborative fashion.”
The Historic Preservation Review Board will review MedStar’s proposal Oct. 24.

A female motorist was fatally shot Thursday afternoon by police when she attempted to pass a barricade on Capitol Hill, prompting a chaotic day of uncertainty and fear for the worst in Washington.
Miriam Carey, a 34-year-old dental hygienist from Connecticut, knocked down a security barrier at the entrance to the White House at 15th Street and E Street NW before accelerating down Pennsylvania Avenue with police in pursuit around 2:15 p.m.
After trying to ram the gate of the Hart Senate Office Building, located at Constitution Avenue and Second Street NE, she was shot and killed. Carey’s 1-year-old daughter was also in the car but emerged unharmed.
The story was initially reported as a shooting at the Capitol, although Carey was later found to be unarmed. Police had fired shots at her car as it sped away.
Due to the day’s events, the Georgetown University Law Center campus was placed on lockdown, along with the Capitol and several other buildings in the area. The shelter-in-place warning was announced through HoyAlert.
“As in any emergency that might affect our community, the Georgetown Law Department of Public Safety followed the events at the Capitol this afternoon closely,” Law Center Director of Media Relations Marisa Kashino wrote in an email. “Overall, operations were affected minimally, since thankfully, the situation was resolved quickly. As always, we will be reviewing our procedures and policies to look for ways to improve our capabilities to respond to future emergency situations.”
HoyAlert, the university’s go-to method of announcing emergency protocol, had some concerning hiccups during the crisis.
Jordan Grushkin (LAW ’15) was in class when he got his HoyAlert text around 3:03 p.m., nearly an hour after the chase began. By that time, the city lockdown had already been lifted. Twenty minutes later, Grushkin was told that the situation was clear and that he could resume normal activities.
“I was in class the entire time, so I was kind of already in a position where everything was secure,”Grushkin said. “Honestly, it wasn’t a big deal, procedurally, but then again, I was already kind of locked in, in class.”
Ashley Kempczynski (LAW ’15), who lives across the street from the Law Center campus and is signed up for HoyAlert through text, phone and email, did not receive any notifications.
“I didn’t even know it was happening,” Kempczynski said. “I started to go to class around 3:15 p.m., and I met up with a friend in the elevator, and she said, ‘Oh yeah, I hope it’s safe to go outside now,’ and I didn’t know what she was talking about.”
Kempczynski added that she finally received an email around 7 p.m., although the time stamp stated that it was sent at 3:30 p.m., at which point the city lockdown had already ended and the House of Representatives had reconvened.
Students at internships on or near the Hill were also affected. Nesh Patel (SFS ’16), who works as an intern near the Capitol, was at work when the incident happened.
“We were getting information before it even got on CNN, so I was going online and trying to see what the news said about it, but it said nothing when we knew about it,” Patel said. “Most of us were just calling our families and texting them, saying that there was a shooting and we were okay. [My supervisor] said we couldn’t leave the building.”
After School Kids Program’s Street Law program, usually held at the Law Center, was called off as a result of the shooting.
“The students were on their way to the courts, I believe, but they were all fine,” ASK mentor AliciaWun (COL ’16) said. “They were most likely in transit when it was resolved. We usually pick them up from the courts [by Chinatown], not the Law Center, so they probably weren’t in as close a proximity as if they were at site.”
Grushkin said that such occurrences are not very uncommon, particularly in the Capitol South area.
“We’re not exactly in the safest area; we are right by the Capitol, but we are also right next door to one of the largest homeless shelters in the U.S.,” Grushkin said. “There has been more than one gun-related thing where someone had a gun drawn on them.”
“It was scary,” Patel said in agreement. “It’s weird that this kind of stuff has been happening in D.C. a lot now.”

While some universities are increasing scrutiny of employee social media use, Georgetown has not yet implemented any formal restrictions. Instead, it trusts in the judgment of staff and faculty.
“We’ve never policed or restricted social media activities before,” Communications Officer Rob Mathis said. “It’s not because we directly say we won’t police but because it has never been an issue.”
Nevertheless, in response to demands from faculty and staff for clear guidelines, the Office of Communications is currently preparing a handbook that will set rules for social media accounts that are affiliated with the university. It will most likely be available to faculty and staff later in the semester and is an extension of pre-existing student code of conduct, employee guidelines and privacy policies, simply in the context of social media.
According to Mathis, social media is simply a vehicle for problematic behavior; it is not the problem itself.
“It’s about giving tools, resources and tips for creating a strategy, and around that use of social media, understanding what the university’s point of view is on strategic use of social media for communications and marketing,” Mathis said.
Currently, the university’s social media policy is loose and created through collaborative, strategic programs and workshops such as the university’s social media working group, which is made up of staff members who manage social media on behalf of their programs or departments, to monitor its own social media.
“We connect with all these members to make sure they are as strategic and creative as possible when engaging in social media activities,” Mathis said.
The Office of Communications is also creating a student social media advisory committee, which will help the social media working group in collecting student opinions about what they look to see and hear from the university’s social media accounts.
Mathis attributed other universities’ problems with social media to a lack of communication and collaboration.
“They haven’t gone through the process of engaging social media on behalf of the university,” Mathis said. “If they were to have more in-person, collaborative programs that go over these guidelines, universities would not have these problems.”
For example, Director of Residential Education Edward Gilhool, who is in charge of managing social media content for resident assistants and hall residents, said his department does not strictly supervise the RAs that control hall Facebook pages. Rather, it is expected that they naturally understand the basics of using social media in a respectable way.
“Although we encourage students to be mindful about how they represent themselves as student leaders on social media, Residential Living does not monitor personal Facebook accounts,” Gilhool said. “As with all of our endeavors, we strive to ensure our mediums of information sharing promote safe, responsible and inclusive living-learning environments. As a result, our RAs understand the importance of using residential community Facebook pages to enhance community.”

Former Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov defended Russian foreign policy on Syria and the United Nations in ICC Auditorium on Thursday evening.
“Russian Foreign Policy in the 21st Century” was sponsored by the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies.
Ivanov referred to Syria and how the international community should react swiftly to deal with its crisis.
“Any further delay with dealing with the conflict will be detrimental to everyone, to the Syrians, the Middle East, to the global community at large,” Ivanov said. “If nothing is done by the international community in the near future, Syria is likely to turn into a failed state with a ruined economy, broken infrastructure, paralyzed political institutions and plenty of military hardware floating around.”
Ivanov discussed Russia’s place in the international community and its relationship with the United States.
“In my view, a lot of Western interpretations of the Russian foreign policy are not accurate and demonstrate a lot of political bias,” Ivanov said.
He then dispelled three myths that he thought characterized the U.S. view of Russian foreign policy: Russia as an isolationist state, Russian foreign policy aimed at complicating life for American politicians and Russia shifting its focus away from the West toward the East.
Ivanov used Syria as an example to show the incompetence of the international in dealing with conflicts.
“The modern international system has an evident deficit of governance. Since the end of the Cold War, not a single major international conflict was successfully resolved,” he said.
He pointed out a trend of rising regional conflicts, which he believes will continue and yield new crises and casualties.
“This trend means that all of us clearly failed to meet our responsibilities in maintaining international peace and stability,” Ivanov said.
Nevertheless, he attested that states are now unified against a common threat against security and shared challenges.
“It would not be an exaggeration to say that today we have a global consensus on matters of international security, something that we did not have for the most part of the previous century,” Ivanov said.
To combat these problems in international affairs, the former foreign minister offered some of his own ideas based on his experience as a statesman and diplomat.
According to Ivanov, the United Nations is the most legitimate and experienced international entity skilled in dealing with international security problems. He proposed that measures should be taken to improve the organization.
“To make the United Nations more efficient and more productive, we need to change our attitudes towards the institution,” he said. “In my view, we can change the U.N. only if the members of the great powers can put their interests aside and convince themselves to work together in order to resolve security problems.”
Dominic LaMantia (COL ’17) said that Ivanov offered insight into Russian foreign policy.
“It was interesting to hear both his personal views of the foreign policy realm, more specifically on Russian foreign policy in particular,” LaMantia said. “His [belief in the] importance of the U.N. in future foreign policy endeavors was very interesting. I’m not sure if I completely agree with it, but it’s something worth considering.”

The Georgetown Business Improvement District held its last community meeting for its Georgetown 2028 plan Thursday evening.
The Georgetown 2028 project, which held its first meeting this summer, aims to discover various projects that would benefit the Georgetown neighborhood. According to BID, most large projects take 15 years to complete, which is why the group is aiming for completion by 2028.
As BID has been collecting opinions throughout the summer at meetings and online, the meeting was primarily to evaluate and refine pre-existing ideas. In particular, several suggestions to Georgetown 2028 focused on transportation.
“Georgetown is in a transport crisis,” Dmitry Zakharov (SFS ’09), who worked with BID on the Metro project, said.
Pedestrians, cyclists and drivers who were in attendance agreed, particularly with regard to M Street’s constant congestion.
BID Transportation Director Jonathan Kass proposed the creation of a Georgetown Metro stop.
According to Zakhrov, however, there are several issues with that proposal, particularly its $6 billion price tag. More pressing, however, is the question of practical implementation.
“The passage from Rosslyn to Foggy Bottom is the biggest constraint,” Zakhrov said.
According to Zakhrov, the current Rosslyn-Foggy Bottom passageway can only handle 26 trains per hour, which are used by the Orange and Blue lines. To expand capacity, the Metro is currently considering the creation of another trans-Potomac tunnel for the Blue line. The best way for Georgetown to add a stop would be during that process, but it is expected to happen in 2040.
“We have a major problem with getting tourists to get here,” Karen Daly from the Dumbarton House said. “It would be a huge benefit from the historical house view.”
Nevertheless, several residents expressed concern over a possible Metro stop because of the influx of more people. Several business owners were also concerned about the effect of three to five years of construction on their businesses.
Other transportation suggestions included a pedestrian bridge to Roosevelt Island that would link bike paths from Virginia to D.C., a streetcar and a Gondola from Georgetown University to Rosslyn.
Meeting attendees also focused on transforming the area near K Street. Several participants called the area a “multimodal gateway to Georgetown,” where bike trails, streetcars, water taxis and foot traffic from the Foggy Bottom Metro station converge. Through Georgetown 2028, BID is considering options to entice residents and visitors away from the waterfront toward M Street and its various restaurants and retail opportunities.
One proposed option was to develop the empty lots between K Street and M Street, including possible new buildings, a street market or by extending sidewalks. Another possible resource is the C&O Canal. Although historically important to the neighborhood, the canal has largely faded from relevance. Expanding the walkways is part of a potential plan to rejuvenate the area.
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the price of the new Metro stop would be $6 million, rather than $6 billion.

Although he is usually not visible when his speeches are delivered, President Barack Obama’s former speechwriter Jon Favreau took the stage at Gaston on Thursday night to offer insights into writing, politics and career opportunities.
Favreau served as the president’s director of speechwritingfrom 2009 to 2013 before leaving the White House to work for consulting firm Fenway Strategies. Favreau said that his path to politics and to the position he eventually attained in the Obama administration was anything but assured as an undergrad.
“When I was a senior in college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. It wasn’t until the night before graduation that I got an offer from John Kerry’s communications director,” Favreau said. “I was paid $20,000 a year, and I shared a tiny Capitol Hill basement apartment with some rats.”
Favreau said that through determination, hard work and more than a few sleepless nights, he eventually got a break.
“One day, when the campaign was almost broke and couldn’t afford to hire any real speechwriters, I became the most affordable option,” Favreau said.
Favreau described his first encounter with his former boss as a less-than-pleasant experience, when he was forced to inform then-Sen. Obama that he would have to remove a particular line from his speech for the 2004 Democratic National Convention.
“He walked over to within an inch of my face, looked down at me, and said, ‘Are you trying to tell me to take my favorite line out of this speech?’” Favreau said. “Great first impression for a future boss.”
Throughout his time in the White House, Favreau was continuously impressed by Obama’s character.
“One of the most valuable lessons I learned from the president was about authenticity and about honesty,” Favreau said.
He emphasized the importance of resisting cynicism and maintaining an original perspective.
“To me, cynicism is just an excuse not to act … an excuse not to try. Our job is to try,” Favreau said. “In my experience, if you are willing to persevere, if you are willing to tune out the cynicism and believe in what you are doing, you will make a difference, not only in the lives of the people you help, but above all, in your own.”
Favreau responded to questions from the audience, including one on why he chose to get involved in politics.
“The reason anyone would want to go into this is because whether you do or not, decisions are going to be made that have huge impacts on people’s lives, and actually can change the course of the world. And we can be a part of those decisions,” Favreau said.
He added that it is this ability to influence people’s lives that drives him as well as many of his colleagues.
“When you actually hear people say ‘My life changed in a better way because of something you helped achieve,’ that is a great thing to hear,” he said.

As email, e-cards and online newsletters increasingly replace traditional snail mail, the U.S. Postal Service announced that it will raise the price of stamps from 46 cents to 49 cents in an attempt to close its $20 billion deficit.
“It was a last resort,” said Katina Fields, senior public relations representative for the Postal Service.
Over the past year, the Postal Service has reduced its costs by over $16 billion, consolidating 306 mail process facilities, reducing about 22,000 city delivery routes, reducing the number of town post offices by about 7,500 and reducing its workforce by 2,000 employees — 29 percent of its original workforce.
“The problem,” Fields said, “is that it’s not enough.”
The increase in stamp prices — which will take effect on Jan. 26, 2014 — will raise $2 billion of revenue each year, theoretically balancing the budget in 10 years. Currently, the Postal Service takes in $40 billion a year from stamp sales — 43 percent of revenues.
Fields, however, characterized it as only a short-term solution because the Postal Service’s financial problems are ongoing. If the Postal Service is unable to raise enough revenue to balance its budget, it may require a taxpayer bailout of nearly $50 billion in 2017.
According to The Atlantic, the Postal Service currently stands to lose $6 billion this year, less than 2012’s $16 billion losses.
For a long-term solution, the Postal Service has pushed Congress for the last two years to pass legislation that would drastically cut costs by closing more facilities, eliminating Saturday deliveries and allowing the Postal Service to determine its own healthcare plan.
In February, the Postal Service announced a plan to limit Saturday deliveries to packages, which would have saved the agency $2 billion. Congress, however, refused and attached a six-day delivery requirement to the Postal Service’s funding. Although the Postal Service does not receive taxpayer dollars, its funding is still controlled by the federal government.
Nevertheless, Congress itself has yet to propose a bill to address the Postal Service’s budgetary problems.
“When people call here, angry about prices going up, I always tell them, well, contact your local senator, contact your congressperson, because we need the postal reforms to be passed,” Fields said. “If you’re angry about the changes, then do something about it.”
The Postal Service is legally permitted to increase all of its prices up to a cap of 5 percent per year.
“We just use the cap in other areas of our prices, but this year, you know, people are really feeling it because the stamp prices have gone up 5 percent,” Fields said.
The Postal Service spent over $550,000 last week to hire marketing company Faith Popcorn’s BrainReserve to judge both the future of the organization at large, as well as the viability of the stamp. Although a large portion of Postal Service revenue currently comes from stamp sales, NBC News reported that the Postal Service expected a drop of 4 percent to 0.5 percent in first-class mail pieces from 84 billion in 2009 to 50 billion in 2020.
“Technology’s forever changing,” Fields said. “You have people who are hacking the Internet now, and maybe people aren’t going to trust the Internet, they’re going to go back to putting a stamp on something and dropping it off at the mail. It all depends on technology and what happens to the Internet in the future.”

Following an outpouring of student opposition to an off-campus housing option and a flurry of on-campus construction projects, the university introduced its second stage of master planning in a Planning 201 session Wednesday evening.
The forum covered a wide range of planning developments, including on and off-campus housing options, changes to Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle routes and current and future projects, like the Intercollegiate Athletic Center, Healey Family Student Center and Northeast Triangle Residence Hall.
Perhaps most notably, the event was the first chance for community members to respond to the university’s announcement that it is has filed a request with the D.C. Zoning Commission to change the designated use of Ryan, Mulledy and Gervase Halls to include “residential, campus life and athletic” along with the current “academic and administrative” designation. The requested change would allow the university to pursue student housing in the building, a featured alternative in the student-initiated “One Georgetown, One Campus” campaign.
Although the session included some major announcements, hardly anyone was there to hear them. Roughly a dozen people attended, about half of whom were students.
The former Jesuit residences, Ryan and Mulledy, have remained vacant since 2003 due to an asbestos problem, while Gervase currently houses administrative offices.
“It’s sitting there deteriorating. Let’s invest in it now and make it a temporary residence that you can help support meeting our commitment,” Vice President for Planning and Facilities Robin Morey said in an interview with The Hoya on Thursday.
If converted, the building would likely be designed to allow a transition from a temporary housing solution to an academic building once the university is able to find long-term housing solutions. Georgetown is responding to requirements of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, which include housing an additional 385 students on campus by fall 2015 and housing 90 percent of students on campus by fall 2025.
“You think about the rooms in there and how you design those rooms, and you can theoretically flip them to common space that could be a combination of administrative and program space,” Moreysaid.
For long-term housing solutions, however, administrators are looking closely at both Harbin Terrace and Kober-Cogan, a vacant building owned by MedStar Georgetown University Hospital.
A dorm on Harbin Terrace, which could house approximately 350 beds, is an option favored by administrators.
In response to intense student criticism, administrators have also reconsidered the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center as an on-campus housing option. The option had been ruled out last March because of the revenue the university receives from the hotel.
Olson noted that satellite housing for undergraduates is still on the table as a temporary solution until permanent housing solutions can be constructed on campus.
“Northeast Triangle is the first priority for new beds on campus. We’re also exploring the possibilities of off-campus housing options. We know that most students have expressed that they don’t like this option at all,” Olson said. “We certainly have a real preference to have student housing on campus. Everyone agrees that’s optimal and ideal.”
While a redesigned Northeast Triangle dorm received favorable feedback when revealed to students in late August, the design has yet to be approved by the Old Georgetown Board, whose Thursday meeting was cancelled due to the government shutdown.
“We expect to get conceptual design approval very shortly from OGB. It’s a little bit up in the air with the government shutdown,” Senior Architect Jodi Ernst said. “We’re at a stage where we have about nine months of drawing left.”
With respect to future campus planning, administrators discussed two initiatives in the works: a faculty collaboration survey and the “Next 100 Acres.”
The survey, to be conducted in late October, will identify which departments work together regularly and attempt to move their respective offices closer together.
“One thing we really wanted to do was ask faculty how they collaborate with each other, and then that will get overlaid onto the physical footprint of where the offices are, how they work and where their classrooms are,” Morey said.
Morey discussed upcoming changes to GUTS bus routes, which reflect a clause in the campus plan agreement that stipulates that all bus routes, except the shuttle to Wisconsin Avenue, will be required to enter and leave campus through the Canal Road entrance, rerouting the Dupont Circle line and removing the Car Barn bus stop.
“We have determined that our passengers are willing to deal with an additional 11 minutes between stops, and we are doing our best to limit increases in travel time to that amount,” Morey said.
While three routes are under consideration, the primary route would include a roundabout in front of the Lombardi Cancer center, with bus stops by Southwest Quad and near the Leavey Hotel entrance.

Participants on this year’s Alternative Spring Break will see a more cohesive, multidimensional program incorporating reflection into all aspects of the trip than in previous years.
Since its inception in 1974, Alternative Spring Break has sent students to locations from Detroit and the Alabama Gulf Coast to engage in a weeklong service venture.
With applications for ASB trips hitting an all-time high of 340 last year, board members have chosen to make this a year of growth for the organization.
“One of our focuses as a board this year is for it to be a formative year for ASB,” Head of ASB Board Stefan Rajiyah (SFS ’14) said. “We really want leaders to be focused on more this year and hopefully for years to come.”
ASB leaders are looking to increase the amount of participant involvement both before and after trips to bring home the message of ASB. In previous years, the program offered limited pre-trip activities and little follow up.
“My experience with pre-trips has been, ‘Let’s get together and get to know each other and go out to dinner.’” ASB trip leader Karyn Miller (NHS ’15) said.
To that end, Miller, who will be co-leading a Native American immersion trip to North Carolina, plans to take her group to the National Museum of the American Indian ahead of spring break.
The new effort will also increase post-trip activities with ASB-wide events that may include a week focused on social justice and reflection.
At a leader retreat in September, board members emphasized the importance of examining the effects of their actions, especially with respect to planning these trips.
“The intentionality aspect is not just for our trips but also in the structure of ASB itself,” Appalachia trip leader Samantha Lin (SFS ’14) said. “The leaders went on a daylong retreat, and everything we did was intentional.”
One goal of this increased attention to intentionality in the planning stages of the ASB trips is to bridge the gap between community service and cultural immersion.
“In the past, trips have been categorized as either service or immersion trips, and we don’t see this dichotomy,” ASB Marketing Chair Kayla Corcoran (COL ’15) said. “All trips are cultural and justice immersion trips.”
Trips will also explore the sociopolitical context of their communities.
“We’re not just doing activities to take up time,” Corcoran said. “We’re going to think about the historic relevance, the cultural relevance and the political relevance, and we’re going to make sure that our participants have the tools to think about those kinds of issues.”
Former trip participant Katie Bui (COL ’16) appreciated ASB’s broader focus.
“I think that while you can learn from just doing community work, putting an emphasis on the trajectory of your work is much more important,” Bui said.
By selecting meaningful activities for participants to engage in both before and during the trips, the ASB board hopes to encourage participants to increase involvement with CSJ and other service programs during the year.
“We’re looking at ASB not just as a one-week commitment but as a commitment to social justice that goes beyond that week,” Corcoran said.

Poet, human rights activist and Georgetown professor Carolyn Forché was the recipient of this year’s Academy of American Poets fellowship.
Forché currently serves as director of the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice at Georgetown. She is also the author of four collections of poetry and most recently co-authored an anthology, “The Poetry of Witness: The Tradition in English: 1500-2001” with English professor Duncan Wu.
The Academy of American Poets fellowship, which has been awarded to poets for distinguished poetic achievement since 1936, includes a stipend of $25,000. Past recipients include e.e. cummings, Ezra Pound and alumnus J.D. McClatchy (CAS ’67).
“To be singled out for this was both a stunning surprise and a deep honor. I still don’t believe it,”Forché said.
Each year, one poet is selected by a group of 15 award-winning American poets.
“Our organization very much admires her work,” Academy of American Poets Executive Director Jennifer Benka said. “The fellowship is given for distinguished poetic achievement and obviously Carolyn Forché has demonstrated that with the number of books she has published and, beyond that, her commitment to human rights.”
Writing has always been a passion for Forché, who began reading and writing poetry at age nine under her mother’s guidance.
“My mother taught me about meter and rhyme and the sonnet form. She gave me what I now realize were her college textbooks when I was a little girl,” Forché said. “I began writing [poems], I enjoyed it. I was enchanted.”
Forché’s zeal for creative writing took her to graduate school at Bowling Green State University, where she also developed a passion for teaching. Forché went on to teach at the University of Virginia, Skidmore College, Columbia University, San Diego State University and George Mason University before coming to Georgetown where she is the Lannan Chair in Poetry.
Much of Forché’s writing has been informed by her involvement with human rights activism in war-stricken countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, Lebanon and South Africa during apartheid.
“I had really thought that the human rights work and the poetry were separate for a long time, but there was a fusion as the experiences I had in these places entered the writing,” Forché said.
While Forché does not consider her poetry to be political, she does recognize the contentious nature of her work, so she was surprised when she was selected to receive the fellowship.
“When one is doing controversial work, one doesn’t expect rewards,” Forché said.
The Board of Chancellors at the Academy of American Poets felt otherwise. In a citation prepared forForché, AAP Chancellor Juan Felipe Herrera said that Forché’s accounts of war and peril made her an appealing candidate for the fellowship.
“Carolyn Forché’s poems deny us escape,” Herrera wrote. “Here is a prophet-poet mashed in newspapers, fish tins, pine roots, spirit chants and pushed down cut-off ears of los desaparecidos, the ‘disappeared’ in El Salvador; with her eyes cut into stanzas and her khaki shirt soaked with impossible love for a country, a nation, a humanity … riddled with vast indifference and expensive war suffering.”
Dennis Todd, interim chair of the English Department, was not surprised by news of Forché’s award.
“Anyone who is familiar with contemporary poetry knows how richly she deserves the award,” Todd wrote in an email. “I hope one of the effects of this honor will be that more and more people will come to recognize what a treasure the university has in her.”
Forché will accept the award later this month at the Poets Forum, held at the Academy of American Poets in New York. She will also give the Blaney Lecture during the forum, an honor unrelated to her receiving the fellowship.
“It’s lovely that [the award] comes at this time for me, when I finished a new book and when the anthology is about to come out and when I’m here at Georgetown,” Forché said. “It’s nice to be here when this occurs. I’ll never forget this moment, the moment of having this special honor.”

With updated design plans and approval from the Old Georgetown Board, the university is set to break ground on the Intercollegiate Athletics Center in the spring of 2014.
The IAC is still going through the required approval process. The school hopes that this authorization will move quickly enough to allow them to begin building the IACtoward the end of the spring tennis season between May and August. The IAC will be built where the courts are currently.
“Last week we got a very good finalized — almost finalized — approval from the OGB,” Associate Director of Athletics for Operations and Facilities Brian McGuire said. “Basically, they said go ahead.”
The university is now working to finish schematic designs. The next step is to develop design drawings, which are expected to take three months. Construction drawings will take another three to four months.
Though the project has been in the works for the past eight years, financial and design issues have kept it from being realized thus far.
“Raising money at this time during this economy, it’s difficult to get the funds in,” McGuire said. “We’ve had a lot of different designs. Originally — and this goes way back — the design was for a much larger building, a much more expensive building.”
Changes to the design are due not only to a budget constraint but also a change in architecture firm midway through the project. Bowie Gridley of Washington, D.C., the lead architecture firm for construction of the IAC, is being assisted by Populous of Kansas City for interior design and programming expertise. HNTB of Kansas City and Hughes Architects of Sterling, Va., were previously involved in the project.
Disagreement with the OGB over design has also slowed down the project.
“We had some issues with OGB in the beginning as well about the mass of the building and the size of the building versus what it looked like,” McGuire said. “It’s interesting, the OGB, one of the first comments they had to us was: ‘It doesn’t look enough like a gym, It looks more like a dormitory.’ So that was a change that we had to do about almost a year ago.”
Though IAC construction will require removal of all the university’s outdoor tennis courts, officials have yet to find a replacement for this loss.
“We’re looking at options on and off site for tennis courts,” university architect Regina Bleck said “It’s more probable that they would be off campus.”
Should construction continue as planned in late spring after the end of the tennis season, the facility could open by the beginning of summer 2016.
While designed for student-athletes, Bleck said the facility will benefit the entire campus by freeing up space in Yates Athletic Center.
“It helps everyone else because it decompresses space within Yates. This facility serves every student-athlete on campus,” Bleck said.
The IAC will mark the first time Georgetown has expanded its athletics facilities since 1951, when McDonough Arena was built on campus to house six sports teams. The athletics department has long been pushing for new varsity facilities.
“This building is sorely needed,” McGuire said. “We need a weight room, we need a sports medicine room that accommodates 750 athletes, we need locker rooms and most importantly we need a training facility for our men’s and women’s basketball teams. That’s the most important part. We’re falling so far behind our competitors right now.”
“This is a game-changer,” McGuire added. “This is going to change the quality of the athletic experience for our athletes, all our athletes. This is the best thing to happen for our athletes since McDonough in 1951.”

Overall reported crime increased at Georgetown’s main campus but decreased at the Georgetown University Law Center in downtown D.C. this year, according to the Department of Public Safety’s 2013 Annual Crime Report.
The report highlights reported crime trends at the two D.C. campuses and the McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies in Alanya, Turkey; Villa Le Balze in Florence, Italy; and the School of Foreign Service in Qatar between Jan. 1, 2012, and Dec. 31, 2012, compared to similar data from the previous two years.
Overall reported crime, which does not include theft or citations for possession of alcohol, drugs or weapons, increased nearly twofold from 2011 to 2012 on main campus. In 2011, there were 43 reported crimes, compared to 72 in 2012.
Of this increase, the largest rise was seen in reported burglaries in main campus buildings and residence halls, which rose from 35 in 2011 to 55 in 2012. Main campus buildings, including office buildings, suffered the largest increase in reported burglaries, rising from seven incidents in 2011 to 38 in 2012.
DPS Deputy Chief and Associate Director Joseph Smith attributed the increase in office burglaries to an increase in reported cases, not an increase in incidents.
“We have been really proactive in increasing reporting,” DPS Sergeant Talib Abdur-Rahim said. “Before, things would happen, but people didn’t always really report it every single time.”
Reported burglaries in residence halls decreased from 28 to 17.
“We really have pushed hard to educate the students on residential security,” Smith said.
Thefts, which do not involve unlawful entry and are not included in overall crime statistics, rose from 219 to 235 this year.
Reported aggravated assault, which does not include forcible sexual offenses, increased from two incidents in 2011 to eight incidents in 2012, with seven of those occurring in main campus buildings.
Non-arrests for drugs, alcohol and possession of weapons, which are referred to the Office of Student Conduct, peaked at 483 in 2010 and have fallen in the last two years to 238 cases in 2012, representing a nearly 51 percent drop. Cases in which students were arrested for drugs, alcohol and possession of weapons similarly decreased from six to zero between 2011 and 2012.
Total reported crimes at the law center dropped from 11 to seven in 2012, although 2012 represented an increase from 2011’s three reported crimes.
The report cites no reported crimes in the last three years at the university’s McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies, at Villa Le Balze or at the Doha, Qatar campus of the School of Foreign Service.
According to Smith, there have been reports of one office burglary and eight bicycle thefts so far this semester, in addition to a noticeable decrease in laptop thefts.

The Georgetown University Student Association launched an alumni networking guide this past summer to help student organizations build stronger relationships with their alumni bases.
The Student Organization Networking Guide, created by GUSA Assistant Secretary of Alumni and Career Services Mitchel Hochberg (SFS ’15), is essentially a blueprint for how student organizations can establish an alumni network.
“I wanted the guide to be broad enough and specific enough to be usable by a wide variety of student organizations,” Hochberg said. “So there are tips on different techniques and the best practices, like a Facebook group or an exit survey for seniors.”
Hochberg said he wanted to create the guide because he felt strengthening organizations’ alumni networks would greatly benefit members.
“You are going to have access in terms of people, money, events and knowledge that you wouldn’t have otherwise,” Hochberg said.
GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Tane Arana-Humphries (SFS ’15), who oversees Alumni and Career Services, acknowledged the difficulties of forming these student-alumni relationships.
“It can be intimidating to reach out when there’s very little known commonality between your Hoya experience and the alumni’s experience,” she said. “Knowing you have at least one common interest gives you a talking point, makes you a little more comfortable and can make the difference between a future career connection.”
Arana-Humphries also said she believes SONG would be valuable for organizations, regardless of their type or size.
“Georgetown organizations, minus a select few, are lacking in strong alumni bases and there’s no reason for it other than a lack of infrastructure,” she said. “It can seem daunting to start putting that stuff in place, and this really takes the legwork out of the process.”
Georgetown International Relations Club Chair Jeff Caso (SFS ’15) said the International Relations Club contacted alumni this past summer and was pleased to find many of them, especially ones who lived locally, looking to get more involved.
“I feel that the guide is a nice way to put to paper what a lot of clubs have traditionally been doing,” Caso said.
Last Friday, the IRC held its first official Homecoming event with about 100 alumni. The club is planning more pre-professional events with local alumni involvement.
Other groups view an alumni base as a way to further current opportunities.
“I think the guide is a great idea, and depending on the nature of one’s club, it can be a very effective tool in connecting current Hoyas with those that have gone on to be very successful in whatever it is that they do,” Men’s Club Basketball President David Burton (MSB ’15) said. “Strengthening our alumni base could affect our club with potential sponsorships, industry experts and familiar faces when we travel along the east coast.”
According to Hochberg, while SONG could certainly help with fundraising and procuring job opportunities for members, the primary focus is on developing mentor relationships first.
“We want freshmen and sophomores meeting these alumni and approaching it from an informational perspective much more than a networking, get-me-a-job perspective,” Hochberg said. “You can build relationships with these alumni, and you then have a variety of contacts who have experience and who can help you. And then if you do want a job, you have someone you know.”
As for the alumni, Hochberg said SONG is aimed at reconnecting with graduates specifically from the last 10 years.
“Those who graduated from the last 10 years are much more likely to get involved and associate their time with a specific group rather than the school in general,” Hochberg said.
The Student Activities Commission advertised SONG in an email to student organization leaders at the beginning of the semester.
Still, Hochberg was unsure of how the guide has been utilized so far.
“We’re still in the outreach phase of the guide. We want to get groups to be able to hear from each other and talk about what they liked with the guide,” Hochberg said. “Our hope is within a few years or semesters, there will be a point where groups across campus have started to use SONG and that it is able to help and provide benefits to these organizations and students that they would not have had otherwise.”

Georgetown dedicated and blessed the Calcagnini Contemplative Center in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains on Thursday after two years of construction and a $17 million donation from Arthur (C ’54) and Nancy Calcagnini.
The center, which will house Campus Ministry retreats, department meetings and other university retreats, has been under construction for two years but ArthurCalcagnini’s vision for a Georgetown-owned retreat center reflects decades of ideas.
Arthur Calcagnini, former chair and member of the Board of Regents and the board of directors, respectively, fully endowed ESCAPE in 1991 after he and his wife attended an Ignatian retreat. They have remained a constant presence within the ESCAPE program, with Arthur Calcagnini participating in retreats almost every year.
The two-decade process of choosing a location ended with the discovery of a property in Clarke County, Va.
“Have you ever heard of love at first sight?” Arthur Calcagnini said. “It was so awesome walking on this location, seeing the view and thinking that students could come here and feel so relaxed and really get in touch with nature.”
At the dedication on Thursday, speakers focused on how the center would be an extension of Georgetown.
“[Georgetown’s location] was and is still an ideal setting: a hill, overlooking a river,” Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., said. “Students, faculty, staff and alumni of Georgetown, each with a story to tell and a dream to share, with prayers to be voiced and friendships to be made will come here to this holy mountain.”
Magdalena Buczek (COL ’13), a former ESCAPE coordinator, emphasized the impact of her ESCAPE retreat.
“It is by listening that I knew what my next step would be,” Buczek said. “I finally understood why God had brought me to Georgetown.”
At the end of the ceremony, University President John J. DeGioia presented Georgetown’s gift to theCalcagnini family: a cross that sat atop Healy Hall for more than a century. The cross, which was removed following structural inspections after an earthquake in August 2011, is meant to represent the connection between the main campus and the center.
There are numerous structural differences between ESCAPE’s former location at Shepherd’s Spring Outdoor Ministry Center in Maryland, which Georgetown rented, and the new center.
“The center is designed for the flow of the retreats, especially for ESCAPE,” Arthur Calcagnini said. “It just made it much easier.”
Students began to use the Calcagnini Center with the first ESCAPE retreat of the year on Sept. 20.
“The contrast is pretty stark,” ESCAPE team leader Eric Nevalsky (SFS ’16) said. “Shepherd’s Spring had a very cozy feel to it. It was built decades ago, and all the furniture was very worn-in … whereas when you go to the Calcagnini Center, everything is brand new.”
The center’s resources also provide a point of attraction for new ESCAPE participants.
“It’s definitely a good selling point, because the rooms that you stay in and the food that you get are amazing,” Nevalsky said. “When we’re talking to freshmen, trying to get them to come on the retreat, we mention the Calcagnini Center a lot.”
O’Brien agreed, saying that he expects more students to attend campus ministry’s retreats.
“Having a home for all of our retreats will make them even more attractive,” O’Brien said. “So our hope is that even more students will want to go on our retreats.”
Despite the shift in setting, the program’s core mission has not changed.
“The format hasn’t changed,” Arthur Calcagnini said during his speech. “Students get piled into a bus and leave campus for 27 hours. And that has proven to be a life-changing experience for many of them.”
Looking forward, O’Brien hopes to develop new retreats, mentioning the idea of introducing retreats unaffiliated with any religion.
“We’re hearing about that need for students who aren’t religious to have time and space and programs to address their needs, so that’s what we’re thinking about now,” O’Brien said.
Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the cross on Healy Hall fell off after the August 2011 earthquake. It was removed following structural inspections after the earthquake.

Dignitaries, faculty and students gathered in Gaston Hall and Alumni Square courtyard Wednesday to dedicate a memorial to former Czech President Václav Havel.
Georgetown established the Václav Havel’s Place memorial in Alumni Square in collaboration with the Embassy of the Czech Republic, the Václav Havel Library in Prague and the American Friends of the Czech Republic.
Havel, who died in 2011, was a prominent dissident and human rights activist during the communist rule in his country. He was the last president of Czechoslovakia and the first president of the newly formed Czech Republic.
The memorial consists of a linden tree, a national symbol of the Czech Republic, between two chairs, surrounded by pea gravel, a stone wall and concentric circles of grass. The embassy chose Georgetown as the host site due to Havel’s ties with the university, which he visited on his first trip to the United States.
“Some of it was happenstance, but I think as he knew more and more about [Georgetown], I think he appreciated the whole aspect of a liberal education,” former Secretary of State and Georgetown professor Madeleine Albright, a longtime friend of Havel, said in an interview with The Hoya.
The celebration consisted of a video presentation and panel in Gaston Hall, followed by a procession to Alumni Square for the dedication of the memorial itself.
Director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies Angela Stent moderated the program and delivered introductory remarks, which included reflection of Havel’s first visit to Georgetown in February 1990 with a group of students who participated in the Velvet Revolution. She noted how Havel, on the Gaston stage, yielded to the students.
“I challenge you to think of any other president … who would defer to students,” Stent said.
A short video featured testimonials from journalist Fareed Zakaria, singer Suzanne Vega, the Dalai Lama, writer and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel and Anglo-Czech playwright Tom Stoppard.
“He was a benign, kind person, so it’s somewhat of a miracle that he ended up as president of anything,”” Stoppard said in the video.
The Dalai Lama spoke of Havel’s vision and the responsibility the world has to recognize the potential of its entire population.
“As a Buddhist monk, I believe his spirit will continue in different forms,” he said.
As attendees left the hall to proceed to the Alumni Square courtyard, paper carnations lined the path, both in Healy and outside. Students also handed out carnation stems to passersby.
University President John J. DeGioia welcomed the assembled from a platform in the Alumni Square courtyard.
“Through [Havel’s] leadership in the Velvet Revolution, he demonstrated for the world the power of non-violence. He exemplified a thoughtful and steadfast leadership, unfailing in his dedication to the public good,” DeGioia said. “We believe in the free and unfettered pursuit of truth for the betterment of the world.”
The Czech First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Jiří Schneider alluded to upcoming elections in the Czech Republic in discussing Havel’s legacy.
“We need courage even in democracy. … Courage is not only needed against tyranny,” he said. “I hope my fellow citizens will express courage and maturity.”
AFOCR Chairman Fred Malek, whose organization supervised and paid for much of the construction, delivered remarks.
“[It’s a] modest tribute … but fitting, because it signifies the man and what he stood for,” Malek said.
In her interview with The Hoya following the celebration, Albright commented on Havel’s courage.
“His courage came from watching what was happening to these powerless people and that he drew his courage from the circumstances in which he lived. He was absolutely amazing. … He was in the face of authorities all the time,” Albright said. “He did things just to kind of push the envelope all the time.”
Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., blessed the site before Havel’s widow, Dagmar Havlová, cut the ribbon to the memorial.
Albright said she might venture to Václav Havel’s Place on occasion.
“It has this interesting aspect of being peaceful but in the middle of things, and I think the way he would feel honored is if people gathered and talked about some of the principles and weren’t afraid to argue with each other,” Albright said. “There’s nothing wrong with disagreeing, and I think he would like it if people used the place to have discussions about ethics and human rights and the human condition. I think it’s lovely.”
