The Georgetown branch of the United States Postal Service will be sold to a real estate developer.
According to the Washington Examiner, post office, which is located at 1215 31st Street NW, will be bought by EastBanc for $4.5 million. The developing company owns numerous properties in the Georgetown area on M Street and Wisconsin Avenue.
After EastBanc officially purchases the building, a post office will still operate on the site.
