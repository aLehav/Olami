The results of last Thursday’s Georgetown University Student Association senate restructuring referendum will not be released or certified before winter break, after the GUSA Constitutional Council extended its enjoinment of the Election Commission at a public hearing yesterday.
The ruling comes on the heels of a complaint of unlawful electioneering filed late Thursday evening. The complaint alleged that GUSA members violated the association’s constitution and bylaws by electioneering at polling stations, offering food at polling stations as bribes, placing an excessive amount of “yes” posters at polling stations and locating tabling stations outside permitted tabling zones.
The Election Commission normally has 72 hours after the end of voting for the referendum to release the results, which slotted the release for Sunday at 11:59 p.m. However, this evening’s decision ensures the enjoinment will remain in place until the council announces its formal opinion on the complaint by Jan. 20.
GUSA bylaws require the council to release its formal opinion 10 working days after the case is heard, excluding final examination periods and holiday breaks. The council said it plans to write its decision during winter break.
The commission first announced it would hold the results early Friday morning after the Constitutional Council initially received the complaint alleging campaign violations.
The decision to continue holding the election results past the typical deadline was announced at 6:08 p.m., several hours after the council held the public hearing on the complaint.
GUSA Senators Jasmin Ouseph (SFS ’19), Isaac Liu (COL ’20) and Charles Hajjar (MSB ’20), GUSA Free Speech Policy Team Chair D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17), GUSA Dining and Auxiliary Services Policy Team Chair Mark Camilli (COL ’19) and Dylan Hughes (COL ’19), who is unaffiliated with GUSA, filed the complaint Thursday evening.
GUSA Senate Speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ’18), GUSA Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) and GUSA Senator William Morris (COL ’19), who represented GUSA as respondents at the hearing, said the results should be released by the Election Commission.
According to Ouseph, there is evidence that the electioneering was intentional and planned by GUSA.
“There is substantial evidence of people being encouraged to vote ‘yes’ at the GUSA polling stations that were set up last Thursday. There’s also evidence of GUSA leadership explicitly stating that the primary intent of polling stations was to mobilize voters and get club funding reform passed,” Ouseph said at the hearing. “The overall majority of people who were staffing these tables were supporters of the amendment.”
In an email sent Wednesday obtained by The Hoya, GUSA members manning the polling booths were told they were allowed to explain the referendums, but that they could not force voters to vote for or against the referendum.
The petitioners also testified that several of the polling stations prominently featured  “yes” flyers, without a comparable number of posters espousing the opposite view.
“All of this indicates that there was a premeditated effort by GUSA leadership to sway the vote at polling stations,” Ouseph said.
Mullaney said the volunteers’ conduct at polling stations was legal because the bylaws prohibiting electioneering at polling stations only apply to candidates and contain no restrictions on campaigns for referendums.
“First, that the use of polling stations was unconstitutional — we believe this claim is incorrect due to the bylaws and well-established precedent. In the bylaws, it does state that candidates or anyone acting on behalf of a candidate cannot set up polling stations with electronic equipment. In a referendum, there are no candidates,” Mullaney said at the hearing. “There are no rules in the bylaws governing the campaigns of referenda.”
GUSA Election Commissioner Aiden Fletcher (SFS ’17), who argued on behalf of the respondents, said the electioneering was not in keeping with the spirit of campaign rules, but did not violate the bylaws or constitution in their current forms.
“The bylaws were very narrowly interpreted. It was a very strict reading, and it didn’t align perhaps with the values of what I think makes an ethical campaign. And the restrictions we’ve put on candidates should definitely apply to referendums,” Fletcher said. “I’m saying should, because I do not think they currently do. You can see that GUSA was out of sync with the spirit of those rules, but they were totally within the bounds with what they did. I don’t think there’s any constitutional standing or bylaw standing to prosecute.”
The petitioners also argued that one of the polling stations was set up in front of O’Donovan Hall, outside the free-speech zones designated in the university’s Speech and Expression Policy, making them improper.
Because the interior of Leo’s is a free speech zone, the location of the polling station outside Leo’s is not relevant, according to Morris.
“It was set up on the left-hand side of the door. The other side of the door is a free-speech zone, and inside is also a free-speech zone,” Morris said. “So if we’re really debating over moving it over 20 feet as the issue of this referendum, I don’t know if that is as pertinent.”
Neither the outside nor the inside of Leo’s is listed as free-speech zones in the university’s Speech and Expression Policy. The only free-speech zones listed that do not require special permitting are public squares and certain locations outside of Lauinger Library, Henle Village, Darnall Hall and the Healey Family Student Center.
All the other polling stations set up by GUSA were within free-speech zones. The table outside Leo’s was removed for logistical reasons before the illegality of the polling location was brought to the attention of the volunteers.
Mullaney said he would support a discussion of changing or clarifying campaign rules in the future, but that under the current rules, GUSA acted legally and with good intentions.
“I agree that while we can think that certain actions are probably inappropriate from GUSA, that is separate from the legality of the actions themselves, which I believe were absolutely allowed by the constitution and the bylaws and GUSA acted in completely good faith,” Mullaney said.
In an interview with The Hoya, Camilli said the bylaws, though narrowly worded in reference to candidates, were clearly intended to regulate campaigns generally.
“Although the constitution bylaws don’t explicitly state much on referenda, it’s pretty clear that the restrictions they’re trying to place, even though it might explicitly be defined for candidates in presidential elections, is trying to apply to campaigning in general,” Camilli said. “Really what we’re getting at is violating the spirit of the law is also violating the law.”

The Washington, D.C. Zoning Commission unanimously approved Georgetown University’s 20-year campus plan in a hearing Dec. 1, ending a four-yearlong process led by the Georgetown Community Partnership.
The 20-year plan, which prioritizes student housing renovations, outlines future academic spaces and plans revitalized on-campus student life, spans from January 2017 through 2036, making it the longest standing campus plan in Georgetown’s history.
Under the D.C. zoning code, all universities in the District are mandated to obtain formal approval of their campus plans by the Zoning Commission. The GCP, a group developed after the 2010 Campus Plan’s contentious drafting and approval process between neighbors and the university, participated in discussions with representatives from the Georgetown University Student Association, university administrators and neighborhood representatives from local citizens’ associations and advisory neighborhood commissions.
The plan emphasizes the main campus as a hub for student activity and life, including the creation of a student life corridor extending from O’Donovan Hall to the Leavey Center, while focusing on the improvement of existing living spaces, rather than the construction of new buildings.
Renovation plans include improvements to Village A, the Alumni Square apartments and Henle Village, as well as the creation of a green space on the north side of campus between Darnall Hall and the Medstar Georgetown University Hospital.
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17), who sits on the GCP Steering Committee and the GCP’s Master Planning Working Group, made up of students, administrators and neighbors to draft the campus plan, said this year’s process better incorporated the wishes of all parties involved.
“This time around, students were very much a part of the process. We maintained open communication with university administrators and neighbors, and we focused on coming to shared agreements,” Khan said. “This plan was unanimously approved, because the students, neighbors and university were able to find shared interests and focus on solutions that help everyone.”
The GCP consists of different working groups focusing on specific parts of the campus plan and eventually makes recommendations to the Steering Committee, which is composed of representatives from Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, ANC 3D, the Citizens Association of Georgetown, the Burleith Citizens Association, the Foxhall Village Citizens Association, Vice President for Government Relations and Community Engagement Christopher Murphy (GRD ’98), Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey and GUSA.
GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff for Master Planning and Community Engagement Zac Schroepfer (MSB ’19), who was elected as a student commissioner for ANC2E on Nov. 8,  said the length of the plan will allow it to be more effective throughout its duration, adding that student interest in improvements to living spaces was reflected in the plan.
“If you were to create a campus plan with such a short term, you’re going to be impeding the planning process. It’s much better to create a long-term plan and then actually follow through with that plan,” Schroepfer said. “What the students saw as super important was renovating our existing buildings to create enhanced living spaces where students actually want to live and learn.”
This emphasis on improving on-campus residence halls also aligns with the interests of the Georgetown neighborhood community. According to Schroepfer, neighbors would like to see a more distinct separation between the campus and the Georgetown neighborhood.
“One of their main goals is to have less students out in the neighborhood and have campus be more of a central hub of living space,” Schroepfer said.
GUSA Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said a main concern throughout the campus planning process was student engagement. During the negotiations for the 2010 Campus Plan, which was not formally approved by the D.C. Zoning Commission until 2012 due to disagreements between neighbors and administrators and included the reinstatement of the third-year on-campus housing requirement, students were not able to give their input throughout the planning process, according to Goldstein.
“There was a lot of bad will from the last plan between students and neighbors and administrators,” Goldstein said. “There was this belief that student interests were fundamentally opposed by the neighbors and administrators, who are really the ones in power in this process.”
GUSA leaders sought to create a collaborative process between each of the parties involved. The GCP was founded in 2012 to allow for such a process.
Schroepfer credits the success of this most recent campus plan to the creation of the GCP.
“Historically, it’s been a lot of people having these ideas and fighting them out in front of the zoning commission. But with the creation of the GSP, to facilitate this conversation, students and neighbors and administrators all came together in the same room to share their perspectives,” Schroepfer said.
Goldstein said the new plan marked an increase in student engagement in the process and steps toward improved relationships with the greater Georgetown community.
“We are in a much better place than we have ever been before,” Goldstein said. “Having these good relationships allows us to advance student interests and get things done in a way that weren’t otherwise able to.”
University President John J. DeGioia said the commission’s approval reflects the efforts of the community members, students, faculty and staff involved in crafting and creating the plan.
“I am deeply grateful to all those who came together through our Georgetown Community Partnership,” DeGioia wrote in an email to the university community Dec. 5. “Developing a comprehensive plan that meets the needs of all stakeholders is challenging, and the unanimous approval by the D.C. Zoning Commission reflects an extraordinary commitment to dialogue and engagement from all who were involved.”

A man was arrested Sunday afternoon after walking into a pizzeria in Northwest Washington, D.C., with an assault rifle and discharging his weapon, citing a desire to self-investigate a false online conspiracy theory linking the pizzeria to a child sex trafficking ring, according to the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.
Edgar Welch, 28, from North Carolina told police he had driven from North Carolina to the D.C. restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, because of “Pizzagate,” a theory falsely accusing the restaurant and its owners of housing a child sex trafficking ring led by former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief, John Podesta.
Welch entered the building about 3 p.m., pointed a weapon at an employee of the restaurant, who fled and notified the police, then discharged his weapon inside the building, according to a statement released by MPD on Monday. After about 45 minutes of searching the building, Welch surrendered peacefully to the MPD.
“Two firearms were recovered inside the location. An additional weapon was recovered from the suspect’s vehicle,” the statement reads.  “There were no reported injuries.”
After a Monday court hearing, Welch is being held in jail and has been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, along with three other weapons charges. Welch carried an AR-15 assault-style weapon as well as a rifle and a folding knife while conducting his search of the restaurant.
Patrons inside Comet Ping Pong fled the restaurant as other businesses nearby went on lockdown at the recommendation of District police.
Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis and his employees have received menacing messages and death threats online since days before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Users on the online message board 4chan found communication between Alefantis and Podesta discussing a fundraising event for Clinton in the latter’s emails, which were leaked by anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks.
The theory gave rise to fake news articles appearing on Facebook and websites such as The New Nationalist and The Vigilant Citizen.
Alefantis denounced the allegations of a child sex trafficking ring being run out of his restaurant, emphasizing that the conspiracy theories were not without consequences in a statement on Facebook on Sunday night.
“I hope that those involved in fanning these flames will take a moment to contemplate what happened here today, and stop promoting these falsehoods right away,” the statement reads.
Georgetown journalism program director Barbara Feinman Todd condemned the rise in fake news stories while highlighting the dangers these stories pose.
“Fake news is suddenly become this huge thing. I don’t know if it crept up on us or what, but it suddenly has really serious consequences that we have seen played out at Comet Ping Pong,” Feinman Todd said. “As of what happened on Sunday, it’s become life-threatening.”
In his Monday press briefing, White House Press Secretary Joshua Earnest also addressed the role fake news played in motivating Welch, saying he was troubled by the prospect of violence erupting due to false information.
“There’s no denying the corrosive effect that some of these false reports have had on our political debate. And that’s concerning in a political context. It’s deeply troubling that some of those false reports could lead to violence,” Earnest said. “How people understand what’s happening in the world is important to the functioning of our democracy.”
The propagated false news also reached Michael Flynn Jr., the son of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who President-elect Donald Trump announced as his pick for his national security adviser Nov. 18.
Michael Flynn Jr., who has served as his father’s chief of staff and top aide, tweeted about the incident Sunday night.
“Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it’ll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many ‘coincidences’ tied to it,” Michael Flynn Jr. wrote.
Earnest addressed Michael Flynn Jr.’s reaction to the incident, emphasizing the value of the truth for those in government and their families.
“I’m not here to issue any specific challenges to the incoming administration on any topic,” Earnest said. “I think we all hold a responsibility, regardless of whether or not we are planning to serve in a government position or if one of our family members is planning to serve in a government position, that we shouldn’t be propagating false things that could inspire violence.”
Feinman Todd highlighted the importance of investigating the sources by which people receive their news, especially given the heightened visibility of fake reports. She suggested students consider the sources, media outlets and facts of each article they read.
“It’s extremely upsetting and as a journalism professor, I feel that it makes my job that much more critical,” Feinman Todd said. “There are plenty of fabulous reporters out there and they’re doing great work. The scary thing is that it doesn’t seem to matter that much. Facts just don’t seem to matter. And this whole Comet Ping Pong story is a very clear and scary illustration of that.”
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber warned against fake news as a potentially dangerous concept and predicted that the trend would not likely disappear.
“False news can be very dangerous. News items should be confirmed and reconfirmed if not from a mainstream media source,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Fake news problems will likely persist.”
Feinman Todd added that another way to fight back against the false news that gave way to the incident at Comet Ping Pong is to support the businesses threatened or endangered by such reports.
“I just ate there about a month ago with another professor and another friend. They have great pizza. Everyone should go. Everybody is talking about how can we support the truth — well, I think we need to support Comet Ping Pong for one thing. I think that’s a lot more effective than just clicking ‘like’ on Facebook,” Feinman Todd said. “I think we all need to eat some pizza, which is how this all started.”

To ensure the 2009 financial crisis does not repeat itself, the United States should keep financial regulations in place after President Barack Obama leaves office, according to Vice President Joe Biden in a speech in Gaston Hall on Monday.
“On almost every measure, Americans are better off today than they were years ago, but there are still a lot of people being left behind,” Biden said. “It wasn’t an accident. It happened because we made some very tough, very unpopular decisions, and things turned out to be the right call on balance.”
President-elect Donald  Trump said during his campaign he would repeal the the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, which introduced a series of regulations designed to prevent a recurrence of the causes that led to the Great Recession.
Paul Volcker, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve under President Ronald Reagan from 1979 to 1987 and chaired Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board from 2009 to 2011, introduced Biden at the event. Volcker characterized the country’s current economy as strong.
“Our performance here in the United States stands out particularly in contrast to the rest of the industrialized world,” Volcker said. “To my mind, it’s very important we have reached the point, we have reached that point of full employment, consistent with reasonable price stability, and the prospect we can maintain that in the months and years ahead.”
However, Biden argued there are still groups of Americans not benefitting from economic growth.
“There’s a lot of people we should be paying attention to, but quite frankly, neither party paid enough attention to. I know every time I talk about it, it’s ‘Middle Class Joe’ again,” Biden said. “But the truth of the matter is, a lot of people got hurt, and many are still not back.”
Biden said many politicians initially underestimated the severity of the recession. Biden said he was often criticized for referring to it as the “Great Recession.”
“Credit markets, credit markets dried up, making it almost impossible for small businesses to keep their doors open and meet payroll. Prospective homeowners to get a mortgage, car buyers to get a loan and right before election day, Lehman Brothers collapsed, unleashing a fear — a real fear — that the whole financial system could collapse,” Biden said.
The unemployment rate hit 10 percent in Oct. 2009, with almost 8.8 million lost jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Biden said it is important to remember the crisis was caused not by everyday Americans, but by bankers and a lax regulatory system, when looking to develop policy following the election.
“The reason to remember how it happened is not to hold people responsible; particularly, it’s to make sure we don’t commit the same problems again,” Biden said. “It was a direct result of short-sighted, irresponsible, and — I would argue — greedy actions by Wall Street. And Washington’s lacks of regulation over a 20- to 30-year period. Barack and I knew that fixing the real economy meant stabilizing and fixing the financial system.”
America’s regulatory systems were not strong enough to prevent the behaviors resulting in the recession, according to Biden.
“We knew our regulatory system was outdated. Designed decades ago and designed decades ago, it was ill-equipped to monitor the modern-day economy,” Biden said.

The 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, a 1933 law that prevented banks with deposits from engaging in the investment business, was a significant contributor to the financial crisis, according to Biden. Many banks made loans they knew consumers could not repay, causing financial problems when consumers were unable to pay back loans.
“Across the board was insufficient regulatory infrastructure. A shadow banking system was allowed to operate with limited oversight — the lack of systematic regulator overseeing the whole system,” Biden said. “Collectively, this wasn’t about allowing banks to take on more risks, it was about shifting the risk from the banks to the governments and taxpayer.”
Biden also shed light on the gravity with which he holds his vote to repeal Glass-Steagall when he served in the Senate.
“This was a debate inside the White House whether I should say this, but I have never not said what I believe, that was the worst vote I ever cast in my entire time in the United States Senate,” Biden said.
Biden emphasized the importance of maintaining proper regulations to ensure a recession does not hit the middle class again.
“I understand, when the middle class does well, everybody does well. The wealthy do very well and the poor have a way out,” Biden said. “It’s what holds together the social contract: a growing middle class.”
The regulations introduced by Dodd-Frank, which have protected the economy for the past few years, are now being taken for granted, according to Biden.
“Let’s at least make sure that the umpire is on the field calling balls and strikes and wearing a striped shirt. That’s why we can’t allow the repeal of Dodd-Frank,” Biden said.
Biden said compensation for company executives must also be more tightly regulated.
“We need to ensure that the executive compensation doesn’t go back to encouraging executive risk-taking, in short term. I’ve spoken a length about stock buybacks by publicly traded companies, how CEOs don’t have the incentive to build for the future, but rather swing for the fences today,” Biden said. “They’re not bad guys or bad women, the processes incentivize actions.”
The government must continue to implement regulations introduced by Dodd-Frank, according to Biden.
“We need to complete the remaining SEC rules created by Dodd Frank, like limits on incentive-based compensation in financial companies. Like Chairman Volcker said, we also need to address the threat posed by a bottomless, short-term debt. And as evidenced by the recent concerns about retail banks, we need to step up our monitoring and enforcement activities,” Biden said. “Look at Wells Fargo.”
Ensuring there is effective regulation should be a common-sense policy for both Democrats and Republicans, according to Biden.
“Millions of families pay the price for reckless and irresponsible policies, and our regulators need to have the resources to catch this activity before it gets out of control,” Biden said. “It’s pretty basic, you know, like me, you don’t have to be an economist to understand this.”

A recent increase in reported bias-related incidents at Georgetown mirrors a national increase in hate crimes since the election of President-elect Donald Trump, increasing concerns about the role of the so-called “alt-right,” also known as the “alternative right,” and the presence of white nationalist groups in Washington, D.C.
Since Trump’s election in November, the Georgetown University Police Department has reported at least three bias-related incidents, which have occurred both on and off-campus and involved students of color or LGBTQ students.
In a Nov. 13 instance, a student wearing a scarf similar to a hijab over her face on the 3700 block of Prospect St. NW was shoved, forced to the ground and told to take her scarf off.
This incident, along with another in which a student of Asian descent was spit upon while walking on the 3200 block of Prospect St., prompted an official response from GUPD Chief Jay Gruber and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson. In both cases, the perpetrators were reported to be a group of four to six white men.
“Like many of you, we have also heard of other bias-related incidents in recent days,” Gruber and Olson wrote in an email to the university community. “We are troubled by these reports and are taking steps to support our students.”
A Rising Force in the District
The alt-right is the general name now used by populist right-wing movements comprised of various white supremacists and white nationalists who emphasize anti-establishment conservatism while prioritizing the protection of the white race in the United States.
The term was coined by Richard Spencer, the white nationalist who founded AlternativeRight.com and now serves as the president of the National Policy Institute, a Virginia-based white nationalist think tank.
Spencer’s organization recently faced criticism after The Atlantic published a video of the annual NPI conference hosted Nov. 19 at the Ronald Reagan Building in downtown D.C. with 275 audience members. The video showed audience members seemingly raising their hands in Nazi salutes.
“Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!” Spencer said to the crowd.
Spencer’s speech compared media figures to creatures, criticized minority groups and questioned the humanity of Trump’s opponents.
“It’s not just that they are leftists or cucks. It’s not just that many are genuinely stupid,” Spencer said. “Indeed, one wonders if those people are people at all, or instead soulless Golems, animated by some dark power to repeat whatever talking points John Oliver said the night before.”
That same night, a group of alt-right supporters gathered at the Maggiano’s Little Italy restaurant in Friendship Heights for a dinner sponsored by the NPI, where attendees were photographed making Nazi salutes and an attendee sent out a tweet with a caption reading “Sieg Heil.”
The following Monday, Nov. 21, the 51-chain restaurant President Steve Provost issued an apology on Facebook.
“This was a last minute booking made Friday afternoon, and the reservation was made under a different name, therefore we were not aware that NPI was dining with us or what the group represents,” Provost wrote. “This expression of support of Hitler is extremely offensive to us, as our restaurant is home to teammates and guests of every race, religion and cultural background.”
University Faculty Concerned
Michael Kazin, a Georgetown University history professor, noted that alt-right’s increased visibility is a response to identity politics, which is the usage of race, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity to intersect with political activism.
“There is a sense in this culture in people protecting an identity and looking at an identity, being part of cultural traditions, that’s something which has become quite legitimized in America since the 1960s,” Kazin said. “Not surprisingly, people like Spencer and others who identify with that kind of politics, whether truly or not, have picked up on this wave presenting itself.”
Georgetown University Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner said she sees a vast contrast between alt-right politics and the mainstream political debate.
“We can all agree that conservative politics is one thing and that the ‘alt-right’ is another thing entirely. If my concerns with the alt-right were about conservative versus liberal politics, I wouldn’t feel the strong need to speak out when asked about this,” Gartner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But that’s not what we’re talking about here.”
Gartner said the presence of the alt-right in D.C. has brought anti-Semitic discrimination back into the national spotlight.
“Things are happening, right here, in our very own DMV area, and across the country. Don’t believe any spin that says otherwise,” Gartner wrote.
Bias-Related Incidents Increase 
This racially charged discourse has impacted minority groups and children in schools across the country, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center’s #ReportHate submission system.
The SPLC has reported 867 bias-related incidents and hate crimes as of Nov. 29, an increase from the 201 incidents reported as of Nov. 11. These instances include anti-black, anti-women and anti-LGBTQ incidents.
In schools, the SPLC has confirmed the so-called “Trump effect,” a term coined by former Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton, describing an increase in bullying and discriminatory acts toward minority students.
A Nov. 28 SPLC report written by Maureen Costello noted the 2016 presidential election has led to 90 percent of educators reporting their school climate has been negatively affected and 80 percent describing a heightened anxiety and concern from students and their families. The survey consulted over 10,000 teachers, counselors and administrators across the nation to find these results.
Students on Guard
Georgetown students have demonstrated apprehension toward the increased visibility of the alt-right in the District.
Grant Olson (COL ’19) said the NPI convention last month shocked him.
“As a Jew, seeing this kind of gathering is incredibly disgusting and racist. How we, as a nation, can so easily fall back into dangerous nationalist, white supremacist tendencies shocks me to my core,” Olson said. “I know that the First Amendment defends their right to say what they want, but we can’t convince ourselves that it’s okay to let this kind of hate speech into the public forum.”
Georgetown University College Democrats Vice Chair Meredith Forsyth (SFS ’19) said the offensive language used by supporters of the alt-right should be concerning regardless of political persuasion.
“Right here in D.C., there are now right-wing extremists promulgating their narrative of white supremacy and hatred, and their voices have been amplified and even normalized by Donald Trump’s rhetoric and behavior,” Forsyth wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown University College Republicans Vice Chair Samantha Granville (COL ’17) said she rejects the alt-right and said she regrets this movement has impaired the work of mainstream Republican outreach.
“Membership outreach for GUCR has always been a difficult job, and the influence of alt-right groups does not help the problem,” Granville wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Conservatism is certainly not supposed to be rooted in exclusion based on gender, religion, race or sexuality. ”
Muslim Students’ Association President Khadija Mohamud (SFS ’17) said she found the discourse used by the Trump campaign and alt-right figures disheartening.
“As a Black American Muslim, I refuse to accept that I am any less American than my fellow compatriots due to the color of my skin or my religious beliefs,” Mohamud said.
Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said the public visibility of the alt-right and Trump’s election have increased concerns among minority student groups.
“As an institution, we need to be aware of any communities who feel vulnerable on our campus, and we need to actively engage and support them,” Khan said.
Still, some students disagree with the mainstream characterization of the alt-right.
Michael Parmiter (MSB ’18) who does not identify with the movement, said it is more than just the group that gathered in Washington last month.
“I see the alt-right as a reaction to the dysfunction in Washington,” Parmiter said. “I see it as an extension of the Tea Party. The alt-right people are not Republicans in the traditional sense of the word.”
Still, Mohamud said she is optimistic Americans, especially students, will reject racist attitudes, citing an instance of another student offering to walk her home from Lauinger Library.
“I’ve never received so many texts from friends who are non-Muslims, people I haven’t even spoken to in so long, people asking me in Lau if I want them to walk me home, going out of their way to do stuff like that — that gives me hope,” Mohamud said. “I refuse to accept the fact that as Americans we will tolerate bigotry.”

Georgetown College plans to introduce four new minors, including Creative Writing, Persian language, Turkish language and Religion, Ethics and World Affairs, beginning next spring.
Students in the college can currently select from minors in 44 areas of study, in addition to seven School of Foreign Service regional studies certificates.
A group must bring a proposal to the College Dean’s Office to create a minor before it is considered by three or four members of the College Academic Council. The minor must then be approved by the entire executive committee.
The minor must then be approved by the Main Campus Executive Faculty, a body consisting of 57 faculty members and two students.
Each of the new minors will require six courses. The minors in Creative Writing, capped at 20 students, and Religion, Ethics and World Affairs will require an application process and involve a capstone seminar, where students complete a project to conclude the minor.
English majors will not be able to minor in Creative Writing due to the overlap in courses.
Professor of English David Gewanter, who helped develop the new Creative Writing minor, said the new minor builds upon the existing courses offered in the English department.
According to Gewanter, the new minor will offer students an opportunity to delve deeper into their writing skills.
“We’ve had an array of creative writing courses that have been filled up and have been very popular for a number of years,” Gewanter said. “The idea of the minor is to try to put them in a sequence so that you can build up towards writing a longer manuscript about something that intrigues and challenges you.”
Gewanter said a creative writing minor is important to foster a writing community that can impact students in the long run.
“It’s a very hands-on, interactive program. The issue of having a writing community is crucial and the ones you establish in school follow you for time afterwards,” Gewanter said. “I am still in touch with people I took poetry workshops with in the 1980s and we are still sharing manuscripts.”
Persian Language and Culture Program Director Farima Mostowfi said the Persian language minor reflects the significant role the language plays on a global level.
“More than 110 million people worldwide speak Persian,” Mostowfi said.
“Creating a Persian minor will enable students to communicate, interact with and form relations with those coming from an important region of the world when they become the leaders of tomorrow.”
Mostowfi also said the new minor recognizes the rising interest in the university’s Persian program.
“I have been trying to create this minor for 5 years. There were a lot of students that could validate 14 plus credits in Persian and we were not able to recognize this or give them a certificate or anything,” Mostowfi said.
Georgetown student demand for Persian has risen sharply in recent years, according to Mostowfi. Between 2013 and 2014, enrollment for “Beginners Persian” rose 257 percent. This fall, 40 students are enrolled in classes across the Persian program.
In another language with growing interest, Turkish minor students can reach intermediate level in the language accompanied by coursework in Turkish studies approved by the department.
Turkish Language and Culture Program Director Sylvia Önder said she was glad Turkish studies is receiving more recognition with the creation of its new minor in the college.
“At Georgetown, we have a special history of nationally-competitive Arabic programs, and Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish have been housed within the Arabic programs,” Önder wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are grateful for the hospitality, of course, but are glad to have more official recognition of our programs through the minors.”
Önder said Georgetown’s efforts to recognize smaller-language programs reflect the university’s commitment to a thorough liberal arts education.
“Now that there are minors in Turkish and Persian — both college students and SFS students can gain a mark on their transcript that will be reflective of a specific type of global education that is so sought after in professional life,” Önder wrote.
Michael Kessler, the managing director of the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, said the new REWA minor will address contemporary global issues. Religion, Ethics and World Affairs was previously a Berkley Center program only available to SFS students as a certificate program. The new minor makes the program accessible to college students as well.
“Students at Georgetown today are training to be the next generation of leaders and will face complex challenges about the role of religion in politics, economic and social development, international relations,” Kessler wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The REWA certificate is a stellar opportunity for students to engage these issues in a sustained way.”

Students continue to voice the need for increased campus dialogue about the ramifications of the election of President-elect Donald Trump to the presidency, specifically on issues concerning minority students, in a weeklong series of discussions organized by Georgetown School of Foreign Service faculty members and SFS student leaders.
Seven small-group conversations began Dec. 2 and will continue through Dec. 9. The discussions attempt to pay special attention to vulnerable communities. The initiative is expected to focus on personal narratives as a reactionary response to a rise in hate crimes against minorities both nationwide and on campus.
Two off-campus bias-related attacks against students were reported in mid-November.
According to SFS Dean Joel Hellman, the initiative particularly resonates in the SFS because of its focus on globalization and multiculturalism.
“Our faculty have very strong views and felt the need to discuss — not only in the classroom but outside — about how are we going to react and what role should we be playing in the shifting dialogue on globalization,” Hellman said. “Students also felt a lot of uncertainty about what this means, especially at a place where they came to study global affairs and global integration.”
Students had the opportunity to register for discussions via an email from the SFS Dean’s Office announcing the initiative.
SFS Academic Council President Devika Ranjan (SFS ’17) said the response from students represented overwhelming interest and engagement. The SFS Academic Council organized many of the logistics of the discussions.
“About 100 people signed up in a period of two days, so many that I unfortunately had to turn people away,” Ranjan said. “I am so, so glad people are enthusiastic about participating in these discussions and want to grapple with the more personal narratives that are deeply tied to our politics.”
The discussions are being led by government professor Anthony Arend (SFS ’80), Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., African studies professor Lahra Smith, history professor Marcia Chatelain, Senior Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs Dean Daniel Byman, culture and politics professor Kate Chandler and Arab studies professor Fida Adely. Carnes, who teaches comparative political studies, said the need for these conversations began the day after the election, Nov. 9.
“I just had a sense, from talking to a few students, to talk about things. In my own classroom, we did a fairly lengthy discussion where I asked students to write down their feelings for a couple of minutes and invited them to share them — issues, fears, hopes,” Carnes said. “It was a very changed environment that moved them and challenged them in a lot of ways.”
Arend, whose group met Monday evening in McGhee Library, said students came to his discussion with respect and curiosity.
“A number of important issues were raised, such as what role does the university play in truth, how we can be citizen journalists, what will be the implications of the new administration for foreign policy,” Arend said. “All of us in the community want to hear each other but also to make sure that all of us understand that this is a place where we can all feel comfortable and welcome.”
Zachary Oschin (SFS ’20), who attended Arend’s discussion group, said the group fostered an environment for reflection and engagement in significant issues.
“We have all felt very overwhelmed by the recent events and it felt like an important experience to be able to connect about our fears and expectations,” Oschin said.
Ranjan said the purpose is to humanize the effects of the election based on the power of personal narratives.
“In the SFS, we are very good at policy discussions, but often we neglect to understand how these policies reflect real lives,” Ranjan said.
While the policies of a Trump administration remain largely unknown, Hellman said he does not expect the historical relationship between the SFS and the federal government — specifically with the Department of State — to change.
“We are a school that has a long history of training people for globally engaging public service and that is not going to change,” Hellman said. “That commitment that we have to keep training a cadre of specialists who really understand the world and know how to engage the world is not going to change at all.”
Carnes said he is hopeful that these dialogues will drive the Georgetown campus to approach civil discourse in a more productive and inclusive way.
“My hope is that all of us as a community could gain a shared understanding,” Carnes said. “The key is the ability to listen well and to construct a new kind of unity and reconciliation.”

Henle Village residents and the Georgetown University Student Association have raised concerns over university spending after residents were charged a total of $2,234.08 after four chairs in Henle Village common space were damaged by vandalism.
According to an email to Henle residents, each chair cost $558.52 with each individual resident being charged $5.28.
The chairs were purchased as part of a project to develop outdoor space at Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Hall.
Henle Community Director Jillian Sitjar notified students living in Henle Village in an email on Oct. 27 of the vandalism and theft.
“Recently, Henle Village received outdoor furniture consisting of 6 tables and 24 chairs. However, due to vandalism, 8 chairs have been damaged or removed from the courtyard over the course of the past three weeks,” Sitjar wrote.
Henle residents were notified Nov. 8 that four of the eight chairs were returned, but that they would be charged for the remaining four missing or damaged chairs.
Following the charge, a number of Henle residents voiced their concerns to the Office of Residential Living.
Henle Village Resident Michael Chapman (COL ’18), who wrote an email to the Office of Residential Living voicing his concerns, said he was concerned that Residential Living was charging students who were not involved in damaging or removing the chairs.
“I find it very unfair that they are charging students who may not have had any impact on the chairs being broken and may not have even used the chairs for something that could have been done by anybody on campus,” Chapman said.
GUSA Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said the costs of the seats raise concerns over how the university spends its money.
“I must have gotten 10 texts and emails from people who were living in Henle and they wanted GUSA to do something about this because it was such an obviously egregious example of misspending,” Goldstein said in an interview with The Hoya.
Goldstein said the charge points to a larger issue of university spending.
“I just don’t know what the industry standard is for chairs, but I think it fits into a pretty obvious pattern of misspending across the board,” Goldstein said.
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the chairs were selected by a design committee for both their value and aesthetic.
“These chairs were selected by a design committee consisting of architects, students and university staff and through a furniture forum during the design process,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This selection represented the best overall value per the selection committee when considering durability, architectural characteristics, price and quality.”
Henle Village resident Bailey Page (MSB ’18) said she was concerned that students’ money was being spent on something students do not necessarily want or need, rather than renovating Henle.
“I think it’s kind of ridiculous that we didn’t ask for these chairs,” Page said.
Henle Village resident Matt Wang (MSB ’18) said the fact that non-Henle Village residents could have damaged or removed the chairs raises further concerns about the charge.
“We know this chair vandalism happened and there is no evidence to pointing towards who’s done them. It just remarks that anyone can come onto campus and do anything to the stuff we leave outside,” Wang said in an interview with The Hoya.
Wang said even if the vandalism was done by a Henle Village resident, the high charge of the chairs would still raise concerns.
“Well I feel that the vandalism was definitely something that needed to be asked about or taken care of,” Wang said. “If it was more about the cost of the chair rather than the actual incident, I would understand us having to pay for it but the fact that each chair cost $400, $500 is a bit ridiculous.”

A lack of access to education for refugee children is one of the most significant consequences of the global refugee crisis, according to Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration Anne C. Richard in a discussion hosted by refugee advocacy group No Lost Generation on Thursday.
“The number of child refugees has more than doubled in the past 10 years,” Richard said. “The most insidious problem, we believe, it that refugee children are robbed of an education. I remember meeting young people in refugee camps and I thought, what a waste for them to be here, along the Turkish-Syrian border instead of school.”
The event, moderated by Georgetown University research professor Elizabeth Ferris in Copley Formal Lounge, explored the Obama Administration’s goals, challenges and successes in dealing with the global refugee crisis.
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 4.8 million refugees have fled to countries in the Middle East, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq since the Syrian civil war began in March 2011. One million have requested asylum in Europe.
The United States runs the largest refugee resettlement program, resettling over 3.3 million refugees since 1975. Obama expanded this program in his administration, pledging to accept over 100,000 refugees by October 2017.
The U.S. State Department funds a number of programs to assist refugee children and adolescents in receiving an education. Both Turkey and Lebanon have pledged to create more opportunities for Syrian children to go to school, an effort that was encouraged and supported by the United States.
However, President-elect Donald Trump’s statements have created doubt for Richard about the future of the program.
“Much to my surprise and dismay, refugees coming into the United States became a political football. We don’t know what the new administration will do,” Richard said.
One of Trump’s campaign proposals was for “extreme vetting” of refugees and Muslims coming into the United States. Trump also called for temporarily banning all Muslims from entering the United States in Dec. 2015, before beginning to walk back the policy in June.
According to Richard, refugees already undergo very comprehensive evaluation and vetting.
“We actually do a very thorough job screening refugees, so my hope is that when the new Secretary of State comes in and sees all the steps involved, they will come to believe that we do a very good job in our vetting,” Richard said.
Richard said students should look to get involved with refugee advocacy by pursuing internships with NGOs and the State department, working as online tutors for refugees and organizing fundraising events. Students have the ability to make a positive impact in the crisis, according to Richard.
“The scale of this crisis means we need more. We need students to get mobilized and informed to make a difference,” Richard said. “We need your wisdom, your creativity, your enthusiasm, your technological wizardry, your power to innovate and your prowess with social media.”
Richard said students should also look for local opportunities to help refugees, rather than opportunities to help refugees abroad.
“I find that college students always want to jet off to some far-flung location and have some life altering experience, but I always suggest they start by going down the street and finding some local refugee student going to a nearby high school,” Richard said. “You don’t have to get a plane ticket to help.”
No Lost Generation is a movement of student activists founded to support refugees by promoting awareness, fundraising and creating education resources for refugees, according to the group’s page.
The No Lost Generation initiative was launched in 2013, with Georgetown’s chapter launching at the beginning of this academic year. Since the 2013 launch, 49 chapters have been established at universities across the nation.
According to the Georgetown chapter’s founder and Executive Director Elana King-Nakaoka (COL’19), the organization works in conjunction with the State Department to raise awareness about the plight of refugees.
“I’m passionate about building the organization here on campus because I feel that while many Georgetown community members care about the refugee crises, the gravity of the situation can feel overwhelming,” King-Nakaoka said.
King-Nakoaka said the event aligns with the goals for No Lost Generation on campus.
“We wanted to host a moving and informative lecture on campus that both raised awareness about the global refugee crisis, and focused on just how students can get involved and make their voices heard,” King-Nakaoka said.
Sindrel Al-Hamsi, a Syrian exchange student from Damascus who is in the United States through a fellowship program with the U.S. State Department, said she was moved by the outpouring of support and advocacy demonstrated throughout the discussion.
“You see images of us dirty and looking like we smell, but it didn’t used to be this way. We are sophisticated and educated people, and we just look this way because we have had to walk for miles and miles to reach safety,” Al-Hamsi said.  “Really, I just wanted to come here to say thank you.”

The Washington Monument is to remain closed until 2019 due to repairs, the National Park Service announced Dec. 2.
The monument has been closed since Aug. 17 following three previous closures, including a three-year period following a 5.8 magnitude earthquake in 2011, which occurred 84 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., yet nonetheless cracked the monument. Initial repair evaluations estimated a nine-month time frame to update the monument’s elevator, which broke down several times in the past year.
New repair proposals estimate the monument will remain closed for at least two more years. The repairs are composed of two main components: modernization of the monument’s elevator and updating the screening facility.
National Parks Service Public Affairs Officer Michael Litterst said both renovations are crucial to maintain the monument’s sustainability.
“The modernization of the elevator is absolutely necessary given the number of times it broke down in the past year,” Litterst said. “We can’t simply operate with a hope and a prayer that people won’t get stuck. The screening facility, is as well, is a necessity.”
The monument, a 555-foot obelisk, has used a temporary security screening area since 2001. The National Parks Service plans to construct a permanent screening facility.
D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) is optimistic repairs will lead to safer access to the monument for visitors.
“The much-needed modernization of the monument’s elevator will resolve the chronic problems that have forced repeated shutdowns of the monument, many of which occurred during peak tourist season,” Holmes wrote in a Dec. 2 statement.
Businessman David Rubenstein, founder of The Carlyle Group, a D.C.-based global private equity firm, pledged to fund the $2-3 million project of modernizing the elevator. Rubenstein said helping restore the monument is a personal honor.
“The monument has become a symbol of our country, and reminds everyone of the towering strengths of our first president,” Rubenstein wrote in a statement. “I am honored to help make this symbol safely accessible again to all Americans as soon as possible.”
Rubenstein already donated $7.5 million for repairs following damages from the 2011 earthquake, and donated $18.5 million for restorations to the Lincoln Memorial earlier this year.
However, the NPS has not yet secured funding for renovations of the screening facility. Funding information for the screening facility is set to be released in the 2017 fiscal budget release.
“It’s just a matter of when we get the funding and then we can start,” Litterst said. “I can’t speculate on when Congress may take action on that funding.”
There is no concrete timeline for the project because the NPS said it must first receive funding from the passing of the 2017 fiscal budget before it can publish a start date for the repairs schedule.
“We certainly share the public’s frustration at the closure for such a long time, but the updates are certainly necessary,” Litterst said.
Students have also expressed regret regarding the closure of the monument. Kendall Place (COL ’20) said though she understands safety concerns, she wanted to be able to access the monument.
“I’m a little disappointed,” Place said. “The Washington Monument is a symbol of our country, and it means a lot to people. But safety’s first.”

The Hoya published its first issue today after transitioning to a new editorial and publishing staff for the spring semester Saturday.
Toby Hung (COL ’18), the executive editor for the fall semester, began his yearlong term to serve as the 143rd editor-in-chief of The Hoya, taking over from Jess Kelham-Hohler (COL ’17).
Hung said he is eager to facilitate more dialogue on campus regarding a variety of issues.
“Over the past two-and-a-half years, I have witnessed multiple facets of The Hoya’s role on campus, from igniting much-needed dialogue to sharing the diversity of stories at Georgetown,” Hung said. “I look forward to working with our staff to realize our fullest potential as an organization that serves the entire university community.”
Paolo Santamaria (COL ’18), who served as sports editor in the fall, will take Hung’s place as executive editor for a semester-long term. Santamaria said The Hoya will strive for innovation and break from tradition to achieve its full potential.
“I would be lying if I said the responsibility of executive editor didn’t terrify me, but at the same time, we at The Hoya, in order to even approach the ceiling of what we are truly capable of, must ready ourselves to break out of traditions that we have long held,” Santamaria said. “I’m ready to help champion that cause alongside the best group of coworkers at Georgetown.”
Jesus Rodriguez (SFS ’19), who served as layout editor in the fall, will serve as the new managing editor for the upcoming semester.
“The Hoya is uniquely situated to renew its commitment to journalism and to the greater Georgetown community,” Rodriguez said. “I consider myself extremely lucky to be part of that commitment and continue a tradition that is 97 years in the making.”
Daniel Almeida (MSB ’18), who was director of sales in the fall, will serve the general manager position for a year-long term, replacing Evan Zimmet (MSB ’17).
“I am happy to begin my term surrounded by some of the most competent and passionate individuals Georgetown has to offer,” Almeida said.
Kristen Fedor (COL ’17) will be continuing her yearlong term as chair of the board of directors until April 2017.
