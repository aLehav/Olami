THE HOYA: What led you to make this your last semester of teaching?
SCHALL: Not any one thing, of course. In a broad sense, the day comes for everyone when he must decide. Just when is the best time is prudential, a judgment. I have had a number of annoying health problems in recent years. I do not want to begin a semester that I cannot anticipate finishing. It seems fair to the [government] department to give them time to find a replacement. Jesuit superiors give good advice here. But it is not rocket science. What Socrates, Cicero and Scripture say on old age, as my students know, I take to be basically true. You make a decision and live with it. Many of my colleagues, just older than I, were required by law to retire at 70. But now we are the almost only country in the world that does not discriminate against age. I will be 85 in January. Thus, I have been able to teach 15 extra years, as it were. So it seems fitting to retire at this time.
THE HOYA: Do you have plans after you depart from campus in March?
SCHALL: Aside from the famous aphorism “The best laid plans of mice and men…” I will reside in the Jesuit House in Los Gatos, Calif., on the Bay-side slope of the Santa Cruz Mountains. This is the large center into which I first entered the Order in 1948. I spent my first years from the time I was 20 to 24 there. It serves now as an infirmary, a residence and the offices of the Provincial of the West Coast Jesuit Province. A priest as priest does not “retire,” even if he is officially retired. I have a number of writing projects that I hope to continue once I am settled in. I have family in California and old friends. It is not forbidden for stray former students to visit the place should they find themselves in the vicinity.
THE HOYA: What is it about Georgetown that has kept you here for so many years?
SCHALL: Well, number one, I never had a better offer! Why would I want to go any place else? I have always had interesting and excellent students here. My colleagues in the government department have been good scholars and colleagues. The Jesuit Community has been a place where I could study and write at my “leisure,” to use Pieper’s famous Aristotelian word. Likewise, Georgetown is in Washington. I have found any number of extremely intelligent and effective men and women who are friends and guides over the years. Washington is larger than Georgetown, but still Georgetown is quite obviously at home here also, though there is always the question of how much we can be or are allowed to be “at home” anywhere in this world. This unwelcome for Catholics is becoming more and more an issue, alas.
THE HOYA: What are some of your fondest memories of Georgetown?
SCHALL: Amusingly, one of my fond memories was on the plane from California on which I flew to take up teaching here. I was on United or some airline that had one of those company magazines. The magazine that was in the seat that I was in had an article about the 10 most “drinking” universities in the country. Lo and behold, Georgetown made this “exclusive” list of 10! That must have been in late 1977. I confess that I have not seen any current list, but I was always amused by that article. I have not myself observed much of this drinking here, but I know that it can be more of a problem than it should be. We all should know, as it were, how to drink.
As I often mention, the beauty of the Healy building, in the morning sun, in snow, in fog, in spring flowers against its base or seen from 35th Street just before Visitation or from the Key Bridge is not easily to be forgotten. I think the campus is defined by the Healy building, and that is fixed in my memory.
But I suppose my fondest memories are those in a large class after I have finally succeeded in identifying each student by name and face, to see a student suddenly catch the drift of what Aristotle or Aquinas or Nietzsche or Plato was talking about.
THE HOYA: Is there some text or topic that you have found most interesting to teach?
SCHALL: The good thing about political philosophy is that it requires one to be open to everything, not just itself. I am more interested in texts, as it were, that open us to everything. Each of the books that I assign in courses has a particular place within the whole not only of the course but of the intellectual life itself. In my second course each semester, I have followed an eight-semester cycle. In the course of four years, a student will cover a semester on Aristotle, then Aquinas, on Plato, then Augustine, on classical theory, then medieval theory, natural law, then Roman Catholic political philosophy. My books “Another Sort of Learning,” “Students’ Guide to Liberal Learning,” “The Mind That Is Catholic” and “The Life of the Mind” are designed to call to students’ attention to books and ideas that they are not otherwise likely to encounter.
THE HOYA: In your personal studies of political philosophy, is there a topic that you still find confounding?
SCHALL: Well, far be it from Schall to say that there is nothing that he encounters that confounds him! That would be something of a divine claim. I have thought a lot about the mystery of evil. Most of my political philosophy books discuss this issue. Often, people just assume that everything will turn out all right no matter what they do. But it can hardly be like that. Plato’s basic problem has always haunted me ever since I was able coherently to formulate it. That is: “Is the world created in injustice?” It obviously seems to be unless we understand the lesson that is presented in the four eschatological myths in Plato. Josef Pieper’s new little book, “The Platonic Myths,” for which I wrote an introduction, seems to me to get at the heart of the matter.
Benedict XVI, himself a mind of truly superior intelligence and a careful student of Plato, never tires of reminding us that the one thing that God will not touch is our freedom. Thus, it is always possible to reject what we are. Otherwise we would not be what we are. Much of political philosophy is a frantic effort to invent ways to avoid the consequences of our freedom and what it is for, namely that we reach the end for which we exist, but freely. On no other condition could it be ours. This, too, is why we need to read Augustine so carefully and so often. He understood both the darker side of our nature and its highest purposes better than almost any one of our kind.
THE HOYA: What are the biggest changes that you have seen since you arrived here as a student?
SCHALL: Well, obviously, the campus has not really acquired much new land, especially anything close by. Hence, we have more buildings all over the place. Where I now live in Wolfington Hall was the back parking lot in my early years here, but before that, it was a gully of some sort, I think. Georgetown remains a rather medium sized school. Everything is now wired for sound and sight. What was once in paper is now online — announcements, grades, schedules, lectures, you name it.
I first came here in 1956 as a graduate student where I remained til 1960 when I finished my doctorate. Georgetown in those days had many great professors, and I tried to take or audit each one of them. Often they were Europeans who came here one way or another because of World War II. I think of Heinrich Rommen, Goetz Briefs, Josef Solterer, Louis Dupré, Wilfred de San, Jan Karski, Rudolph Allers, Martin D’Arcy, S. J., Thomas McTigue, Karl Cerny, Valerie Earle, William O’Brien, Edmund Walsh, S. J., Jeane Kirkpatrick, Henry Veatch, Hadley Arkes, Evron Kirkpatrick, Howard Penniman, Carol Quigley and any number of others. I suspect few of these names are known to today’s students, even to the faculty. Yet many of them were giants, and all were first-class.
Georgetown has long been known throughout the world, largely because of its law school, its medical school, the Foreign Service school and the language school. The arrival of Patrick Ewing and John Thompson II put the school on the map in another way. No one should underestimate the fame that comes to a school through athletics –— sometimes infamy, to be sure. Almost all the departments seem to have settled down to a good routine. No doubt the bureaucracy of the university, as elsewhere, is the most notable growth.
In a sense, there are three or four universities on the same campus. The university the students see, the university the faculty thinks it teaches in, the university the administration thinks it rules, and the university that is kept in physical shape by gardeners, drivers, cooks, craftsmen and other service units, not the least of which is the one that keeps the computers going. The one that keeps the water flowing may in fact be of less importance.
Yet a university is a place of the mind. The temptation of a place like Georgetown is politics. We are tempted to study politics before we pay much attention to either what is or what man is. I have been struck in recent years of how little of the basic names, dates and places of our tradition that students no longer know. Both the Bible and Shakespeare, not to mention Plato and Aristotle, Aquinas and Augustine, are often but vague names. We have good courses on these sources, but in the clutter of general education, much of civilization is lost.
THE HOYA: What about THE HOYA?
SCHALL: Over the years, I have had some 40 columns and essays in THE HOYA, plus a number of essays in other student journals. Probably one of the most influential essays I ever wrote first appeared in THE HOYA some years ago called, “What a Student Owes His Teacher.” This essay found its way into my book “Another Sort of Learning” and was, indeed, part of its inspiration. You would be surprised how many students have told me that the idea that they “owed” anything to teachers was new to them. Actually, a number of my Hoya essays have made it into other Schall books. Over the years, Hoya editors would invite me to do a column. I always appreciated that courtesy.
These student essays were written as reminders of the higher things that liberal education should be about. Very often they arose from what we were reading in class. I have long been convinced that much of what a student encounters about what is important he must find for himself in books that no one seems to tell him about. If I receive a letter or email from a student, I usually try to give him back something short to read, sometimes a JVS Hoya essay or a Schall on Chesterton essay, but something that we both, student and myself, ought to think about.
Sometimes I think the imagery of what a university is, the “ivory towers,” is not reflected on enough. The phrase is mostly said in derision, something similar to Plato’s description in Book six of “The Republic” about why the philosopher has a bad name in the city. Modern pressure to make college a training ground for certain crafts or professions, as well as the demands of departments for more time for the specialization, has left little time for reading and serious reflection. A student who spends 20 to 50 hours a week working, on a ball team, volunteering or goofing off simply misses what his time means here.
The university should be designed to protect us from the pressing world at least for a few years during which we are free to read and write and think. Even heavy class loads will interfere. Once a student leaves the front gates, he will be inundated with the world and the pressing problems of going forth to his life. The specter of the online university is no longer just over the horizon, the place where we only need a machine and an online connection. The essence of education is simple: a teacher, a student, a room and a book. I often cite Yves Simon’s remark that nothing can protect a young student from giving his soul to an unworthy professor. We have to seek the meaning of what is. This is the adventure that finally defines us.
THE HOYA: If you had one piece of advice to give to a freshman, what would it be?
SCHALL: That is easy. Students have often heard Schall’s basic advice: “Don’t major in current events.” Or as my older aphorism has it: “To be up to date is to be out of date.”

Several employees in O’Donovan Hall allege that they have not been paid what they were promised for completing special projects.
Jeff Day, who has worked in Leo’s for almost five years,said that he has not been properly compensated for painting part of the dining hall over the summer. Day initially requested $16 per hour for the painting project, but his employers paid him just 50 cents extra over his hourly wage of $11.85, promising him retroactive pay that he has not yet received.
“It was just me and one other employee, and we painted the upper and lower walls of the dining hall,” Day said. “We worked all through the summer until the students arrived, and we were promised higher pay for doing an engineering job. My pay went up temporarily, but then it went back to normal wage, and I still haven’t received the retro pay I was promised during the summer.”
Troy Washington, a Leo’s supervisor and a representative of UNITE HERE, the union under which Leo’s workers are organized, confirmed that employees who work on these special projects are meant to receive higher wages under the terms of their contracts.
“The job you’re doing [when painting] is building-engineering,” Washington said. “Under building-engineering you’re supposed to get the same wages that building engineers get.”
Day said the other employee, who has since left his position at Georgetown, did not receive his retroactive pay either.
Charles Hendricks, a lead organizer of UNITE HERE Local 23, explained, “There’s a system in the contract [in which] employees can file grievances, which ultimately go to a neutral third party called arbitration if the employer and the union can’t reach an agreement.”
Hendricks said that assigning a task to an employee outside of his job description would violate the contract that union representatives at Leo’s negotiated with Aramark, the company that manages Georgetown’s dining services.
“I’ve never heard of an issue of the employer making people do engineering work, but that would certainly be a violation of the contract,” Hendricks said. “That’s a good thing for the employee to go to the employer about, go to the shop steward about and file a grievance about.”
Karen Cutler, director of communications for Aramark, stated in an email that she had not heard about these problems.
“We are unaware of any of these issues, but, as always, are committed to discussing any matters with our employees and their elected representatives,” she wrote. “Our employees at Georgetown are represented by a union and covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We strive to follow all terms and conditions of that agreement, which includes a clear provision for how to address and resolve employee issues and concerns.”
Yet Day said that he and other employees are reluctant to use the grievance system because they feel it could threaten their jobs.
“We’ve heard of the grievance process, but from what I’ve heard, we’ve only used it against each other. I’ve never heard of one of my coworkers filing a grievance against an employer. Basically, they’re afraid of termination,” Day said. “They might be terminated because there is some good management here and there is overbearing management, and many times we feel that if we make a complaint, we risk losing our jobs.”
Hendricks, however, said any retaliation on the part of Aramark against an employee grievance would violate the workers’ contract and is illegal.
“Employees have a right under the law and under their [contracts] to file complaints … through the union contract to enforce their rights,” he said.
Washington said that Aramark has weekly meetings with workers, but these meetings do not necessarily assuage the doubts of workers who are intimidated by the grievance system.
“We came up with this system for better communication,” she said. “We meet with them every week [to straighten] things out and [talk] about things that aren’t right.”
“Some workers go and talk to Georgetown students,” Hendricks said, “thinking that students are going to fix the problems for them rather than [going to] their coworkers and … [bringing] the issues up to management. I keep getting phone calls from students on a regular basis about issues that never get brought up to the shop stewards.
“We don’t have any way to know if [workers are] being paid correctly unless they tell us they’re not being paid correctly,” Hendricks added.
Day said that while he was painting the dining hall, Aramark managers employed a contractor outside of Leo’s to supplement the job.
“I brought many of my own tools from home to complete the job,” he said. “Then they employed an outside painter [who] was paid much higher than I was and they gave him my tools, so I was left to do my part of the job without my tools for lower pay.”
Day said he was assigned these tasks through a system in which management asks interested employees to submit their names to a special projects list. From this list, management selects Leo’s employees based on seniority. Employees typically work these jobs for standard overtime pay, even when the task is not included in their job descriptions.
Additionally, Day said that he has trained several employees without receiving a pay increase. Generally, employees referred to as “leads” are responsible for training new employees and are compensated appropriately for this work, according to Leo’s employee and UNITE HERE representative Tarshea Smith. Day said that although he is not a lead, he does the same work as most leads and was still asked to train other workers without lead pay.
“I have been put in charge [of] training many employees. I spend extra time teaching these employees how to perform certain jobs, but I have not been paid extra for training them,” he said. “Many of these employees are promoted higher than I am even though they have less experience.”
Day said he has not been compensated appropriately because he only made a verbal agreement to offer training.
“They wanted to save some money, but they didn’t pay me what they promised because they were paying me outside of contract,” he said. “They said it was a verbal agreement, but if you verbally agree to do something, then honor what you said you’re going to do.”
In response to the employee’s claim that he was not paid for training other employees, Hendricks stated that he did not know the specifics of the Leo’s workers’ contracts.
“Many union contracts call for a training wage if you are training an employee; many union contracts call for [a higher rate of pay] if you work out of your classification doing a higher-paid job,” he said.
Day said he is still confused as to why he hasn’t been granted promised retroactive pay.
“Everyone else who has worked the entire summer has already gotten paid. I should have been paid right after summer break ended. It doesn’t make sense,” he said.

The Center for Social Justice and the Jesuit Universities Humanitarian Action Network hosted a panel discussion about Hurricane Sandy relief efforts and past responses to disasters in the Philodemic Room Wednesday evening.
The panel included Katie Oldaker, director of Disaster Response Operations for Catholic Charities, Regine Webster, vice president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy and Luca Dall’Oglio, chief of the Mission for the International Organization for Migration. Susan Martin, Herzberg Professor of International Migration in the School of Foreign Service, moderated the panel.
Oldaker explained the role of her organization in the current Sandy relief effort.
“In Sandy itself, we had 12 dioceses affected,” Oldaker said. “We’ve [sent] about 20 truckloads of supplies from national partners, [and] we’ve deployed four separate teams.”
According to Oldaker, the relief response to Hurricane Katrina provided lessons for future disasters.
“For us, Katrina showed that you can’t just have a plan that’s sitting on a shelf somewhere that you haven’t really been trained on. You have to have a training system that’s actually exercised,” Oldaker said. “You have to have staff that continually understands what to do in a disaster phase, such as your phone tree. Where are your staff members when a disaster hits? How do you find everybody and how do you make sure they’re safe? Especially if it’s a local emergency or disaster, your staff is also affected.”
The Center for Disaster Philanthropy has served as an information hub between donors and aid recipients.
“Donors may have an interest in responding to disasters, but because of their staff capacities or resource capacities, they may not have the ability to have a full-time disaster personnel and staff,” Webster said. “So we are positioning ourselves to be that support network for those organizations so that they can call us, email us, look on our website, and work closely with us to understand what the short-, medium- and long-term needs following a disaster may be.”
Webster stressed the importance of media coverage during and after disasters.
“What we know is that day four following a disaster is the peak media day, and day four following the disaster is the day when the most dollars are distributed to disaster [relief],” Webster said. “I think media plays a role [as] one of the challenges [we face]. Even in The New York Times, Sandy was off the front page after two weeks.”
Dall’Oglio brought attention to the problems that Hurricane Sandy caused to Haiti, a country still recovering from a 2010 earthquake in addition to Hurricanes Tomas and Isaac.
“The impact that an event like Sandy can have on a massive scale is devastating,” Dall’Oglio said. “The agriculture production has been affected by about 50 percent. That leaves about 45 percent of the population of Haiti at serious risk of malnutrition. Farmers have lost their produce; food will need to be imported. So this is a real present danger for Haiti for the next harvest is June of next year.”
Kayla Corcoran (COL ’15), who is leading the Alternative Spring Break program to New Orleans in March, noted the importance of disaster relief awareness and the long process that recovery requires.
“I think that these kinds of conversations about disaster preparedness are really important because we’re constantly facing this issue where two weeks [after a disaster], people are forgetting about it,” Corcoran said.

Faith Complex, a web interview series that explores the intersection of faith, religion and culture through interviews with various experts, filmed its latest installment in Riggs Library Tuesday.
Jacques Berlinerblau, the director of Georgetown’s Program for Jewish Civilization, founded the series in 2009 with a Reflective Engagement grant for academic research from University President John J. DeGioia, though the series is currently funded by the PJC.
When the program first began, Berlinerblau conducted all the interviews.
“People were asking me a lot of questions in 2008 [after I published a book],” Berlinerblausaid. “It hit me that I wanted to get on the other side of this and ask the questions.”
Over the past three semesters, students have taken the lead. They conducted nine of the 11 interviews Tuesday.
“At PJC, we have a model: students come first,” Berlinerblau said. “It made sense that students would lead [Faith Complex]. We very much have a journalistic attitude here at the PJC.”
Ghazi Bin Hamed (SFS ’15), a former student of Berlinerblau’s freshman proseminar “Secularism in America,” said that the students treat the project as a professional endeavor.
“The thing is, Faith Complex is very legitimate because we’re on all of these platforms,” Hamed said. “We don’t think of ourselves as students when we’re filming the show. Most interviewees may think that it is not that professional, but it changes their mind when they see our set and production.”
Faith Complex has two production days and airs approximately 20 episodes on YouTube, The Huffington Post and on the web platform of magazine The Jewish Week each year.
“An alum had a connection to The Huffington Post,” Hamed said. “Otherwise, we send out emails to relevant blogs linking to the video. We don’t seek royalties. It’s very hodgepodge, but it works out at the end of the day.”
The interviews all contain an element of faith, though the connection is not readily apparent at first. Interviews explore topics ranging from hip-hop theology to a new museum about Polish Jews in the Warsaw ghetto.
“We’re a very eclectic group with very different interests,” Hamed said. “I usually seek interviewees with an artsier or more creative side to things. Once you find that connection between the interviewer and the subject, that’s what makes a good piece.”
According to Hamed, Faith Complex utilizes professor and family relationships in seeking speakers. Group members generally send a total of 20 to 30 emails and receive 15 responses, which lead to six or seven interviews.
The show has attracted many high-profile guests in the past, including former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and columnists from The New York Times and The Washington Post.
Danny Woods (SFS ’16), who works for the PJC, pointed to Georgetown’s prestige as the factor that makes Faith Complex so successful in finding guests.
“[Faith Complex] gives them the chance to speak to a young college audience and to be involved in their development,” Woods said. “We, as Georgetown students, have a good reputation for being serious.”
The series, however, prides itself on its inclusion of Georgetown professors as guests, including former Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs visiting professor Abdullahi An-Na’im and sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson.
Berlinerblau said that he hoped to make professors a more prominent part of the show.
“Georgetown has such a dynamic faculty,” Berlinerblau said. “I want to help them radiate.”
This session of interviews included Director of the Religion and Public Policy Program at the Woodstock Theological Center Fr. Thomas Reese, S.J., Director of Research at the Public Religion Research Institute Daniel Cox, senior writer for Tablet Magazine Allison Hoffman, Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America Edwina Rogers, associate professor in the government department Michele Swers and author of “The Soul of Hip Hop” Daniel White Hodge.
In his interview, Reese spoke about the role of religion in the 2012 presidential election.
“I talked about the conflict between U.S. Catholic Bishops and Obama, and their concerns about abortion, gay marriage and the freedom of religion. I talked about the fact that Catholics voted for Obama instead of following the bishops,” Reese said.
Reese said that the student-conducted interviews were a welcome departure from his usual interviews with reporters.
“I’ve done a lot of these kinds of interviews,” Reese said. “I get hundreds of phone calls from reporters. It was nice to do it with Georgetown students.”
Reese added that the students were as good as professional reporters in conducting the interview.
“They had someone to do makeup. … It all went very seamlessly,” Reese said. “The interviewer had questions that they were prepared to ask. Normally, the producer will call you and give you a feel for what the angle [of the segment] is and what your responses will be, then when you get with the interviewer, God only knows what will happen. But [Faith Complex] was not like that.”
Katelyn McNelis (SFS ’15) interviewed Reese and was interested in his thoughts on Paul Ryan’s use of Catholicism to support his budget plan, which Reese has spoken about in many media outlets and as a guest on “The Colbert Report.”
“I was raised Catholic and my personal interpretation of Catholic doctrine isn’t in accordance with a lot of the ways Catholicism is taught by the bishops. It was interesting to hear that point of view from a priest,” McNelis said.
Reese was impressed by McNelis’ professionalism and interviewing skills.
“I told [her] she was just as good as [Stephen] Colbert,” Reese said.
Students participated in all aspects of the show’s production as hosts, producers and researchers, and they also gave input on which guests would appear on the show.
“This is not a normal college experience,” Audrey Anderson, PJC program officer and Faith Complex executive producer, said. “You’re building skills and putting them into practice in a real-life situation. This is also adding to students’ resumes; they each have a title within the credits.”
Woods said that the most surprising part of the experience was the interviewees’ nervousness in front of the cameras.
“It was surprising how doing something in front of a camera makes people more nervous,” Woods said. “It was interesting seeing some of our guests get nervous — I didn’t expect that.”The students involved were either members of the PJC or students in Berlinerblau’s proseminar.
“I got involved last winter when I went to a PJC interest meeting and was recruited,” McNelis said. “Once Berlinerblau explained to me the premise of the show, I was hooked. As someone who is extremely interested in religion and the different ways in which religion interacts with society, culture and politics, it was a perfect match.”
Participants also emphasized that although the series was associated with the PJC, the program spoke to a variety of different experiences.
“I really think [Faith Complex] is important because we’ve had a lot of people on the show who might be considered minorities,” Alexa West (SFS ’13) said. “The show is giving them a voice.”
Woods stressed that the diversity of the student participants contributes to the diversity of speakers on the show.
“I really like that we bring in all different perspectives and viewpoints, be they really conservative, liberal or somewhere in between,” Woods said. “Everyone has a voice.”
Berlinerblau added that Faith Complex is consistent with Georgetown’s goal of finding the intersection between religion and public policy.
“Our location in Washington, D.C. is unprecedented,” Berlinerblau said. “Georgetown takes these issues from both a spiritual and scholarly perspective so seriously. I can’t imagine having the show anywhere else.”

From the moment he arrived on the Hilltop this fall, University Provost Robert Groves has been fixated on correcting Georgetown’s technology shortcomings. Christmas came early Tuesday for Groves’ pet project — to the tune of $8 million.
The university will invest this sum over the next three years in the Initiative on Technology-Enhanced Learning. ITEL, which was announced earlier this fall, will support new uses of technology in the classroom, enhanced infrastructure to adequately handle this expanded use of technology and a consortium of both online and physical campuses committed to improving technology as it is used in education.
The initiative will begin by expanding the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, which administrators credited for providing a baseline for further initiatives.
“We have a leg up on other universities. If we hadn’t had [CNDLS], ITEL would’ve been a big jump,” Groves said. “I’m convinced we’ll pull it off, but I’m not sure I would be so bold without CNDLS.”
Depending on their comfort with technology, faculty and students can apply for demonstration grants, design and implementation grants or, at the most advanced level, “transformation grants.”
“[Transformation grants] are really where faculty and students are rethinking what it means to teach a particular kind of class or material,” Associate Provost and CNDLS Director Randy Bass said. “What comes out is a substantial shift in time, in studying [and] in engaging materials.”
According to Groves, introductory courses are likely to be the first affected by transformation grants. With more technological capabilities outside of the classroom, such as listening to lectures online, students are expected to be able to spend class time learning specific skills and participating in modules.
Individual faculty members, faculty teams and student-faculty pairs from all three university campuses will be able to apply for grants in mid-February, and the university will announce accepted proposals in the beginning of April.
“We’re trying to get a lot of people involved in new things and trying to go deeply in a few places,” Bass said. “Imagine what we can get out of a deeper project spread to a large number of people involved with smaller things. We’re trying to go broad and deep [and] spread out over the years.”
The university has not yet decided which schools or online groups will be involved in the proposed learning consortium, which is one of the three main goals Groves outlined in his announcement. Groves envisions the consortium as a way to bring Georgetown into the larger learning community through expansive online course offerings.
While acknowledging that some faculty members have expressed concern about Georgetown’s online presence overpowering its physical campus, as these online courses can enroll a virtually limitless number of students, Groves said he sees the new initiative as an expression of dedication to Georgetown’s future.
“Is there a danger? Yes,” Groves said. “There’s discussion among faculty about what’s true to our mission and what isn’t true to our mission. … Strategically we’ve made the commitment, decided [and] judged that there will be a Georgetown 100 years from now [and it] will be a place where students will come to interact with faculty. Regardless of technology, this deep, face-to-face interaction will be a part of university education.”
To develop ITEL, Groves created a working group of students and faculty from a variety of campuses and departments and drew on the expertise of [email protected], a group of administrators and faculty with a more specialized background in technology.
The Georgetown University Student Association and the Office of the Provost nominated Tyler Sax (COL ’13) to serve as the student representative on the working group because of his past work withCNDLS.
Sax stressed that ITEL aims to take a new holistic approach to changing the face of technology in Georgetown’s classrooms.
“It’s been a top-down conversation about how this fits into the university as a whole,” Sax said. “It’s not about putting lectures online or using clickers more; it’s about rethinking the way we’re teaching.”
During discussions focused on how ITEL would affect the university budget or faculty time spent on research, Sax brought up the student perspective.
“I recognize that everyone approaches school differently, and, as a part of this mission, we have to think about how different people learn,” he said. “If we get it right, students are going to end up getting a lot more out of their professors than they are today. … For Georgetown in general this is making a statement that we want to remain a premier, competitive university in the 21st century.”
According to government professor Mark Rom, who represented the Georgetown Public Policy Institute on the working group, ITEL would affect undergraduate courses more than graduate courses, since graduate courses are usually more discussion based and would provide limited opportunities for using technology.
But Rom, who frequently uses blogs, clickers and online presentations in his undergraduate courses, emphasized that ITEL will provide the tools for a necessary reevaluation of teaching methods.
“We have deep, intellectual concerns about how teaching as a university profession works,” Rom said. “In some ways, we kind of loom like medieval monks; we still stand in front of the classroom and talk. It seems like a lecture class is hardly the model for how we should typically do it.”
According to Bass, ITEL represents an expansion of the university’s previous forays into technology.
“It’s like Chef Emeril says: ‘Let’s kick it up a notch,’” Bass said. “We’re taking the work we’ve been doing for the last 10 to 12 years, taking what has been on the margins to the institutional level.”
Groves and Bass expect to see these larger projects implemented within the next 18 months and to see the full impact of ITEL within the next two to three years.
“We’re working toward making sure current freshmen, sophomores and juniors will see some of this before they leave here,” Groves said. “It’s not something your children will see; it’s something you should see.”

Georgetown students have joined forces with StudyHall, an online learning platform that they believe can complement Blackboard as a useful online platform for education, though they have not reached out to the Georgetown administration.
Approximately 650 Georgetown undergraduates have signed up for the service, as have approximately 1,000 people throughout the university.
StudyHall performs many of the same functions as Blackboard but also provides a simple tool for communication between students in a class, something site developer Welles Robinson (COL ’14), who joined StudyHall as an intern this summer and built the website before its launch this fall, said Blackboard lacks.
“If I had a question, there was no one to ask it to,” Robinson said. “If you sit next to someone, you know their first name — that’s not enough to look them up on Facebook.”
According to Robinson, Blackboard has a diverse role at Georgetown and at other schools beyond its learning platform. He said that StudyHall does not seek to compete with Blackboard in those respects, but he believes that StudyHall’s online learning tool is more effective.
“Blackboard is so embedded in Georgetown,” Robinson said. “Not only is it a website, but they also do everything, including card swiping on GOCards. [StudyHall] is much more about the ability of students to interact with each other online, opposed to Blackboard as a destination site where you go to download an assignment and leave.”
In addition to providing a platform for students to communicate with each other, StudyHall would provide a platform for professors to share material with people outside the Georgetown community through video lectures and online learning tools.
StudyHall founder and CEO Ross Blankenship echoed Robinson in describing his reasoning for developing the service.
“I didn’t see any passion, any energy about Blackboard,” Blankenship said. “Students are using Google Docs, Dropbox and 10 other things [in addition to Blackboard]. We want to make it easier for students.”
However, Blankenship stressed StudyHall’s unique role, independent of whether Blackboard remains the main university-sponsored online learning tool.
“This is not just to replace Blackboard. What I’m talking about is giving professors the opportunity to reach out to the world,” Blankenship said.
At present, StudyHall has student users at approximately 30 colleges, but does not partner with university administrations specifically. Instead, the service’s strategy is to reach out to student leaders through the National Society of Collegiate Scholars and to count on word of mouth to promote its platform at individual colleges.
“We spend a lot more time going to students first because the administration tends to be very slow to react,” Robinson said. “Students are much faster to adopt new technology than universities themselves are.”

Two years after the online course evaluation system was first introduced in spring 2010, the University Registrar has completely eliminated paper evaluations this semester in addition to  posting evaluation results alongside course descriptions on MyAccess.
According to Manager of Faculty Evaluations Caitlin Harding, the online evaluation system was an optional choice for faculty until spring 2011. In fall 2011, the online evaluation became the default, and paper surveys remained an option for faculty. This is the first semester in which all evaluations must be conducted online.
University Registrar John Pierce explained that the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship recommended the transition to improve the quality of course assessments.
“There are more opportunities for error with paper,” he said.
Pierce added that online evaluations allow professors to add customized questions, which generates more relevant responses.
Associate professor of French Andrew Sobanet, who has used paper evaluations until this semester, added specialized questions to his online course evaluations this year but had mixed feelings about the online system.
“The only negative thing I see in the online-only evaluation is that there has to be a mechanism put in place where we maximize student participation,” Sobanet said. “Otherwise you get the weird self-selection you see on Rate My Professor, where evaluations are more polarized.”
Another source of concern is that since the web option was launched, response rates for web-based evaluations have been lower than previous response rates for paper-based evaluations.
In spring 2011, paper-based evaluations yielded an 86.9 percent response rate while web-based evaluations yielded a 77 percent response rate. In fall 2011, the respective numbers were 92 percent and 71.1 percent.
Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) pointed out that the decline in response rates elicited concerns among faculty.
“A lot of faculty and staff were worried that they wouldn’t get the kind of percentage responses that they had in the past, since when they required us to do it in class it’s basically 100 percent participation,” Gustafson said.
Despite the drop in response rates for web-based course evaluations during the transition period, Harding expressed optimism that they will eventually increase.
“Nearly all institutions with an online course evaluation system report seeing a drop in response rates when the online system [is] initially rolled out, but these institutions also report a gradual  return to prior response rates or higher over the years following the conversion,” Harding wrote in an email.
According to Harding, Cornell University saw an increase from 50 percent to 70 percent after the full transition, while Brigham Young University also had a similar increase from 50 percent to 72 percent.
Harding pointed out that other universities’ experiences indicate that the most important factor in raising response rates is high-quality and frequent communication from instructors directly to their students.
“The idea is that if instructors encourage, welcome and explain their use of student feedback, the students will understand that their contributions make a difference and will be more likely to respond,” she wrote in an email.
As part of an effort to encourage students to complete course evaluations online, the registrar has created prize raffles offering iPads, iPod Shuffles and iPod Touches.
In order to make the survey process easier and increase student awareness about the importance of evaluations, the registrar has also sent out regular reminder emails to students with log-in information and links to the evaluations included.
Students were mostly in favor of the online evaluations, but also agreed that they could lead to a lower response rate.
“People who do fill them out are going to fill them out more honestly and put a little more thought into it than they would if they were just trying to do it at the end of class,” Bo Julie Crowley (COL ’15) said. “They might get a lower overall turnout but the responses will be more accurate.”
Pierce stressed the importance of maintaining response rates, as faculty members and academic departments rely heavily on course evaluations to improve their teaching and programming.
“The faculty in general takes evaluations seriously and uses responses to make continual improvements to courses. The institution relies on numerical results in merit review and tenure. We take it as a serious opportunity to solicit thoughtful feedback from students and actually use it to inform important decisions,” Pierce said.

The Student Activities Commission announced Monday that it would allocate $172,000 in funding for spring semester, fulfilling 66.9 percent of all funding requests.
Though this figure is the highest amount of funding ever allocated by SAC, it represents the lowest percentage of requests ever fulfilled, resulting in reduced funding for recipient groups.
SAC Chair Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) attributed the increase in requested funds and subsequent inability to fund these requests to SAC’s recent encouragement of big projects.
“We always encourage groups to be ambitious with programming because the more ambitious the programs are, the greater they can be,” Appelbaum said. “The only issue is that ambitious programs are also more expensive.”
SAC budgeted 45 percent of available funds for the fall, with the remaining 55 percent left for spring to adjust for an expected increase in funding requests, since the spring semester historically has more programming because of a spike in celebrations and balls during that period.
Appelbaum added that many groups requested funding for spring conferences this year.
“We’re pleased to be able to support these conferences, but they are very expensive,” Appelbaumsaid.
In order to determine funding for each group, SAC scales down groups’ budgets based on the SAC budget guide. The remaining budget total is then compared to how much funding is available.
“Groups submit a budget to us, then we review it line by line to see what we can allocate based on a budget guide. We try to keep the process as objective as possible,” Appelbaum said. “The total funding requested was higher than the available funds, so we had to scale down budgets across the board evenly to get the amount we allocate down to the funds available.”
Former College Democrats President Joseph Vandegriff (COL ’14) expressed concern that the funding cut will make it harder for clubs to fund events with rigid costs.
“If we’re talking about a movie watch, it’s a simple matter of ordering less pizza,” Vandegriff said. “But for events such as renting out a place or paying a speaker to come, where you need a definite amount of money, [the cut] makes your life harder. It’s going to take a lot of creativity on everybody’s part.”
Nevertheless, according to Vandegriff many of College Democrats’ speakers are elected officials, who cannot legally charge for a public appearance.
“It’s really paying for spaces, tables, chairs and other things we need that is going to be tough,”Vandegriff said.
International Relations Club Chair Emilie Siegler (SFS ’14) agreed and pointed to the fact that most IRC costs are food related.
“I think the funding cuts [for food] are understandable because sometimes we do order more than we actually need,” Siegler said. “It makes us think, ‘how much do we actually need for the people who are going to come’? Maybe instead of ordering 10 pies, we order five pies.”
Siegler said that the IRC was prepared for some sort of cut, though perhaps not as large as SAC announced.
“The funding for food and small events primarily comes from SAC,” Siegler said. “But for larger events such as renting out [Copley Hall] for a speaker event, we look to organizations like the [Georgetown University Student Association] and the [Georgetown University Lecture Fund] as possible sources of funding. We have a very strong programming schedule and everyone on campus benefits, so I think that people really understand and help us out.”
Vandegriff said that he hoped SAC would be able to fund a higher percentage of group requests in coming semesters.
“I know it’s hard to find a system that works for everybody,” Vandegriff said. “I hope SAC can find a way to stop the downward spiral we’ve seen in the percentages.”

The Social Innovation Public Service Fund will distribute $14,300 among four student winners announced last night in its first-ever round of grants.
Kristin Trivelli (NHS ’14), Tommy Larson (SFS ’13), Tyler Eldridge (SFS ’13) and the Hilltop Microfinance Initiative will each receive grant money to fund four social justice projects.
“We’ve seen about 25 [applications] so far this year, which has really blown us away,” said SIPS Director Tyler Sax (COL ’13). “That incredible demand is indicative of that huge gap that we’re filling; it really demonstrates what a need for funding for these types of projects there is.”
The first round of grant recipients have proposed a diverse set of projects with a common focus on building relationships and sustainable service initiatives.
“Sustainability is a major criterion,” said Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., a SIPS board member. “We mean ‘sustainability’ both in terms of continuing involvement here on the Georgetown campus, but also in connection to the communities we serve.”
SIPS offers funding to projects throughout the year drawn from $50,000 earned from the interest of the $1.5 million endowment allocated by the Student Activities Fee Endowment reform, which was created in February. The initiative considers applications on a rolling basis.
The four student projects will target different locations: Ghana, India, Haiti and locally in Washington, D.C.
Trivelli will receive $3,500 to work as a student nurse in a hospital at a cleft center in Guwahati, India, over winter break. She will also volunteer at an orphanage and at the nonprofit Pratyasha Foundation, which cooks and delivers meals to impoverished children. Beyond these immediate goals, Trivelli aims to make the trip an annual venture with a different goal every year.
“My goal with this SIPS fund is to create a sustainable annual trip from Georgetown to Guwahati to volunteer at one of these nonprofits,” Trivelli said “Every year you go with one goal, whether it is teach them how to take care of their teeth or hair hygiene or physical activity.”
On the other side of the globe, Larson will travel to Haiti, most likely during spring break, along with Naman Trivedi (SFS ’16), Caroline James (COL ’16) and Alex Koeberle (COL ’14), who helped Larson apply. Using $4,000 from SIPS, the group will install a solar-powered charging station where rural entrepreneurs will be able to make a profit charging cell phones and other small devices in Fonds-Parisien, a rural area east of Port au Prince.
“Normally these stations are powered by diesel, but those are expensive to fuel, so the idea of this project is to replace the diesel with solar,” Larson said.
In the long term, the system will eventually pay for itself, despite its high start-up cost.
“One [of our goals] is to set up a self-sustaining business model that, once the money comes back into our account, can be rolled out again and again to other areas of Haiti,” Larson said.
Larson added that his initiative aims to raise awareness about the plight the country faces in hopes of involving more students with initiatives in Haiti in the future.
“We’ve got a country that is almost a failed state right off our shores, and bringing more talent there would be just a great way to get them exposed to issues of development and also get a few other kids hooked on Haiti,” Larson said.
Like Larson, Eldridge will bring a sustainable business model to a poor community when he uses $1,500 from SIPS to travel to Ghana during winter break to implement a water treatment facility in the drought-stricken northern region. Eldridge is also aiming to raise $3,000 on fundraising website Crowdrise by Dec. 10.
Eldridge will teach local women how to run the business in partnership with Boston-based nonprofit Community Water Solutions.
“At least two current students both went to Ghana last year and one of the directors of the nonprofit itself is a Georgetown alum,” Eldridge said.  “I’d like to see it more of an institutionalized program at Georgetown.”
Alissa Orlando (SFS ’13), Alex Honjiyo (SFS ’13) and Craig Melcher (MSB ’13) of the Hilltop Microfinance Initiative  will use their SIPS grant of $5,000 to launch a program to build credit reports for small business and citizenship loans.
Founded in 2008, HMFI has focused on giving out small business loans to help local entrepreneurs who cannot obtain them from banks, which has enabled business owners to purchase materials necessary for their businesses. The grant will be used to expand HMFI’s scope to issue small credit-builder loans of $600, which their clients will pay back for the sole purpose of raising their credit score. In order to issue these loans, HMFI must report to a credit agency, which requires them to have a secure office space and mailing address. Part of the SIPS grant will be used to fund the organization’s rent at a new office.
“This is really momentous for our organization because it really allows us to empower our clients to a much greater degree,” Honjiyo said.
HMFI is composed of 25 Georgetown students, making it a match for SIPS’ emphasis on widespread student involvement.
“We have a certain bias towards those [proposals] that use more Georgetown students,” Carnes said. “We especially like seeing dialogue with faculty and especially students.”
Since there is no strict funding timeline in place, SIPS wants to get as many people involved this year as possible, with four to five new projects likely to be funded early next semester.
“We wanted to make a process that reflected the fact that entrepreneurship and ingenuity don’t come on a schedule,” Sax said.
Moving forward, SIPS looks to build upon what it considers a successful beginning and create a community around the organization.
“It’s great to have a few dozen students who have great ideas and want to apply, but what’s more important is turning it into a sense of community around those ideas,” Sax said. “Part of the original mission statement of SIPS was not only funding projects but aiming to create a culture of public service at Georgetown.”

Wardah Athar (COL ’13) is not your typical science student. While many neurobiology majors may be pouring over orgo textbooks in Regents as their ticket to medical school, Athar is busy applying her studies outside of the classroom. A recent recipient of the Mitchell Scholarship, which will fund her graduate studies in Dublin, Ireland, Athar will be focusing on a union between medicine and research in order to further medical developments. In her free time, she is also completing a certificate in Islam and Muslim-Christian understanding and is heavily involved in research on campus — specifically, working in Professor Donoghue’s neurobiology lab studying cerebral cortical development.
What else are you involved in on campus?
I’ve conducted research in a developmental neuroscience lab since my freshman year, so I spend a lot of my time in a white lab coat playing with mice and cackling evilly to myself (but really). I’m also a member of the Carroll Fellows Initiative and the Howard Hughes Scholars Program and am co-chair of the Undergraduate Research Ambassadors, so I’m really invested in highlighting undergraduate research on campus, helping other students find research opportunities and just generally telling everyone how awesome research is. I’m also the current president of the Muslim Students Association. Lastly, I’m a teaching assistant for BIOL-101 and a leader for the ESCAPE retreat program, which is awesome and all freshmen should go on. 
What led you to do research here at Georgetown? 
Honestly, I kind of fell into it. I started here staunchly pre-med, and I just wanted to get done with undergrad so I could go to med school. Luckily, though, I met a professor, Maria Donoghue, during an Intro Bio seminar and really clicked with her. I went to one of her lab meetings, she offered me a spot to work there in the summer, I took it and I’m still working there nearly four years later.
Working in her lab gave me this sense of ownership of my work that I hadn’t gotten from any of my courses, and that ownership was really what caused me to fall in love with neuroscience and with research. I just think it’s so cool that when I get results from an experiment, I’m the first person in the whole world to know that small piece of science. Yes, my friends and family have alerted me to the fact that this is super dorky.
What would you say are the biggest benefits to being involved in undergraduate research?
Research gives you ownership of your work. You get real expertise, real knowledge, in your research area, and that’s very difficult to come by as an undergrad. So even if you don’t want to be an academic or a researcher later in life, it’s valuable to develop this extra skill set and to obtain real expertise.
What was it like to win the Mitchell Scholarship?
It was insane. I knew that they call everyone on the same day as the interview, so the waiting was driving me crazy. Still, though, when I got the call that evening, I was just in shock. I had some friends over and they were jumping up and down and screaming while I was still talking to the Mitchell director, and then I called my parents in Saudi Arabia, where it was about 3 a.m. It was all very surreal, and I’m just incredibly thankful for the opportunity.
Looking forward, my Mitchell year will be a great way of not just studying neuroscience but also of building ties between American science and Irish science. I’m also really excited to travel! The 12 Mitchell scholars are spread out all over the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, so there’s a lot of travelling between cities to visit each other and also a lot of traveling to other places in Europe. I didn’t go abroad during my time at Georgetown, so I certainly plan to make up for it next year.
What does this mean for your post-graduation plans? Med school? Career?
After my Mitchell year, I’m hoping to enter a joint MD/PhD program to become a physician scientist. I’ve always wanted to practice medicine because it’s a tangible way of making an impact and serving others, but I’ve realized that medicine alone isn’t enough. We need to better understand how the brain functions before we can create new treatments, and the only way to do that is through research. I think that marrying research and medicine is a way of having a meaningful, immediate impact while also looking to the future and creating a knowledge base that will help us develop more sophisticated medical techniques in years to come. I love the idea of using individual medical cases to inform research projects and then using discoveries from those projects to better treat future patients!
 
What is the most valuable thing you’ve gained from your research experience?
The realization that failure is a part of life. In all honesty, 97 percent of the time, our experiments don’t work. We believe that the science gods have a very mean sense of humor. We have to keep redoing experiments and changing them and troubleshooting them before we can even begin to think about getting real data, and that’s a very humbling experience. It’s not that I think anyone should accept failure but rather that we will all encounter it at one point or another, so the only solution is to get up and throw yourself at the problem again, from a different direction.

The House of Representatives passed a bill Nov. 30 that would grant green cards to graduates of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, also known as STEM, masters and doctorate programs.
The STEM Jobs Act reallocates 55,000 visas from the Diversity Visa program that served people from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.
While the measure did not make it past the House when it was originally proposed in September, the most recent attempt garnered support from both Democrats and Republicans.
The legislation, however, is not expected to be debated in the Senate until the new Congress forms early next year because of the debate surrounding the fiscal cliff.
Among math and sciences at Georgetown, a significant number of graduate students are foreign.
In the mathematics and statistics department, about 20 out of 80 students are international while approximately half of the chemistry department’s 70 doctoral candidates are from other countries.
Professors in STEM fields have mixed opinions about the legislation.
YuYe Tong, head of the chemistry department, said that the bill failed to address the difficulties of the visa application process itself. According to Tong, graduates can apply for an EB-2 visa that guarantees permanent residency to those who have employment offers, but he said that the process is time consuming. In addition, the company-sponsored H-1B visa has a quota and is rendered void once the worker quits or is fired.
Ken Shaw, director of graduate studies for mathematics and statistics, agreed that the sponsorship portion of the visa is a problem for STEM students.
“Nearly all [of] the international students want to stay in the U.S. and find permanent employment. And nearly all seem to have some trouble finding a position that will sponsor them for residency,” he wrote in an email. “Persistence pays off but many have to return to their home countries.”
Although Shaw wrote that the bill would help many math and statistics graduates get jobs in fields that typically require citizenship, Tong said that providing visas would leave a surplus of scientists.
“You don’t want to keep those people who can’t find jobs so what I would say is that you should automatically give people green cards if they can find a job,” Tong said.
Other professors, however, say that not all graduates want to stay in the U.S.
“The times have changed now: a lot of students come now and return to their home countries,” saidMakarand Paranjape, co-director of graduate studies in the physics department. “A lot of the students from China have a desire to learn here and return to China. It’s not necessarily true now that they flock to the U.S. because it’s the land of opportunity, because they have chances in their home countries.”
He stressed that the government must weigh the costs and benefits of the visa allocation system.
“You’ve got to be wary about how the green cards would be allotted, if they’re going to be add- on, additional or if they’re going to be taken away from other places,” he said.

The impending “fiscal cliff” for the budget deficit, which would cause a combination of automatic federal tax increases and spending cuts early next year, could compromise the availability of federally funded financial aid programs to Georgetown students.
Unless Congress can agree on a deficit-reduction deal before it adjourns Dec. 21, $55 billion will automatically be cut from domestic programs. The Office of Management and Budget projects that funding for individual programs will decrease on average by about 8.2 percent.
The Federal Work-Study program would be among the victims of these automatic spending cuts. Most need-based financial aid packages offered to Georgetown students include money from the program.
Funding for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant would also face automatic cuts. Georgetown uses these funds to supplement Pell Grant aid for students with the greatest financial need.
Pell Grants, while exempt from automatic tax cuts, could be affected in the next few years, according to Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations.
Fleming said that Georgetown’s Office of Federal Relations’ primary strategy is to lobby Congress to reach a deal by Dec. 21 to ensure it does not invoke automatic tax cuts, also known as sequestration.
“We’re trying to do our part through my office to advocate for taking steps that will prevent sequestration because it is a very problematic approach to dealing with all of this,” Fleming said. “We have certainly been talking to congressional offices about that.”
While the spending cuts would affect aid packages for the 2013-2014 academic year, Fleming said those for next semester will remain intact.
As the fiscal cliff approaches, a deadlocked Congress has created an atmosphere of uncertainty.
“We don’t know what our allocations are, so we can’t really plan until we do,” Fleming said. “We don’t even know what the baseline is from which the 8.2 percent cut would be made because [Congress] hasn’t passed any appropriations bills.”
Even in the event of cuts to federal support for financial aid, Georgetown administrators are determined to keep Georgetown open to applicants of all financial backgrounds through its need-blind admissions policy, regardless of reductions in government funding.
“We need to be sure that talented students of any background have this chance, and if Georgetown’s where they want to be, it’s imperative upon us that we make that a possibility,” said Charles Deacon, dean of undergraduate admissions.
In times of increasing financial austerity, some colleges are revising their aid distribution policies. Wesleyan University will no longer examine all of its applicants on a need-blind basis, according to the New York Times. For its 2013 freshman class, Wesleyan will admit as many students as it can without looking at their ability to pay tuition. When its entire financial aid budget is used, however, ability to pay will factor into students’ acceptance.
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, Georgetown will continue to review all applications on a need-blind basis.
Grinnell College in Iowa, which awards financial aid to nearly 90 percent of its students, is also considering implementing policies similar to those announced by Wesleyan. Other colleges, such as Williams and Dartmouth, have moved away from their grant-only financial aid offerings and are now requiring students to take out loans to receive their entire award. Deacon worries that these changes to financial aid policies will decrease diversity on those campuses.
“If you have fewer students on financial need, you’re going to be less socioeconomically diverse, and that usually means you’ll have less ethnic diversity,” Deacon said.
However, Deacon expressed some doubt that such a policy can remain in place forever, acknowledging that in the coming years, federal funding will play a role in determining Georgetown’s financial aid policies.
“Hopefully, as we’re going forward, we will continue to be successful in raising the kind of money for financial aid that will make that policy possible,” Deacon said. “I guess you can’t foresee the future totally, and it is a matter of funding in the long run. I think there’s going to be a lot of pressure on the government to adopt additional policies to support financial aid for students.”
