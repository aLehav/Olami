The Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University welcomed five new members to its advisory board to aid in efforts to reshape the school’s representation and inclusion policies.
The new members, voted onto the SFS Board of Advisors on March 25, will contribute to an ongoing review process intended to identify ways for the SFS community to represent a more diverse group of people, according to Joel Hellman, dean of the SFS. The board, including the new appointees, consists of 43 members who are SFS graduates, parents of current students or community members. The board’s role is to guide the dean’s office and the school administration in areas like fundraising and outreach across graduate and parent networks. 
The new appointments highlight an increase in representation of people from different career paths, backgrounds and identities, according to Alma Caballero (SFS ’13, GRD ’15), one of the new board members. 
“I think that this is a testament to the efforts that Dean Hellman and the university are trying to conduct in bringing much more of that diversity, and it’s not only a diversity of ethnicity but also diversity of thought and a diversity of experience and a diversity of background, so I think that’s a positive step forward,” Caballero said in a video interview with The Hoya.
Caballero, who will be the youngest member ever to serve on the board, comes from a background in global consulting with a focus on Latin America and currently serves as the regional director for northern Latin America at McLarty Associates, a global strategy advisory firm in Washington, D.C. 
“The fact that I was nominated and voted to be part of the board is a substantial change because it’s the first time that a young alumni will be part of the board,” Caballero said. 
The incoming board members were elected in part because of their commitment to the Georgetown University community and because they bring different perspectives from those who have been historically represented on the board, according to Hellman.
“We are in the process of reviewing the role of the board, and in that process, we thought it was important to bring on right away a group of more diverse voices into the board so that they can be part of that discussion,” Hellman said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
The process of becoming a board member includes prior engagement with the SFS for some time and in different capacities, such as participating in coffee chats or planning for the school’s centennial activities, according to Hellman. 
The board must explore why certain demographics are underrepresented in the student body of the SFS, according to Zaid Zaid (SFS ’97), one of the new board members. Zaid currently works as the lead on Facebook’s North America strategic response policy team on U.S. politics and elections and previously served in the Obama administration.
“The number of Black students that are in SFS every year is low, and part of that means that we need to do better recruitment,” Zaid said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Part of it means that we need to think about why students at Georgetown are choosing other schools, but I’m not sure what the answer is yet.”
Across all four undergraduate schools, 6.3% of Georgetown students identify as Black, 9.5% of students identify as Hispanic or Latino and 10.4% of students identify as Asian, according to the university’s 2019-20 Campus Demographics Survey. An additional 48.8% of undergraduates identify as white. 
The board is also welcoming Nick Talwar (SFS ’95), who currently serves as the president and CEO of the technology investment platform CircleUp, and Brionne Dawson (SFS ’02), who works in diplomatic and foreign policy at the Bureau for Economic and Business Affairs at the U.S. Department of State. 
Also joining the board is Lulu Garcia-Navarro (SFS ’94), the host of “Weekend Edition Sunday” and the news podcast “Up First: at NPR. Garcia-Navarro has also worked as a foreign correspondent in Brazil, Israel, Mexico and Iraq.
A more diverse student body in the SFS will change the demographics of the next generation of foreign service officers, according to Garcia-Navarro. 
“Elite institutions need to make room at the table for different kinds of students,” Garcia-Navarro said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “The School of Foreign Service has such a very close relationship with the cadre of the State Department in this country. Because of that close relationship, it is even more incumbent on the School of Foreign Service to really open up the ranks to other types of people because that will help shape actually how the American government itself functions.”

Georgetown University students are now able to donate unused meal plan money to be redistributed in order to combat food insecurity on campus through mutual aid efforts.
Georgetown Mutual Aid, a student group established in 2020 to help distribute funds to students in need, is collaborating with the student-run nonprofit The Corp to provide students with greater access to food through the reallocation of Flex dollars, which can be used at many of Georgetown’s dining services.
Students can indicate an amount of Flex dollars to donate through a Google Form, and The Corp will charge that amount to the student’s account and hold it in an account of funds to be redistributed, according to Rose Dallimore (SFS ’22), community engagement chair and board member at large of The Corp. Students can request funds through another form, and The Corp redistributes the collected Flex dollars raised. Students can use donated Flex dollars for groceries, food and coffee at The Corp Café, a breakfast and coffee shop in the Healey Family Student Center. 
The Corp’s ability to hold Flex dollars presented a chance to work together to achieve the vision of Georgetown Mutual Aid, according to Dallimore. 
 “We saw an opportunity to use their structure, our capacity for flex collection, and the only Corp service which is currently open — The Corp Café at the HFSC — to combat food insecurity and serve the on-campus community,” Dallimore wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
A 2016 survey conducted by the Georgetown University Student Association found that 54 percent of the 351 students surveyed had experienced food insecurity during their time at Georgetown, and two-thirds of those students received need-based financial aid. 
Additional stressors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or financial concerns, often heighten food insecurity, according to Dallimore.
“The need for the drive is the unfortunate reality that even with support resources from the university, many students still do struggle with food insecurity,” Dallimore wrote. “Individual circumstances, such as dietary and COVID-based restrictions and personal, financial and familial stressors may produce scenarios where students require extra support.”
The redistribution program offers a solution to food insecurity and also encourages aid within the Georgetown community, according to Dallimore. 
“Opening up dining options further and sourcing Flex donations is an accessible way to promote community mutual aid without requiring students to pay out of pocket,” Dallimore wrote. “Rather, asking them to donate the Flex that we were required to have in our meal plans by the university, which in many cases, is going under-used.”
Students have desired to donate Flex dollars to Georgetown Mutual Aid before, but funds could not be held past the end of the semester without The Corp’s help, according to Binqi Chen (NHS ’22) and Megan Huynh (NHS ’22), co-founders of Georgetown Mutual Aid.
“Having an official partnership through The Corp where they have previously done similar work helps to facilitate this process and ensure that any donated money is being completely utilized,” Chen and Huynh wrote. “Because FLEX expires at the end of the semester, our partnership with The Corp is a way to get around that deadline because The Corp is able to store that money indefinitely in order to be used later on.”
Since Feb. 22, the Georgetown Mutual Aid Network has raised $495 in Flex and has redistributed $320 of it to 15 students, according to Chen and Huynh.
Students living on campus raised prior concerns over food resources after the university required all students living on campus this semester to purchase the All Access 7 meal plan, which includes $200 in Flex dollars. Students argued they should not have to pay for the plan if there are cheaper alternative food options.
The university is working to help students suffering from food insecurity in a variety of ways, including through the Hoya Hub, an on-campus food pantry open to students, according to a university spokesperson.
“Georgetown is committed to supporting students with food insecurity and the University meets the full needs of students who require financial assistance paying for college, including tuition, housing and meal expenses. For the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic Georgetown has supported students with housing and food insecurity on campus,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As the food pantry continues its operation, we will also continue broader dialogue about food insecurity across our campus so we can ensure the university is addressing the needs of community members seeking additional food resources.”
Although the Flex Fund began during COVID-19, The Corp and Georgetown Mutual Aid both see it as a long-term resource for students, according to Chen and Huynh.
“As long as students have a need for this resource, we will continue to use this as an avenue for mutual aid. However, whether it remains in the same format as it does now is something that is subject to change,” Chen and Huynh wrote. “Our main goal is to make sure that students are taking care of their peers and that all our community’s needs are met.”

Former Trump administration official turned critic Christopher Krebs warned the integrity of the electoral process is in danger of being undermined at an April 13 Zoom event. 
At the event, Krebs, who served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency from 2018 to 2020, discussed his recommendations for how the government can protect election integrity by combatting disinformation and upgrading the security within voting software as technology becomes more sophisticated. The event was co-hosted by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service and the Georgetown University Center for Security Studies. 
In 2018, Krebs was tasked with leading the newly formed CISA under the Department of Homeland Security. After the 2020 election campaign came to a close, former President Donald Trump continued to repeat that the election had been stolen from him due to unverified claims of election fraud. Krebs publicly refuted Trump’s claims, which led to his Nov. 17 firing from the administration. 
Despite the claims of Trump and his allies, there is no evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election, according to Krebs.
“We know there wasn’t any interference. We not only didn’t see any activity that would lead to any sort of suspicion of tampering, but the proof was in the ballots,” Krebs said. “You could go back and audit and recount, and that’s what Georgia did.”
Security obstacles in the electoral process were unfortunately multiplied after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the country, according to Krebs. In order to prevent further spread of the disease, many Americans filled out and mailed in absentee ballots, a form of voting that Trump repeatedly delegitimized, making security experts’ jobs much more difficult, Krebs said.
Despite these additional challenges, Krebs’ team was able to work with state and local officials to run a smooth 2020 election. However, Krebs said the Biden administration still needs to make it a priority to increase government infrastructure security.
“It’s even bigger than just elections. It’s state and local government agencies writ large need to go through a digital transformation, and I’m concerned that COVID-19 will have a disproportionate impact on local communities and their ability to upgrade their technologies.”
Krebs also discussed the topic of social media as a form of interference and how people in the United States can spread disinformation. In fact, the security community’s biggest worry in the summer of 2020 was not a hack interfering with machines but the danger of a false claim on social media going viral, according to Krebs. 
“The way we framed it was, ‘How would any actor seek to either technically disrupt an election or undermine confidence in an election?’” Krebs said. “We had dozens of scenarios built out that you could go find out one township in Pennsylvania and claim that you did something and it could be a pivotal county that would all of a sudden be within a margin of error.”
When any alerting post is identified online, Krebs said security experts like himself do their best to get in front of the problem. However, experts must walk a deliberate and precise line in how they flag false information, he said. 
“Through talking to the lie, you amplify it and give it credibility, and so there’s that balance of, ‘Is this ready for interruption yet?’ ‘Okay, now it is, let’s go get it,’” Krebs said. “You do not want to draw attention to a thing, but if it is out there, you have to kill it with fire.” 
While experts will continue to learn from this past election cycle and adapt the election process to the digital transformation, Krebs said individuals can continue to do their part to uphold our political system by becoming more digitally literate and finding ways to be civically engaged.
“Some of the threats against election workers is going to have a chilling effect, and there will be a lot of attrition among election workers,” Krebs said. “I would recommend that everyone, at least for one cycle, volunteer to be an election worker, get out there and understand how our democracy works.”

Despite harsh Midwest winters, Phillip Catanzaro (COL ’23) has been sporting surf wear both on and off his surfboard year-round since he was a kid.
Growing up in Cleveland, Catanzaro spent much of his free time as an avid member of the city’s little-known surfing community, heading to Lake Erie’s cold and unpredictable shores whenever he had the time, he wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“While most do not consider Lake Erie to be the surfing capital of the world, it still has an awesome community of surfers,” Catanzaro wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I loved the surfing vibe and since I was old enough to swim my wardrobe has been mostly popular surf brands.”
Until last year, surfing had always been just a hobby for Catanzaro. Under the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, Catanzaro turned to his surfing community as a source of support in understanding where the future of the country was headed. 
After many conversations with fellow surfers about how activism could be incorporated into a part of their sport, Catanzaro decided to launch a surf-inspired clothing line called Paisan Clothing Company in May 2020. The brand, named after an Italian expression that means “mate,” aims to bring sustainable, wearable everyday surfing clothing with social justice ties to the fashion industry, according to Catanzaro.
“To me, the Paisan lifestyle aligns the awesome spirit of surfing communities across the globe,” Catanzaro wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The brand donates $5 to a charity of the customer’s choice with each purchase. Customers have a range in organizations and causes they can choose to support. In 2020, Paisan donated $1,000 to charities including Black Lives Matter, environmental nonprofit Sierra Club Foundation, ocean awareness and cleanup nonprofit Surfrider Foundation, humanitarian aid organization UNICEF and international medical aid organization Doctors Without Borders, according to Catanzaro.
Paisan is committed to working with ethical manufacturers to limit waste procured during production and to ensure fair worker compensation, according to Catanzaro. 
“A large part of Paisan’s ethical mission as a brand is to try to shift the apparel industry from fast fashion to slow fashion, and we’re working towards that with our significantly more sustainable model of on-demand production,” Catanzaro wrote. “Holding a high ethical standard to us doesn’t just stop at the environment.”
Catanzaro began reading about how companies in the fashion industry handle unsold clothing, and he was struck by the magnitude of items that go unsold and are then thrown away. One such company, fashion brand H&M, burned nearly 60 tons of unsold clothing between 2013 and 2018. Catanzaro has worked to ensure Paisan does not contribute to this growing trend.
“Each product in our catalog is made on-demand,” Catanzaro wrote. “When an order is placed, our partnered manufacturers receive the order and begins production. So unlike other brands, we never hold inventory and never have the need to throw away unsold items.”
Paisan works with Apliiq, a clothing production and design company located in Los Angeles, for its manufacturing. Although Catanzaro has contracted an outside designer twice to help him with design questions, he alone runs and manages his company. 
Paisan currently offers clothing for men, women and children, including a range of tropical-colored surf and swim, outerwear with toucan- and ocean-themed graphics, and accessory options, including baseball caps and winter beanies, all within the $20 to $50 range. Items are meant to be worn both while surfing but also in an everyday context, according to Catanzaro.
Since the company’s launch in May 2020, Paisan has sold just over $7,800 worth of apparel, according to Catanzaro. In their newest endeavour, Paisan partnered with Tristan Schrager, an artist based in Honolulu, to launch a clothing line inspired by surf and scale culture. 
Paisan also sponsors an adventure team of global athletes, including Kerl Moraga, a surfer in Hawaii; Jose Garcia, an ocean photographer based in Australia; and Harry Jones, a beach volleyball player in the United Kingdom. Sponsored surfers are asked to wear and promote Pasian’s clothing, especially while out on the water. Athletes like Moraga met Catanzaro through a surfing photographer they both follow, according to Moraga. 
Paisan’s environmental commitment appeals to members of the surf community across the globe, according to Moraga. 
“I’d say my favorite thing about Paisan, other than the fact that they cater the surf community, is that Paisan is very environment conscious,” Moraga wrote in an email with The Hoya. “To a surfer, that is a very, very big thing. We want our nature to thrive, so it can continue to nurture our lifestyle.”
Though Moraga has yet to meet Catanzaro in person, he is confident Paisan’s future will continue to grow and reach a larger number of athletes in the surfing community.
For now, Catanzaro is focusing on the growth of Paisan—as well as the time management involved in being a college student—but he still tries to catch a few waves in Cleveland when he can. 
“Obviously, I would love for Paisan’s legacy to be that of a catalyst. If established brands took a look at what we’re doing and said, ‘Maybe we should give that a shot,’ the fashion industry could really change for the better,” Catanzaro wrote. “Aside from that, I simply want the brand to live up to its namesake, to be a ‘Paisan’ for our customers and our shared planet.”

Georgetown University’s graduate student union reached a series of agreements with the university regarding COVID-19-pandemic-related rights and protections March 25.
Following nearly a year of negotiations, the Protections and Benefits for Graduate Student Assistants during the COVID-19 pandemic, a series of agreements established between the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees and the university, outline rights for union members and graduate students amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The agreements will remain in effect until the summer term. 
For graduate student workers who have experienced uncertainty surrounding their working conditions throughout the past year of bargaining, the agreement has provided relief and a sense of accomplishment, according to Jewel Tomasula (GRD ’22), president of GAGE.
“We are proud that we held our ground and stood up for our rights,” Tomasula wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We’ve proven to University administrators and the broader higher education community that impact bargaining is in fact an appropriate forum for addressing major changes to graduate working conditions.”
The agreements include increased university-provided technology support for teaching assistants and instructors of record to purchase new equipment needed for virtual course instruction. The policies also guarantee greater university transparency and rights for instructors assigned to in-person teaching, access to emergency isolation housing and free parking for graduate research assistants who are currently working on campus.
Throughout the negotiation process, the university pushed back on many of the bargaining team’s proposals with financial concerns on specific topics such as isolation housing and technology reimbursement, according to Jeffrey Tsoi (LAW ’23, GRD ’26), a member of the GAGE bargaining team.
Both parties have reached agreements on all issues because of a shared commitment to prioritize health and safety concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a university spokesperson.
“We appreciate the collaborative relationship with GAGE-AFT, and we look forward to continuing our work and building upon the progress already made,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are grateful for the dedicated work of graduate student assistants in supporting our educational and research mission during these challenging times.” 
GAGE ratified its first contract with the university in May 2020 following months of negotiations, online campaigns and a series of strike efforts. The Collective Bargaining Agreement established GAGE as a union and outlined its contractual provisions, such as establishing grievance procedures, expanding medical and parental leave policies and increasing minimums for stipends and wages. After this agreement, the union submitted two demands to the university regarding concerns that graduate workers would be at risk of contracting COVID-19 should they need to return to campus for work in person.
In private bargaining sessions between GAGE and the university during summer 2020, the union submitted a series of six proposals about health protections and wage security for graduate workers and expressed its desire to reach a written letter of agreement on these topics. These proposals led to disagreements between the university and GAGE, despite the union’s growing call for increased COVID-19 protections. 
In the fall, the union submitted an official grievance motion that alleged the university breached its contract by failing to negotiate graduate COVID-19 related protections to the chairperson of the Union Grievance Committee, which the university denied. The dispute culminated in an independent arbitrator’s ruling in January that the university originally did not bargain in good faith with GAGE over specific policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic and mandating that the parties return to negotiations on a variety of issues, such as subscriptions to health services and COVID-19 vaccinations.
The established agreement highlights GAGE’s rights to bargain through arbitration, according to Tsoi.
“We are glad to see that the University has honored its contractual obligation and look forward to the continued collaboration in faithfully executing our collective bargaining agreement,” Tsoi wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The union is now meeting with graduate student workers one-on-one to discuss the newly established rights and protections as well as to gather feedback about how graduate students’ work is currently going, according to Tomasula. 
“As we look ahead to the summer sessions and the fall semester, we will be organizing to make sure everyone feels comfortable with their working conditions and has their rights respected,” Tomasula wrote.
GAGE is also working with students’ departments to help union members obtain the technology necessary to continue remote learning and reinforcing its mutual aid efforts to best support members facing financial barriers because of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Tomasula.
GAGE hopes the university will continue to include the union in discussions about policies that directly affect graduate student workers, according to Daniel Solomon (SFS ’13, GRD ’23), vice president of GAGE.
“We also hope that these agreements establish new rights and benefits that will improve graduate working conditions long after the pandemic subsides,” Solomon wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Graduate students and the university will have to continue working together to ensure that their agreements are upheld, but the success of the COVID-19 pandemic negotiations indicates positive progress in the parties’ relationship, according to Zachary Park (GRD ’22), an officer on the GAGE executive council.
“At the end of the day, the fight for labor justice here at GU and beyond has and will continue to be a long one, but arbitration and now these side agreements has been a victory on that front and I have faith there are more to come,” Park wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Dr. Leon “Lee” Jones has been appointed as the dean for medical education at the Georgetown University School of Medicine following a yearlong, nationwide search. 
The position has been vacant since June 2019, when longtime Dean Stephen Mitchell stepped down after a 20-year term. While the School of Medicine searched for a replacement, applications to medical schools across the United States hit an all-time high because of a surge in interest in medical education stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Focusing on student wellness, diversity and inclusion is crucial for the medical school’s growth, according to Jones, whose role officially takes effect Aug. 1.
“I’m looking forward to having my feet on the ground; getting to know our community well; and reaffirming our guiding principles and desired outcomes,” Jones wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Jones, who currently serves as the associate dean for students and health sciences clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, has worked in medical education for more than 25 years.
In addition to his background in medicine and education, Jones has also been involved in a number of initiatives aimed at promoting diversity within medical education. He helped create a series of informative videos for the Association of American Medical Colleges that focused on improving care for LGBTQ populations, and he has worked as a national educator with the Building the Next Generation of Academic Physicians diversity initiative, which provides resources about careers in academic medicine to medical students and residents, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an immigration policy that protects people who were brought to the United States as children from deportation.
Given his work advocating for inclusion and diversity, the university is looking forward to welcoming Jones into the Georgetown community, according to President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79 , GRD ’95).
“Dr. Jones is a national leader in efforts to advance equity and inclusion at medical schools in the United States,” DeGioia wrote in a universitywide email. “He has led extensive work in developing evidence-based policy, initiatives, and educational programs with a focus on medical school admissions, diversity, student support and learning environment, and student financial assistance.”
Jones hopes to further educate Georgetown students about racism and discrimination in the United States health care system, he wrote.
“There are twin pandemics,” Jones wrote. “These are intertwined, with the viral pandemic further highlighting not only our need to address public health in depth and proactively, but also the health care and health inequities in our country.”
During the last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed deep inequities in the health care system, including in Washington, D.C. A June 2020 report published by the Georgetown School of Nursing & Health Studies found that Black residents accounted for over 80% of the COVID-19 deaths in the District.
Jones’s extensive experience as an educator and his work advocating for diversity make him well positioned to lead Georgetown’s School of Medicine as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, according to Edward B. Healton, the executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center and executive dean of the School of Medicine.
“Dr. Jones is an inspiring and transformational leader who is uniquely positioned to lead our medical school into this next decade,” Healton wrote in the university press release. “He is highly regarded nationally as a champion for advancing medical education, for medical students and the issues that most affect them, and for creating a culture of equity and diversity.”
The past year’s pandemic challenges have forced the medical education field to adapt, but the changes have left the field in a position to make positive progress, according to Jones.  
“The time is right to use momentum, innovation, and the dedication and passion of our medical community to improve what we do, how we do it, and who we welcome into our community going forward,” Jones wrote.

The Republican Party needs to distance itself from conspiracies about the 2020 election and instead focus on prioritizing effective policy, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said at a Georgetown University event.
At the Zoom discussion, Cheney discussed her vision for the future of the Republican Party. The eldest daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, Liz Cheney served as the deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs under the George W. Bush administration. In 2016, she was elected as Wyoming’s representative and currently holds the position of House Republican Conference chair, making her the third-highest-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives. 
During the 2020 election, the Republican Party lost the White House and its majority in the Senate, giving Democrats control over both chambers of Congress and the executive branch. In response, many Republicans, most prominently former President Donald Trump, have perpetuated the debunked theory that the election was stolen.
The Republican Party needs to accept the results of the election in order to move on and tackle issues of actual substance and ideas, according to Cheney. 
“In addition to the damage it does to our democratic process, to claim that an election was stolen or rigged when it wasn’t also doesn’t make any sense politically to be doing that because we want those voters back,” Cheney said at the event. “People are tired of the vengeance and the vitriol. They want some hope.”
The April 12 event, titled “A Conversation With Congresswoman Liz Cheney,” was hosted by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service and featured GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) as moderator. 
While Republicans continue to clash over their party’s loyalty to Trump, the real reason the GOP lost the 2020 election is that it failed to communicate its platform during the 2020 election, according to Cheney.
“In both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, we’re in this era of celebrities and social media. We need to think about how we can — in both parties frankly — structure incentives for people to debate on policy and substance. Too often, the incentives run toward who can make the splash on Twitter,” Cheney said. “It is really important for us to get more of those folks who really do want to make things better for the lives of their constituents.”
Cheney faced her own social media firestorm and pushback from her party after she voted alongside nine other GOP representatives to impeach Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot after the election. In response, her pro-Trump Republican colleagues attempted to remove her from her leadership post. 
Even though Republicans now make up the minority party in the federal government, its focus should be to craft alternative legislative proposals productively, according to Cheney.
“When you’re in the minority, it becomes easy to say no all the time. My constituents certainly want to know that we’re fighting against the policies that we think are bad and dangerous,” Cheney said. “That’s important, but then you also have to remind yourself that when you’re going out to try and tell people, ‘Listen, here’s why you ought to put us in the majority,’ you need to have a positive agenda.”
Cheney said a shift to policy-centered politics will ultimately make for a healthier political climate and will encourage more people to become involved in politics. 
“No matter where you are on the political spectrum, it really matters to get involved,” Cheney said. “Our country really needs young people to be involved and engaged, and I just think it’s a lot more interesting and appealing to get engaged if you’re talking about substance and policy than if we’re all just screaming at each other.”

Georgetown University launched a new program that will allow eligible incarcerated persons in the Maryland state prison system to earn a bachelor’s degree.
The program, led by the university’s Prisons and Justice Initiative, is an expansion of the Prison Scholars Program, which was started in 2018 to provide non-degree classes at the D.C. Jail through a variety of credit and non-credit bearing courses. The program’s expansion will give incarcerated persons at the maximum-security Patuxent Institution, located in Jessup, Maryland, the opportunity to take Georgetown courses and earn a bachelor’s degree. The program will welcome the first cohort of 25 students in the 2021-2022 academic year. 
The new initiative fits within PJI’s broader goal to provide comprehensive educational opportunities to the local incarcerated members of the Washington D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area, according to PJI Director Marc Howard.
“For us, it’s a milestone we have been striving to achieve that we always hoped we would reach,” Howard said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We are thrilled all the pieces came together between Georgetown and the state of Maryland. I could not be happier.”
The university and the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services signed a memorandum of understanding March 17. 
The degree will closely model the Georgetown College curriculum, which consists of 120 credits across a variety of core subjects. Students in the program will have a choice of three majors: cultural humanities, global intellectual history and interdisciplinary social science, according to PJI Director of Education Joshua Miller. 
“This curriculum is amazing. It is hard to take all the things you can do on Georgetown’s main campus and take it into a prison,” Miller said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We are doing everything in our power to take the education you are receiving on the Hilltop and bring it to Patuxent. And I think we’re going to succeed.”
Students will also have access to other university resources, including research assistance and reentry support, which will help students successfully rejoin society after they are released from prison, according to Howard.
“What we are hoping to show is that education and intelligence are two separate things. Some of my smartest students are people who earlier in life have had completely different paths but have now found themselves in a world of education,” Howard said. “We’ve already shown with the Pivot Program and the Paralegal Program we have the country’s leading university reentry programs. We hope to establish ourselves as the only university in the world that has full-scale education and reentry programs and support.”
The PJI’s Maryland degree program’s expansion is funded by a $1 million three-year grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. In addition, Georgetown will offer financial aid to qualified students through the Pell grant government initiative, which are funds distributed by the federal government to low-income students to fund their pursuit of higher education, according to The Washington Post. 
The Prisons and Justice Initiative, founded in 2016, has started a variety of programs designed to address issues of mass incarceration. The Pivot Program and Paralegal Fellowship Program, two certification programs within the PJI, are designed to prepare formerly incarcerated students in the fields of business and law, respectively. 
Georgetown is proud to partner with PJI, and expanding the Prison Scholar’s Program is a testament to the rehabilitative powers of education, according to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
“As a University, we have a responsibility to advance the common good and empower the members of our community to share in this important work,” DeGioia wrote in an email to The Hoya, “As a Catholic and Jesuit institution, this commitment has been a long-standing element of Georgetown’s mission, and I’m grateful that this expansion of the Prison Scholars Program will ensure that future leaders who are currently incarcerated will be able to access the Georgetown academic experience as members of our community.”
PJI will accept applications from incarcerated persons across the Maryland state prison system and evaluate applicants on preparedness, motivation and potential to succeed in the program. The application will consist of both admissions exams and interviews, according to a university press release. Applicants who are accepted from other prisons will be transferred to the Patuxent Institution to participate in the program.
The program comes at a pivotal time for the American criminal justice system, as the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated prisons and incarcerated individuals across the country. PJI also faced COVID-19-related challenges over the past year, including the Prison Scholars Program’s transition to virtual learning. 
Despite these changes, PJI has remained committed to advocating for the lives of incarcerated persons. The new program’s launch feels like a light at the end of the tunnel after the past year away from interacting with incarcerated persons in-person, according to Howard.
“I cannot wait. I have been going to prisons and jails for many years, pretty much weekly since 2014,” Howard said. “To not have been able to go in for almost a year is almost painful for me, but I always keep in mind it’s a hundred times more of a nightmare for people inside. They are excited and we are excited.”
Beyond providing a transformative opportunity for incarcerated students, PJI is hopeful the program’s graduates will go on to initiate broader, nationwide prison reform, according to Miller.
“My expectation is that the United States is going to come to terms with the fact that it over-incarcerates,” Miller said. “It is probably going to take a couple of decades at least to undo what we have done, but I think that the students that Georgetown educates at Patuxent will be the leaders of that movement.”
Colleagues at peer institutions have already reached out to PJI for advice on creating similar programs that advocate for prison reform and education, indicating Georgetown is leading the way for prison reform, according to Howard.
“I think that we are setting a new example, reaching a new level, that I hope will help both other universities and our society overall recognize the tremendous potential of incarcerated people, that their lives have value,” Howard said. “If we humanize them and support them, they will become truly successful. They will become wonderful family members and community members. There are a lot of reasons to support this work.”

Georgetown University students plan to send a finalized proposal for an environmental studies major to university administration later this month, advocating for a program with an interdisciplinary framework of science, politics and humanities while tackling environmental issues. 
A Georgetown University Student Association working group has spent the past year drafting the major proposal and recently submitted it to the College Curriculum Committee, a ten-member faculty board that reviews proposed programs, in March. The working group is now revising the proposal and plans to submit it to the Provost’s Office for implementation in the fall. 
While Georgetown offers majors in environmental biology and science, technology and international affairs, there is currently no opportunity for students to pursue a humanities-based major with an intersection in environmental policy, according to Rowlie Flores (COL ’22), GUSA Sustainability Senate Co-Chair and a member for the working group.
“The reason why I wanted to push for this project is because I realized that I wanted just the environmental issues when I got to Georgetown,” Flores said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “But I realized that I needed to be in some sort of STEM course load, and I did not really want that.”
The environmental biology major emphasizes a scientific framework, including courses in biology, chemistry and math, and the STIA major in the School of Foreign Service, while following the SFS core curriculum, includes many science labs as well. The proposed environmental studies major incorporates several environmental science courses but also focuses on humanities and policy courses, offering a more interdisciplinary track.
The working group will meet this month with the College Executive Council, the main academic policy-making group, before sending the proposal to the Provost’s Office, and the major should be open in the fall for the Class of 2023, according to Flores.
The administration has largely been in support of the major, but the GUSA working group has helped move the project along faster, according to Flores.
“They were already planning to have this as an ongoing project two years from now, but because of the GUSA proposal they were like, why not speed it up by a year, so that is kind of why it is happening now instead of two years from now,” Flores said.
While there is significant administrative and faculty support, administrators still have concerns about finances and resources to back the program, according to Scott Kase (MSB ’23), a member of the working group with a minor in environmental studies. 
“There is some hesitation, especially with COVID there are resource constraints,” Kase said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “I know that a problem we have had is how can we expand new course offerings and hire new teachers and stay within the budget and make sure that this is something we get passed?”
Despite the financial constraints, an ENST major is important to Georgetown values and would allow students to study environmental issues in-depth, according to Randall Amster, co-director and teaching professor of environmental studies and a member of the working group.
“Having an ENST major here would help keep us on par with our peer institutions, and further would offer an opportunity to expand our environmental offerings within the unique context of the University’s mission, values, and location,” Amster wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Equally important, having a major in Environmental Studies would provide greater visibility for the critical issues and concerns that animate the program and drive student interest, adding an important component to existing curricular and co-curricular efforts.”
Many other universities offer similar environmental studies majors, including George Washington University, American University and Johns Hopkins University, and Georgetown should follow these examples and implement its own program, according to the GUSA policy proposal. 
“Environmental issues become an obligation of social justice, which, as a Jesuit institution, we have committed to addressing,” the proposal reads. “With the advent of climate change, environmental studies is becoming a rising academic interest for current and prospective students.”
One of Georgetown’s core Jesuit values — care for our common home — emphasizes the importance of caring for the earth and advancing environmental sustainability and justice. 
Georgetown supports the courses centered on environmental studies in addition to environmentally focused research initiatives, according to a university spokesperson.
“The University is supportive of exploring course options, including majors and minors, that reflect our values and the broad interests of our students,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
As the working group is preparing to present their revised proposal to the administration later in April, the biggest challenge has been finding faculty that will permanently teach the new curriculum, according to Flores.
“We really want to hire tenured professors to teach the core courses and it is kind of hard to do that right now because of COVID,” Flores said. 
Although there are some logistical concerns, the working group is optimistic about the project’s progress and is confident the university is working to implement the program, according to Amster. 
“The process has been very constructive and effective, resulting in a comprehensive proposal that is being shared with various governance committees,” Amster wrote. “While there are still many steps along the way and nothing has been decided about this yet, the initial feedback we’ve received has been positive.”
This is a developing story.

Georgetown University will revise commencement plans following changes to Washington, D.C. COVID-19 regulations and advocacy from community members in response to the university’s initial decision to hold a virtual commencement ceremony.
Last month, the university announced that commencement ceremonies would take place virtually with the possibility of small in-person gatherings, contingent on public health conditions. In response to this announcement, community members launched an online petition calling for a masked and socially distanced in-person ceremony, which garnered over 2,200 signatures. The Georgetown University Student Association also worked with the university to improve the original virtual plan. 
The university is now working to finalize and submit commencement plans for approval that include an in-person component following changes to Wasington, D.C. COVID-19 restrictions, according to an April 13 email from President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95). 
The senior class is optimistic about the university’s reconsideration and hopes the new plans will allow them to celebrate graduation in person, according to Robert Steer (SFS ’21), who signed the petition. 
“All of my friends and I were thrilled to hear the news and would be extremely grateful for the opportunity to invite our families to D.C. this May,” Steer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The email certainly makes our whole class feel heard and gives hope that the administration is making its student body the priority rather than its balance sheet.” 
Last week, the D.C. Mayor’s Office released updated COVID-19 guidelines for in-person commencement ceremonies, mandating mask-wearing and requiring a 25% capacity in any space. The updated guidelines have allowed the university to reconsider and restructure its plans to host at least some portions of commencement in person, according to DeGioia’s email.
However, the university should have been more creative in forming its original commencement plan, according to Steer.
“I think the reason why it’s really important is because the school has sort of said that an in-person graduation and keeping public health as the number-one priority are mutually exclusive. I think the leadership needs to know that so many Hoyas disagree,” Steer said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Every single person that I’ve talked to, every single parent that I’ve talked to has at least five different ideas on how an in-person graduation could work with just a little creativity.”
The university is grateful for community feedback to its initial plan, and administrators are hopeful that there will be a finalized plan in place soon, according to DeGioia’s April 13 email.
“The importance of this day in the lives of our students is at the forefront of our planning, as we work to adjust to this new health guidance,” DeGioia wrote.
In addition to the petition, GUSA worked with administrators to alter the commencement plans to include some kind of in-person event for graduating students, according to Melanie Cruz-Morales (COL ’22), GUSA Speaker of the Senate. 
“Seniors have been robbed of their entire senior experience, and after such a dark year, we hope to end the year with a sense of light — that being an in-person ceremony, that really celebrates and acknowledges the resilience of so many students who powered through such an unprecedented experience,” Cruz-Morales wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While graduation plans are under reconsideration, the university still plans to invite first-year and transfer students to campus this summer for the Summer Hilltop Immersion Program, a five-week, in-person experience meant to introduce new students to life at Georgetown. Graduation is scheduled for May 14 to 23, and SHIP is scheduled to begin June 4, only two weeks later.
If first-year and transfer students can come to campus for an in-person program, then the university should be able to organize an in-person graduation event, according to Linda Wen (COL ’21), who originally chose not to sign the petition because she lacked confidence the university would change its decision in response to community advocacy.
“The fact that Georgetown is bringing freshmen to campus shows that they have the ability to do something in person, at the very least, for the seniors,” Wen said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Especially after this last year of not getting the usual activities seniors would get, like senior week and senior picnic, it just feels like graduation is the bare minimum.”
Other Washington, D.C. universities intend to incorporate in-person elements into their ceremonies. George Washington University plans to have a mostly virtual ceremony with several in-person opportunities, and American University submitted a proposal for in-person elements to the D.C. health officials. 
While there is no concrete plan in place yet, the university’s reconsideration indicates that the administration might finally be listening to student concerns, according to Wen.
“I think I’m overall feeling cautiously optimistic and I guess it feels like they are responding to the outcry that the initial decision sparked,” Wen wrote in a text to The Hoya.
