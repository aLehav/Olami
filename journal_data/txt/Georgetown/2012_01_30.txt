Occupy D.C. protesters remained in McPherson Square Monday night, despite a National Park Service announcement that they would have to leave the park by noon.
The drive to clear the camp began earlier this month when D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray sent a letter to NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis, asking that the McPherson camp be moved due to a rat infestation and other health issues.
Last week, Jarvis was called to testify before a House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee as to why the camp has been allowed to remain in the square since protesters first moved in last October, violating an NPS ban on camping there.
According to the National Park Service, the camp is considered a 24-hour vigil, and therefore exempt from the ban. However, under the guidelines for such vigils, protesters are not allowed to sleep in federal parks, as the Occupiers have been doing.
Speaking to the subcommittee, Jarvis argued that the Occupiers had a First Amendment right to protest in the square in his statement to the subcommittee, but acknowledged the need to address safety and health concerns surrounding the encampment.
Gina Bull (SFS ’12), who has been actively supporting the Occupy movement on campus and visited McPherson Square on Sunday, said that she believed the real impetus for the crackdown is to suppress dissent.
“There were a lot of police around at one point, and it definitely seemed like they were trying to have an intimidating presence,” Bull said. “I think whatever guise they may give for shutting it down, we all know that this is an attempt to suppress dissent and the camps are incredibly powerful symbols for that.”
Samuel-Geaney Moore (SFS ’12) agreed that the District had motives other than health concerns for deciding to close the camp.
“I don’t think it’s an issue of cleanliness. … Camps have been exceptionally organized,” he said. “[The NPS decision] follows that pattern of trying to close the camps across the country.”
Bull added that the camp was likely allowed to remain in place on Monday because the eviction had attracted so much media attention.
“The police didn’t come probably because there were so many news cameras. I don’t think it would be unlikely that they would [take down the camp] during the night instead,” she said.
The camp remained in place at press time, though the possibility that authorities would disband the protesters remained.
Though the McPherson Square camp has been relatively calm compared to other Occupy groups in Oakland and Manhattan, there has been a recent increase in tensions between police and protesters, culminating in the cuffing and tasering of a protester known as “Lash” Sunday.
“Lash … wouldn’t hurt a fly,” American University student and protester Ben Johnson said. “He’s all about having a positive attitude. So the fact that they chose Lash, of all people, to tase … really speaks to the mindset of the cops. They’ll tase somebody who walks around in [pajama] bottoms and spends most of his days playing guitar because he said something they don’t like.”
Johnson claimed that protesters were bracing for more altercations, but stressed that the protesters themselves would not provoke violence.
“If there’s violence here, it’ll be on the part of the cops,” he said.
Supporters of the movement, such as Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) warned against an unruly response to NPS enforcement, saying that such behavior could distract from the protesters’ real message.
“If some resist the enforcement of the camping ban, they could reinforce critics who see them as young people on an adventure and could destroy the unity of their message against income inequality, which has captured the country and changed the conversation in Washington,” Norton wrote on her website Sunday.
If police do remove protesters by force, Bull felt that college campuses will become increasingly important protest sites, adding that Georgetown Occupy, an on-campus group that supports the D.C. Occupy movement, plans to coordinate more discussion events and general assembly meetings on Fridays to increase awareness.
“If camping at Occupy D.C. comes to a close, it only means a transformation for the movement, certainly not an end, and that’s why I think it becomes increasingly important to think of creative ways to keep the Occupy movement going,” she said. “College campuses [will] become more critical sites. Georgetown Occupy intends to increase our presence this semester.”

All three proposals for the allocation of the $3.4 million Student Activities Fee Endowment cleared their last hurdle when they passed a referendum by the student body last week, but the implementation process for each is just beginning.
Last week’s referendum was the final step in a reform of the Student Activities Fee that began last spring. The implementation of the individual plans now rests on the shoulders of the students on the respective steering committees, which are being managed by the working groups for each proposal and the Georgetown University Student Association.
Just before the referendum, GUSA members signed a binding agreement with the administration regarding the implementation of each proposal. According to GUSA President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12), the document guarantees that students’ money will be used appropriately by the university, which controls the funds for the time being.
“In terms of the short term, having [the university] sign [the agreement letter] ensures that no funny business can happen,” Meaney said.
The document, signed Jan. 23, dictates that the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, granted $1.25 million, will be established by Jan. 1, 2013. However, the leaders of SIPS are currently working to recruit three additional members to its 10-student steering committee by Feb. 14. Students will be able to apply to join through GUSA. The group intends to have the fund up and running by fall 2012, according to GUSA senator Clara Gustafson (SFS  ’13), who helped spearhead the proposal.
“The 13 of us will … work out a lot of kinks and then turn [SIPS] over to the [governing board],” she said.
The steering committee plans to hold a launch event for the fund in April.
“There’s obviously a lot of work to be done … but I don’t foresee any challenges being big enough [not] to overcome in the next three, four months,” Gustafson said.
Members of Georgetown Energy, which was allocated $250,000 to install solar panels on about 43 university townhouses, are talking with University Facilities and Student Housing about when construction can begin.
The university has agreed to install solar panels on seven to nine townhouses on 37th Street as the first round of the project. The allocated money not used will be placed in the Green Revolving Loan Fund, housed in the SIPS Fund, and can be used for future sustainability initiatives.
An agreement on the start date for the project and the number of townhouses included must be reached by April 3, according to the agreement signed with the university.
Although Solar City, a residential and commercial solar provider, helped develop the proposal, Georgetown Energy has not yet chosen a company with which to partner in the project. The group hopes to choose a vendor by mid- to late February.
The solar panel installation plan must be approved by the Old Georgetown Board before the project can begin. Dave Nulsen (SFS ’12), Georgetown Energy’s project leader for the solar panel installations, is optimistic about winning their approval.
“The Old Georgetown Board are good people,” he said. “They just want to make sure Georgetown maintains its integrity.”
“I imagine that [the installation] will take place over the summer, [because] it’s not that difficult,” Meaney, who is also on Georgetown Energy’s advisory committee, said.
Leaders of the New South Student Center proposal are meeting with University Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Christopher Augostini and members of the university’s Investment Office to determine when to cash out the $2.04 million of endowment money that the project was allocated. The timeline depends on the strength of the financial market, according to Meaney.
Meaney expects construction on the student center, which will be financed primarily by the university, to begin in summer 2013. The project can begin only after the university has raised enough money to complete its portion of the renovations.
The proposal will use SAFE money to augment the university’s plan for the space, adding an outdoor terrace and additional study and lounge space to the existing design.
Through the agreement document, GUSA retains the right to approve revision to the plans for NSSCenhancements. The administration has also agreed to build a restaurant and bar that will serve alcoholic beverages and to allow GUSA to choose the names for the areas of the NSSC on which SAFE money is spent.
Meaney is optimistic that the implementation of the approved proposals will go smoothly.
“Because the process itself was so thorough … I actually don’t think any of the initial roadblocks we foresee will stall up [the plans],” he said.

Of the 47 cases brought before the Supreme Court since its term began in October, 45 had been argued beforehand — in a moot court at the Georgetown University Law Center.
Richard J. Lazarus, former Georgetown Law professor and Supreme Court advocate, founded the Supreme Court Institute twelve years ago after he noticed that Georgetown’s faculty boasted more practical Supreme Court experience than those at other law schools across the country.
In the past five years, the institute’s moot court has gone from hearing 40 percent to 95 percent of cases on the Supreme Court docket.
The Institute conducts two- hour cases are heard on a first-come, first-serve basis during the week before the case is argued in the Supreme Court. Only one side of any case is given the opportunity to present oral arguments in order to prevent conflicts of interest and preserve confidentiality.
“It is completely non-partisan, completely non-ideological, there is no charge for any of the services. It is purely pro-bono and in the public interest,” Dori Bernstein, deputy director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University Law Center, said.
Once the case is scheduled, the assembly of the panel of judges begins. According to Bernstein, the program draws on the many prominent Supreme Court advocates, former members of the Solicitor General’s office and recent Supreme Court clerks in the D.C. area.
“We usually try to get a mix of people on a panel so you get a range of experience … various backgrounds and various outlooks … because that is more likely to reflect what the advocate will encounter when they go to court the next week,” Bernstein said.
The panelists ask questions of the advocate presenting his or her argument for the first hour, then hold strategic discussions during the second hour. They do not, however, render a verdict on the case.
Bernstein, who has worked for the program since July 2010 and has 18 years of appellate experience in the federal government, said the program is tremendously helpful for the advocates who have the opportunity to receive feedback.
“This job has restored my sense of the legal profession as really being one filled with people who are committed to what’s best, I think, in our system of government — that it’s a democracy and that there’s room for differing opinions and differing points of view, and that we’re all best served when all those different points of view can be fully aired and fully explored,” she said.
Bernstein added that the ability to hear cases of national importance while they are preparing to do similar work is a valuable experience for students in the law center.
“The primary goal of the Moot Court Program is to prepare advocates to present their best argument to the Supreme Court,” Bernstein said. “The secondary goal, which is also of great importance, is to further the education of the students at Georgetown Law school because they have the extraordinary privilege of being able to observe these moot courts.”
The program often coordinates with professors so that the case being presented is integrated into the class curriculum as well.
“That’s just a tremendous opportunity because it brings the law really alive,” Bernstein said.
Correction: The article previously stated that 73 of the 78 cases argued in the Supreme Court had been argued at the Georgetown Law Center beforehand. These numbers were from the October 2010 – June 2011. The article has been updated to reflect the appropriate numbers from October 2011 to the present day.

SafeRides will become a more exciting way to get around the neighborhood when Georgetown University Student Association launches a “Cash Cab”-like game in one of the service’s vans Thursday.
The program is intended to mimic the Discovery Channel game show, which poses trivia questions to unsuspecting taxicab passengers in New York City.
Each night during weekends, one SafeRides van is driven by a GUSA member. Students who are picked up by this van will have the opportunity to answer trivia questions and win prizes ranging from bottled water and sports drinks to gift cards and Georgetown Cupcakes.
According to GUSA Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12), GUSA hopes that student interest in the game will reduce incidents of students calling SafeRides but leaving before the van arrives, which can cause the drivers to fall behind schedule. He also sees the game as a positive demonstration of student-administrator collaboration.
Once in the van, participants will be asked to list items in a single category, such as Major League Baseball teams, until they reach their destination. At the end of the ride, prizes will be awarded based on how many items the students were able to list.
GUSA plans to collaborate with The Corp and local businesses to provide prizes.
GUSA is working on a way to install lights, like those used in “Cash Cab,” that flicker when passengers enter to announce that they have been chosen to participate in the game.
The project was conceived by GUSA senator Bridget Power (COL ’12), Laverriere and Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Chris Augostini at a Hoya Roundtable event. Laverriere and Power have since been working with Augostini and the Department of Public Safety to make the game a reality.
Student participation in the game will be filmed and posted to the university and GUSA websites. Participants will sign two waivers, one when they enter the van and another the next day, in order to ensure consent.
“If [students] sign a waiver while they’re inebriated, then the next morning they might think better of it,”GUSA Senior Counselor Sam Ungar (COL ’12) said.
The videos will also be edited to show what GUSA deems to be the best clips instead of posting footage of entire SafeRides trips.
The program will debut Thursday, because SafeRides expects to receive fewer calls on a Thursday night than on weekend nights. According to Laverriere, it will serve as a test run, and the game will be moved to Friday nights as of next weekend.
“Ideally it would be something that would be expanded to each weekend night. We’d definitely love to do that,” he said.
GUSA’s collaboration with SafeRides is slated to continue through the end of the year, as is the new quiz game.
An earlier version of this article mistakenly stated that the Office of the Chief Operating Officer would provide prizes for the test run of the program. The article has been revised to reflect correct information.
