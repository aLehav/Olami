As Winter Storm Jonas blanketed the District of Columbia with approximately 2 feet of snow, around 200 employees from Georgetown’s Planning and Facilities Management slept on campus to keep the university running during the storm, some of whom found themselves without a bed.
Aramark employees at Leo O’Donovan Hall also remained in the area in order to ensure the Georgetown community had access to meals, while a number of employees of The Tombs and 1789 ensured that The Tombs stayed open all weekend.
Snowstorms like Jonas can cause university staff to sleep in on-campus accommodations for as many nights as services, such as snow shoveling, are required. One facilities employee, who has worked at Georgetown for over a decade and requested anonymity said the university offers limited amounts of cots within campus buildings for workers staying overnight.
“They haven’t … [provided enough cots] in the past,” the employee said. “Because they’ll be like: ‘We don’t have no more cots,’ if you asked for one.”
According to Vice President of Facilities Robin Morey, the university noted that it did not have enough cots during the week prior to the storm. In response, the university purchased 100 additional cots to supplement the 50 already in storage, and workers also had the option to sleep on extra mattresses borrowed from the Office of Student Living. Temporary living arrangements were established in the facilities’ offices in the New South building as well as in common areas within Village C West and Village A dormitories.
In addition to the cots and mattresses on-campus, Georgetown rented rooms in the Key Bridge Marriott Hotel in Rosslyn, and booked all available rooms in the GU Hotel and Conference Center on campus; however, the majority of facilities employees stayed in on campus residences close to pedestrian walkways to be readily available to clear snow. Georgetown also provided a shuttle service for campus-based workers from Rosslyn to its campus.
Morey said even with the additional cots, there might have been Georgetown employees who did not find an open bed during the storm.
“I can say that we have accommodated the vast majority,” Morey said. “I haven’t talked to all 200 people — would it surprise me if one or two people had to find a couch? No, it wouldn’t.”
Morey emphasized the university’s dedication to the significant amount of staff that remained on campus, but acknowledged the difficulty of effectively managing every individual.
“I don’t want to sound cavalier about one or two people, because everyone is of equal importance,” Morey said. “But, again, when you’re trying to coordinate the activities of 200 people, it’s possible that somebody slipped through the crack.”
McDonough School of Business distinguished teaching professor Thomas Cooke said he was concerned for some of the facilities workers he encountered upon leaving the Rafik B. Hariri Building on Friday afternoon, a few hours after the university closed at 12:30 p.m.
“I asked where [the workers] were staying, and I got the impression they really didn’t know where they were staying … and they had in fact been given a blanket and a towel and [were] told to find a place to sleep,” Cooke said.
Georgetown Solidarity Committee member Esmeralda Huerta (SFS ’17) said an inability to meet the needs of working staff is unacceptable.
“The point is, while there are resources, there hasn’t been a lot of planning, or it’s very inadequate,” Huerta said. “I feel like workers are often disregarded or their needs aren’t being met by the school or facilities or whoever happens to be their employer.”
Morey said even though oversights may have occurred, the safety of facilities workers was his number one priority.
Throughout the storm, workers received meal vouchers for breakfast, lunch and dinner at Epicurean and Company as well as appropriate shifts for rest, Morey said.
“We’re running appropriate work-rest cycles, making sure we’re not wearing our folks out,” Morey said. “[We made] sure they’re getting their rest cycles and, you know, getting the food so they can stay in good shape.”
According to facilities workers, even with food and lodging, some employees worked 12-hour shifts, while they manned shovels, snow-blowers, plows and heavy machinery, removing an estimated 3 million cubic feet of snow to ensure basic operations continued at the university.
This was also the first year facilities workers were paid for the time they spent on campus when not working. According to Morey, all the workers who stayed on campus during the storm volunteered for the snow detail, although some workers had to finish their normal shifts after the university officially closed.
The Tombs restaurant was also able to remain open through the storm. According to Director of Communications of the Clyde’s Restaurant Group Molly Quigley, employees were accommodated appropriately in hotel rooms.
“All 1789 cooks, chefs & managers that could, came in to help at The Tombs. We provided hotel rooms for staff that were not able to walk home,” Quigley wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The General Manager, Rich Kaufman (SFS ’05) spent the entire weekend at the restaurant, sleeping on an air mattress in front of the fireplace in the restaurant. 1789 Chef Samuel Kim, when not in The Tombs kitchen grilling burgers, was outside shoveling. It was all hands on deck, all weekend long,” Quigley wrote.
The George Washington University and American University also accommodated their employees in hotel rooms, but each university had significantly fewer employees who stayed overnight than Georgetown did.
Sullen Day, a manager in facilities maintenance and operations for The Catholic University of America, said her university provides for its workers in the same way as Georgetown.
“Our campus ministry provides I think 30 or 40 cots for our grounds workers and I think our housing department tries to rustle up some beds for [our custodial team],” Day said. “The cots are provided to both groups, grounds and custodial.”
Assistant Director of Facilities Operations for American University Mark Feisp said his university applies a similar accommodation method as Georgetown for about 60 workers.
“We typically provide housing through our residence halls, so spaces with [bedding and washrooms] for the staff,” Feisp said.
Cooke expressed his admiration for the dedication that he sees in Georgetown employees, such as those who work in facilities.
“They’re hardworking people that we depend on every day,” Cooke said. “They don’t get enough credit for the hard work that they do…”
Joshua Gautreaux (COL ’18) stressed that his fellow students should remember to thank the workers for their labor.
“Definitely, stop and thank them for all the good work they’re doing,” Gautreaux said.

This type of dedication is above and beyond. I certainly hope the presence and actions of these employees gets noted in their records. Getting paid to be there is incidental to the fact that their families went without these hardworking people, while they served the facility, and then went home and dug out there.
You can’t teach this type of dedication and commitment, but you damn sure ought to recognize and reward the excellence demonstrated.

The Georgetown Community Partnership Steering Committee agreed Friday to accelerate the drafting of the university’s next campus plan over the next six months and anticipates filing a finalized 20-year plan with the District of Columbia by the end of the summer.
According to Georgetown University Student Association President Joe Luther (COL ’16), the first draft of the 2017-2037 Campus Plan is anticipated to be available to the entire community in April.
The campus plan is the city zoning approval for the university to use its land for future construction projects and current utility. Universities in residential areas of the District are required to obtain formal approval from the D.C. Zoning Commission to operate land within a residential area.
The decision to move the schedule forward came after representatives of GUSA, MedStar Georgetown Hospital, the Burleith and Foxhall Village Citizens Associations and Georgetown University met Friday afternoon to discuss goals for the first draft.
Among the priorities discussed were MedStar Georgetown’s plan to construct a new surgical pavilion in the north of the university campus and the need for students and residents to have sufficient time to review and comment on the plan before this semester ends.
“This is something we have been talking about through all of last semester,” Luther said. “We had talked with the university and the neighbors about our perspectives and my biggest concern is that there is a completed draft by the time the semester ends, because I think it is really important that we create this first draft while school is still in session so they [students] can input commentary.”
Luther said moving up the release of the draft will make it easier for students to have their voices heard.
“One of my biggest concerns was that a finalized draft would be released in the middle of the summer and no one would be here to voice our really big student priorities and I’m really glad we were willing to take that into account,” Luther said.
Luther said although the official drafting for the campus plan has not yet begun, GUSA’s objectives are clear.
“It comes down to students having the freedom to live on or off-campus and having on-campus housing that is comparable and well-maintained,” Luther said. “We share the same goal with the university and the neighbors to make campus an attractive place to live and to learn, but if the university’s facilities and academic spaces are falling apart, then it is completely natural that students will want to live off-campus.”
GUSA’s objectives on behalf of students living on and off campus include freezing the construction of additional housing projects until renovations of existing living spaces are made, setting off-campus neighborhood noise standards to the District of Columbia level and ensuring that off-campus residents have access to individual trash bins outside their homes instead of a university proposed communal trash collection site.
According to the campus planning town halls, the university’s goals are new, high-quality green spaces, a more developed residential living-learning community and a more pedestrian-friendly campus.
Assistant Vice President for Strategic Communications Stacy Kerr said the partnership between students, administration and community members signifies that there are many aligned priorities between students and university administration.
“We are grateful for the GUSA leadership and other student leaders and community leaders who have made the GCP a successful model for developing our campus plan in a collaborative way that will benefit the university and our partners in the neighborhood and city,” Kerr said.
This is the first time the campus plan will be drafted with significant input from student representatives through the GCP, which was created after the difficult 2010 Campus Plan negotiations resulted in Georgetown missing the deadline to submit a plan to the D.C. zoning commission.
GUSA leaders involved in the GCP said they hope to avoid some of the missteps taken during the last round of campus plan negotiations.
“The last campus plan was really a ‘Georgetown Neighborhood Plan’ that wasn’t very representative of student interests, needs, and wants,” Speaker of the Senate Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said. “The fact that renovations are currently not a priority for the university because they are trying desperately to meet that housing requirement shows that.”
According to Khan, the last campus plan was catered toward settling the neighborhood councils’ disputes and not on advocating for student needs.
“We have a list of demands and priorities for students that we’ve been advocating to be put in to the next campus plan, and during this drafting phase, that’s really what we’re pushing for,” Khan said.
GUSA Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) said student priorities must come first in this new plan.
“I want to make sure that everything in that plan is good for the students and good for the university,” Rohan said. “I do not want to include any major provisions here that will harm students or divert resources away from students or educational programming when it is not necessary.”
Both university and GUSA representatives are optimistic about the GCP approach to campus plan negotiations and anticipate the consensus driven approach could be a model for other universities.
“What we are doing now is very different from how we’ve operated in the past,” Kerr said. “If we are able to be successful in working toward a consensus over the next six months, it will really be providing a framework that is better for everyone over the next twenty years. That’s the genius of the Georgetown Community Partnership. It really is a model for the country.”
Teddy McFarland (COL ’17) said that because campus affects students most, it’s important that they have their voices heard.
“More student input is always great. We’re the bulk of this campus; we’re living on it all four years so we should have input,” McFarland said.
According to Maggie Bautista (COL ’19), it is important that students living on-campus have the opportunity to shape the place they live.
“Especially for people who live on campus they have to navigate the campus more … it’s a good thing [that there will be more student input],” Bautista said.
Rohan said he’s optimistic for the new plan.
“I want to get the most utility out of this plan as possible,” Rohan said. “From what we’ve discussed with the neighborhood and the university, it seems like this plan is going to be very different from the last one, which is great.”

Winter Storm Jonas, which covered Washington, D.C. with over 2 feet of snow this weekend, has tied for the storm with the fourth most snowfall on record in the District, aggravating an existing homelessness problem and essentially halting all activities across D.C.
The storm, dubbed “Snowzilla,” shut down federal, state and local governments as well as the D.C. Metro and public schools and universities.
The total snowfall ranged from 10 inches to 35 inches in and around the city. The White House lawn measured 22 inches of snow as of 6 a.m. Sunday.
Mayor Muriel Bowser highlighted the potential dangers of the storm in a press conference last Friday.
“It has life-and-death implications and all the residents of the District of Columbia should treat it that way,” Bowser said.
At least one death, that of an 82-year-old man who died from a heart attack after shoveling snow, has been reported in the District. Eight more were reported dead from blizzard-related incidents in Maryland and Virginia.
National Weather Service meteorologist Isha Renta said members of the homeless population had been calling to check on conditions.
“I know that we get calls at least several times a day,” Renta said. “[The callers] get briefed by us on snowfall amount, wind-chill and all that and then they make their decisions based on what we tell them.”
Gunther Stern, executive director of the Georgetown Ministry Center, a homeless shelter in Georgetown, said although his center was unable to open, he personally checked on the conditions of homeless people he knew in the area. Stern said Emergency Medical Services had to be called in one case.
“I checked with a couple people under the bridges and they’ve generally been okay,” Stern said. “I missed one person and some folks found him and called EMS and apparently he was in bad shape.”
Stern emphasized that although GMC was unable to open, it worked to direct people to other shelters and spaces where they would be safe.
“There are places available where people can stay in 24 hours through the storm and we really wanted them to go there,” Stern said.
The D.C. Department of Human Services opened recreational centers to be used as warming shelters and overflow hypothermia shelters during the storm. Six of the eight wards in D.C. had a recreational center open for the duration of the storm.
In Ward 2, the Kennedy Recreation Center opened its doors to more than 130 people in need of shelter Saturday night. Department of Human Services Program Analyst Aida Fikre worked at the shelter over the weekend, passing out food and registering people arriving there.
“What the city does is basically try to make sure that everyone is off the streets in extremely cold weather,” Fikre said. “Most people will know to come in themselves but for the ones that don’t know and aren’t sure what to do, there are also vans that drive around and look for people that are vulnerable and on the streets. Then we try to bring them into a warm place where they can have a bed and so on.”
Fikre attributed the shelter’s ability to work efficiently to the collaboration between various District departments and organizations.
“It is really a collaborative effort between a whole bunch of organizations just to make sure that everybody is safe and warm,” Fikre said. “Although it is run by the Department of Human Services, there are other organizations in the city that actually help out. Here we had people from Catholic charities that literally worked 24 hours a day.”
Renta said that the criticism D.C. received in reference to the city’s preparedness for snow, or lack thereof, is due in part to the District’s unique international makeup.
“I’ve heard comments of people from the North saying that they get a lot of feet of snow and they still go to school and all that but we also have a very international city and we have people from lots of different places and they might not have good experience driving, but that’s my personal view,” Renta said.
Fikre agreed that the shelters and the DHR, at least in terms of dealing with the homeless population, were overall adequately prepared to handle the storm.
“In terms of actually helping the homeless families and stuff like that, this is not something that is new,” Fikre said. “If tomorrow there is a surprise storm that comes, I guarantee you they will have everything ready already. We always have backup staff that is ready to come in at any given time and moment.”
The Georgetown administrators in charge of planning for the storm were also confident in their preparation. Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said that early in the week, key administrators, students and staff began meeting to discuss options regarding the storm.
Olson said one of the more difficult aspects of the storm was figuring out how to keep certain facilities, including Leo O’Donovan Hall, Yates Field House and residential hall offices, running.
“There’s always a complicated question because, being a residential campus, even when we’re closed, we’re never really closed,” Olson said. “It’s always disappointing to folks when they’ve worked hard and planned for a program or event and then it can’t happen. But I think we also tried very thoughtfully to keep the events that we thought were still workable in this environment.”
Olson emphasized his appreciation toward all those who worked to keep the campus running over the course of the storm.
“I just want to express my gratitude. I think that there are a lot of university staff and administrators who have worked hard to manage this and I also want to note the role of student employees and student volunteers,” Olson said. “They all play a role in contributing to keeping the campus safe and working.”
Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey agreed that students played a big role in keeping the campus running. He emphasized the importance of the students who expressed their gratitude to workers as a key factor in motivating the workers.
“The students were amazing during the event,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The vast majority of students thanked our workforce as they were working and many handed out cookies and hot chocolate. That support motivated our team.”

José Miguel Luna (SFS ’15) has been selected as a member of the first class of Schwarzman Scholars, a program that will send 111 students from 35 countries to pursue a Masters degree in either public policy, economics and business or international studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.
The program, which was founded by Stephen Schwarzman, Chairman, CEO and Co-founder of Blackstone asset management and advisory firm with an initial $100 million endowment, offers scholars from around the world the opportunity to study for a year at one of the top-ranked schools in China.
While at Tsinghua University, Schwarzman scholars pursue a core curriculum through the winter, followed by study in concentrations of economics and business, public policy or international studies. The scholars are also expected to have internships in the spring and opportunities for travel.
Luna’s pursuit of the program was the result of both his desire to learn more about China, a region he studied greatly while at Georgetown, as well as coincidence.
“The program fit my interests really well, almost unbelievably well,” Luna said. “I didn’t know about this program, it wasn’t like I was planning this program for a while … I got the email, I thought it was incredible [so] I did some more reading.”
While abroad, Luna hopes to form a deeper understanding of China’s role in the world.
“I really want to use this year to get a more concrete idea of how China is going to continue to become such a key player specifically in international economics, trade and finance,” Luna said.
While at Georgetown, Luna was founder and president of the Mexican Student Association and was a general manager at Hoya Snaxa. He graduated with a major in International Economics with a concentration in International Finance and Commerce and a certificate in International Development.
Assistant dean in the School of Foreign Service Polly Robey wrote in an email to The Hoya that Luna has the character traits necessary to be a successful scholar.
“José has such a wonderful and warm personality and he is the kind of person that inspires others to get involved and do great things. I have no doubt that he will represent Georgetown extremely well,” Robey wrote.
According to Global Admissions Director for the Schwarzman Scholars Robert Garris, the program was created with the intention of developing leaders with a better understanding of China.
“Steve Schwarzman, when he created the program really had the ambition of building over time a global network of people who are in leadership roles in business and government and the non-profit sector who are more effective at their work because they have a deeper understanding of China,” Garris said.
Applicants from around the world must submit a written application and semi-finalists must attend an interview with politicians, businesspeople and academics. This year, internationally renowned figures such as General David Petraeus, the former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, participated in certain interviews.
This year the program received 3054 applications and interviewed 300 applicants, before selecting the final 111 scholars.
The program has a 3.7 percent acceptance rate. The Rhodes Scholarship has a .4 percent acceptance rate, while the Marshall Scholarship has a 3.4 percent acceptance rate.
Garris said that the program hopes to develop the same level of prestige as the Rhodes Scholarship.
“I think everyone or almost everyone is aware that Bill Clinton for example is a Rhodes Scholar and we hope that in some point in the future a Prime Minister of Brazil or Thailand or Japan or a President of the United States was a Schwarzman Scholar and everyone points that out,” Garris said.
According to Luna, the Schwarzman Scholars will not only help the scholars who participate, but it will also help improve relations between China and the rest of the world.
“If you take a step back it’s a big necessary process in my opinion for the substantial and thorough forging of the relationship between China and the US, and really China and the rest of the world in general because it’s a global program,” Luna said.

The Office of Residential Living will replace Georgetown University Student Housing with a new software called StarRez as the campus-wide housing management system for the spring semester.
This new system, designed to simplify and condense the housing selection process, will affect all students who plan on living in university housing for the 2016-2017 school year, including incoming freshmen.
The current system, GUSH, was developed by a Georgetown employee several years ago. According to Executive Director for Residential Services Patrick Killilee, the university began looking into third-party systems after it became clear that GUSH was unsustainable.
“Homegrown systems aren’t always desirable because often you can be dependent on the person who created them,” Killilee said. “The platform that he [the creator] built it on was a platform that the university was no longer supporting.”
When the decision to find a third-party system was made, the university invited several different vendors to campus. Ultimately, university administration settled on StarRez, a housing system company that provides services for about 400 colleges and universities.
StarRez’s online housing portal will replace the current Housing-at-a-Glance page in February.
Killilee said that Georgetown chose StarRez primarily for its ability to provide the same services that GUSH did, but in a simpler and more user-friendly fashion.
“It’s very easy to use, very intuitive. We’re looking to provide the same information that we currently do and maybe more,” he said.
In addition to a new user interface, one of the most notable changes will impact the room selection process. In the current system, different types of rooms have different sign up dates spread out across nearly two months. In StarRez, this process will be greatly condensed.
“If we could get the room selection period from six weeks down to two weeks, that would be a big win,” Killilee said.
StarRez will require all students to respond to Living Preference Questions. In the event that students do not self-select their roommates, or if there is an opening in a room, this change will ease the roommate matching process.
According to Assistant Director of Assignments Krista Haxton, this will accompany a Campus Housing Roommate Matching System-type program for upperclassmen.
“We want to be able to do compatibility matches on a stronger scale than we’ve done in the past, since it’s been old [Living Preference Questions] data,” Haxton said.
Students registering as groups will no longer be forced to rely on a group sponsor for the selection process. In the new system, every student will have to access the system and familiarize themselves with its layout. This change will enable the university to more easily collect data from students, such as emergency contact information.
The StarRez portal will include the same information that the Housing-at-a-Glance page currently does, but will also hold a cache of all emails that the Office of Residential Living has sent.
Richie Sekerak (COL ’17) welcomed this change and hoped that students will have an opportunity to work with the new program prior to housing selection.
“It can be a hassle to find those [emails] in your inbox,” Sekerak said. “It would be a good idea in my opinion to have each student get acclimated to the website.”
Phalguni Vetrichelvan (SFS ‘18) said she hoped StarRez would be an improvement.
“I hope this new system is more user friendly and less time consuming,” Vetrichelvan said.

Georgetown University received a $10 million donation from Hong Kong-based multinational conglomerate Spring Breeze Foundation to establish an Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues, announced Jan. 14.
The donation, which will be parceled out at $1 million per year over 10 years, funds research, teaching and outreach that span five global issues: peace and security, business and trade, economic and social development, global health and humanitarian crises and the environment.
The university has previously facilitated academic exchange with China through partnerships with Chinese institutions including the Central Party School in Beijing and Fudan University in Shanghai.
Vice President of Global Affairs Thomas Banchoff said Georgetown’s academic background in and relationship with China were factors that compelled the Spring Breeze Foundation to impart the gift.
“The Foundation reached out to Georgetown because we are a leading university in Washington, D.C., and have interdisciplinary expertise around global issues as well as strong connections in China,” Banchoff wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Core Initiative’s programs, including the research groups and student-student dialogue, will be designed to build and share knowledge on critical issues.”
The Charoen Pokphand Group, a leading Thai agro-industry and retail conglomerate, created The Spring Breeze Foundation in 2015. The CP Group supports academic institutions that research global development. The Group has previously donated to Harvard, Pennsylvania State, Duke and Tsinghua universities.
Shang Zhang (GRD ’11), an investment manager for CP Group’s subsidiary CT Bright Holdings, emphasized the initiative as a way to strengthen relationships between American and Asian institutions.
“As a global corporation with a large presence in [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] and China, the CP group has a social responsibility and willingness to contribute to stronger East-West ties,” Zhang wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown University was selected for its academic excellence, independence and potential role in enhancing high-level dialogue and cultural exchange between the East and West.”
While still in its planning stage, the initiative has assembled a 14- person faculty committee, comprised of scholars from across the Georgetown schools, to formulate its programming. The committee is currently recruiting a director and staff for the initiative, including a senior China scholar and a junior hire focused more broadly on Asia.
Some of the plans are expected to take effect this semester, including the launch of a website scheduled for next month and the formation of research groups which will publish their findings, organize seminars and consult with policymakers. Others, including the linkage of Georgetown classes with courses taught in China through videoconferencing technology planned for the fall semester, are operating on a longer time frame.
Professor Michael Green, who previously served as a senior Asia expert on the National Security staff and now is on the initiative committee, said the committee aims to establish a dialogue unencumbered by the bureaucracy which often dogs official government channels, and fosters mutual trust that does not compromise U.S. or ally interests.
“We’re well-positioned to have a candid dialogue about comprehensive issues and we’re still designing what that dialogue will include,” Green said. “I should emphasize that this is not based on the idea that we should sweep our differences under the rug or that we should ignore the interests of our allies in Asia. … Georgetown has done that on some of our most sensitive issues in a very productive way that has built more trust, not less.”
Green said that a donation from the corporate foundation will not infringe upon the autonomy of the university’s research, as Georgetown will independently decide how the money will be spent. Rather, the programming will revolve around four foundational principles: independence, transparency, balance and academic excellence.
“In any gift, it’s incumbent upon the university, whether a university or a think tank, to ensure academic independence,” Green said. “The donors understood that … we would define the mission of this dialogue, but we would do so based on participation from the U.S. side that is unhindered and unobstructed in any way.”
Alex Rued (GRD ’16), editor-in-chief of The Georgetown Journal of Asian Affairs and a graduate student in Georgetown’s Asian Studies program, said she hopes for a greater degree of people-to-people exchange as a result of the new initiative.
“I think it might also be helpful that there be some involvement with the Journal where we could publish some young scholars from China on issues and maybe have debates on issues that the U.S. or China are facing to get dialogue where we’re not seeing much improvement at the high levels of government,” Rued said.
Anna Scott Bell (GRD ’16), who also studies politics and security in China in the Asian Studies program, said she hopes the donation will provide insight into more morally ambiguous topics.
“I think so much about the conversation about the U.S.-China relationship is understandably focused on business and security, but in many ways I’d like to see that we broaden the conversation,” Bell said. “Some of the areas that are really difficult to get past in the U.S.-China relationships are more values-based or human rights-based, issues about the different types of governance and free speech and civil society that we need to focus research on rather than make them more peripheral or marginal.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article indicated that Bell was an employee of the Congressional Executive Commission on China and was speaking on behalf of CECC. She is an intern and is not professionally affiliated with CECC.

The Smithsonian National Zoo welcomed three new pandas these past several months and has slowly begun to introduce them to the public on public-viewing days.
Rusty, a male red panda famous for his temporary escape in 2013, and his two cubs are thriving at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. Along with their father, the one-year-old cubs, Tusa and Asa, join fellow red pandas on the red list of endangered species, meaning there are fewer than 10,000 of them left in the wild.
The third panda, Bei Bei, sparked the public’s interest with his birth five months ago on Aug. 22.
On Bei Bei’s public-viewing day on Jan. 16, 10,000 visitors entered the zoo and 7,000 of them visited the panda exhibit, a greater amount than for Bei Bei’s older sister Bao Bao in January 2014. The general public was able to watch Bei Bei’s growth through an online camera before his debut.
Currently, the Smithsonian Zoo is home to four giant pandas: Tian Tian, his mother Mei Xiang and their daughter Bao Bao, and Bei Bei. Tai Shan, their firstborn, was sent back to China in 2010.
In the public viewings thus far, Bei Bei, whose name means precious treasure in Chinese, has developed a reputation for being rather sleepy, which he proved by sleeping through his media checkup.
Bei Bei has also been quite popular in the media, with articles featuring him published in several newspapers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, in addition to blogs and videos dedicated to him. First Lady Michelle Obama and China’s first lady Peng Liyuan have both visited him.
Spokeswoman for the zoo Devin Murphy said that Bei Bei’s popularity is likely due to the relationship the public has maintained with him since his birth.
“The public has been able to watch Bei Bei since the moment he was born through the panda cam and that’s why they feel very attached to him,” Murphy said. “And they’ve been able to see exactly what we’re seeing.”
Pandas are an endangered species with only 1,800 left in the wild and have a notoriously difficult time reproducing. Mother pandas give birth to twins 50 percent of the time but in the wild, the mother can only take care of one, often causing the other to die.
Bei Bei, was a result of artificial insemination. However, his sibling died at four days old. Although Mei Xiang, their mother, began nursing both cubs, she had difficulty caring for the both of them. The zoo swapped the babies until Mei Xiang rejected the weaker one, allowing it to bottle-feed him.
A pathology report attributed Bei Bei’s brother’s death to an aspiration of food in his respiratory system, resulting in pneumonia and eventually death.
Murphy said that zoo staff tailored its care for Bei Bei and Bao Bao according to indications it receive sfrom Mei Xiang.
“Really, Mei Xiang has raised both of her cubs, so we take all of our cues from her and she is an excellent mom. And based on what she’s telling us, we move at her pace,” Murphy said. “We’ve done things very similarly with Bei Bei and Bao Bao.”
The Smithsonian will have the pandas until 2020, when the lease expires. Bei Bei will only be here for the first four years of his life before he joins his older sister in China. The cubs are transferred in order to aid the process of creating more pandas and generating research on the species.
For now, Bei Bei is in good health and is expected to continue to grow. Murphy is looking forward to Bei Bei’s development.
“We expect his climbing skills to get a little better,” Murphy said. “He’s probably going to work on perfecting them over the next couple of months. He’s probably going to start eating bamboo around six months of age so he’s going to be nursing from his mom for at least another year.”
Murphy added that as people continue to visit him, visitors will be able to see the changes in Bei Bei over time as he grows and thrives with his family.
“He’s going to be changing week by week so if you visit multiple times, you’re likely to see something different every time,” Murphy said.
David Harris, a zoo visitor who went to the general public viewing, had yet to visit the zoo before attending Bei Bei’s debut.
“We came to visit family and meet family for our kids,” Harris said. “We hadn’t been to the zoo before. We’re happy to be here when the new panda is coming.”
His children interrupted him to express their excitement over the pandas.
“They’re really cute,” the Harris children said. “They’re pretty far up on my list.”
Kate Cole (MSB ’18), president of Animalia, a student group that aims to ensure humane animal treatment, praised the cooperation between the National Zoo and China.
“I think it’s great that the zoo is working towards helping the panda population stay alive and trying to get it off the endangered list. I love the bear,” Cole said. “If China decided that the zoo is the best place for it to be raised then that’s awesome. China loves their pandas so much that I’m sure if they chose for it to be raised here, then that’s the best thing for it and that’s all you can ask for.”

The Georgetown University Student Association has worked with the D.C. Fair Skies Coalition since August 2015 to combat noise disturbances caused by a 2013 shift of the Federal Aviation Administration’s route for flights in and out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
The D.C. Fair Skies Coalition is comprised of seven of the affected neighborhood’s citizen associations: Foggy Bottom, Georgetown, Burleith, Colony Hill, Hillendale, Foxhall and Palisades.
The shift moved flight paths from over the Potomac River and industrial areas of northern Virginia closer to Georgetown, resulting in noise disturbances across northwest Washington. The impact of the changed routes was further aggravated by the authorization of round-the-clock arrivals and departures at the airport.
Ed Solomon, Commissioner for Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, to which Georgetown belongs, said the noise has a significant impact on residents.
“When there’s a person outside, they have to pause [when speaking] because the planes are flying so low and also the planes are taking off earlier in the morning, before five o’clock and after midnight,” Solomon said. “Folks have noticed a major increase, not only has it gone on the last two years that we’ve noticed an increase, but specifically in the spring of 2015, more planes are flying over our communities.”
Solomon said the D.C. Fair Skies Coalition plans to fight the FAA’s decision through legal channels.
“We would hope to convince the FAA through expressing our concerns as well as through the legal route that we’ve taken so hopefully we can bring a resolution [and] have them revisit the routes that they have chosen to fly,” Solomon said.
Modeling its actions after those taken by Phoenix, Ariz. neighborhoods against the FAA last year, the coalition is seeking to take legal action through submitting a Petition for Review with the D.C. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The Coalition argues that the FAA’s decision not to review the impact of the 2013 flight path changes is unjust.
Although GUSA cannot be an official party in these actions because it cannot officially lobby as an organization, student leaders are helping in other capacities, including creating a website that will be operational later this semester.
GUSA Speaker of the Senate Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) stressed that GUSA’s primary motivation to support D.C. Fair Skies is improving neighborhood relations.
“With the general student body, I think it varies in terms of how important this issue is …” Khan said. “Since this is something of high importance to this neighborhood, it’s definitely something worth partnering up on, but … it just depends on in terms of legality to what extent we can get involved.”
GUSA Secretary of Campus Planning Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said neighborhood relationships are particularly important as the university enters the next campus planning process.
“As we go into the next campus planning process and we engage in a critical semester for the campus plan, maintaining good relationships with neighbors and working together on issues of common interest will be especially important,” Goldstein said. “So GUSA is going to continue in D.C. Fair Skies Coalition, both out of concern for the problem of flight noise itself and out of a good will effort to engage with the neighborhood.”
GUSA aided the coalition by convincing the university to bear some of the financial costs of its legal effort.
Vice President for Government Relations and Community Engagement Chris Murphy wrote in an email to The Hoya that the university will support the coalition.
“We’ve committed to pay our share of the coalition’s legal expenses but no funds have been paid to date,” Murphy said.
Murphy declined to give an exact figure of how much the university plans to contribute.
Goldstein said for most students, the noise from planes is a fact of campus life, particularly on the south side of campus.
“I’ll go out to sit on the Healey Family Student Center patio and I hear them pretty constantly,” Goldstein said. “I also notice it when I give tours for Blue and Gray … and there’s just planes barreling overhead and so I normally will stop for a second and make a joke about it and then continue. It’s not that big of an obstruction to my experience at Georgetown, but it certainly is a nuisance and I know that for certain types of neighbors, it can be an especially significant problem.”
Melissa Frazee (COL ’17) said the issue of planes flying over the university is not particularly relevant to the student experience.
“I think that it’s just not an issue. I don’t hear planes in class … It just seems a little ridiculous, there are bigger issues,” Frazee said.

In conjunction with the United States’ recent prisoner swap with Iran, a fifth detainee named Matthew Trevithick, who worked at Georgetown’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, was separately released Jan. 16. Trevithick was released along with four other prisoners, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian.
The original agreement planned for the exchange of four American prisoners for seven Iranians, who were either released or will have the charges against them dropped. Adding Trevithick to the negotiation jeopardized the completion of the original deal, which led to Secretary of State John Kerry directly negotiating with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif for Trevithick’s release on a different track.
Trevithick was conducting research at the Syrian Research and Evaluation Organization in Turkey, a research center that Trevithick co-founded in 2013. The center conducts analysis to help governments and organizations respond to the Syrian conflict and humanitarian crisis. Trevithick then traveled to Iran in Sept. 2015 to participate in a four-month intensive Dari language program at Tehran University’s Dehkhoda Institute, where he was detained by Iranian authorities.
According to his family, Trevithick contacted them once a day prior to his detainment to assure them of his safety. The day that Trevithick was captured in December, twenty-four hours went by without any word from him.
Trevithick’s mother and stepfather were informed several days later that Iranian authorities were holding him. He went on to spend 40 days in Iran’s Evin prison, which is known for detaining political prisoners.
In a statement, Trevithick’s family expressed gratitude to all those who worked to secure his release.
“We are profoundly grateful to all those who worked for his release and are happy for all the families whose loved ones are also heading home,” the statement read. “We look forward to reuniting with Matt and ask that all respect his privacy as he returns.”
Trevithick’s mother Amelia Newcomb said that the family strategically kept his detainment discreet.
“We kept it very, very quiet because that’s how we could best ensure a positive outcome,” Newcomb said to The New York Times.
Trevithick’s stepfather Scott Armstrong said that he was confused as to why his stepson was detained in the first place.
“They just grab people and you don’t really know why,” Armstrong said to The New York Times. “He was very careful.”
Trevithick, a 2008 graduate of Boston University, is recovering with his family after returning to Massachusetts.
Robin Wright, a joint fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, said that it is unclear why Trevithick was detained, according to Financialcv.com.

When the Washington Auto Show opens at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center today, artwork from 11 Georgetown University students and a professor will be displayed at two of the show’s exhibits.
The art project is part of a partnership between Mazda and Professor L. Collier Hyams’ Introduction to Graphic Design class that challenged students to create car exterior artwork relating to the theme “Kodo,” a Japanese word roughly translating to “soul of motion.” The Washington Auto Show is open to the public and runs until Sunday.
Nearly 130 designs were submitted by students in November and the top three winners were chosen by Mazda North American Operations Design Director Julien Montousse.
Elle Vernerey’s (COL ’17) design “Flash” took first place and Zack Bennett-Engler’s (COL ’18) design “Hyper” took second place.
“It was the last thing I expected, to be honest,” Vernerey said of her pick as the top design. “I felt good about my designs, and I thought they looked cool, but there were other people in the class who were very artistic.”
“Flash” incorporates strokes of color that make the car look as if it is moving when it is stationary. Conceiving the design took Vernerey a little more than a week, but she said that once she got the idea, it took her about five hours to design it on the computer.
Vernerey’s design premiered on Dec. 5 at the Scottish Christmas Walk Parade in Alexandria, Va. and is on display at Mazda’s booth at the Washington Auto Show this week.
Like last year’s competition winner Tori Hideshima (COL ’15), Vernerey had no previous experience with graphic design before taking Hyams’ class.
“I had zero experience with graphic design,” Vernerey said. “Like less than zero. I had never used Photoshop or Illustrator. I knew what it was, generally, but I had never actually used it.”
Bennett-Engler’s second-place car design is on display at the Automotive Rhythms’ “Art in Motion” display at the Auto Show this week alongside a car containing a decorative wrap designed by Hyams.
In addition to the two physical car displays at the Automotive Rhythms exhibit, nine students have their car art displayed on posters.
This is the first year that Hyams partnered with Automotive Rhythms and second year that he partnered with Mazda for a competition. During last year’s contest, the Intro to Graphic Design students at Georgetown created 100 designs celebrating the opening of Mazda’s new auto factory in Salamanca, Mexico.
Now in its third year, Hyams said that Georgetown’s Introduction to Graphic Design class has developed with age.
“It’s gotten stronger,” Hyams said of the class. “I mean, certainly when you introduce a new class, you go through some growing stages, growing pains.”
The introductory class has become so popular that the Department of Art and Art History added a Graphic Design II class this semester. According to Hyams, the demand for graphic design instruction is in part fueled by a desire to increase marketable skills that can carry over to other professional careers such as marketing.
“This is cyclical,” Hyams said. “You see this quite a lot. There are periods when students want to learn, explore, create simply for the sake of doing it. And there are other periods of time where students want to learn something that can be applied directly to the career path or making money. And I think that’s the environment of things for the last couple of years.”
Bennet-Engler said he took Hyams’ class as a means to explore a lifelong interest. He is currently taking Hyams’ Film Animation class and said he hopes to continue his design work in the coming years, especially after winning the Mazda competition.
Hyams said he hopes Georgetown’s partnership with Mazda will continue in the coming years. But for Hyams, his graphic design class is about more than competition. It is for the love of graphic art as well.
“I just got a message last week from a kid who was talking about how it changed her career,” Hyams said. “To me that’s just wonderful. So I think that there’s a sense of happiness and joy and accomplishment that’s really important.”

Citing recent disappointment in the financial performances of its three Washington, D.C. stores, Walmart abruptly cancelled the planned construction of two stores in some of D.C.’s poorer areas Jan. 15.
As part of its deal to enter the D.C. market three years ago, Walmart promised to build two supercenters in Ward 7. The D.C. Council, backed by labor unions, initially resisted Walmart’s integration into the city, citing concerns with the corporation’s low wages and prohibition of worker unions.
However, the major retailer promised to open two stores east of the Anacostia River in underresourced neighborhoods, where jobs and affordable goods are much needed. The now cancelled stores were planned for Skyland Center in Southeast D.C. and in Capitol Gateway Marketplace in Northeast D.C.
The Skyland location alone would have brought $65 million in sales and property taxes to the city while adding 300 permanent and 300 temporary jobs, a major boost to the area. D.C. officials have not specified a next step for the locations, which have been zoned to accommodate a large retailer.
D.C.’s elected officials reacted with outrage at Walmart’s announcement. At a press conference discussing the issue, Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed her disappointment with Walmart and affirmed the District’s commitment to continue to try to help areas that the corporation had planned to build stores in.
“I’m blood mad about it,” Bowser said at the press conference. “We will turn our attention to those private developments to see any and everything the city can do to make sure they continue to be viable.”
A spokesperson for the mayor did not respond to requests for comment.
Due to poor financial performances at some of its locations, Walmart recently announced its decision to close 154 stores across the country and 269 worldwide, most of which are part of its Walmart Express brand of convenience store-sized centers. D.C.’s three current Walmart stores, located on H Street, Georgia Avenue and Riggs Road, will not be affected. Walmart’s first two locations in the District opened in 2013.
The company’s stock prices have gone down nearly $25 a share from January of last year, and Walmart is looking into how it can revitalize its company’s profits, which forced them to draw back from building the two new D.C. superstores.
In a press release, Walmart explained that the decision to pull out of Skyland and Capitol Gateway was part of a greater trend in Walmart’s business model.
“As part of a broad, strategic review of our existing portfolio and pipeline, we made the difficult decision to close 154 stores throughout the U.S.,” the statement said. “As part of this review, we’ve concluded opening two additional stores in the District is not viable.”
The statement also cited concerns about the three current Walmart stores in D.C., which have not been profitable for the company.
“We share in the disappointment about this reality but our existing three stores are not profitable,” the statement said. “We must focus on improving them so we can take care of our customers and associates.”
D.C. Councilmember Yvette Alexander (D-Ward 7) expressed frustration at Walmart’s decision and pointed to possible discrimination in a statement to CNN. Ward 7 has a median income of $35,000, which is nearly $17,000 less than the national median average income.
“I take this personally, as I advocated to bring them to Ward 7,” Alexander said. “This has racial and social-economic discrimination implications.”
Former D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray, who negotiated the deal with Walmart during his term, criticized Bowser’s inability to keep pressure on Walmart to stay in D.C. Gray stressed the need for the company to be held accountable for backing out. Gray could potentially use the issue as part of an attempt to launch a political comeback in a possible Councilmember run this year against Alexander in Ward 7.
“If I were mayor, I’d get on a plane and go to Bentonville [Walmart’s Arkansas headquarters]. They should be held accountable,” Gray said to The Washington Post, citing Walmart’s Arkansas headquarters. “What did the administration do to stay on top of this? There is no bigger project going on than this one.”

The Center for Social Justice’s Alternative Breaks Program announced in November its expansion to include 31 service trips, the most in ABP’s history. The increase includes six new trips, including trips over the summer and Presidents’ Day weekend, as well as five new spring break trips.
Founded in 1975 with a single trip to Appalachia, ABP has gradually expanded throughout its history to begin offering trips outside of the spring break period, with 18 trips in the 2013-2014 academic year.
This year’s additional trips, which include Washington D.C. programs “Magis: Deconstructing Islamophobia & Religious Discrimination” over Presidents’ Day weekend and “City Seeds” in May, increase ABP’s total enrollment potential to over 400 undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty and staff members.
“CSJ’s Alternative Breaks Program has a long history at Georgetown University, with our first group of students spending their breaks immersed in community and learning more about social justice over 40 years ago,” CSJ Associate Director Raymond Shiu wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Three of the seven new ABP trips this year are designated as “Magis” trips, resulting from a partnership with the Center for Campus Ministry. Each will specifically involve discussions of faith and religion.
“We’ve been looking to continue to expand the options available to respond to interest, provide alternative options, and explore additional social justice issues,” Shiu wrote.
ABP’s new programs aim to attract a greater number of student volunteers this year by offering more trips over a wider range of dates. According to ABP Finance Chair Saumya Bollam (COL ’16), ABP’s new programs endeavor to target students whose schedules may not allow for a traditional spring break service trip.
“We understand the commitments that Georgetown community members make during spring break and wanted to offer alternative timelines — shorter, weekend trips for people who can’t commit a week away from family — and other options for students who go abroad in the spring,” Bollam wrote in an email to The Hoya.
With these additional programs, student leaders within ABP said they hope greater student involvement will bring more diversity to ABP groups and lead to more productive and impactful trips.
According to Kate Riga (COL ’17), who serves as a co-leader of ABP’s Blanket New Orleans trip, the addition of new trips allows for more participants and more fulfilling experiences.
“By expanding the trips, all we’re doing is making this transformative experience more available to a greater selection of people. ABP thrives off of a diversity of participants, and the more people we can reach, the richer and more impactful the trips will be,” Riga wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Magis: Deconstructing Islamophobia & Religious Discrimination” will take place in Washington, D.C. after requests from Georgetown’s Muslim Life chaplain Imam Yahya Hendi, and students both within and outside the Muslim Student Association.
Hendi will join 14 student volunteers and two student trip leaders, such as co-leader Zack Abu-Akeel (SFS ’18), on a four-day-long service trip in the District to address issues of Islamophobia in the local community and its effect on national policy.
“A big part of any ABP is meeting people where they are. So we start at the beginning with a lot of discussion about identity and how to form a religious community through identity,” Abu-Akeel said.
Abu-Akeel said that a large part of creating a successful ABP trip comes from working with various community groups.
“We contact the community partners and actually set up the schedule for the week and who we’re going to meet with. That’s a big part of it, forming the arc of the trip,” Abu-Akeel said. “How are we going to combine our different experiences to form a narrative for the few days or the week?”
Applications for ABP’s 25 spring break trips were due Jan. 15, after which trip leaders were tasked with sorting through applicants and assembling their service groups. Abu-Akeel said trip leaders specifically look for applicants who are enthusiastic about the alternative break’s issue area and display a willingness to approach the trip with an open mind.
“What we look for in applications is ability, willingness to engage in reflection and draw on past experience to explain why you see the world the way you do now,” Abu-Akeel said. “Basically, are you showing potential to engage with these issues through reflection?”
Students’ responses in recent years to added trips during winter and summer break encouraged ABP to add trips over long weekends such as the Islamophobia trip.
“Going home and seeing my family over spring is important to me, but doing a service trip in February or May is something I can see myself doing,” Nicole Bittlingmaier (NHS ’18) said.
Christina Graziano (MSB ’17) said that she appreciates ABP’s expanded program offerings allow students to participate in social justice work outside of the spring break period.
“Well, I think it’s definitely a good idea to expand the offerings, just because I know people have set plans for spring break,” Graziano said. “I know I haven’t gone on a spring break trip because of previous commitments to my family, so I definitely would be interested in going on a Presidents’ Day trip.”

Despite efforts to invest in Washington, D.C.’s infrastructure, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the city a C-minus on its 2016 Infrastructure Report Card, released Jan. 14.
The ASCE releases a national report card every four years as well as report cards for individual states and regions on a rolling basis. The evaluations take into account the conditions of bridges, drinking water, energy, levees, parks, rails, roads, schools, solid waste, transit and wastewater.
Engineer Ranjit Sahai, chair of the committee that created D.C.’s report card, highlighted the report card format as allowing easy access to both infrastructure experts and District residents.
“The Report Card for D.C.’s Infrastructure is a standardized assessment of D.C.’s infrastructure against eight relevant criteria,” Sahai wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The report card, like a dashboard, is an easy to understand tool for documenting and presenting the outcome of an assessment for both the layman and the expert.”
Of the criteria that the ASCE selected, the District scored the highest on bridges and rails, receiving a B-minus in both categories. However, the report cites that 21 of the 252 bridges in D.C. are structurally deficient despite the $26.1 million that the city received from the Federal Highway Bridge Fund in 2011.
The District also received a D-minus on the evaluation of city levees and a D-min for roads.
According to a United States Army Corps of Engineers inspection, all 3.26 miles of levees in the city are reported to be structurally unacceptable. Additionally, the report card states that of the city’s 1,502 public roads, 95 percent are in poor condition. Because of this, District motorists spend an average of $1,061 annually on vehicle repairs after driving on damaged roads, totaling $425 million.
Public Information Officer for the District Department of Transportation Terry Owens said that while the ASCE’s analysis is welcome, projects involving complete overhauls of city infrastructure are not currently the DDOT’s primary focus.
“We appreciate the work of the American Society of Civil Engineers which can be a valuable tool not only for the District, but communities across the country,” Owens wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Major infrastructure projects are important and we are making progress, but we have also prioritized our delivery of core services and programs like repair and rehabilitation of existing sidewalks, roads and alleys, as well as streetlights and trees.”
Although the ASCE found much of the District’s infrastructure unacceptable, its overall score was actually higher than that of the nation’s D-plus average. Furthermore, D.C. scored similarly to other areas with high urban populations, such as New York, which also received a C-minus.
Sahai said that in comparison with other states, D.C.’s infrastructure problems result more from the leadership of local elected officials than from other factors.
“D.C. infrastructure owners and their consultants have the technical know-how to improve infrastructure grades,” Sahai wrote. “The problem is not that their model is broken. The problem is that policymakers who allocate available resources have relegated infrastructure needs low on their priority scale. This approach has over decades starved the maintenance and evolution needs of infrastructure.”
However, Owens said that local officials have given the DDOT adequate support, and that this support is beginning to pay off.
“We are grateful for the tremendous support we receive from the Mayor and Council,” Owens wrote. “That support can be seen across the District in the form of new sidewalks, repaved streets and alleys, as well as major developments such as the recently completed 16th Street Bridge over Military Road, the 11th Street Bridge and the New York Avenue Bridge.”
Despite D.C.’s drinking water receiving a C-minus and wastewater receiving a C-plus, D.C. Water and Sewer Authority Chief Executive Officer George Hawkins expressed optimism in a press conference Jan. 14.
“It’s the trend that matters more than an individual point,” Hawkins said. “Each day, each year, we’re going to get better.”
