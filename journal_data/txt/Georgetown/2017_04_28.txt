The law should not prevent women from pursuing their aspirations, said Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg during a discussion in Gaston Hall yesterday.
Society’s perception of women has evolved but certain underlying challenges remain toward achieving full gender equity, Ginsburg said.
“The challenge is more daunting than the one we faced. I spoke before about explicit gender-biased laws. What’s left, is what’s called unconscious bias. My best illustration of that is the symphony orchestra when I grew up you never saw a woman in the orchestra. The music critics thought that a violin sounded different played by a woman,” Ginsburg said. “It’s getting over that unconscious bias that remains a problem.”
Ginsburg was joined by her two authorized biographers, adjunct professor of law Mary Hartnett and Georgetown University Law Center professor Emerita Wendy Williams, to discuss her new book “My Own Words” as part of the Marver H. Bernstein Symposium, which seeks to stimulate discussion on public policy issues. Ginsburg also addressed GULC students Sept. 8 last year.
Ginsburg recommended women seek allies of all genders in an effort to fight gender discrimination.
“For you, the challenge is more daunting than the one that we faced,” Ginsburg said at Georgetown on Thursday. “My advice is find allies among men as well as women who want to change things. And think of yourself … as a teacher. So don’t react in anger because that’s going to be counter-productive.”
According to Ginsburg, when she joined the Supreme Court, gender-based discrimination was not considered an issue.
“There was the woman who took care of the home and children and the man who took care of the family’s economic wellbeing. And many laws were written with that picture of the world in mind,” Ginsburg said. “So the effort was to say there’s something wrong with that picture of the world. The object was to break down all those explicit gender-based distinctions so people could be free to be you and me.”
Ginsburg, who has served more than two decades on the Supreme Court, said she believes in the power of the law to evolve as times change.
“The great thing about our constitution is that, like our society, it can evolve,” Ginsburg said.
Currently, Ginsburg is one of three women on the Supreme Court. In 1993, when she was sworn in, she was the second female justice to be confirmed, joining former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who resigned from the court in 2006.
Ginsburg said O’Connor’s departure from the court led to the most significant shift in the Supreme Court in her time on the bench.
“The biggest change in the 24 years I’ve been there is when Justice O’Connor retired. Before, there were the two of us. We didn’t talk alike, we didn’t walk alike,” Ginsburg said. “But when Justice O’Connor left, there were these eight, most of them rather wealthy, men, and then this small little woman.”
Ginsburg said her husband Martin Ginsburg, a former GULC professor, was her biggest supporter and showed her what a partnership could look like. Ginsburg often referred to her Martin Ginsburg as a life partner, rather than husband.
“Marty was the first boy, probably the only boy, who cared that I had a brain,” Ginsburg said.
While Ginsburg’s “dissent jabot” has gained her a reputation as an avid dissenter, according to legal scholars, she said she aims to exercise that right only when necessary.
“I do not take every opportunity to dissent. I do try to save them for when it counts, when it really matters,” Ginsburg said. “I keep on my desk the unpublished opinions of Justice Brandeis. His view was his voice would be all the more compelling if he only dissented when it really mattered.”
Ginsburg hopes her work helps improve individuals’ state of living and ultimately contributes to a better world.
“I would like to be thought of as a person who cares about people and does the best she can with the talents she has to make a contribution to a better world,” Ginsburg said.
The Honorable Robert A. Katzmann, chief judge for the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals, who moderated the discussion, said Ginsburg has made enormous contributions to American society.
“Justice Ginsburg is celebrated for her impact as a judge on this country’s highest court, the second-longest member on the court, for her path marking contributions to laws’ developments, for her methodical, brilliant analyses and concise, elegant prose,” Katzmann said.

Unconscious gender bias? What does that mean? So we are to believe she knows what is in the subconscious of men who then unconsciously discriminate against women? So much unconscious male bias must have occurred against her that she became a Supreme Court Justice? Men in general do have bias for and against women just as many women tend to prejudge men. Men and women are different both physically and mentally. Both have strengths and weaknesses. Judge people on who they are and what they do not some belief that men are against women’s achievements.

Oh my goodness: a Supreme Court member with a history of political bias – versus the law itself – makes a call to arms for addressing bias. Perhaps she should take a good look in the mirror and realize that she and her professor husband are nothing more than hacks and sail quietly into the sunset. What a disgrace of a Supreme Court Justice. SHAME!!!!

“The great thing about our constitution is that, like our society, it can evolve,”
Hey, GInsburg, do you THINK (if you actually do that versus just espouse your political beliefs) that the Founding Fathers would have put in language about how the Constitution would evolve over time versus just assuming it would. You are pathetic (to put it nicely). Way to pee on the foundations of our country….

A Georgetown University Student Association referendum on senate electoral reform  failed to pass last night after receiving support from less than 25 percent of the student body – the minimum threshold required for the vote to pass.
The referendum, conducted over a three-day period, included two major reforms to the GUSA senate: the election of senators by class year rather than geographic district and the codification of outreach to underrepresented communities to encourage participation in student government.
The first proposed reform would have reduced the size of the senate from 29 to 24.
Other changes included in this question included moving senate elections to the spring.
The second reform proposed codifying existing GUSA diversity programs, including ElectHer, which seeks to recruit female students for elected positions, and A GUSA That Looks Like Georgetown, which seeks to encourage students from underrepresented populations to run for elected positions. The reform also proposed updating GUSA bylaws to prevent exclusion on the basis of identity.
The two questions received 88 percent and 93 percent support of voters, respectively, but total turnout was 23 percent of the student body. The most recent constitutional referendum in December saw 38 percent turnout before it was invalidated by the GUSA Constitutional Council for violating GUSA bylaws. The Dec. 1 referendum sought to abolish the GUSA senate and replace it with a smaller assembly with a narrower legislative focus on club funding.
Twenty-five percent of the student body needed to vote “Yes” for the referendum to pass. Voter turnout surged to 11 percent on the first day of the referendum, according to the GUSA Elections Twitter account, and crept up to 14 percent by the end of the second day. Turnout picked up again on the final day, in part due to a voting booth set up in Red Square.
The impartial voting booth was one of the reforms instituted by the GUSA senate following the council’s decision to invalidate the December referendum. Reforms sought to make the election and referendum process transparent and unbiased.
GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) said the executive can focus on policy goals now that the internal structure of the senate has been settled.
“GUSA executive has always supported the right of the student body to decide who represents them and how they are represented,” Mack said. “Now that the question of the internal structure is sort of settled, I am definitely excited to get to work with on issues such as affordability, student health and many other ways to help the student body.”
No one was to blame for low voter turnout, according to Mack.
“Now is just the end of April and a lot of people are turning their vision to finals and Georgetown Day is a big event happening tomorrow. I don’t know who the blame is for the turnout. I don’t think anyone is to blame for the turnout,” Mack said.
GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said the time of year and nature of the referendum topic prevented voter turnout from reaching 25 percent.
“This referendum was a low turnout referendum in part because it was done in April and we are obviously not used to doing elections in April and it was a very arcane topic: GUSA restructuring,” Willard said. “It was held over three days to try to get more votes out.”
The polling station in Red Square, which ran from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., was one of the highest sources of votes, garnering about 100 to 150 votes on the last day, according to Willard. There were no irregularities with voting on Hoyalink.
GUSA Senate Speaker Richard Mullaney (COL ’18) said voter turnout was an initial concern and that the senate needs to improve its outreach efforts.
“Students clearly support this type of reform but GUSA still has a lot of work to do engaging students,” Mullaney wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m extremely proud of the senate’s ability to address its own problems and seek to improve them. This senate is not too keen on giving up. I expect that we will continue to move forward with our efforts to better serve the students of Georgetown.
Students were able to vote for 72 hours and were able to vote on both referendum questions or just one.
GUSA Sen. Scott Lowder (COL ’17) said the 7 percent of voters who voted against the anti-inclusivity referendum should alarm all students.
“The fact that 113 students voted against basic non-discrimination protections should shock and disgust every decent Hoya on this campus and encourage all of us to stay vigilant in support of the marginalized communities among us,” Lowder wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Mack said the executive will continue to work with the senate to achieve policy objectives.
“We still want to work hand in hand with the senate. For us all we care about is improving the student experience, we are definitely going to zone in on working on the issues,” Mack said. “The referendum is time for us to reflect on what are the good things and what are the bad things about the structure.”

Meal says 
April 29, 2017 at 3:24 pm
“No one was to blame for low voter turnout, according to Mack.”
Looks like someone took a cue from the Clinton campaign.

Dick Pointer says 
October 6, 2017 at 9:07 pm
Mack was against it from the beginning.

After about three years of advocacy by the Disability Studies Minor Working Group, Georgetown is set to offer a new minor on disability studies this fall after it was approved by the Georgetown College Executive Council on Monday.
With the introduction of the minor, the university is set to join 42 higher-level institutions offering programs in this field in the United States and Canada.
Students interested in declaring the 18-credit minor will have to take three core courses: Introduction to Disability Studies and two approved elective courses. The electives will span a range of different departments, including English, Theology and Anthropology.
The university currently offers courses in the disability studies course cluster, which was formed by the Disability Studies Minor Working Group, an ad hoc faculty body formed in 2013. The cluster institutionalized relevant courses across different departments in the College and School of Nursing and Health Studies.
After the cluster was created, students were able to explore disability studies in more depth, but still could not receive accreditation. Associate professor of theology Julia Watts Belser, a member of the working group, said the minor would lead to a greater commitment to the field.
“We’re doing tremendous work for the disability studies cluster, but it was always a bit of a regret for me that the kind of intellectual work that happened there wasn’t recognized in students’ transcripts,” Belser said. “Having the minor makes it possible for students to make a more sustained, deeper commitment to disability studies as a field and then to come out of it with a credential that I think signals this kind of intellectual commitment.”
Georgetown College Dean Chester Gillis said students and faculty deserve academic programs that pertain to current social issues.
“Clearly this is an emerging field of study. Our students deserve a curriculum that reflects national trends. Many faculty members work in this area and now have a curricular outlet for their research and expertise,” Gillis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown’s program has the potential to reinforce the university’s broader mission of nurturing the individual’s mind, body and spirit, according to Libbie Rifkin, professor of English and head of the working group.
“What I think Georgetown is poised to contribute to this array of existing programs is the relationship that the field of disability studies has to our mission,” Rifkin said. “The notion of educating the whole person and really thinking about what it means to educate the whole person and what are our notions of the healthy body, the normative mind, the worthwhile life — those are all questions that disabilities studies asks.”
Working group member and professor Sylvia Önder said the group is confident that interested students will also engage in some form of community-based learning, particularly due to their access to D.C. institutions.
“We would have a list of placements where students could work in organizations and do the work that is intimately connected to disability studies but we weren’t going to make it a requirement of the minor,” Önder said. “We expect that most of our students would want to do community-based learning, which seems to be a natural fit with the topic.”
Belser emphasized that the minor would encourage students to engage with deeper questions about disability, such as its significance across time and cultures and the broader notions of social power.
“If we recognize that cultures develop a certain sense of what constitutes normal, disability is really those human experiences that fall outside the boundaries of the norm,” Belser said. “So, in many ways I think disability studies is the critical interrogation of this notion of normalcy and deviance.”
The active support of the student body was crucial in getting the minor approved, according to the members of the working group. Last spring, the Georgetown University Student Association ran an online petition in support of approving the minor, which garnered 618 signatures.
Former GUSA Accessibility Policy Chair Danielle Zamalin (NHS ’18) said that GUSA recognized the need to become more involved in supporting academic initiatives related to disability studies.
“GUSA has always co-sponsored the Disability Studies Lecture Series, and been part of important accessibility discussions on campus and throughout the campus-plan, but we knew we could do more in terms of student engagement on the academic side,” Zamalin wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The recognition of the field is important in light of the need to advance intellectual engagement with disability and promote greater tolerance than that displayed by current leaders, according to Zamalin.
“Our own president has mocked a disabled reporter. Let that register. The example of leadership that generations of young people will witness is a figure shrouded in ableism and simultaneously completely unlearned in Disability Studies,” Zamalin wrote.
“As an educational institution we are the country’s only resource to combat such prejudice and ignorance; we have the opportunity to teach. So the attainment of a minor, especially in this climate, is good. The fact that Georgetown students can train to make a difference in the larger world, that’s great.”

At first glance, Shon Hopwood appears to be a typical American and an average lawyer — he has a wife and two children, served in the U.S. Navy and earned his J.D. from the University of Washington Law School.
But Hopwood’s path to studying law is different from most. The incoming Georgetown University Law Center professor of criminal law began studying the law while serving 11 years in federal prison in Pekin, Ill., for a string of bank robberies he committed in his home state of Nebraska.
Hopwood cites immaturity and impulse control issues as the factors that led him to robbing banks when he was 22.
“I had no purpose in life. I woke up every day and had no idea what I wanted to do with life or even what I should be doing,” Hopwood said. “Then a bunch of other guys who were in similar circumstances to me, who had no purpose in life and drug and alcohol addiction, and you throw all of that together, along with depression, and the result was a bunch of us deciding to go rob these banks.”
Hopwood began teaching at Georgetown in 2015 as a graduate teaching fellow in GULC’s Appellate Litigation Clinic, while he pursued his Master of Laws degree.
Hopwood will teach criminal procedure to first-year law students in the coming fall semester, a choice he said was influenced by his time in prison.
Hopwood said he hopes this experience will aid him as he embarks on training future lawyers.
“It impacted me in that I saw injustices almost every single day, whether it was prison guards abusing prisoners or people that came into the system on nonviolent drug offenses that had been charged with possessing a handful of crack and received 20-year mandatory minimum sentences,” he said. “It didn’t make much sense that the federal prison system was just warehousing people and not providing them with any sort of job skills or life training and then kicking them out into the world and expecting a miracle to happen, which is why the recidivism rate is so high.”
Hopwood is a second-year fellow at the Appellate Litigation Clinic, where he guides third-year law students as they take on professional assignments from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Professor Erica Hashimoto has worked with Hopwood as co-director of the ALC.
“The amazing thing about Shon is that he is the perfect combination between really, really bright and a good lawyer, but also just a real human being,” Hashimoto said. “He’s very practical and nice and really good with the students and really good with the clients that we represent.”
During his sentence, Hopwood said he read law books in the prison library as an escape from the violence and grimness around him.
“Your movements and your entire personal liberty can be violated at any time by prison authorities or by physical attacks from other prisoners,” Hopwood said. “You have to remain vigilant at all times when you’re in a serious prison like I was. I found solace in the law and reading books and education. That sustained me throughout my time in prison.”
After teaching himself law for 18 months, Hopwood became a jailhouse lawyer, typing out two certiorari petitions to the United States Supreme Court on the prison typewriter. He argued for a judicial review of the inmates’ cases.
John Fellers, one of these inmates, had not been provided Miranda rights, constitutionally protected rights for inmates including freedom from self-incrimination, during his arrest, in violation of the Sixth Amendment.
Ultimately, the Supreme Court granted hearings to both of his petitions.
Hashimoto said the Supreme Court granting a certiorari petition — let alone that of a self-taught, federal inmate — is extremely rare.
“He had researched just as a lawyer would do and could present the issue in a way that the United States Supreme Court could understand it and understand why he was right,” Hashimoto said. “That’s pretty amazing for somebody who hadn’t at that point even graduated from college, let alone law school.”
Upon his release from prison in 2009, Hopwood said he struggled to find lasting employment. After working briefly as a telemarketer, he landed his first legal job at Cockle Printing in Omaha, Neb., where lawyers from all over the country filed briefs to the Supreme Court.
Following his wife’s urging, Hopwood returned to school, earning an undergraduate degree from Bellevue University in Nebraska, and a law degree from the University of Washington. Upon graduation, he worked multiple clerkships for well-known judges, and passed the bar examination in 2014. In 2015, he applied for a fellowship with the Georgetown Appellate Litigation Clinic.
Professor Steven Goldblatt, the clinic’s other co-director, said Hopwood’s analytical abilities set him apart from other applicants.
“My first impressions were that he was very interesting, very talented,” Goldblatt said. “It was clear to me that his analytical skills were off the charts. He has a knack and a talent with the law that he can be very creative, and it comes very naturally.”
Hashimoto said she is confident Hopwood will be an incredible professor.
“The students will learn so much from him, just as the clinic students have learned from him,” Hashimoto said. “They will certainly learn the basics of lawyering that they need from the classes he teaches, but they also will understand the ways in which law affects people. That’s one of the most important things that we can help our students understand when they’re in law school. When they go out and become practicing lawyers, law is not a game.”
Hopwood said the main lesson he hopes to impart on his future students is that the law has real-world consequences.
“Law is not just words on a page,” he said. “It impacts people sometimes for life. One wrong mistake can impact someone’s life forever. I would hope that they would see me as having a lot of passion towards criminal law and trying to make society better, and maybe that would inspire them to go into the same field.”

Three hundred members of the LGBTQ community and allies gathered at the ninth annual Lavender Graduation ceremony to celebrate the accomplishments of the class of 2017 in the Healey Family Student Center Great Room last night.
Organized by the LGBTQ Resource Center and the Tagliabue Initiative for LGBTQ Life, the celebration recognized 113 students from all undergraduate and graduate schools of Georgetown University. It featured speeches from Dean of Students and Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Dr. Jeanne Lord, University President John J. DeGioia, Fr. Michael A. Zampelli, S.J. (CAS ’82) and senior speaker Luke Brown (COL ’17).
Additional awards were presented to six students and one faculty member for their work surrounding the LGBTQ community, as well as to the center’s 10 undergraduate Out for Change fellows, who participated in a yearlong initiative to explore “queer masculinities.”
With standing room only and attendance by numerous staff and faculty, this year’s ceremony is an example of how LGBTQ initiatives on campus have grown since the first official Lavender Graduation in 2009, according to LGBTQ Resource Center Director Shiva Subbaraman.
Although students had been hosting their own ceremonies for many years before, Lavender Gradation has expanded in size and support every year it has been held, Subbaraman said.
“The most joyful thing about this has been the numbers and numbers of faculty and staff and other administrators who come out to show love and support for our students. It’s quite amazing. President DeGioia has come since 2012. It’s one ceremony he will not miss no matter what happens,” Subbaraman said in an interview with The Hoya.
DeGioia said Lavender Graduation is an important tradition to recognize the roles members of the LGBTQ community play on campus.
“Each of you has made your own unique and lasting contributions to our university. You’ve enlivened our mission with your passion and talents. You’ve enriched and strengthened our university in countless ways,” DeGioia said in his address to the graduates.
Zampelli, who was an executive producer of the Mask and Bauble Dramatic Society during his time at Georgetown, is the first Jesuit to speak at Lavender Graduation. He has done pastoral work with LGBTQ Catholics through the Catholic Association for Lesbian and Gay Ministry.
At the ceremony, Zampelli reflected on his experience at Georgetown when he faced the decision to stand with LGBTQ friends. He said his commitment to the LGBTQ community today was “born out of a failure.”
“Something deep inside pulled me toward the conversation in which people were laboring to understand more adequately a range of identities, sexual, religious, political. Something deep inside pulled me, and I did nothing,” Zampelli said.
The question of how to address silence surrounding issues of oppression was the theme of Brown’s reflection on his time at Georgetown. Brown opened his speech by recognizing that he was the fourth white cisgender male to address the audience during the event, and addressing that as a white cisgender male, his experience navigating identity issues at Georgetown has come with a significant amount of privilege.
“I have been welcomed here on the Hilltop in the fullness of my gay identity, yet I know not everyone can point to such a cookie-cutter, picture-perfect narrative as mine,” Brown said. “We, white people, men, cis people and other privileged identities especially, must remember that marginalization and oppression do not exist somewhere out in the world. Rather they work through us and in us, whether or not we acknowledge that fact.”
Lavender Graduation was held during the final week of classes, rather than closer to other commencement activities in mid-May, because many LGBTQ-identified students or allies are unable to celebrate their identities with their families, according to LGBTQ Resource Center Assistant Director Julian Haas.
“In response to that shame and guilt, this large ceremony of the entire campus community is really our way of saying, ‘We are proud of you despite what other things go on in our life. Because you are LGBTQ, we are proud of you’,” Haas said in an interview with The Hoya.
Brown expressed his pride and gratitude for the class of 2017 and recognized many of its accomplishments, including organizing around the sale of 272 slaves to settle Georgetown’s debt and demanding answers about Georgetown’s investment in prisons and occupied Palestine.
“You have turned a school into a home for me, and I think I can say this without exaggeration, thousands of other students,” Brown said. “You have showed me the person I one day hope to be.”

Amid recent criticism for its labor policies and a meltdown on the Red Line on Thursday morning, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority General Manager Paul Wiedefeld announced plans to implement a new business model to increase WMATA’s budget by $500 million per year and cut worker retirement benefits April 19.
The proposal calls for WMATA’s Capital Investment, the organization’s funding from local governments, to be available for use on a multi-year basis until Metro’s budget is stabilized, calling the current annual plan stifling for the organization. Local governments that use WMATA rail and bus services would also provide $500 million in extra funding each year.
WMATA has already announced fare hikes and reduced services beginning in July as part of Metro’s efforts to avoid a $1.1 billion budget deficit by 2020. In addition to the fare hikes, WMATA’s 2018 fiscal year budget of $3.1 billion proposes eliminating 14 low-traffic Metrobus lines, reducing service hours, cutting nearly 1,000 jobs and requesting additional funding from the local governments of the District, Virginia and Maryland.
The plan also proposes a sales tax for local jurisdictions to pay for the expanded funding, though each jurisdiction is free to raise the necessary funds in any way they choose.
Wiedefeld said the proposal is necessary for WMATA’s future because current operating expenses are nearly double what the organization gains in revenue.
“WMATA has completed a detailed analysis of the financial challenges it faces and practical requirements necessary to keep Metro safe, reliable and affordable,” Wiedefeld wrote in the plan.
Metro has faced a series of malfunctions and safety hazards on its rail service. Most recently, riders on the Red Line faced delays for several hours Thursday and evacuated following reports of smoke between the Metro Center and Farragut North stations.
The smoke was detected at approximately 7:30 a.m., according to WMATA spokesman Richard Jordan. Following protocol, trains in the affected area between Dupont Circle and Gallery Place were suspended and the fire department was notified. Metro service on the Red Line was restored at approximately 11 a.m., according to Metro.
The proposal also outlines methods of limiting WMATA’s operations costs, which includes limiting resources to WMATA employees, such as “strengthening management of absenteeism, overtime, and workers’ compensation;” reducing “reliance on overtime and prevent fatigue by staffing up key operating positions” and providing all new WMATA employees with 401K retirement benefit plans instead of the current pension plans primarily funded by Metro.
401K plans, on average, are largely funded by employees, as employer contributions are not required.
Wiedefeld said though the new plan may provide fewer resources to employees, addressing WMATA’s financial realities is critical.
“I think that the union, and all of our employees, need to understand the conditions we’re under,” Wiedefeld said in a press conference on April 20. “They may not agree with it, but that isn’t because I’m trying to do anything against them personally.”
Over the next ten years, WMATA is looking to raise a total of $15.5 billion dollars to renovate and maintain the Metrorail and Metrobus system for riders across the District, Virginia and Maryland.
Wiedefeld addressed this budget issue at a press conference Thursday afternoon, saying that Metro is taking steps to conduct preventative maintenance and update the system beginning July 1, with funding from his business proposal.
“The issues that we had this morning are ones that we’ve been clear about that are not going to disappear overnight. They were not made overnight and we have to continue to work through those. And that’s why we’ve requested and received the ability to get more hours into the system starting July 1,” Wiedefeld said.
Labor union leaders oppose the budget plan. Shortly after the announcement, WMATA leaders received nearly 500 absence requests for Friday from workers in the local Amalgamated Transit Union 689, which represents WMATA transit employees.
WMATA rejected all of the requests.
Though ATU Local 689 President Jackie Jeter said the organization is not planning a “sick-out,” or an organized event in which workers abstain from coming in to work, she emphasized that individuals are free to protest in whatever way they see fit.
“There is a possibility that members have taken it upon themselves to start following the directives that WMATA has given,” Jeter told The Washington Post. “Local 689 supports the actions of the members 100 percent. We support what they’re doing.”
However, Jeter was critical of WMATA leadership for not granting the absence requests, as workers are typically granted these requests so long as they are submitted three days before an absence.
“Will WMATA accept the responsibility of refusing a person who is legitimately sick from getting a doctor’s care Friday?” Jeter wrote in an email to Wiedefeld on Thursday.
A WMATA memorandum on the high volume of absence requests said employees who do not report to work on Friday will receive negative marks on their individual disciplinary records.
The critiques come amidst an already tense relationship between WMATA employees and its leadership.
After Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) introduced the WMATA Improvement Act of 2017 Feb. 16, which aims to grant Metro management greater power in reassigning workers and relying on outside contractors to complete the work typically completed by WMATA employees, ATU International President Lawrence Hanley called the plan heartless, cruel and “among the most outrageous proposals ever put forth by a Democratic member of Congress in recent memory.
The House Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law is currently reviewing this legislation.
“The bill holds hostage hundreds of millions of sorely-needed dollars from WMATA until our collective bargaining agreement is changed to allow the transit authority to ‘implement all necessary operational changes required’ and lower costs by outsourcing our work,” Hanley told WMATA management Monday.

When Shiv Jhangiani (MSB ’19) registered for a McDonough School of Business class last year billed as a course on entrepreneurship and venture capitalism, he did not expect he would end up a published author.
Jhangiani is one of 15 students whose books were published by New Degree Press after taking an McDonough School of Business course last semester, released his book, “1.3 Billion: A Football Revolution in the Making” to contribute to the development of football in India and launch his career in the sports industry in the Healey Family Student Center on Tuesday.
The 15 students had their books published after taking “Launching the Venture,” a course in the MSB that taught students how to launch their own businesses and write books on subjects about which they were most passionate.
Jhangiani presented his book at the annual Sant Jordi celebration, a Catalan celebration similar to Valentine’s Day, organized by the Spanish Department last Monday.
Since the release of his book, Jhangiani has launched his own sport advisory firm, Billion Dollar Food, a sports advisory company that aims to connect an interested party, whether a European football team, a worldwide brand or an individual investor, to Indian football.
Jhangiani said he has been passionate about football since he was young, when he aspired to being a professional football player. Serious knee injuries prevented his football career from materializing while young, but his passion for football and his homeland remains.
The book focuses on potential ways to develop football in India.
“The main parts to the book are where football is currently in India, where it needs to go, why the world needs Indian football and why India needs football,” Jhangiani said. “It looks at the issue from the outside: how European clubs, if they were to invest in Indian football, how they can do that, the different ways a big club can do it, a smaller club can do it and how that can impact Indian football.”
Jhangiani said his personal experience with football in India urged him to recognize the lack of development in the sport.
“I moved to India when I was 11, which is an age where you need to be playing football day in, day out if you want to be making it professionally. I found it really tough to find a place to play because there wasn’t a structure where the teams had youth clubs where people can come in to train everyday,” Jhangiani said.
Luck and the right connections enabled him to play at the right level, according to Jhangiani.
“I didn’t really get anything through the football system in India. I just got very lucky in the people that I met and was really in the right place in the right time and that is how I got my opportunity to move to France,” Jhangiani said. “I was given a trial by a football team in France through an agent who is Indian.”
Jhangiani said he wants to develop a more formal structure for Indian football players to access resources to play professionally.
“There isn’t a whole infrastructure. There isn’t a whole setup for it and that is what needs to be developed right now,” Jhangiani said.
Jhangiani said the lack of academic material on Indian football was a source of difficulty.
“There are literally no books on football in India so I just did not know where to start,” Jhangiani said. “There is not a lot of material about Indian football apart from news articles which have come up very, very recently.”
Jhangiani has partnered with multiple departments on campus to promote the recent launch of his book, including the French and Spanish language departments and entrepreneurship groups at Georgetown.
Catalan lecturer Laura Vilardell, who managed the Q&A section of his book presentation, said the intersection between Indian football and international football interested her.
“We need more books like Shiv’s book because I think it gives you an image not only of Indian football, but also how it compares to all other leagues in the world,” Vilardell said. “It will probably be the first of many books about Indian football because it is a topic that a lot of people are interested in.”
Vilardell said Jhangiani’s research about the Spanish soccer team F.C. Barcelona made his book presentation pertinent to the Spanish department.
“I thought we should do something with the department because he is interested in La Masia and F.C. Barcelona. He had done some interviews with people who are part of the directive leadership of Barca. This is a very interesting link because of the heavy football culture Spain has,” Vilardell said.
Jhangiani has also sought links with India Initiative, a student and faculty-organized effort at Georgetown to advance teaching and research about India and world affairs.
India Initiative student fellow Yash Johri (SFS ’17) said Jhangiani’s book launch came at an opportune time for Indian sports.
“[The book] comes at an opportune time as India prepares to host the [FIFA] U-17 Football World Cup. There is a tremendous push by the government and businesses to gain the footballing world’s attention; one hopes that Jhangiani’s work also gets attention and that he can jump onto the bandwagon of world football’s next revolution,” Johri said.
The U-17 Football World Cup is a competition for football players under 17 years of age.
So far, Jhangiani has sold over 100 e-books on pre-release through Amazon and is hoping to sell as many paperbacks as possible. He intends to pursue partnerships with consulting firms Deloitte and Credit Suisse to buy mass numbers of books.
Jhangiani said he wants to use his book to help him break into the sports management industry, setting himself apart from most of his MSB peers.
“I wanted to use the book to get my foot into the sports industry because it’s not an industry like banking or consulting where there is a path drawn out for you and you just follow it,” he said. “I want to prove to the world of sports why I deserve to have my place in that world. But I want to sell as many copies as possible to raise awareness about Indian football.”
