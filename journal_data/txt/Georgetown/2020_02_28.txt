Two minutes after Eric Trump (MSB ’06) and Charlie Kirk, executive director of Turning Point USA, began addressing Lohrfink Auditorium, about 40 students dressed in bright orange shirts that read “Unstoppable, Undeniable, Undocumented, Unafraid, #HomeIsHere” walked out.
Members of Hoyas for Immigrant Rights organized the Feb. 25 walkout to oppose “A Conversation with Eric Trump and Charlie Kirk,” a talk sponsored by Georgetown University College Republicans and The Georgetown Review. Trump and Kirk reflected on U.S. President Donald Trump’s term in office and made their projections for the 2020 election at the event.
HFIR co-President Sofia Negrete-Retamales (COL ’23) personally participated in the silent walkout to take a stance against people who espouse offensive rhetoric, she said. 
“I felt empowered as I knew that I was peacefully demonstrating my stance and making a statement about how I do not wish to hear hateful speech in my campus,” Negrete-Retamales wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUCR invited other political organizations on campus to attend the event, according to GUCR President Henry Dai (SFS ’22) (Full disclosure: Dai previously served as a sports writer for The Hoya). The protests did not distract the audience from the main goal of the event — to engage in bipartisan discussions on Georgetown University’s campus — he said. 
“The protests were insignificant and 30-seconds long,” Dai wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We had an entertaining hour of ideas and questions, and it was truly a lot of fun.”
As the student activists were exiting the auditorium, Kirk insulted the quality of their protest. Trump then told the remaining audience members that the way they present themselves during protests will influence the effects of their advocacy. 
“When you see people dressed in orange jumpsuits like they came out of prison, no one is ever going to take them seriously. And then you look at all of you in here. Look how well you’re dressed,” Trump said. “The lesson in life here is, if you want to be taken seriously, act like a serious person.”
Trump’s reaction to the protesters, specifically his comment comparing activists and prisoners, offended students who left the room, according to Negrete-Retamales, who did not speak on behalf of HFIR. 
“Regardless of how it is claimed for this event to have an open space for fruitful bipartisan discussion, it is clear that this was not the case, as the speakers spoke directly against us in an offensive manner as we walked out,” Negrete-Retamales wrote.
TPUSA, a conservative advocacy organization founded by Kirk that touts its close relationship with the Trump family, has faced allegations of racism, according to The New Yorker. The organization has garnered support from people who are Islamophobic as well as some white supremacists, according to the Anti-Defamation League. 
Georgetown University College Democrats released a statement on their website Feb. 24 calling for students to boycott the event, which H*yas for Choice, Georgetown University American Civil Liberties Union, GU Pride, Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and March for Our Lives Georgetown signed onto. Members of GUCD passed out the statement to students waiting in line for the event. 
GUCR responded to GUCD’s statement with a counter statement Feb. 24, defending the event as an important forum for freedom of speech and diversity of thought. 
GUCD students boycotted the event in an effort to show their disapproval of TPUSA’s offensive sentiments, GUCD Chair AJ Williamson (COL ’21) said. 
“We don’t want to legitimize those behaviors by attending an event with these speakers, and we don’t think that folks who disagree with the sentiments espoused by Turning Point USA should want to attend the event either,” Williamson said in an interview with The Hoya. 
During the event, Eric Trump and Kirk cited the United States’ recent transition to becoming an energy-independent country as one of the largest successes of Donald Trump’s administration. 
Georgetown University announced Feb. 6 that it will divest its endowment from fossil fuel investments within the next decade. At the event, Kirk opposed Georgetown’s decision, saying that fossil fuel companies have propelled the United States to become the world’s leading producer of natural gas.
“That’s thanks to allowing, which I know this university is so unbelievably misguided on, fossil fuel companies to frack and use energy that we have at our disposal with this amazing blessing from God so that we don’t have to buy our oil and natural gas from medieval theocratic dictatorships halfway across the world, so thank you President Trump for embracing liquid natural gas,” Kirk said. 
While he called out democratic politicians for what he deemed partisan political tactics, Trump called for open dialogue between Democrats and Republicans. He specifically mentioned Patrick Milito (MSB ’23), a student who was dressed in full senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) paraphernalia.  
“I mean, with the Bernie guys over there, we could sit down over a beer at The Tombs, and I guarantee you when you really flush out an issue, when you actually take away the labels of the politics and all of the nonsense, 80% of things we probably see eye-to-eye on,” Trump said.
Milito hoped to engage in productive conversation by sitting toward the front of the auditorium. Trump and Kirk directed comments about socialism toward him throughout the event, he said. The attention from the speakers was unexpected, according to Milito.
“To me, it was incredible how he offered a 19-year-old college student to get a beer with him — son of a president,” Milito said in an interview with The Hoya. “That was incredible. And how he strongmanned my personal politics a lot, made a lot of insults to me, but then said, quote, ‘Your hair is way too good to be a communist.’ My life is very surreal.”
Looking toward the next election, Trump said the economy will be the most important issue for voters. Donald Trump is primarily focused on economic policy over identity politics, according to Eric Trump. 
“A lot of things get thrown around, a lot of racial stuff, a lot of other things get thrown around when it comes to identity politics,” Trump said. “I always say my father sees one color, and that’s green.”

Dear Sophie,
This isn’t a truthful portrayal of what occurred. While the protest as a whole was peaceful, there was at least one participant (a female student) engaging in an obscene gesture by offering her middle finger to Trump.
Regarding the  student that said he was offended by being offered a beer. This student, if not his friend that was sitting next to him, actually screamed out “I’m down” as in “I’m down to have a beer with you” when asked the question. 
I do not condone underage drinking but I just wanted to inform you of the facts.
Thank you,
John

This article discusses sexual assault on campus. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The Black Survivors Coalition has launched a #GeorgetownDoesntCare campaign in protest of Georgetown University’s failure to meet demands to better support Black women and nonbinary survivors of sexual assault.
At a BSC rally Feb. 21, students gathered in Red Square before marching toward the office of University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95). Many of the students carried signs and chanted protests.
“No more silence, no more violence,” the protesters chanted.
Three days later, BSC, along with other student groups, returned to Healy Hall and staged a sit in outside DeGioia’s office. The group has staged sit-ins from 9 a.m. to 12 a.m. every day since Feb. 24 to continue to call for the university to establish more resources for Black women and nonbinary survivors.
The protests come after BSC delivered a statement to the Office of the President on Jan. 27. The statement outlined a list of 10 demands, which included hiring more Black clinicians, improving the Women’s Center’s capacity for supporting sexual assault survivors and requiring all faculty and staff to undergo mandatory diversity, bias and bystander trainings. The statement also requested the university publicly respond to the demands by Jan. 31.
After BSC released its demands, the university issued a public statement on its website affirming Georgetown’s commitment to making sure campus programs and services respond to the needs of all students.
The university also sent emails directly to several board members of Black student organizations on campus Jan. 31 affirming the university’s commitment to promoting equity on campus, according to one of BSC’s organizers for the #GeorgetownDoesntCare campaign Kayla Friedland (SFS ’22). The university did not email BSC directly, however, despite being given the contact information for the group, according to Friedland.
BSC then released another statement criticizing the university’s response, because it never mentioned or addressed BSC’s demands.
The protest and sit-ins are necessary to force the university to take meaningful action regarding the needs of Black women and nonbinary survivors of sexual assault, according to Makayla Jeffries (COL ’23), one of BSC’s organizers for the #GeorgetownDoesntCare campaign.
“Let me just clarify — we don’t want to be out here sitting in the president’s office,” Jeffries said. “All of this is because it needs to be done. It’s been very clear with the bureaucratic measures or whatever polite measures people have taken to make changes, and this university hasn’t responded.”
Students have voiced concerns about the issues referenced in BSC’s statement for years. Despite these consistent demands, however, the university has still yet to adequately fulfill student needs, according to Vice President of H*yas for Choice Chad Gasman (COL ’20).
“We’ve given them exactly everything that they need to make our lives better, and they’ve shown time and time again that they’re not willing to do it because it’s too much money, or they didn’t have enough time to do it,” Gasman said. “But really, these are easy asks that can improve everyone’s lives, and they just refuse to do the simple task of getting them done.”
The university responded to the recent Healy sit-ins in a Feb. 26 email to the student body from Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Rosemary Kilkenny (LAW ’87) and Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson.
The email described how the university has responded or is planning on responding to each of BSC’s demands. In regard to the demand for more Black clinicians, the university highlighted Counseling and Psychiatric Services’ recent hiring of three new clinicians for the 2020 fall semester, two of whom are Black women, according to the email.
The university’s supposed progress in meeting BSC’s demands is not enough, according to BSC member Nile Blass (COL ’22).
“It was simply a reiteration of what was already discussed in this activist space,” Blass said. “As long as our demands aren’t met sufficiently and with relevant, tangible commitments that we know are going to go through, then we’re going to be here.”
During the Feb. 25 sit-in, BSC met with several university administrators and officials, including with CAPS Director Phil Meilman to discuss increasing mental health resources and with Georgetown University Police Department Chief of Police Jay Gruber, according to a Feb. 25 BSC Instagram story.
The university hopes to further the dialogue on the concerns BSC and other student groups have brought up through the #GeorgetownDoesntCare movement, according to a university spokesperson.
“Georgetown University takes seriously the concerns of student survivors and we are committed to learning more about their experiences both at Georgetown and outside of the university,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are committed to continuing to improve our resources so they meet the needs of all students, and work to be responsive when our campus resources fall short.”
One BSC demand that is especially pressing is the need to establish comprehensive crisis response resources that are survivor-centered and trauma-informed, given Georgetown’s high rates of sexual assault, according to Georgetown University Student Association President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20), who attended the protest and also helped organize the #GeorgetownDoesntCare campaign.
“Mental health resources across campus, or resources for survivors of sexual assault, are just slim to none, and also folks don’t even trust them enough to engage with them,” Francis said. “It’s a very sorry state that we’re in right now, just the fact that our rates of sexual assault for undergraduates is higher than other universities is appalling.”
Among Georgetown undergraduates, 31.3% of transgender, genderqueer or nonbinary, questioning, or not listed students reported experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force or inability to consent, which is higher than the 20.3% average reported by the Association of American Universities, according to the 2019 Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct. This statistic was cited in BSC’s original statement.
The university fails to provide adequate support and resources for survivors, according to Eric Perez (COL ’23), who also attended the protest.
“When you are attacked on this campus, you are expected to be your own therapist, your own doctor, your own caretaker, and also a full-time student at the same time,” Perez said. “Under a system with adequate resources that just would not be the case.”
Resources: On-campus confidential resources include Health Education Services (202-687-8949) and Counseling and Psychiatric Services (202-687-6985); additional off-campus resources include the D.C. Rape Crisis Center (202-333-7273) and the D.C. Forensic Nurse Examiner Washington Hospital Center (1-844-443-5732). If you or anyone you know would like to receive a sexual assault forensic examination or other medical care — including emergency contraception — call the Network for Victim Recovery of D.C. (202-742-1727). To report sexual misconduct, you can contact Georgetown’s Title IX coordinator (202-687-9183) or file an online report here. Emergency contraception is available at the CVS located at 1403 Wisconsin Ave. NW and through H*yas for Choice. For more information, visit sexualassault.georgetown.edu.

Georgetown University temporarily suspended all study abroad programs at the Villa Le Balze in Florence, Italy, after the university announced a suspension of all university-related travel to South Korea on Tuesday over concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised the advisory levels for Japan and Italy to Level 2 on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23, recommending travelers practice enhanced precautions when traveling to these countries. University programs in Japan, however, have not been suspended. The CDC also elevated the advisory level for South Korea to Level 3 on Feb. 24, advising travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to the country. 
The decision to cancel study abroad programs depends on the local conditions and development of the coronavirus, also called COVID-19, which Georgetown continues to monitor, according to a university spokesperson.
“The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak raises a number of considerations both in terms of health and safety, and also practical operational considerations with respect to the ability to most successfully support students abroad,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Because local conditions, support from on-ground partners, and travel restrictions vary by country, and by program, the university reviews these decisions on a program-by-program basis, after careful consideration of all relevant factors.”
The university is currently working individually with students in affected programs to coordinate travel efforts and create alternative plans as necessary, according to the university spokesperson.
Professors will implement instructional continuity plans for students in programs at the Villa Le Balze beginning March 9, according to the university spokesperson. Under the plans, students will still complete the required coursework from their semesters after being relocated from Italy. 
Currently, the university has only announced the cancellation of the spring semester at the Villa Le Balze, a Georgetown-owned academic campus. Planned courses over the summer are currently still set to take place, according to journalism professor Ann Oldenburg (GRD ’20).
“I’m set to teach a new class, International Journalism: Reporting from Florence, this summer at the villa,” Oldenburg wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As of now, it’s still on, and I hope the students who have signed up will still want to join me there.”
Despite the Villa Le Balze cancellation, other study abroad programs in Italy have not been canceled yet, including all programs through the Institute for the International Education of Students, Brown University, Middlebury College and Duke University.
While the cancellation is unfortunate, it is a necessary step by the university to ensure the safety of students, according to Oldenburg.
“I was sad to hear that the Villa had to be shut down for this semester, but it seems a prudent move by the university,” Oldenburg wrote. “I just hope a cure will be found quickly and the spreading of the virus will soon be stopped.”
The suspension of the programs comes after the university canceled all study abroad programs in China on Jan. 28 during the initial outbreak of the coronavirus. Before the university announcement, several programs independently made the decision to cancel their programs over fear of the spread of the disease. A university-sponsored trip to Cambodia will also be postponed until after the spring semester. 
More than 80,000 people in 48 countries and territories have been infected with the coronavirus since the initial outbreak, and nearly 3,000 have died, according to CNN. Of the reported cases, over 78,000 have been from China, with around 2,700 deaths in the country. 
South Korea has reported more than 2,000 cases of the virus, the largest outbreak outside of China, according to CBS News.
The university is working with students, faculty and administrators in South Korea programs to coordinate travel home,  according to a Feb. 25 universitywide email from Provost Robert Groves announcing the suspension. Given the developing situation regarding the outbreak of the virus, the university will continue to assess university programs as news breaks, Groves wrote in the email.
“The uncertainties surrounding the coronavirus have made travel to countries with extensive interactions with locations severely affected by COVID-19 more risky,” Groves wrote. “While Georgetown has not prohibited university-sponsored or related international travel to any country other than China and South Korea due to COVID-19, the situation continues to be very fluid.”

Georgetown University launched its first cultural climate survey Monday to assess students’ perceptions of diversity and inclusion on campus.
The survey, which was created by the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity & Affirmative Action, is open to both undergraduate and graduate students and will run from Feb. 24 to March 24. The survey will ask students questions about effective professor-student relationships, support for cultural communities on campus and the interactions with law enforcement, among others.  
Administrators sent out the survey universitywide email. Student are also prompted by a reminder in Canvas, Georgetown’s academic management system, to refer to their personalized survey link, which they received in an email from University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95). 
The responses to the questions will help the university ascertain how to provide resources to meet students’ needs, according to a Feb. 19 schoolwide email announcement from Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Rosemary Kilkenny (LAW ’87). 
“Data will help inform how we can enhance or build meaningful programs and support systems to ensure an inclusive educational experience for all members of our community, so that every student can flourish at Georgetown,” Kilkenny wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will be asking about diversity and identity across various dimensions, including race, ethnicity, faith, sexuality, ability, gender and other backgrounds.”
The university initiated discussions regarding the survey beginning in March 2019. Questions for the survey were drafted by administration officials and then assessed by a statistician to ensure they were unbiased.
Georgetown University Student Association Senator Leo Teixeira (COL ’20) said that while giving students the platform to express their experiences at Georgetown is a positive step for the university, administrators must continue to work toward adequately supporting marginalized communities on campus. Teixeira is also a member of the Georgetown Latinx Leadership Forum, the Georgetown University Black Leadership Forum, Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and O Clube Brasileiro de Georgetown, a Brazilian student organization. 
“As a member of these organizations, I strongly believe that this climate survey is necessary,” Teixeira wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s clear that, as a predominantly white institution where a large portion of students come from affluent backgrounds, Georgetown still has a long way to go in terms of properly supporting students of all cultural backgrounds, and especially those belonging to marginalized communities.”
The Georgetown University Student Association created the Cultural Climate Survey Student Advisory Committee in May 2019 to work alongside the administration and staff to ensure the survey had student input. The committee began meetings in summer 2019 and started its work during the 2019 fall semester as the survey developed.
Through the committee’s work, members were able to better represent student voices in the survey, according to GUSA Senator Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22).
“All of us collaborated in the form of weekly meetings with administration on reviewing the already established questions and adding Georgetown specific questions,” Sanchez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We helped shape the survey to truly reflect the Georgetown experience, as we provided the perspective of the students.”
The GUSA Senate faced internal disagreements about what questions to include in the Cultural Climate Survey and how they should be phrased, particularly surrounding law enforcement that would accurately characterize student experiences, according to former GUSA Senator Alexandra Mucher (COL ’22).
In October 2019, GUSA circulated a petition, which 160 students and 10 student organizations signed, to suggest questions in the survey about intersectional identities and policing on and off campus. The committee ultimately received approval from the administration to add the proposed questions. 
The petition was a necessary tool for the administration to consider student suggestions after students’ proposed questions faced pushback from administration, according to Uju Nwaigwe (COL ’20), the chair of the GUSA Racial and Cultural Inclusivity Policy Team.
“We ultimately had to create a petition in order for them to take our matters seriously. I also think that we had competing views on the survey,” Nwaigwe wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think administration wanted the survey to show how ‘great’ Georgetown is with diversity and the students, like myself, wanted the survey to show how bad Georgetown is with diversity.”
Other colleges and universities in the United States have administered similar campus cultural surveys to students in the past. In 2016, the University of Michigan administered its Campus Climate Survey on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Case Western Reserve University launched its survey in 2011.
Georgetown has administered similar schoolwide surveys in the past, including the inaugural Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct in 2016 and the follow-up survey in 2019. While the participation rate for the first survey was 51%, the second saw a decline in participation to roughly 40%. 
The new cultural climate survey will help students, faculty and administrators create a stronger community on campus, according to a Feb. 24 schoolwide email from University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
“As a community, we are at our best when we are able to work together to create and sustain an environment where each member of our community can thrive,” DeGioia wrote. “I wish to express my gratitude for your commitment to fostering a culture of care for all members of our community as we engage in professional and academic pursuits and in the work of personal formation.”
Georgetown’s Office of Assessment and Decision Support, which leads university data collection and analysis, will review the survey data and share the results with the entire university community including students, faculty, administration and planning committees in fall 2020, according to Kilkenny.
“The university is prepared to acknowledge both positive and critical comments about our community, and intends to collaborate with students and colleagues to enhance the educational and co-curricular experiences of all students,” Kilkenny wrote. “We want to hear from all segments of our student community — all voices are important to shape the full picture of our environment on campus.”
This article has been updated Feb. 26 to clarify where students can access the survey.

All criminal charges against Georgetown University Graduate Student Government President Lewis May were dropped Feb. 26.
GradGov Vice President Heerak Kim filed a Feb. 4 police report accusing May of physically assaulting him. On Wednesday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia reviewed Kim’s police report and decided no charges would be filed. The same day the charges were dismissed, the District of Columbia Superior Court also denied Kim’s preliminary injunction request for a long-term restraining order against his GradGov colleague, according to court documents. 
The decision is the latest chapter of a monthlong saga surrounding Kim’s fallout with GradGov. GradGov initiated impeachment proceedings against Kim on Feb. 9 after the organization deemed a number of tweets posted on Kim’s public Twitter as homophobic, antisemitic, Islamophobic and racist.
Kim claims that May physically confronted him outside of a Jan. 30 GradGov Senate meeting shortly after the tweets surfaced. Kim attempted to get a temporary restraining order against May following the alleged physical altercation. A District of Columbia Superior Court judge, however, denied Kim’s request Feb. 12.
Kim’s attempt to seek a restraining order against May, a second-year graduate student in the School of Foreign Service, represented an abuse of the law, according to May’s lawyer, Joseph Scrofano. 
“We do not have any comment at this time other than to again reiterate that Mr. Kim is abusing the legal system with false allegations,” Scrofano wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This afternoon another judge in the District of Columbia Superior Court denied Mr. Kim’s request for an injunction in the frivolous case he filed.”
Kim mischaracterized the severity of the interaction, according to May. 
“Apparently at one point in the conversation I, like, booped him in the chest, sort of for emphasis, and he was like, ‘Oh, you physically assaulted me,’ and then called for my resignation,” May said in an interview with The Hoya on Feb. 4.
Although Kim’s initial request for a restraining order was denied, the D.C. Superior Court decided to schedule a preliminary injunction hearing for Feb. 26 to consider imposing a long term restraining order against May, according to Kim.
Before his preliminary injunction hearing, Kim filed an official complaint with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel of the District of Columbia Bar on Feb. 24, accusing Georgetown University Counsel Paul Greco of preventing witnesses from testifying at the hearing. 
Kim alleged that Greco’s office prevented the Georgetown University Police Department from serving witness subpoena papers to graduate students and faculty who witnessed May’s alleged assault of Kim in late January, according to Kim’s complaint to the D.C. Bar. 
The university was attempting to cover up the assault charges against May, according to Kim.
“It appears that Georgetown University is [trying] to cover up for GradGov President Lewis May physically assaulting me in public, since the witnesses would tell the truth of the physical assault under oath at the Preliminary Injunction Hearing,” Kim wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The university has acted in accordance with the appropriate legal procedures, according to a university spokesperson. 
“While Georgetown does not comment on individual cases, the University has robust policies and procedures in place prohibiting any form of discrimination or related retaliation,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya on behalf of the general counsel and Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action office. “The Office of General Counsel conducts its work in accordance with the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct.” 
The complaint filed against Greco comes after Kim submitted a bias complaint to the university’s IDEAA Office on Feb. 10, accusing May and GradGov Supervisor Owen Agho of retaliating against him for his political and religious affiliations. Kim specifically charged Agho with ignoring his complaint about May’s alleged assault. 
Kim, a second-year master’s student in the School of Nursing and Health Studies, hopes the IDEAA complaint will protect other Christian and conservative students against the discrimination he alleges, Kim wrote. 
“The outcome that I would like to achieve through IDEAA complaint filing is to protect conservative evangelical Christians and practicing Catholics at Georgetown University from discriminatory actions based on their religion, such as being targeted for resignation from positions or by liberal professors giving bad grades to conservative Christian students or denying conservative Christians of scholarship and other promotion opportunities within Georgetown University,” Kim wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
GradGov originally scheduled Kim’s impeachment hearing for Feb. 20. However, GradGov was forced to postpone the hearing because of the pending IDEAA complaint, according to a Feb. 20 email from the GradGov Executive Board to GradGov senators obtained by The Hoya. 
GradGov then scheduled the hearing for the following week, but the university demanded that the hearing be postponed until the IDEAA office completed its investigation of Kim’s bias complaint, according to GradGov Director of Advocacy Henry Watson. 
“We are being told by the university not to hold the vote, and that if we were to do so, GradGov would be in violation of university policy. This because our group must cooperate with the current IDEAA investigation, which means not taking further action that could be seen as compounding the claimed retaliation before IDEAA has a chance to investigate it,” Watson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As an Executive Board, we cannot breach university policy, and so the impeachment vote will not be held until further notice.”

This headline is extremely irresponsible. The charges were based on a frivolous police report made by a notorious fraudster and bigot who is gratuitously litigious. Mr. May is a victim here, and in no way deserves to be associated with designations like “criminal.” Editors, be a little self-aware about how you frame a piece of reporting like this.

Georgetown University Law Center and gun-safety advocate Andy Parker filed a complaint alleging YouTube illegally deceives consumers by allowing violent murder videos to endure on its platform.
The complaint, which was filed with the Federal Trade Commission on Feb. 20, is the first of its kind to challenge the spread of videos that depict murder and proliferate conspiracy theories against victims of gun violence on YouTube, according to a Law Center press release.
In August 2015, Parker’s daughter, Alison Parker, a reporter in Roanoke, Va., was shot to death along with her cameraman, Adam Ward, while conducting a live television interview. YouTube videos display footage that Ward’s camera caught of the shooting, as well as the GoPro the shooter was wearing. 
Parker has been trying to get YouTube to remove the videos for years, but his requests have been largely ignored and rejected by both YouTube and its parent company Google, he wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“The two co-founders of Google started with a mission statement—’Don’t be Evil,’” Parker wrote. “But for all the good Google has done, they are in fact perpetrating evil every day they let videos of my daughter stay on their platform.”
The content has reappeared on YouTube since it was originally posted to the website, according to Rachel Guy (LAW ’21), one of two student attorneys representing Parker as part of the Civil Rights Clinic, which works with clients facing discrimination or constitutional rights infringements, among other issues. 
“Both of these sources of footage were uploaded to YouTube on the same day that Alison died, and since then, iterations of these videos have proliferated on the site—some add music and other effects,” Guy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Andy, understandably cannot watch these videos, but hates knowing that people are getting sick entertainment from his daughter’s death and that the site is profiting from them.”
After learning about YouTube’s lack of action to Parker’s requests, the Civil Rights Clinic decided to file the complaint with the FTC, according to Guy.
“The more the Clinic learned about YouTube’s responses to Andy and to other users, and families of victims, the more it became obvious that this type of behavior constituted illegal consumer deception,” Guy wrote. “Because of how widespread this problem is, we felt that FTC investigation and potential penalty is the best way to ensure that YouTube changes this behavior entirely, rather than simply addressing specific videos.”
The complaint argues that the easily accessible videos depicting Parker’s death on YouTube violate the company’s Terms of Service. The videos thus indicate that Youtube is deceiving consumers about the platform’s safety, according to the complaint. 
“YouTube violates its Terms by hosting videos that graphically depict people being murdered, capitalizing on their final moments for pure shock value and entertainment,” the complaint reads. “The platform’s Terms of Service proclaim that violent content is not allowed, leading users to reasonably believe that they will not encounter it. In reality, these videos are commonplace on the platform, and many of them have remained there for several years.”
YouTube does not allow content that encourages illegal or dangerous activities that could risk serious physical harm or death, according to its harmful or dangerous content policy. In the policy, YouTube asks users to report content that they think would violate the policy. YouTube had removed thousands of copies of the video of Parker’s shooting since her death in 2015, according to a YouTube statement in The Washington Post. 
YouTube enforces its policies on violent content with an aim of protecting users, according to the statement.  
“Our Community Guidelines are designed to protect the YouTube community, including those affected by tragedies,” the statement read. “We specifically prohibit videos that aim to shock with violence, or accuse victims of public violent events of being part of a hoax. We rigorously enforce these policies using a combination of machine learning technology and human review.”
By filing the complaint, the Law Center hopes to push YouTube to take down videos like those of Parker’s dauther’s death so that people like Parker do not have to watch the death of their loved ones, according to Guy.
“Our primary goal has always been to get these videos taken down [and] end the torment that Andy experiences every day in knowing that they are on YouTube,” Guy wrote. “The FTC Complaint has the benefit of being able to end this same torment for all families in the same place.”
The issues that the Law Center and Parker raised in the complaint about videos of Parker’s daughter extend to help all victims of gun violence and their families, Parker wrote.
“This action today is for all the families and survivors—from Sandy Hook to Parkland, and countless others who’ve been victimized,” Parker wrote. “The days of Google’s inexcusable and unlawful conduct– enabling, promoting and profiting from heinous content must end.”

Former Georgetown University student and South Korean pop artist Kim Sang-woo (COL ’19), popularly known as Roy Kim, has been cleared of charges of circulating obscene materials.
Kim had been a suspected member of one of singer Jung Joon-Young’s mobile chat rooms, in which group members shared sexually explicit photographs of women. Kim was formally charged by the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency in April 2019 for violating Korean information and telecommunications law. After an investigation, the indictment against Kim was officially suspended Feb. 25, according to K-pop news agency Soompi.
The charges against Kim came amid a national scandal that implicated multiple prominent K-pop stars for their involvement in group chatrooms where they shared explicit videos of women and discussed raping and drugging women. Jung and former member of rock band FT Island Choi Jong-hoon were both convicted of gang rape in relation to the Jung chatroom scandal in November 2019, according to the South China Morning Post. Jung was also separately charged with filming and distributing footage of other assaults.
On Feb. 25, a reporter on a South Korean entertainment news show said that Kim was only a member of a chat room that specifically focused on the sport of fishing, according to Soompi.
In the fishing chatroom, Kim attempted to clarify to members of the group chat that a certain pornographic image was photoshopped, according to the reporter.
“There was an instance of a photoshopped pornographic image of a celebrity being shared in the chatroom. Roy Kim took a screenshot of a blog image and posted it saying, ‘This is not that person,’ and that is what he was charged for,” the reporter said on the news show, according to Soompi. “So Roy Kim had posted the photo, not for others to see, but to state that it was a photoshopped image, and that is what got him charged for spreading pornographic material.”
On the same day, Kim released a statement to his fans affirming the reporter’s narrative and expressing regret for his mistakes.
“I found the picture addressed in the stories on a blog post by looking it up on a portal site, screenshot it and sent it along with a text saying that the rumour wasn’t true into a chatroom,” Kim wrote in his statement. “I realised that regardless of my motive, it was wrong to send such a photo and I am reflecting on my mistake. I’m really sorry for hurting those who love me despite my reckless actions.”
Kim rose to fame on a South Korean music competition show called “Superstar K” in 2012 and reached the top of the K-Pop Hot 100 Chart with his debut single in 2013. While the investigation was pending, Kim went on an indefinite career hiatus and returned to South Korea a month before he was set to graduate from Georgetown. 
A Georgetown student circulated a Change.org petition in April 2019 calling for Kim to be suspended from the university and later expelled if he was convicted. The petition reached 4,726 signatures.
Kim missed the final month of school and was unable to attend his graduation ceremony. No disciplinary action was taken by the university at the time and Kim received his diploma, according to SPOTV News, a South Korean broadcast.
A university spokesperson confirmed that Kim graduated in 2019, but provided no further comment.
“We can confirm directory information and share that Roy Kim graduated in 2019,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Otherwise, Georgetown refrains from commenting on individual students in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).”
Kim appreciates his fans’ support throughout the investigation process and hopes to resume his career now that the charges have been dropped, according to the letter Kim wrote to his fans.
“I was able to look back at my past and realised how precious the love I received was even though I was lacking in many ways. I am thankful to the point where I can’t express it in words,” Kim wrote. “I will not disappoint those who have believed and waited for me. I will return as the Roy Kim who everyone loved and supported. I will be mindful from here on out.”

Georgetown University hosted a group of young performers to put on a musical that highlights the experiences of immigrant families in Poulton Hall Feb. 21.
The musical, titled “The Traveling Serialized Adventures of Kid Quixote,” featured 15 students aged 6 to 17 who translated and adapted the original Spanish version of “Don Quixote” into a bilingual story with Still Waters in a Storm, an afterschool program based in Brooklyn, New York. During the event, students used a mix of Spanish and English, prose and song, and fictional and nonfictional stories to convey their own interpretation of the classic novel.
The original story of “Don Quixote,” written by Miguel de Cervantes in the 17th century, is about a knight who comes across many obstacles while traveling through Spain to serve his nation. The story is both timeless and relatable, especially for Spanish-speaking students, and serves as an excellent learning tool for students who come from immigrant backgrounds, according to Chief of Still Waters in a Storm Stephen Haff.
“Like any great work of art it yields treasures and speaks truth across generations,” Haff wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I also like to present my students with projects that seem to be impossible, so that they learn that nothing is beyond them. The novel is common ground for us and for our audiences.”
Still Waters in a Storm was founded in 2009 to help students, especially those from low-income and immigrant backgrounds, practice reading, writing and acting in a safe environment, according to Haff.
“Our one rule is ‘Everyone listens to everyone,’ a simple algorithm for teaching and learning in which every person is considered equally important,” Haff wrote.
At the event, the students of Still Waters in a Storm read aloud an excerpt from a letter they received through correspondence with girls who had been separated from their families, according to Haff.
“We had a brief opportunity to correspond with a group of girls from Guatemala and Honduras who were separated from their families,” Haff wrote. “My students became attached to their long-distance friends and determined to tell their story wherever we go.”
The students use their performance to express and understand different perspectives on global issues, Haff wrote.
“They wish they could set the girls free, but all they can do is liberate their stories and try to inspire audiences to care about them,” Haff wrote. “Reading the letter is also in keeping with the novel Don Quixote, in the sense that it represents a multiplicity of narrative voice and a deliberate, metatheatrical awareness that the actors are storytellers.”
This musical adaptation of “Don Quixote” strives to incorporate the ideas of all the student performers, according to Kim Sherman, a composer at Still Waters in a Storm.
“Every choice in translation, dialogue writing and songwriting was made collectively,” Sherman said in an interview with The Hoya. “Every kid, no matter how young, had input, and no decisions were made without consensus of the group.”
The musical was co-sponsored by the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics, the Georgetown Humanities Initiative and the department of performing arts.
The success of the project can be seen through its impact on the students and families involved, according to Derek Goldman, professor of theater and performance studies and co-founding director of The Lab.
“It was wonderful – really inspiring and moving and many commented that it was palpable the huge impact this project has had on the lives of all the children and families participating, as well as on the perception of immigrant communities among audiences,” Goldman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Lab, founded in 2012, is the only joint initiative between the School of Foreign Service and Georgetown College created with a mission to harness the power of performance to humanize global politics, according to Goldman.
The musical is meant to both showcase the talent of its student performers and encourage greater understanding of the immigrant experience, according to Haff.
“I hope people who see the show can experience how brilliant these kids are, and by extension appreciate the genius of children in general,” Haff wrote. “I also hope they recognize that immigrants and refugees come to this country with much to give, not to take. The ultimate goal, on behalf of the kids and their families, is compassion.”

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate approved a resolution advocating for the creation of an online textbook program that would grant students free access to hundreds of textbooks during their weekly meeting. 
The program, called the Open Textbook Network, is a collection of peer-reviewed, openly licensed educational resources that are free for students to download. Over 600 colleges and universities use the program, saving students an estimated $8.5 million, according to the OTN website.
The resolution, introduced by Senator Joshua Marin-Mora (SFS ’21), passed unanimously at the Senate’s weekly meeting Feb. 23. The textbook policy constituted a central component of Marin-Mora’s executive candidacy platform in the election that he lost Feb. 6. 
The program would not eliminate all course material expenses as professors can still opt to not use the program and assign their own textbooks. Despite this option, the OTN program would significantly lower book costs for many students, according to Marin-Mora.
“This isn’t going to solve the issue completely, but this is another avenue, on top of book drives that happen around campus, to continue to attack the textbook affordability issue,” Marin-Mora said in an interview with The Hoya.
Students enrolled in four-year colleges spent an estimated average of $1,240 on books and course supplies for the academic year 2019-20, according to The College Board. Textbook prices have risen in recent years, with costs increasing by 88% between 2006 and 2016, placing a large burden on many low-income college students.
Rising coursebook costs make the program even more crucial to students struggling with other college expenses, according to Marin-Mora.
“This network is really important because textbook prices continue to rise,” Marin-Mora said. “I know plenty of students who struggled with textbook prices at the beginning of the semester.”
The free textbook network would primarily help students who come from low-income backgrounds or who are the first in their family to go to college, according to Georgetown Scholar Program member and first-generation college student Maddy Langan (COL ’23).
“Textbooks are something that unfortunately aren’t included in tuition, making it an added cost when arriving on campus,” Langan said in an interview with The Hoya.“Being first gen, I didn’t know the secrets of getting cheaper textbooks or how to navigate alternative options. Reducing the costs of textbooks would be an enormous help. College is expensive overall, but when you’re paying for it on your own, every dollar counts.”
The OTN program was adopted at American University in 2015 as a part of their greater “Open American” policy aimed at improving resource access and affordability. AU students have been able to save $603,694 on textbooks since the start of the program, according to the AU’s Assistant Vice President for Communications and Media Lisa Stark. 
Georgetown could achieve similar increasing affordability by adopting the OTN program, according to Marin-Mora.
“We’re seeing a peer institution right here in our neighborhood that is taking another step at saving costs for students and I think that Georgetown is also the perfect institution to be at the forefront of that conversation,” Marin-Mora said.
Georgetown faculty have autonomy to choose their own course materials. The GUSA resolution, however, will be discussed at the next Council of Associate Deans meeting, according to a university spokesman. 
Additionally, the Georgetown University Library recently joined the OTN through its membership in the Washington Research Library Consortium, which shares information resources among colleges in the DMV area, according to Harriette Hemmasi, dean of the library. The library staff is currently working to maximize student awareness and access to the program.
Despite the benefits to low income students, some students have opposed the implementation of a free textbook network. The program would limit the academic freedom of professors, according to Simeon Brockington (COL ’23), who has raised concern about the initiative. 
“I don’t think teachers should have to cater to students,” Brockington said in an interview with The Hoya. “If it’s a good textbook, teachers should use it regardless of the price.”
In response to such concerns, Marin-Mora said the network would still allow professors to have complete control over the resources they decide to use.
“I think one of the most important things is academic freedom, and teachers aren’t required to use open textbooks, but it provides an avenue if they want to use any that are already in the library or add to the library,” Marin-Mora said.
Resources within the network are available in a wide variety of formats, including textbooks, online quizzes, instructional modules, interactive simulations and video and audio files, according to American University’s website. Many AU professors have said the OTN program has increased academic freedom by providing them with new ways to customize their curriculums. 
Implementing the OTN would pave the way for more initiatives that aim to improve affordability at Georgetown, according to Marin-Mora.
“It would continue the conversation about how to make campus more affordable for students and would show that Georgetown is taking another step at leading, along with other institutions all over the country,” Marin-Mora said.

Former Georgetown University parent Michelle Janavs was sentenced Tuesday for conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, as well as money laundering, becoming the third former Georgetown parent sentenced in the college admissions scandal.
Janavs, whose father and uncle founded Hot Pockets, was sentenced to five months in prison and two years of supervised release and was ordered to pay a $250,000 fine. Janavs pleaded guilty to paying $400,000 to have her son Grant Janavs (COL ’21) admitted to Georgetown as an unqualified tennis recruit, according to an April 2019 indictment. 
Janavs also paid $200,000 to have one of her daughters admitted as a fake beach volleyball recruit to the University of Southern California. Janavs worked with Rick Singer, the ringleader of the national college admissions scandal, paying him $100,000 to provide a fraudulent test proctor for their ACT exams in 2017 and 2019. 
Prosecutors charged Janavs in April 2019, to which Janavs initially pleaded not guilty. In October 2019, Janavs and three other former Georgetown parents switched their pleas to guilty. Prosecutors then recommended Janavs be sentenced with 21 months in prison, three years of supervised release, 250 hours of community service and a $175,000 fine.
Prosecutors for the case alleged Janavs was one of the most culpable parents in the admissions scandal, citing her repeated efforts over multiple years to help her children gain acceptance into both Georgetown and USC, according to CNN.
Janavs’ lawyer did not respond to request for comment.
The charges come as part of the ongoing “Varsity Blues” college admissions scandal, a national college admissions investigation that has exposed alleged misconduct by parents who sought to improve their children’s college admissions chances. Janavs is one of five Georgetown parents charged in the scandal.
Janavs conspired with former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst to have her son admitted as a fake tennis recruit to the university. Ernst reportedly accepted over $2.7 million in bribes to help 12 applicants get falsely designated as tennis recruits for the university.
The university first discovered Ernst’s actions in 2017 and took appropriate measures to ensure the integrity of the future of athletic recruitment at Georgetown, according to a university spokesperson. 
“In 2017, Georgetown’s Admissions Office discovered irregularities in the athletic credentials of two students who were being recruited to play tennis. Neither student was admitted,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya in October. “Georgetown immediately put former coach Gordon Ernst on leave, initiated an internal investigation, established a new policy concerning the recruitment of student athletes, implemented audits to check whether recruited student athletes are on team rosters, and asked Mr. Ernst to resign.”
Janavs joins other former Georgetown parents Douglas Hodge and Stephen Semprevivo in being sentenced for their roles in the “Varsity Blues” college admissions scandal.
Hodge was given the longest sentence to date in the college admissions scandal Feb. 7 when a federal judge sentenced him to nine months in prison, two years of court supervision, 500 hours of community service as well as a $750,000 fine.
Hodge reportedly paid $325,000 to Ernst to get two of his children admitted to Georgetown as tennis recruits. Hodge additionally paid $525,000 in bribes to get two of his other children admitted to USC as football and soccer recruits. Hodge also unsuccessfully attempted to bribe coaches at Loyola Marymount University to have his fifth child admitted there.
Stephen Semprevivo was sentenced in September 2019 after being charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud in March 2019. Stephen Semprevivo reportedly paid Ernst $400,000 to have his son, Adam Semprevivo, admitted as a fake tennis recruit. (Full disclosure: Adam Semprevivo formerly served as a cartoonist for The Hoya.)
Stephen Semprevivo was ultimately sentenced to four months in prison, two years of supervised release and 500 hours of community service and was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. Georgetown formally dismissed Adam Semprevivo from the university and rescinded his admission in May 2019.Adam Semprevivo filed a lawsuit against the university after the announcement of his dismissal, claiming he was not aware of his father’s efforts to gain his admission to the university. Adam Semprevivo ultimately dismissed his lawsuit against the university.

The race, gender and ethnicity of residential students and community members will be excluded from the 2020 census as Georgetown University switches to a new online census reporting system, according to a university official.
The university will be able to report 100% of students living on campus through an online data collection system in April 2020. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, however, restricts the university from reporting the race, ethnicity or gender of students, according to a university official. 
Georgetown will compile census data for residential students and community members using a new Electronic Response Data Transfer, or eResponse, method for the first time this year. Administrators will input census data online on behalf of residential students and community members through the new system, according to a university official. 
The U.S. Census Bureau will not directly contact students in university-owned housing, which the bureau considers group quarters, the same category as jails and senior living homes, according to a 2020 census fact sheet co-authored by Cara Brumfield. Brumfield serves as a senior policy analyst at the Economic Security and Opportunity Initiative at the Georgetown University Law Center’s Center on Poverty and Inequality.
The USCB will instead communicate with university representatives, according to the fact sheet. 
When universities report census data on residential students, representatives have several options for how they count those students, according to the USCB. Universities can choose to report census data by allowing a census taker to drop off paper questionnaires for students to fill out. They can also choose to give a census taker permission to knock on doors to conduct the census or elect to compile data online using a secure portal, according to the USCB. 
In previous years, the university participated in a program in which students filled out a census form and delivered it to their residential assistants. Under this system, used by Georgetown in the 2010 census, roommates filled out forms together before turning them in to their RAs, according to a university official. 
Out of concerns that the previous system could make students feel uncomfortable, the university switched to an eResponse method for group quarters for the 2020 census, rather than having students self-report information, according to a university official.
Students also have the opportunity to request that additional directory information, such as home addresses, telephone numbers, and date and place of birth, be withheld from student directory information, according to a Jan. 23 universitywide email from Associate Vice President and University Registrar Annamarie Bianco. 
While students can withhold the release of directory information every academic year, students can also restrict the university from sharing their information with the USCB, according to a university official. 
Students can opt-in to filling out the census form themselves and include answers to questions about characteristics of their identity, according to Amy O’Hara, director of the Georgetown Federal Statistical Research Data Center.
“There is also an option for students to fill out individual forms, which would enable them to report their characteristics like race, Hispanic origin, and gender,” O’Hara wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These fields have always been restricted by FERPA, nothing changed this year in terms of the law or regulations.”
Data collected from the census is crucial to developments for Georgetown’s surrounding neighborhood, according to O’Hara. 
“Census data is critically important for understanding Georgetown’s local community, potentially involving the availability and use of rental housing, of transportation planning (bike share, ride share, parking, bus routes, shuttles), and the data are important to investors and entrepreneurs who offer services to the Georgetown community,” O’Hara wrote.
Unlike residential students, the university will not complete an eResponse for students living off campus. These students will self-report their race or ethnicity and gender on 2020 census enumerations, according to a university official. The census will also contact those students directly.
The university has not sent instructions to students living on or off campus for the upcoming census set for April 2020.
Georgetown students, whether they live in official campus housing or in off-campus residences, need to know how their data will be reported, according to Natalia Lopez (SFS ’22), secretary of D.C. Affairs for GUSA’s D.C. and Federal Relations Committee. 
“One of our major projects this semester is making sure that all students understand the importance of the census to not only the university but to our community as well,” Lopez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are working alongside the university with their advocacy efforts to make sure every student knows their responsibilities for the census, such as what forms they need to fill out if they are living off campus.”

Changing political dynamics like a rise in candidate-centered campaigns and a more engaged electorate will shape the 2020 presidential race, political experts said at a panel event Wednesday. 
The event, titled “Road to 2020,” was hosted by Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service and the Brunswick Group, a strategic consulting firm. At the event, panelists discussed strategies implemented by President Donald Trump and his campaign that ultimately led to his victory in the 2016 presidential election. 
The event comes as the Democratic primary contests for the 2020 presidential nomination have intensified. Most recently, the Democratic Party hosted its 10th scheduled debate in Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of the state’s primary election Feb. 29. Fourteen more states are set to hold their primaries March 3.
Trump succeeded as a presidential candidate because of his ability to increase his name recognition among U.S. citizens, according to panelist Michael Steele (LAW ’81), former chairman of the Republican National Committee. 
“Over the prior 15 years, he had a relationship with the American people, officially known as an audience. He built a brand; he built an identity that they latched onto and they liked,” Steele said. “He created this reality television identity presence and people were sucked into it. The essential thing Trump did was he took his viewers and made them voters.” 
Trump’s rhetoric and persona have dominated much of the national political discourse, according to panelist Amy Walter, national editor of The Cook Political Report.
“In the 2020 election, there is one thing that matters, and it’s Donald Trump,” Walter said. “It’s been the entire focus of the political ecosystem for the last four years and will continue to drive 2020.” 
Other panelists for the event included CNN political commentator Patti Solis Doyle, New York Times White House Correspondent Maggie Haberman, former governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe (LAW ’84) and former GU Politics fellow Jonathan Burks.
The shift in the political landscape over the last four years has also been accompanied by a change in voter demographics, according to Doyle.
“Politics has changed. I think the electorate has changed. I think it’s getting much younger; it’s getting much more diverse,” Doyle said. “The way we measure politics, the metrics by which we measure, that’s different. We can’t measure accurately anymore. The way we receive information has changed; the way we disseminate information has changed.” 
Through the rise of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, public participation in political discourse has increased, Haberman said. As individuals are now able to discuss and express their own opinions on large platforms, the media’s power to shape public opinion has decreased, according to Haberman. 
“The press is no longer the gatekeeper,” Haberman said. “We are just covering what’s in front of us and the voters are going to do what they’re going to do with it.” 
In presidential primaries, state delegates vote for the presidential candidate they want to represent them in the presidential election. So far, primaries and caucuses have taken place in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. 
While Trump leads the Republican primaries with 86 of the 87 delegates that have been allocated so far, voters and politicians have expressed uncertainty over who will become the Democratic presidential nominee after the results of the first three contests. Currently, there is a 51% chance that no candidate receives a majority of pledged delegates for the nomination, according to FiveThirtyEight’s Democratic primary probability model.
McAuliffe said he predicts the race will quickly pare down to a contest between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
“It’s hard for us right now to really go after Trump because everybody is trying to get delegates. I think a week from today we’re going to have a pretty clear idea,” McAuliffe said, “It’ll probably be down to a two-person race.”

Members of Georgetown University Riqueza Dominicana, a student-run Dominican cultural club, attended a protest near the White House on Sunday opposing the Dominican Republic’s recent suspension of nationwide municipal elections.
Protests first began in the Dominican Republic on Feb. 16 when the suspension began and were followed by similar protests in several major cities around the world, including Washington, D.C. The D.C. protest, which was organized via a Facebook page, took place near the White House at 2:30 p.m. Six members of Riqueza Dominicana attended the protest, which totaled over 150 attendees, according to Communications Director of Riqueza Dominicana Nicole Sanchez (SFS ’22).
Protests in the Dominican Republic began shortly after the government suspended nationwide municipal elections four hours after the start of the elections, when officials realized that many voters were unable to see complete ballots on the electronic voting machines, according to The New York Times. The voting machines were used in the capital, Santo Domingo, as well as 17 of the most populous of the Dominican Republic’s 158 municipalities, according to BBC News.
The glitch in the voting machines benefitted the current party in power, the Dominican Liberation Party, as many candidates from opposition parties were not listed on the incomplete ballots, according to Sanchez.
“The new voting system was only showing the current party in power, the Dominican Liberation Party—which has been in power for sixteen years. They are also the party that oversees the elections,” Sanchez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The PLD has not been transparent with this ‘glitch’ and has not publicized their plan to move forward.”
The goal of the D.C. protest was to demonstrate support for the people of the Dominican Republic who are currently fighting for a more transparent democracy and elections, according to Sanchez.
“Our objective is to show our support for those on the island who are being effected directly by the political corruption,” Sanchez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our organization is protesting to show that what we care about what happens in our homeland though we live thousands of miles away. Just because we no longer live there does not mean that we have forgotten about our people.”
This instance is not the first time the country has faced issues with its electronic voting system. After the Dominican Republic’s 2016 presidential election, the Central Electoral Board spent 13 days counting votes that were cast electronically. The protests in the Dominican Republic reflect a growing concern about protecting elections as electronic voting systems come under scrutiny around the world, as in the case of the recent e-voting system failure during the United States’ Iowa Democratic primary caucuses, according to the New York Times.
Students calling for better electoral procedure in the Dominican Republic augments broader efforts to unseat long-term corruption in the country, according to Leslie Rozon (NHS ’23), a member of Riqueza Dominicana who also attended the protest. 
“Dominican mentality has to change as well, because with corruption a lot of people usually get paid to vote for a specific party,” Rozon said. “Something that would also help is the voting of the youth in this country, many young people don’t vote, so their voices are overlooked.”
The protests surrounding the Dominican Republic’s election suspension displays the impact that protesters can have on political reform and applies to other countries in the region, according to Academic Director of the Center for Latin American Studies Angelo Santos.
“If young people are able to impact electoral reforms, they also have the challenge to continue monitoring the transparency of their elections through several means (not only through voting and protests, but by engaging in the political process),” Santos wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is true not only for the Dominican Republic, but for every other country in the region.”

The United States must reconcile with the darker parts of its history to confront current political and social issues, according to accomplished documentary filmmaker Ken Burns. 
Burns, famous for his multi-episodic documentary series, discussed his past and present projects with Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) on Feb. 27. His most recent documentary miniseries, “Country Music,” premiered on the Public Broadcasting Service in September 2019. The event, a discussion of immigration issues in the United States, touched on Burns’ lengthy career of curating U.S. history in his films. 
At the event, Burns discussed his new historical film project with PBS, UNUM, a reference to the motto of the United States, “e pluribus unum,” the Latin phrase for “out of many, one.” Hopefully, the new project will enrich conversations about the lasting significance of events in U.S. history, Burns said. 
“Every time we finish a film we can’t help but hear its resonance in the present,” Burns said. “I think that it’s the deepening of these conversations which I’m after and trying to celebrate in this new form of UNUM.”
UNUM compiles film clips about various events, people and topics throughout U.S. history in separate educational video series, according to the PBS website. Burns’ latest collaboration comes as the most recent step in a storied four-decade filmmaking career. His films and documentary series have been honored with dozens of major awards, including 15 Emmy Awards, two Grammy Awards and two Oscar nominations. 
A separate discussion with Burns and Georgetown College Dean Christopher Celenza was held earlier in the day in Riggs Library. 
Historians should tell U.S. history by including more diverse perspectives without deleting any community’s narratives, according to Burns. 
“We have to find a way to tell our stories, and for the longest time our stories have only been a white male narrative,” Burns said. “It has been presidential nominations punctuated by wars. That doesn’t work anymore, but you don’t throw that out; it’s still there. It coexists with all of the bottom-up stories and the million heroic acts.” 
Common themes run throughout U.S. history, but today’s issues are unlike anything the nation has seen before, according to Burns. 
“Things occur and reoccur. We are very fond of saying that history repeats itself; it does not. It’s not true. Mark Twain is supposed to have said ‘History doesn’t repeat itself, it rhymes,’” Burns said. “We are in a historical moment that is actually very different than previous generations and that actually goes beyond party or office.” 
The event, titled “Immigration: Views on Liberty,” took place in the Lohrfink Auditorium. DeGioia hosted the event alongside the Better Angels Society, a nonprofit organization educating the public about U.S. history. The discussion was followed by a panel with Georgetown professors.
The panel included professors Katherine Benton-Cohen, Richard Boyd, Ricardo Ortiz and Andrew Ian Schoenholtz, who joined Celenza to discuss current immigration policy in relation to the selected clips from Burns’ films. 
In his closing remarks, Burns said his films, which seek to tell the truth about the past, not only encompass stories about the United States but also describe the essence of the nation. 
“I’d like to say that the films that I have made have all been about the U.S., but they have also been about the corresponding two-letter lowercase plural pronoun: us,” Burns said.

The Whole Foods market in Glover Park will reopen after a three-year closure, following a legal battle between the store and its landlord.
Whole Foods and Wical Limited Partnership, the owner of the store’s space at 2323 Wisconsin Ave. NW, filed to settle the legal dispute in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Feb. 19. The settlement, for an undisclosed amount of money, allowed Whole Foods to move forward with planned renovations to their Glover Park location, which was previously prevented by a contract stipulation.
While the exact timeline of the renovation process is unclear, neighbors are eager for the store to reopen, according to Brian Turmail, chair of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3B, the local government body that represents the Glover Park neighborhood. 
“I have no idea how long it will take for Whole Foods to secure renovation permits, conduct their renovation and reopen,” Turmail wrote in an email to The Hoya. “From our point of view, the sooner, the better.”
The grocery chain is pleased to come back to Glover Park, according to a Whole Foods spokesperson. 
“We are thrilled to announce that Whole Foods Market will be returning to Glover Park. We will be completing a remodel of the store before reopening our doors, so stay tuned for more details on timing,” a Whole Foods spokesperson told DCist. “We look forward to returning to serving the community we’ve been part of for more than 20 years.”
The dispute between Whole Foods and Wical began in 2017 when a rat infestation led to two shutdowns of the grocery store by the D.C. Health in just two months. When the Washington, D.C. health department gave the store permission to reopen, management decided to keep the store closed to undergo remodeling, triggering the first complaint from Wical. 
The owners claimed this shutdown violated the terms of Whole Foods’s lease, which stipulated that the grocer could not shut down for more than sixty days. The planned renovation would have exceeded the 60-day limit. 
Whole Foods argued it was not in violation of its agreement by invoking a clause that would allow for a prolonged shutdown if there were extenuating circumstances beyond its control, such as “acts of god, strikes, lockouts, labor troubles, plan approval delay.” The store classified the two rat infestations that led to the original shutdown as an “act of god.” 
The validity of the argument that the rat infestations were an “act of god” was scheduled to be considered at a May 26 trial. The settlement reached by the parties, however, cancels the planned proceedings.
D.C. Health has shut down other Glover Park establishments for rat infestations in recent months. Cafe Romeo, a pizzeria and hookah bar, was shut down in September 2019 for rat infestation and structural issues. 
The reopening of Whole Foods’ Glover Park location will make grocery shopping more accessible to Georgetown students, according to Elise Gallentine (COL ’23). 
“I am excited because I think it will be a more direct walk through Georgetown, because the one in Foggy Bottom is a little bit hard to get to sometimes,” Gallentine said in an interview with The Hoya. 
A Trader Joe’s store opened in Glover Park at 2101 Wisconsin Ave. NW in July 2019, giving the neighborhood’s residents an alternative option for grocery shopping. Whole Foods’ gluten-free options and transparency around the ingredients in its products, however, make it a more convenient place to shop for students with dietary restrictions, according to Gallentine, who is a celiac. 
“As a celiac, I do find that Whole Foods has more variability and more selection of gluten free products, which is very important to me as someone who has to pay extra attention about what is in their food,” Gallentine said.

After putting the brakes on its electric bike initiative last year, Capital Bikeshare will be releasing a fleet of 1,500 new electric bikes onto Washington, D.C. streets beginning March 18. 
The improved e-bikes are equipped with hybrid docking technology that allows riders to lock the bikes to Capital Bikeshare stations, as well as standard bike racks for a $1 out-of-station fee, according to a Feb. 21 District Department of Transportation news release. Capital Bikeshare e-bike riders will also be charged a $1 fee per trip in addition to the normal trip fees. 
E-bikes will be an attractive new transportation option for students and other university community members, according to Georgetown University Transportation Demand Manager Lindsey Bullen. 
“The new e-bikes make it easier to travel a longer distance, and ride in areas with hills, which can make biking more accessible for our campus community,” Bullen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Capital Bikeshare can also be accessed 24/7 when other transportation options may not be available.”
Capital Bikeshare has two docking stations near campus, one outside the main gates of campus and one recently installed in Burleith. Georgetown students are eligible for a discounted annual bike membership of $25 in partnership with the Capital Bikeshare University Program. 
The university encourages the increased use of bikes, according to Bullen.
“I expect we will see the e-bikes being used to get to and from campus, especially now that the University has access to two docking stations nearby,” Bullen wrote. “The e-bikes are only a portion of the total Capital Bikeshare bikes in the system, so we will still see high usage of the traditional Capital Bikeshare bikes.” 
The reimplementation of the e-bike program comes as part of a District-wide effort to broaden transportation options, according to DDOT Director Jeff Marootian. 
“These new and improved e-bikes will allow Capital Bikeshare riders to lock the bikes to bike racks at their destination, allowing unprecedented accessibility across all eight wards of the District,” Marootian wrote in the Feb. 21 news release.
Advisory Neighborhood 2E Commissioner Kishan Putta, who is currently running to represent Ward 2 on the Council of the District of Columbia, supports the return of the e-bike program as a more sustainable transportation option for D.C. residents, he wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“We need more electric modes of transportation in D.C.,” Putta wrote. “I support the expansion of not only electric bikes, but electric cars, buses and charging stations to help DC become carbon neutral and climate resilient by 2050.”
Capital Bikeshare recalled the e-bike pilot program in April 2019 after issues with the e-bikes’ braking systems resulted in multiple injuries among riders. The company continued to offer nonelectric bikes while undergoing internal safety assessments and improvements. 
The company’s decision to halt the e-bike program after safety concerns was a wise one, according to Putta. 
“I strongly support new safe, efficient transportation options in our city,” Putta wrote. “Safety is most important. That’s why I am glad Bikeshare voluntarily paused the e-bike program until they were made safer.”
Members in the Community Partners Program, Capital Bikeshare’s need-based discount service, will also have complete access to the new e-bike initiative, according to an update posted on the Capital Bikeshare website. CPP members will receive a one-year free membership extension and will not be charged the additional e-bike fee. 
To ensure the success of the Capital Bikeshare e-bike program, the company needs to remain focused on promoting public safety and responsible use, according to Putta.
“They should not roll this program out unless they are fully ready to ensure that these bikes will be parked safely,” Putta wrote. “We are glad for these new transportation options in our city, but these companies are making money. They have to be safe, used safely and parked safely.”

Hi Brian,
Is there any update about this program? Has Capital Bikeshare
 released fleet of 1,500 new electric bikes? And is there any possibility of this program in California?

Bicycling, on the other hand, is an excellent method to stay active and fit. To navigate over difficult trails, you’ll need one of the best enduro mountain bikes. This article is about the best enduro motorcycles under $3,000. So stay tuned for more fantastic ideas!

Dupont Underground, a nonprofit art venue located in abandoned trolley tunnels under Dupont Circle, is in talks to renew their venue lease, allaying previous concerns it would be forced to close.
Since October 2019, Dupont Underground’s management has been in discussions with the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, which is responsible for overseeing the property and the negotiations of the new lease. The most recent meeting between the art space’s management and DMPED occurred Feb. 24, according to Robert Meins, CEO of Dupont Underground. 
Although contract and lease negotiations are still ongoing, Meins is optimistic that the new contract will soon be finalized. 
“We’ve been in negotiations to see what works for us. In fact, there was a meeting today at Dupont, which we took to go over the final term sheet,” Meins said in an interview with The Hoya. “And that sets out the terms for what the final agreement will be.”
DMPED is in talks with Dupont Underground but would not elaborate on the details of the negotiation, according to Deputy Mayor John Falcicchio in a statement to ABC affiliate WJLA. 
“We remain in active negotiations with the operators of the Dupont Underground to extend their operations despite nonpayment of rent,” Falcicchio said to WJLA. “Given the ongoing nature of those negotiations, public comment would not be prudent at this time. As we previously stated: We remain committed to keeping this unique space as an asset of the creative economy.”
Dupont Underground’s flexible space offers opportunities for diverse programming, according to Meins. 
“When you see a space like this, you understand what its potential is. Anyone who comes down here sees that potential and it’s just a question of getting the right team and formula together,” Meins said to WJLA.
The venue is an accommodating space for aspiring and ambitious artists, according to Meins.
“When I first met with them, I said, ‘Look, I don’t have money, I don’t have an organization, I have this really ambitious exhibition that I want to put on in just 10 months and what do you think?’” Meins said in an interview with The Hoya. “Any other venues in the city would have said, ‘That’s ridiculous. Come back two years before you are gonna do something.’ Except Dupont Underground worked with me to make the exhibition possible.”
In addition to displaying art exhibitions, Dupont Underground hosts events like comedy showcases. Georgetown students Sahaj Sharda (SFS ’20) and Gary Simons (COL ’21) both performed at the venue’s “D.C.’s Best Young Comedians” showcase in September 2019.
Performing at Dupont Underground provided Simons with an introduction to the professional world of stand-up comedy, he wrote.
“To me, Dupont Underground will always be a reminder of my first professional stand-up show and what I am capable of as a performer,” Simons wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “After my first show there people from GW reached out to me to perform at their school and the organization that booked me for the first show kept asking me to perform again. By the end of last semester, I had done 4 stand-up shows.”
The venue is a great place to perform because of the unique space, which can accommodate a large audience, according to Sharda.
“It was my favorite gig to date. The rogue location and ambiance combined with the over 400 people who were comfortably seated in the audience led to a night that was an absolute blast,” Sharda wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “I personally loved the attitude of the venue.”

Georgetown University administrators have joined students and workers in the ongoing opposition against proposed bus service changes to eliminate routes that serve the university.
University administrators testified alongside local officials and community members in opposition of proposed bus route changes at a Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority public hearing Feb. 26. Residents from around Washington, D.C., packed the hearing room to express their frustrations to a panel of five WMATA officials. 
The university worked with local governmental and business groups, as well as student organizations, to develop a united position opposing the proposed changes, according to Heidi Tseu, director of local government affairs at Georgetown, who testified at the hearing on behalf of the university. 
“We were pleased to provide testimony last night on behalf of the University and were grateful to join with our local Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, students and neighbors to express our shared concerns about this proposal,” Tseu wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
In addition to presenting testimony at the public hearing, Georgetown also submitted a letter to WMATA on Feb. 27.
“Our historic campus is home to thousands of students and, as the District’s largest private employer, the workplace of thousands of faculty and staff. Many of our students, faculty, visitors, and staff rely on public transportation to travel to and from our campus,” the letter read. 
As part of its budget proposal for the fiscal year 2021, WMATA proposed a series of service changes, including the elimination of Route D1 (Glover Park-Franklin Square Line), and the consolidation of Route G2 (P Street-LeDroit Park Line) and Route D2 (Glover Park-Dupont Circle Line), all of which serve the Georgetown neighborhood. 
By consolidating the G2 and D2 lines, riders will now have to walk nearly half a mile from campus to reach a bus stop, which will make taking public transportation a less attractive option, according to the letter.
“To move access to Metrobus service even farther away – when such a ride is often just one leg of a rider’s total commute – will strongly disincentivize the use of public transportation, promote the use of single occupancy vehicles and rideshares, and increase parking and congestion in the Georgetown neighborhood,” the letter read.
A WMATA spokesperson did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment by the time of publication. 
Service changes to Route G2 will disproportionately affect campus workers — some of whom already have sizable commutes — and make their community even more inconvenient, according to Alex Taliadoros, organizing director at the Kalmanovitz Institute for Labor and the Working Poor, which develops policies and strategies to improve workers’ lives.
“We believe that about a quarter of Georgetown’s campus workers rely on the G2 for their daily commute,” Taliadoros wrote in an email to The Hoya. “ It’s not uncommon for a worker to ride a bus to their nearest Metro station, ride the train into DC, switch lines, then get off at DuPont Circle or Rosslyn to take another bus to campus. On a good day, when everything runs smoothly, their commutes last between an hour and an hour and a half. On a bad day it takes much longer.”
While the proposed changes may seem small, they will have significant detrimental impacts on Georgetown’s community members, according to Taliadoros.
“The proposed changes to the G2 route may seem small to some, but it adds a ten-minute walk each way to what is an already Odyssean journey home,” Taliadoros wrote. “It means walking an additional six blocks before-and-after a physically demanding work shift. It means waiting for a bus on a dark street corner without as much as a bus stop canopy to protect them from the elements.” 
The university has encouraged community members affected by the proposed changes to submit comments via WMATA’s online survey, Tseu and Vice President for Government Relations and Community Engagement Christopher Murphy wrote in a Feb. 27 university-wide email.
The university has reposted the Georgetown University Student Association Federal and D.C. Relations Committee graphics about the routes on their social media accounts. The posts came as FedRel embarked on a social media campaign, called #WMATAWeek, to increase student awareness about the service changes. 
Submitting a public comment is the best way for students to advocate for the preservation of the bus routes, according to Natalia Lopez (SFS ’22), who serves as the secretary of D.C. affairs for FedRel. 
“GUSA’s Federal and D.C. Relations Committee has been working with the Local Relations Office in finding resources for students and workers on campus to advocate for their bus lines,” Lopez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The most important outlet to comment and voice your opinion will be filling out a public comment on the WMATA website by March 2nd.”

Georgetown University’s Office of Global Education postponed a Centennial Lab’s spring break trip to Cambodia until after the end of the spring semester, due to increasing concerns over the spread of the coronavirus in Asia. 
Students enrolled in “Politics and Performance: Confronting the Past, Shaping the Future,” the affected Centennial Lab, which is a program of courses that focuses on experiential learning, planned to travel to Cambodia over spring break. Following reports that one passenger tested positive for the coronavirus after going on a cruise that disembarked in Cambodia, the OGE decided Feb. 18 to postpone the travel component of the class. 
While Cambodia has reported only one registered case of coronavirus, health officials are now worried Cambodia may have opened its doors to an outbreak, according to The New York Times. The spread of coronavirus has led the university to cancel study abroad programs in China in January and South Korea this week. 
As the coronavirus, also called COVID-19, outbreak spreads, the university is evaluating the health risks of study abroad programs individually, according to Vice Dean for Undergraduate Affairs of the School of Foreign Service Daniel Byman.
“The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak raises a number of considerations both in terms of health and safety, and also practical operational considerations with respect to the ability to most successfully support students abroad,” Byman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Because local conditions, support from on-ground partners, and travel restrictions vary by country, and by program, the university reviews these decisions on a program-by-program basis, after careful consideration of all relevant factors.”
Cambodian Living Arts, which was set to host students in the Centennial Lab, is prepared to receive the class in May. The organization promotes creativity and innovation in the arts sector and works to get more arts and culture education into Cambodian public schools, according to the Cambodian Living Arts website. 
The university is watching developments in Cambodia and will decide whether or not to run the trip in May depending on coronavirus conditions, according to Byman.
Professors Derek Goldman and Cynthia Schneider, who are co-teaching the course for the third time this year, remain hopeful the trip will run with its original itinerary and all students will still participate. 
“Needless to say we are heartbroken about the situation, as sharing this trip with our students has been profoundly meaningful to us, and we are very hopeful that the trip will be able to happen in May with as many of the students as possible,” Goldman wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Cambodia is the ideal case study for the Politics and Performance Centennial Lab, which aims to study the important intersection of politics and performance through diverse examples from the past and present, because it is an example of a place where the arts play a vital role in a post-conflict context, according to the course syllabus. 
Goldman and Schnieder are working to adapt the course material to account for changes caused by the trip postponement, according to Schneider.
“It’s much better to have it in the middle of the semester, much better, but we can still lead up to it during the course, and the students can still have a really fulfilling, meaningful, culminating experience,” Schneider said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think we’re all trying to make the very best out of a really regrettable situation.” 
The 14 students enrolled in the course now must make alternative arrangements for spring break. Such last minute changes may pose a financial burden to students, according to Celia Buckman (SFS ’21), one of the students enrolled in the Centennial Lab.
“It’s really annoying that this came at such short notice.” Buckman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’ve had to replan my spring break overnight, which comes at a financial cost since everything is more expensive with such a tight turnaround.”
The university is coordinating with students affected by the Centennial Lab change in an effort to mitigate the effects of the postponement, according to Byman.
“SFS administrators are working closely with concerned professors and students,” Byman wrote. “The professors engaged us from the start regarding travel safety and are an important part of every decision we make. We are working with students, both as a group and as individuals, to make sure that no one faces problems regarding graduation credits or other possible academic issues.”
