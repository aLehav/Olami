U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch expressed her support for a recently announced program that will collect information on the lethal use of police force as well as create the first national database for lethal and nonlethal interactions in Gaston Hall yesterday.
The speech marked the first time Lynch publicly announced her support for the National Use of Force Data Collection Program, which is a joint project by the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was launched Oct. 5.
Transparency between the police and the communities they serve will increase with the program, according to Lynch.
“One of the things that we want to know is that when we do see a situation where, in one part of a country or another, there is a police department that is seeing a rise in complaints among civilians about the way they are treated at traffic stops,” Lynch said. “You want to know how that’s compared to last year or the year before. What’s going on that’s leading to this?”
Lynch addressed the project in part of the second of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service’s six “exit interviews,” a programming series that focuses on President Barack Obama’s legacy as he reaches the conclusion of his second term.
GU Politics, which is part of the McCourt School of Public Policy, previously hosted National Security Advisor Susan Rice on Sept. 14 in an event focusing on national security as the first of its six-part series.
Moderated by Michel Marton, the weekend host of National Public Radio’s “All Things Considered,” said the Thursday discussion centered on modern policing and community relations in light of the national conversation surrounding the excessive use of force by law enforcement officials.
The National Use of Force Data Collection Program will focus on analyzing the effectiveness of the data collection methodology and quality, as well as requiring local, state, tribal and federal law enforcement agencies to report incidents of lethal police force, under penalty of noncompliance fines. However, the Justice Department cannot mandate state and local agencies to report on nonlethal interactions; its participation in this section of the program is voluntary.
The Justice Department plans to begin collecting data early next year.
University President John J. DeGioia introduced Lynch by discussing the importance of promoting justice and working toward public service on a university campus.
“Understanding and exploring ideas of justice has a strong resonance with any university, whether through the formation of our students, in the inquiry of our faculty or in the responsibility that we have in promoting the common good,” DeGioia said. “It is the ethos, the characteristic spirit of a university, to seek those matters, to work and build a more just, fair and inclusive society.”
Lynch cited the poor relationship between police officers and the communities they serve as one of the biggest challenges to the Obama administration’s legacy.
“In every community that I go into, and I’ve been a prosecutor for 20 years, people want to have good relations with law enforcement because no one wants to feel that when you are in harm’s way, you have nobody to call,” Lynch said. “That is the upshot of what we’re seeing in communities. People are feeling targeted, and people are feeling that there is nowhere there for them. There’s no one in their corner.”
Lynch also said conversations on the issue are important because they serve as a way to acknowledge the claims of both minority and police communities and to find common ground between both groups.
“I think it’s an opportunity to honor the deaths of civilians and law enforcement officers and to acknowledge that law enforcement have an incredibly difficult and dangerous job, but at the end of the day both law enforcement and civilians have the same goal: to get home alive and to live in a safe community,” Lynch said.
Lynch called the Obama administration’s work on LGBTQ issues its greatest success, specifically citing marriage equality and legal protections for families with same-sex parents.
“You cannot have a country, even when it’s as great as ours, live up to its ideals and what it stands for if you are deliberately excluding a huge class of people who want one of the most basic and fundamental rights we have, and that’s the right to marry,” Lynch said. “The way in which this administration has been able to work on the issue is one of the great points of pride and for me. We are measured by how we treat people that others want us to exclude and push or hold back.”
Kelly Bies (GRD ’18), who previously taught middle school in Chicago, reflected on how she witnessed firsthand the impact of the Obama administration’s policies.
“I think her opinions on criminal justice and social justice are really interesting,” Bies said. “I’m a former teacher, so it’s amazing to see how these policies impact our lowest-income communities and the students in them.”

About 35 Georgetown undergraduate and graduate students marched from the university’s front gates to the White House on Oct. 10 to raise awareness for unarmed black victims of police brutality in America.
Organized by graduate students Raquel King (GRD ’16) and Skylar Cruz (GRD ’18), the rally — titled “Black Bodies are Beings” — sought to specifically address the deaths of Trayvon Martin in 2012, Eric Garner in 2014, Sandra Bland in 2015 and most recently Terrence Sterling, shot by a police officer Sept. 11 in Washington, D.C.
As students, who were notified about the march through a Facebook event page Sept. 30, gathered at the front gates, King began by addressing the killing of unarmed black Americans and her view of today’s youth’s desire for change. The group then gathered for a prayer of solidarity, asking for a successful march and changes to the American policing system.
“We’re backing civil rights,” King said to the protestors at the beginning of the march. “I don’t understand how we’re still going through this when our grandparents talk to us and tell us to be careful. It shouldn’t be like that. We shouldn’t be going through this.”
As King filed a parade permit Oct. 4 for 125 people, the group received a Metropolitan Police Department escort, which included the accompaniment of three motorcycles and five cars for certain stretches of the march and fewer vehicles for other stretches, depending on the location. Police blocked car lanes so the students could peacefully march on O and M streets and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania avenues, which caused up to 10-minute traffic delays in Northwestern D.C.
Although only a third of the expected number of protestors who indicated on Facebook that they would be attending showed up, Raymond Nelson (GRD ’17), president of the graduate student multicultural organization Hoya Circles, said he felt the demonstration helped foster dialogue about police brutality in the Georgetown community.
“If I could do it over again, I would encourage more people to participate. I think part of the turnout had to do with advertising,” Nelson said. “But it was a therapeutic moment to let the frustration out and being able to channel that emotion in a way that was productive felt affirming.”
As the protestors marched, they carried signs listing the names of men and women killed by police and chanted calls reinforcing themes of racial equality and political reform, such as, “It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win” and “What do we want? Change. When do want it? Now.”
Once they reached the White House, the protesters continued their calls for racial reform with nearly an hour of chanting before pausing for a prayer circle.
King said she organized the march after hearing about the death of Terence Crutcher, a 40-year-old black man fatally shot Sept. 16 by officer Betty Shelby in Tulsa, Okla. Shelby was charged with first-degree manslaughter Sept. 23 and released the same day on a $50,000 bond.
“After the Crutcher killing, I messaged my friend at Georgetown Law saying ‘I have to do something. I can’t just sit still and not do something,’” King said in an interview with The Hoya.
However, King said the organizers aimed to highlight the pattern of police killings beyond the Crutcher shooting.
“More than anything I want people to see that we care,” King said. “We are going to be proactive. We are young professionals and will make decisions in our own careers that will change in America.”
Though the march was not affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, participants referenced the movement and included its emblem of a raised fist in their promotion of the march.
Tom Chidiac (GRD ’18) said he attended the rally to learn more about issues facing the black community and demonstrate his support for racial equality.
“It’s important to me to be supportive of this movement and do so with my feet, not just Facebook comments,” Chidiac said. “I’m also hoping to learn more about what the organizers find most problematic and how I, as an ally, can be most helpful.”
Carlsky Belizaire (GRD ’18), who helped lead the rally, said he was happy with the results but wished for a bigger turnout and more interactions with pedestrians.
“I’m happy and excited that Georgetown students came out,” Belizaire said. “In the future, hopefully, more people come. I wish I could have reached out to more people. Some people were watching us and there was probably a delay between watching the protests and understanding what we were saying and what was really going on.”

As members of Georgetown’s Jewish community gathered for Rosh Hashanah services Oct. 3 and Oct. 4, Andrew Meshnick (COL ’17) delivered a sermon on a seemingly unrelated topic: the community’s connection to the sale of 272 slaves in 1838, the profits of which provided financial support for Georgetown.
Director for Jewish Life Rabbi Rachel Gartner led the themed services by giving two Rosh Hashanah services, which featured sermons delivered by students on the legacy of slavery at Georgetown.
Drawing a connection between the biblical story of Isaac, who was almost sacrificed by his father in an expression of faith, and one of the slaves sold by the university also named Isaac, Meshnick argued the Jewish community has a special responsibility to atone for the past.
“If you would teach your children that the sacrifice of biblical Isaac was wrong, would you do the same for a flesh and blood man named Isaac who was one of the slaves sold in 1838?” Meshnick said. “Unlike biblical Isaac, 1838 Isaac was not spared; we know Georgetown’s leaders sold Isaac’s children and grandchildren to Louisiana’s highly lethal sugar plantations.”
Meshnick’s sermon was part of a larger theme for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services on campus this year, which centered on the responsibility of the larger community in atoning for Georgetown’s slaveholding past.
In September, the university announced that it would undertake multiple efforts to make amends for the sale of the slaves, including providing legacy status to descendants in the admission process, renaming Freedom and Remembrance Hall to Isaac Hall and Anne Marie Beechcraft Hall and developing memorials to the 272 slaves on campus.
Gartner worked with the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation to organize ways to further involve the Jewish community with the university’s past with slavery beyond its themed Rosh Hashanah services.
Attendees went on a walking tour through the Georgetown area to explore slavery’s historic presence in D.C. after the customary Jewish atonement ritual, Tashlikh.
Director of the Center for Jewish Civilization professor Jacques Berlinerblau said Gartner’s efforts revived the Jewish tradition of social activism on campus.
“I applaud Rabbi Gartner for doing this. She is harking back to a tradition of Jewish left activism and of the rabbinical community,” Berlinerblau said. “She is trying to reinvigorate this relationship by drawing attention to the commonalities between blacks and Jews.”
This semester, Berlinerblau is teaching a course on the relationship between Jews and blacks drawing on the groups’ shared histories of oppression.
Berlinerblau said the two groups have had at times contrasting experiences of oppression in the West.
“Maybe what makes this course interesting is that it’s true and it’s false. No two groups have suffered more at the hands of Western civilization, that’s the true part,” Berlinerblau said. “The false part is that their experiences here in the United States are very different.”
Co-President of Georgetown’s Jewish Student Association Jenna Galper (COL ’17) said solidarity between the black and Jewish communities is important for the future.
“The history of Jews in America has been very intertwined with the history of African-Americans and the civil rights movement and so I think analyzing that history and recommitting ourselves to being strong allies for our African American brothers and sisters is definitely a very important next step for the Jewish community,” Galper said.
In his sermon, Meshnick urged the congregation to atone for the sins previously made by the Georgetown community.
“I hope you will join me in the all-important work of atoning for the sins done to Isaac, the 271 other individuals who were sold and the millions throughout our country who were held in slavery’s chains,” Meshnick said.
Galper said Meshnick’s sermon changed the way she understood and processed Georgetown’s history with slavery.
“It was a powerful way to connect myself to the legacy of slavery at Georgetown,” Galper said. “It was a really powerful analogy because not only am I atoning for my own sins in this high holy season but for the sins of my broader Georgetown community which includes the fact that we sold slaves to be where we are today.”
Berlinerblau stressed the importance of devoting academic resources to black Jewish groups when confronting Georgetown’s legacy with slavery.
“I think this shows the importance of having academic representation on campus and how academic representation fosters a greater understanding of issues of interesting groups like blacks and Jews,” Berlinerblau said.
The Board of directors voted unanimously in June 2016 to make African American studies the newest department in the Georgetown College. African American studies was previously an interdisciplinary program founded in 2003.
Georgetown expanded the Program for Jewish Civilization — which sought to promote an increased understanding of Jewish civilization at the university — into the CJC in February.
According to Galper, the Jewish community listened to the recommendations of the working group on Georgetown’s legacy with slavery when it said it wanted to see other Georgetown communities taking it upon themselves to encourage discussion about the university’s past.
“The history of slavery and of oppression and of our people is something that is very close to our hearts and is something that is always at the forefront of our mind when we are celebrating holidays and when we’re praying,” Galper said.

Hate crimes against racial, religious and sexual orientation minority groups increased by 300 percent from one in 2014 to four in 2015, according to the Georgetown University Police Department’s 2016 Annual Security Report.
Alleged instances of rape in non-residential areas decreased 50 percent from four in 2014 to two in 2015. While these cases decreased in residential areas as well, the drop was less pronounced — 12.5 percent from eight to seven in the same time span.
Hate crimes have increased from one in 2014 to four in 2015 and have targeted minority groups on the grounds of race, sexual orientation, religious affiliation and gender identity.
Reports of stalking increased by 333 percent from three in 2014 to 13 in 2015, while reports of dating violence increased by 80 percent from five in 2014 to nine in 2015.
Reports of fondling increased from zero to two in nonresidential areas and remained constant at two in residential areas.
The report, released every year by Oct. 1 and accessible from the Georgetown University website, aggregates all criminal activity reported on facilities owned by Georgetown University — including those overseas — in the previous academic school year and provides statistics comparing results to the three previous calendar years.
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said multiple departments, including the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action and the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, have worked together to address hate crimes on campus.
“The university takes a collaborative approach to dealing with these crimes,” Gruber said.
More institutional support for minority groups is required to minimize the rate of hate crimes, according to GUPride Co-President Grace Smith (COL ’18).
“Many queer students have had unfortunate or even harmful encounters with other members of the community as well as GUPD and administrative forces meant to prevent these events from occurring,” Smith wrote in an email to The Hoya. “On a personal level, I believe that GUPD should make a more active effort to reach out to GUPride and remind them of their solidarity.”
Smith said the report’s statistics may not be accurate because of potential reporters’ lack of faith in GUPD and the university.
“GUPride would appreciate and be receptive to more engagement with GUPD with the intent to build a bridge of solidarity and trust between the communities,” Smith wrote. “GUPride fights hate with love, fear with acceptance, and violence with care. The organization takes what measures it can to provide safe and brave spaces for its students and community members at its events, but we have not worked with GUPD directly.”
Representatives from the Black Student Alliance and Casa Latina declined to comment pending further review of the report.
For a second straight year, GUPD also attached an appendix devoted to describing procedures used to address sexual misconduct and sexual assault.
Gruber said the number of documented cases might not reflect the actual number of sexual crimes committed on campus.
“Many studies and climate surveys show that sexual assaults on campus are significantly under-reported,” Gruber said. “There is hesitation on the part of the survivor to report the crimes for various reasons.”
Georgetown University Student Association Security and Sexual Assault Policy Team Chair Maddy Moore (SFS ’17) said the statistics included in the report are not an accurate representation of the prevalence of sexual assault on campus.
“The numbers are helpful in raising awareness that sexual violence is happening at Georgetown, but it is important to note that they do not necessarily correlate with the number of assaults,” Moore wrote. “Many survivors — for various reasons — do not disclose their assault to anyone or only share with confidential campus resources.”
Bystander education programs, the hiring of a full-time Title IX coordinator, the Campus Climate Survey and the new Sexual Assault Response Team have contributed to increased resources for survivors of sexual assault, according to Moore.
Moore said GUSA will continue to use the Sexual Misconduct Task Force — a group of students, administrators, faculty and staff assembled following the release of the results of the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey in June — to recommend policy on bystander programs, alcohol, drugs and grievance procedures to University President John J. DeGioia.
Associate Vice President for Strategic Communications Stacy Kerr did not respond to a request for comment as of 2:30 a.m. Friday.
Referrals for illegal consumption of alcohol dropped from 250 in 2014 to 226 in 2015 for on-campus reports, a 9.6 percent decrease.
The report also addresses crime prevention measures, crime reporting policies and disciplinary procedures as well as new GUPD resources and programs such as the new closed-circuit television camera surveillance system, the LiveSafe mobile app and self-defense courses open to all students.
Gruber said GUPD will work to continue to build trust with community groups.
“In my opinion, the relationship between GUPD and the university community has never been better,” Gruber said. “We all have a mutually inclusive goal of maintaining a safe and secure living and learning environment.”
Correction: This article previously stated there was a 75 percent increase in hate crimes; there was a 300 percent increase. This article also previously stated that there was a 9.6 percent increase in illegal consumption of alcohol; there was a 9.6 percent decrease.

A note to whoever did the calculations for this article – a few have been caught, but they should all be checked. 5 to 9 isn’t an 80% increase, etc. If you’re going to cite statistics (and turn them into percentages), make sure to do so correctly. 🙂

Relationships have become more flexible as society has evolved in the last decade, argued The New York Times’ “Modern Love” Editor Daniel Jones in Copley Formal Lounge on Tuesday.
The event was co-sponsored by the Lecture Fund, The Hoya and the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice.
“Modern Love” is in its 12th year as a reader-generated column inside The New York Times’ weekly Sunday Styles section.
In 2015, the most-read article at The New York Times — “The 36 Questions That Lead to Love” — was published in January in the “Modern Love” column, receiving more than 20 million hits online and accumulating a collective reading time of over 100 years.
Jones said his column bears witness to societal changes that have influenced trends in relationships over the past decade, such as the legalization of gay marriage and popularization of nontraditional family structures.
“I see that, even in college campuses, that there is an aversion to being placed into boxes, there is an aversion to calling yourself something, there is an aversion to calling your relationship something,” Jones said. “People want things to be fluid and undefined, and I think that’s a big change where it was not this way 12 years ago.”
Jones said the column aims to capture love in all its forms, from life-changing encounters to more ordinary episodes, such as the agony of an unanswered text to a crush.
“This column is about relationships, it’s about human love, which means you don’t write about a love of place or a love of your favorite book, although people submit essays like that,” Jones said. “This kind of complicated love is given means, and it’s not necessarily romantic love. Some of the most moving essays I see are from family, especially parents and children, the sort of blood lines that can be very trying and complicated.”
According to Jones, falling in love is about finding a balance between vulnerability and dependence.
“To fall in love you have to show your weaknesses, but you have to be smart about it – you have to be vulnerable and smart at the same time,” Jones said. “You can’t be vulnerable to the point where you’re a mess, or you’ll scare the other people away. But you have to be vulnerable to the point where the person feels invited in.”
Lecture Fund board member Anisha Vora (SFS ’19), who introduced Jones at the event, said she invited him to campus because he signified a departure from the typical lecturers invited to the university.
“We have a lot of politics speakers come in, and those are great, but we definitely don’t have as many arts-based speakers, and I definitely consider the type of literature and the type of journalism Dan Jones does to be a kind of art form,” Vora said.
Jones, who now reviews over 8,000 annual submissions to “Modern Love,” was a ski instructor before he published “The Bastard on The Couch,” a follow-up to his wife Cathi Hanauer’s feminist essay anthology “The Bitch in The House,” which captured the attention of New York Times editors who approached the duo with the idea for the column.
Jones said both he and his wife were skeptical at first.
“We didn’t think it was a good idea, I have to say, but I was largely unemployed at the time having just finished my book and not having anything else to do, so we started the column together,” Jones said. “We said let’s see how this works. That’s how I wound up, surprisingly, at this job.”
Though his wife left the project after a month to finish a book, Jones said he stayed to accomplish his vision for a new type of column.
“I wanted to open the floodgates to stories about people who didn’t have any connection to any editor, who weren’t experienced writers, who had a wealth of stories that would be fresh, would be surprising and honest, people who hadn’t already told their stories,” Jones said. “In my estimation, that’s what’s made the column what it is and given it the longevity that it has had.”
Jones said the idea to include personal essays in an established newspaper like The New York Times, while ordinary now, was a novel idea when “Modern Love” launched in 2004.
“I didn’t get it when I first started; I just did not see how this belongs in a newspaper with news articles, and now newspapers, online magazines, they’re all saturated with personal essays,” Jones said.
Shifts in the way people consume news has prompted Jones to explore different platforms for disseminating “Modern Love.” Jones said the launch of the “Modern Love” podcast in December 2015 opened up a new opportunity to monetize storytelling.
“Podcasting is very profitable right now, and some people would even say it’s in a bubble, but right now it’s easy to get advertisers,” Jones said. “People are really searching for ways to monetize this material out to people and have them pay for it.”
Sydney Green (COL ’17), an avid listener of the “Modern Love” podcast, said the pieces published in the “Modern Love” column reflect Jones’ concept of love.
“I just love them. Like he said, I like them because they are very sweet and very sincere, but also very smart,” Green said. “I think he knows what he’s looking for and does a great job finding it.”
Sarika Ramaswamy (SFS ’18) said she attended the event because as a culture and politics major, she is interested in how media intersect with broader political trends.
“I like this idea of using more human stories to talk about broader issues,” Ramaswamy said. “These changes in romance are reflective of a change in society, and it’s a good way to talk about the world through these more human stories.”

The 12th annual “OUTober” – a six-weeklong celebration of Georgetown’s LGBTQ community that kicked off with Coming Out Day in Red Square last Friday — focuses on the theme of personal and political histories of the varied LGBTQ community.
Held in conjunction with LGBTQ History Month, “OUTober” will feature a series of 14 events, including speaker events, panel discussions and theater performances.
The initiative is a joint effort by the LGBTQ Resource Center, GU Pride, GU Queer People of Color and the Tagliabue Initiative for LGBTQ Life. OUTober has also partnered with administrators and clubs including Campus Ministry, the Office of the President and GU College Democrats.
This year’s programming includes a discussion with sociology professor Brian McCabe and Bowdoin College sociology professor Theo Greene about the roles of queer people in shaping neighborhoods and the impact of gentrification on queer people of color.
In addition, the Theater and Performance Studies Programs will perform itsfirst production of the year, “Anon(ymous),” in the Davis Performing Arts Center from Oct. 13 to 15. Anon(ymous), a retelling of Homer’s Odyssey written by Naomi Iizuka, follows the journey of a refugee, Anon, who explores their gender identity.
The performance is student-produced and directed by faculty.
“Coming Out Day,” the first event of “OUTober,” featured a door with a rainbow flag surrounded by chalk drawings and messages of acceptance and declarations of identity to provide a safe space for LGBTQ students to come out.
LGBTQ Resource Center Assistant Director Julian Haas said Coming Out Day is a celebration of inclusivity.
“‘Coming Out Day’ is a really special day for Georgetown’s campus. It’s an opportunity for faculty, staff and students to come together to celebrate all of the people that make up what is special about Georgetown,” Haas said.
“Coming Out Day” also reflects the challenges still facing LGBTQ individuals, according to Haas.
“I think it’s also an opportunity for folks to reflect that there might not always be the conditions or opportunities for people to do that safely and securely, and so it’s a moment for celebration and also a time for reflection on how we can make this an opportunity for more people moving forward,” Haas said.
Yellow shirts with the words “I am” were distributed to encourage visibility of the LGBTQ and LGBTQ ally community on campus. The color of each year’s “I am” shirt follows the sequence of the pride flag, with this year’s yellow shirts preceded by orange last year and red in 2014.
GU Pride Co-President Grace Smith (COL ’18) said the shirts not only help raise awareness on campus but also represent the progress the LGBTQ movement has made in recent years.
“It’s nice because it’s also a visual representation of the kind of progress we make on this kind of journey, so I like that a lot,” Smith said. “The shirts are just a way for people to be empowered but also a way to spread visibility about the day because we have tons of people wearing it throughout the day.”
Georgetown has been criticized by some in the Catholic community for promoting LGBTQ initiatives while being a Jesuit university. The Cardinal Newman Society criticized Georgetown in an article last week entitled “Coming Out Day Still Celebrated at Catholic Colleges,” arguing that it is improper for Georgetown to support “OUTober” as same-sex sexual activity is against Catholic teachings.
GU Pride Co-President Ida Dhanuka (COL ’17) said Coming Out Day — and supporting LGBTQ individuals — is consistent with Georgetown’s values as a Jesuit university.
“I think it’s unfortunate that the Cardinal Newman Society would disagree, and that they would not want to give space to the breadth of ways that Catholicism is practiced, as well as to a diversity of students who come to Georgetown,” Dhanuka said. “Especially Jesuit values — I think that’s really compatible with wanting to have an inclusive campus that gives space to LGBTQ folks.”
Planning for the month of programming began as early as the summer and involved both the LGBTQ Resource Center and various student groups, according to student staff member Jose Ramos (MSB ’19).
Other events include a panel about LGBTQ life in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 18 and an Open Mic night Oct. 24.
Ramos said the student-led organization of the month reflects students’ broader commitment to LGBTQ issues.
“We have to remember that students were the ones who wanted this; they were the ones who, at the beginning, advocated for Georgetown being more inclusive to students from the LGBTQ community,” Ramos said.
Dhanuka said “OUTober” is as important for the greater Georgetown community as it is for LGBTQ students.
“I think as important as it is to have spaces that are for LGBTQ folks, I also do think it is important for people who don’t identify as LGBTQ to go out of their way to get a sense of what other people are going through and how they’re living their lives. Because these are your friends, these are your community members, your roommates and team members.”

The Georgetown University Medical Center’s School of Medicine promoted over 100 women to the status of full professors, fulfilling a goal established last year by the faculty-run organization Georgetown Women in Medicine.
GWIM, which advocates for the professional advancement of women in the medical field, celebrated the accomplishment with a reception Sept. 29 after GUMC learned of the promotion of the 100th woman last June. The organization prioritized achieving the full professor status of 100 women by connecting women within the school to mentors and organizing promotion workshops for female faculty.
With women comprising 18 percent of full professors in academic medicine at the School of Medicine, the university lags slightly behind the national average of 21 percent, according to the most recent report by the Association of American Medical Colleges on the topic in 2013. Only three department chairs at the School of Medicine — 11 percent — are women.
GWIM aims to increase the percentage of female departmental chairs and to gather data on salary equity within the medical school.
GWIM President Kristy Graves, who is also an associate professor of oncology, said that the milestone was particularly significant in light of challenges faced by women in medicine, who often face additional demands outside of publishing and research.
“I think there are a lot of subtle obstacles, such as competing time demands in the workplace and the full lives of women faculty outside of their day-to-day jobs,” Graves said. “I think the thing I’ve seen change — I’ve been here 11 years — is that GWIM’s voice matters and our opinion is heard when we offer it.”
School of Medicine Executive Dean Edward Healton, who also serves as the executive vice president of health services, stressed gender equality as one of the school’s core values in an email to The Hoya.
“We know that women bring a different perspective to their professional lives and that perspective can positively impact their peers as well as their patients,” Healton wrote. “Much has been said about the differences between male and female professionals in biomedical fields, but the mere fact that there are differences supports the argument that women bring to the table a set of experiences that is informing and impactful.”
Healton said GWIM’s programs address the paucity of female mentors within the medical school, making it more difficult for female students to find role models.
“Mentorship is critical to the success of all students and certainly women and men contribute significantly, but to not have half of that equation is disadvantage,” Healton wrote.
Georgetown Medical School’s chapter of the American Medical Women’s Association Co-President Elizabeth Zolper (GRD ’19) commended GWIM’s fulfillment of a concrete goal in seeing 100 professors achieve full professorship, but she recognized the lack of representation persisting in certain fields.
“There are still a lot more inequalities throughout the system,” Zolper said. “Especially at Georgetown, a powerhouse in orthopedics, you’ll still see that orthopedics and some other schools are still very male-dominated, and even though this school is really well-known for it, there aren’t the female physicians in certain fields to serve as mentors.”
Association of Women Surgeons Vice President Colleen Hamm-Kelly (GRD ’19) said the conditions for women in the School of Medicine are noticeably improving. Although the total student body in the School of Medicine is half male and half female, Hamm-Kelly said the majority of her graduating class is female. In addition, Hamm-Kelly noted a prevalence of women in campus groups.
“It’s a big step in the history of medicine,” Hamm-Kelly said. “I think, overall, the atmosphere is very welcoming. I definitely don’t ever feel intimidated or brought down because I am a woman.”

This year’s TEDxGeorgetown speakers include six students and three external speakers, including Vice President of CNN U.S. and CNN Worldwide General Manager Andrew Morse.
In its sixth iteration, the event, which takes place Oct. 22, will focus on a theme of “The Tipping Point,” highlighting different moments in speakers’ lives that have led to change.
The TED organization runs various conferences and speeches around the world on a broad range of academic and cultural topics. While TEDxGeorgetown uses the original TED Talks format, Georgetown students organize every aspect of the conference. Chosen last spring by the TEDxGeorgetown board, the theme was inspired by Malcolm Gladwell’s book “The Tipping Point”, according to TEDxGeorgetown Co-Chair Natalia Peña (COL ’17)
“It is defined as the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point,” Peña wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The six student speakers, Agnes Lee (SFS ’17), Amina Gerrbi (MSB ’17), Anthony Anderson (COL ’18), Jeong Whan Park (SFS ’17), Febin Bellamy (MSB ’17) and Summer Durant (COL ’18), were selected by members of the TEDxGeorgetown board.
The conference will also feature Jonah Reider, a student at Columbia University who converted his dorm room into a restaurant, and Mary Beth Bruggemen, executive director of the Southeast Region for The Mission Continues, a nonprofit that helps connect veterans with service opportunities in the states.
Peña said the organization attempts to select as diverse a group of speakers as possible.
“We try to get a dynamic group of speakers that put across our theme in the best way possible,” Peña wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We try to look for people who don’t only have great inspiring stories, but who also have the capacity to engage the audience as much as possible whether that be through inspiring people with their stories or simply captivating them with their enthusiasm and personality.”
Each student speaker comes to the event with a unique background and moment to discuss. Speakers were chosen not only because of their individual stories but also based on how they would work in combination with their peer speakers, according to TEDxGeorgetown Co-Chair D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17).
“Our goal was not to judge or evaluate someone’s experience; our goal was simply to pick the best combination of student speakers to hit on the various aspects of our theme,” Angelini wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Gerrbi and the other student speakers were selected for their unique moments that relate to the theme of “The Tipping Point.”
Gerrbi said she will be speaking about the impact of the Arab Spring on her journey to Georgetown.
“I don’t want to give too much away, but I will discuss my time living through the Arab Spring and how I miraculously ended up at Georgetown despite it being virtually impossible,” Gerrbbi wrote. “The goal is to help people understand that we are all capable of shaping our own realities if we want to.”
Anderson, who recently found out he is HIV-positive, will discuss how the disease disproportionately affects black gay males, while Lee will speak about her experience living in the country without authorization.
Durant will deliver a spoken-word poem about her experience reconciling being half Indian and half black; Park, a veteran, will speak about his struggles with mental health.
Bellamy will speak about his work founding Unsung Heroes, which seeks to give back to under-recognized workers at Georgetown.
Gerrbi said she wants to convince attendees to set goals beyond societal limits.
“I constantly see people making decisions based on their limiting beliefs and what society decides is ‘realistic’ or ‘unrealistic’ for them,” Gerrbi said. “I have a story that really challenges society’s norms, and I want people to get the chance to hear it so that they can walk away inspired and motivated to take on any challenge they face in the future.”
Morse, who produced CNN’s presidential debate, monitors CNN newsgathering operations as well as the Washington Bureau and D.C.-based programming, will be speaking about the unprecedented nature of the upcoming presidential election.

Georgetown must continue to focus attention on its history with slavery as it begins to reconcile with its past, according to a panel discussion on Georgetown’s slaveholding past in Lohrfink Auditorium on Wednesday.
John Carr, the director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, emphasized how Georgetown’s Jesuit identity and Catholic mission have impacted the way the university is confronting its past.
“We have a situation that is not unique but, I think, a response that is unique, and I think part of that uniqueness comes from who we are, what we believe and where we come from,” Carr said. “Great evil was done, but great good can come from that because of who we are, what we believe and how we act.”
Carr said the role of slavery in Georgetown’s success cannot be underestimated.
“I knew in a general way that the Jesuits owned slaves, but the more I found out about this the more appalling and personal it got,” Carr said in an interview with The Hoya. “I live, you study, at a place that was made possible in part by the sale of slaves.”
Carr praised the university’s leadership — particularly that of University President John J. DeGioia — in confronting a sensitive issue.
“This is a leader who steps up and faces responsibility, and I was very struck in his speech. He didn’t just talk about the past; he talked about the present and the future,” Carr said. “He talked about how slavery and its continuing legacy diminished the lives of people all around us.”
Associate professor of history Marcia Chatelain, who was a member of the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation that recommended to DeGioia ways for Georgetown to reconcile with its history, said it is important to look back at Georgetown’s work on this issue in light of current events.
“What’s most important to understand about the working group isn’t the fact that we were tasked to tell a truth that many of us knew, but maybe we’re not ready to confront, but rather the context in which this conversation is happening,” Chatelain said.
Chatelain said the working group’s task is not only to find a possible remedy for past sins, but also to combat potential future discrimination in society.
“This working group isn’t just an opportunity for people to trace their individual family history,” Chatelain said. “This is a call to rethink all of the practices that we have with us today as an institution that rely and thrive on inequality.”
Carr said in an interview with The Hoya that the evolution of Catholic and Jesuit values can be a form of guidance for Georgetown to find ways in applying the recommendations made by the working group in its report.
“I think our faith, our Catholic identity and our Jesuit values help us understand what went wrong and how to set this right, and so it pushes us in a direction that considers the moral and ethical responsibilities we have beyond the historical or financial responsibilities,” Carr said.
James Benton, a Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation fellow for the Office of the President who is helping to organize the university’s efforts to reconcile its slaveholding past, said the university has been working with descendants of the 272 and community members to plan the next steps to address Georgetown’s history with slavery.
“We’ve been at work trying to figure out how to go forward with implementing the recommendations,” Benton said. “With the participation of descendants, of students, of the Jesuits, the university community, people of good will.”
Benton said the working group’s recommendations are just the beginning of Georgetown’s engagement with this issue.
“I don’t think people have begun to really grasp the significance of the working group report being a start rather than an endpoint,” Benton said. “We are at the very start of a very long process.”
According to Chatelain, the historical context of Georgetown in the 1800s is also important to consider, as Georgetown’s culture was deeply intertwined in the system of slavery that existed in the nation at the time.
“One does not wake up one day and imagine the possibility of human bondage. It has to be deeply engrained in the culture in which the possibility of selling human beings is reasonable and legible,” Chatelain said. “It was not only Jesuit slaveholding that formed this experience. It was individual students coming to university with slaves. It was a university contracting slave labor.”
Government professor Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., a member of the working group, said the failings of the Jesuits at the time reflect the failings of the United States as a whole in its support of the institution of slavery.
“I think about the Jesuits who made these decisions. They were very much a product of their time,” Carnes said. “You can say ‘how did this happen among Jesuits?’ but how did it happen in the United States?”
Carnes said this indifference was due in part by a lack of understanding of the principle of sin among Jesuits.
“There was a lack of moral vision,” Carnes said. “They were trapped both by the economy of their day and by the theological thinking of their times.”
Professor of theology emrita Diana L. Hayes said she was surprised at how Catholics, who emphasize the dignity of all human beings, could engage in the sale of persons.
“If we are all created in the image and likeness of God, why were some images seen as lesser than others?” Hayes said. “In the United States, the whole idea of race based on color came into existence as a result of the issue of slavery.”
In an interview with The Hoya, Carr said he hopes for Georgetown to be a role model for other universities in addressing similar issues.
“My hope is that we can show the way towards a real path to greater justice in part because we recognize how we failed, how we created injustice,” Carr said.
Daniella Montemarano (GRD ’18), who attended the event, said she is pleased that Georgetown is continuing to focus on its history with slavery.
“I’m extremely gratified at the continuing attention that’s paid to this issue by the leadership at this university as well as its community, its alumni, its scholars, its professors and its students,” Montemarano said.
Andrew Straky (COL ’20), who also attended the event, said he enjoyed how the panel highlighted the importance of continued dialogue on the issues of slavery, prejudice and discrimination.
“I think it’s really valuable that we are having these types of conversations. I think it’s admirable that the university is willing to look at, understand, comprehend and reconcile our past and the issues we’ve had with it,” Straky said.

I’m astonished that Professor emrita Diana L  Hayes should express surprise at the Catholic Church’s historical failure to respect the dignity of all persons. One need ony read the section on capital punishment in its compendium of official teaching (the Catechism of the Catholic Church) to discover its legacy of SELECTIVE respect for human beings. Even today the Church I was baptised into and of which I remain a member continues, officially, to sanction the taking of human life against its will.
The Catholic Church shows its disrespect for others as well, for example LGBT people, whom it continues to marginalize and victimize through teaching which describes them as “intrinsically disordered” and which, indirectly, sanctions discrimination against them in terms of such matters as employment.

A group of Master of Business Administration students dressed in all black to demonstrate their solidarity with black victims of police brutality during two gatherings at the McDonough School of Business on Oct. 6.
The students engaged in two moments of silence at 12:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. to accommodate students’ different schedules.
Police brutality was brought to the forefront of the national consciousness when Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher on Sept. 16 and police officers shot Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte on Sept. 20 sparking national outrage.
The protest, called the McDonough Blackout Initiative, was sponsored by the Georgetown Black MBA Association, diversity network the Consortium for Graduate Study and Management and the MBA Student Government Association.
The Blackout Initiative was inspired by similar demonstrations at MBA programs across the country, including the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, New York University’s Stern School and Columbia University’s Columbia Business School.
According to Black MBA Association President Jonathan Owhe Jr. (GRD ’17), the initiative aims to show that members of the Georgetown MBA community stand in solidarity for victims of police brutality.
“What we have recently seen in the MBA community and also in the U.S. in general is organizations coming forward and trying to show the police brutality that is current across America is not right and needs to be addressed,” Owhe said.
The MSB administration supported the demonstration. Interim Dean of the McDonough School of Business Rohan Williamson said the event was a constructive way of examining police brutality.
“It is not surprising that our students have elected to confront a difficult issue in a positive way that helps to bring our greater community together,” Williamson wrote in an email to MSB faculty and staff supporting the initiative. “Georgetown University has long valued fighting for social justice, being at the forefront of important national issues, and living as women and men for others.”
MBA Student Government Association Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion Aisha Saber (GRD ’17) said the Georgetown MBA students joined with other MBA programs in promoting the #MBAsOpenUp campaign on Twitter, using the hashtag to spread awareness of injustice toward the black community.
Saber said the MBA Student Government Association stands against racial injustice.
“We strongly believe in the fragility and preciousness of every person’s life,” Saber wrote in the email to the McDonough community inviting students and faculty to take part in the protest. “Therefore, we endeavor to protest the killings of these unarmed human beings.”
In addition to joining the #MBAsOpenUp campaign, Owhe said Georgetown MBA student groups would be hosting community service events aimed at opening dialogue between police and local Washington, D.C. communities.
“We plan to have a community service event that will be more so related to where we can bring an awareness to police brutality and try to help out the African-American community,” Owhe said.
Owhe said he was pleased with the progress Georgetown has made so far in addressing racial injustices.
“I think Georgetown has come a long way,” Owhe said. “The things that we have seen the Georgetown community doing with reparations and also with the support we received when we were trying to launch this event has been amazing and shows Georgetown’s community is aware and is supportive of us.”

Eight Georgetown professors will travel to Quito, Ecuador to attend the third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, focused on addressing the needs of the developing world in the midst of rapid urbanization, from Monday to Wednesday.
The conference — held every 20 years and previously hosted in Vancouver, Canada and Istanbul, Turkey — brings together urban specialists, policymakers and representatives from around the world. The 1996 conference in Istanbul resulted in the adoption of the Habitat Agenda Goals and Principles, a proclamation of two guiding principles for the summit: providing “adequate shelter for all” and establishing “sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world.”
Habitat III will be the first UN conference to follow the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference that led to the Paris Agreement, which saw 191 signatures from member countries agreeing to adopt measures to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2020.
The Georgetown delegation will include professors Uwe Brandes, Shareen Joshi, Robin King, Jamie Kralovec, Mina Marefat, Kaara Martinez, Brian McCabe and Brendan Shane, spanning from the School of Foreign Service to the School of Continuing Studies and specializations in international economics, business diplomacy and urban planning.
According to the draft of the New Urban Agenda, a document outlining the expected outcomes of the upcoming conference, Habitat III envisions attaining social equality, urban prosperity and an end to poverty, even as the world urban population is projected to double by 2050. According to the proposal, the conference plans to achieve these stated goals by changing the means by which cities and human settlements are planned, financed, developed and managed.
Brandes, the founding executive director of Georgetown’s master’s program in Urban and Regional Planning, said he hopes the takeaways of the Paris Climate Summit will be deeply embedded in conversations about achieving urban development at the conference.
“What is becoming very clear is that we cannot achieve global climate change goals without globalizing those solutions and cities,” Brandes said. “The relationship between climate change litigation and urban development is something that I hope will become the very clear outcome of the summit.”
Brandes also said he believes the conference is essential in forging collaborative relationships to better equip stakeholders in tackling the sustainability challenges of the coming century.
“In a sense the conference is a validation of the work that has been ongoing over the last few months or so,” Brandes said. “One of the things that could be so important to make cities sustainable is the new generation of partnerships. I think many of those partnerships will be hatched at the Habitat III conference.”
Program Director for the Urban and Regional Planning Program Kralovec echoed Brandes’ call for cooperation during the conference.
“I would love to see greater coordination across sectors. The work that organizations are doing on urban development would be better coordinated and aligned,” Kralovec said. “One great takeaway from this conference is creating more closely coordinated networks producing ideas, disseminating information, doing research and working together to support the overall goal of creating more sustainable cities.”
Kralovec said the mission of the conference, along with the research of Georgetown’s Urban and Regional Planning Program, resonate with the university’s commitment to social justice.
“Urban planning is a discipline that helps bring the [Jesuit] values alive by supporting community-driven goals and aspirations, and by helping communities realize their ambitions and their aspirations,” Kralovec said. “There’s a strong alignment between urban planning as a discipline and what we’re doing here in the master’s program in the School of Continuing Studies at Georgetown.”
Hoya/Homeless Outreach Programs and Education Co-President Andrew O’Brien (COL ’18), whose organization addresses issues of hunger and homelessness in Washington, D.C., said he hopes the global conversation at the conference can positively impact local urban challenges.
“I hope that this global conference can have physical effects on local homeless populations,” O’Brien said. “That’s very hard sometimes to transform in global conversation to something with local ramifications that are also positive.”
O’Brien said the District provides a rich case study for the conversations addressed by Habitat III.
“I hope they bring the D.C. perspective to this conference. D.C. is a very unique area currently undergoing a lot of changes with homeless services. That’s something that will be very valuable to the Habitat III conference,” O’Brien said. “This is great as a global program, as an advocacy campaign, but I’m very curious what the actual pragmatic results of it will be at the local level.”

After a three-year closure, $69 million in renovations and a 12,250 square feet expansion, the East Building of the National Gallery of Art reopened to the public Sept. 30 with 150 new artworks on display.
The renovations were a result of $39 million in federal funding and $30 million in donations from local philanthropists.
Several renovations, such as the addition of a staircase, were required to ensure the building meets regulations and codes. Other renovations were made to open up new spaces to house more artworks, expanding from 350 works in the permanent collection to 500. Additionally, the new space allows for larger temporary collections.
The reopened building also features a new range of around 50 works acquired in January from the Corcoran Gallery of Art, which closed in 2014. These pieces include works by Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly and Pablo Picasso.
The reopening also marks the beginning of three temporary exhibitions, one of which is courtesy of Virginia Dwan, an art dealer and patron. Dwan’s new contributions are located in a temporary exhibition, “Los Angeles to New York: Dwan Gallery, 1959-1971,” which will remain on display until the end of January.
Originally designed by architect I. M. Pei, the East Building opened in 1978 adjacent to the National Gallery’s West Building, which houses art from the 13th to the 19th centuries.
One of the renovations is the new roof terrace, which connects the two tower galleries and overlooks Constitution Avenue. The previously unused area between the northwest and northeast towers now serves as an open space for visitors to walk through, complete with sculptures.
NGA Curator and Head of Modern Art Harry Cooper said the new outdoor space helps make the National Gallery unique among the other museums on the National Mall.
“It’s so, so wonderful to have that 12,000 extra squarefeet of space up there, that really wasn’t being used, and put it to use with these beautiful galleries, and just to have an outdoor museum space on the Mall is unique,” Cooper said.
Cooper said that by reconsidering the function of each specific space in the East Gallery, the galleries could be repurposed to house different collections.
“One of the major decisions that happened, which then really determined a lot of other things, was the decision to move special exhibitions from the heart of the building, where they had been for a long time on the mezzanine and upper level mostly, down to the concourse — the lower level — to free up those mezzanine and upper level galleries to the permanent collection,” Cooper said.
According to Cooper, moving the permanent collection to the upper level galleries, which are situated around the East Building’s open atrium, allows for a more coherent presentation of the collection.
“The permanent collection of modern art has been growing and growing, and I really wanted to be able to present it, among other things, in a kind of chronological order so people could learn the history of modern art,” Cooper said.
After revisiting the gallery for the first time since its reopening, Asian art history professor Michelle Wang said the use of the upper level and tower galleries stood out to her.
“What struck me this time was that you still have that experience where the galleries are located on the periphery of the building, but now there’s greater coherence and certain galleries are spread out over multiple levels,” Wang said.
According to Renaissance art history professor Al Acres, the museum’s reconfiguration of its permanent collection and special exhibition galleries have enhanced the East Building’s best features while preserving its familiarity.
“The celebratory or contemplative space of the atrium remains what it was — that changes for different people and over time — but the bread and butter, the real work of the gallery can now be done in many different ways,” Acres said.

A virtual kidnapping scam — a hoax where a family is falsely led to believe a loved one has been kidnapped for ransom money — targeted a parent of a Georgetown student Oct. 6, according to a campus-wide email sent by the Georgetown University Police Department on Oct. 7.
GUPD advised the Georgetown community to stay vigilant for potential future abduction scams of a similar nature and to immediately contact the police upon receiving a phone call asking for ransom payments.
The Georgetown parent targeted in the virtual kidnapping was able to establish contact through social media to confirm the student’s safety and did not pay the ransom.
Virtual kidnappings have been on the rise this year, according to the FBI. According to the FBI Washington Field Office, out of the 122 reported kidnappings involving U.S. citizens in 2015, 22 were virtual kidnappings. There have been 19 reported virtual kidnappings as of Sep. 26 this year.
The incidence of virtual kidnapping scams has been increasing in the Washington region, according to The Washington Post.
FBI Washington Field Office Public Affairs Specialist Nicole J. Schwab said the FBI believes a many virtual kidnapping cases are never reported to authorities.
“The F.B.I. believes that a significant number of virtual kidnappings are still going unreported,” Schwab wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Some victims either just hang up the phone and don’t report the incident, or they are embarrassed that they fell victim to the scheme.”
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said the best way the university and its students can respond to reports of online extortion is to gain an understanding of the nature in which these scams are perpetrated to prevent students and their parents from falling victim to such scams in the future.
“The best thing to do is to be informed that these kind of scams exist; look at some of the information that I sent out to parents and students and remember some of those things if in fact you do get one of these phone calls,” Gruber said.
Virtual kidnapping scams typically have readily recognizable characteristics, including requests for relatively low amounts of ransom money, refusal to accept money through any other means aside from a wire transfer and insistence victims stay on the phone for an extended period of time, according to GUPD’s email.
The scammers research the individuals they have kidnapped, including places they often visit and their friends, in an effort to make the fake kidnapping appear realistic, according to Schwab.
“Many of the perpetrators obtain information on a victim by taking their cell phone, wallet, purse or address book, which will give them sufficient information to make phone calls to family members and friends of the victim in order to make ransom demands,” Schwab said.
According to 2015 FBI statistics on virtual kidnapping scams in New York City, scammers typically request between $600 and $1,900 and order the money to be delivered via wire transfer using companies like Western Union. Frequently, the money is wired to third parties in Puerto Rico.
The FBI treats each virtual kidnapping scam as a real kidnapping threat until it finds enough evidence to suggest the abduction is fictitious.
It is difficult for the FBI to take action against virtual kidnapping perpetrators, as the scams are often executed remotely and over untraceable burner phones, according to Schwab. Similarly, university police departments and local law endowment have little they can do to pursue scam perpetrators.
Scammers tend to target affluent areas such as the Beverly Hills region of California and the New York metropolitan area, which have both been disproportionately affected in the past few years, according to The Washington Post.
Nearby schools including the University of Maryland and George Mason University have encountered similar kidnapping scams.
