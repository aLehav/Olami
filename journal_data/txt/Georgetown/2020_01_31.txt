Georgetown University announced a temporary suspension of all Chinese study abroad programs and university-related travel to China for students, faculty and staff Jan. 28 amid rising concerns over the spread of the coronavirus in the region.
The university is in contact with students, faculty and staff who were planning on traveling to the country and is working to coordinate appropriate alternate plans, according to a Jan. 28 universitywide email from Provost Robert Groves announcing the suspension. The decision comes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of State raised their travel advisories Jan. 27 to recommend that travelers avoid nonessential travel or reconsider travel to China, according to Groves’ email.
“While there have been no reported cases with any connection to Georgetown, the university is taking proactive steps to ensure the safety and health of our community out of an abundance of caution, since there is still much about the situation that is unknown,” Groves wrote in the email. 
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China. As of Wednesday, 132 people have died and over 6,000 cases have been confirmed, with five cases confirmed in the United States, according to The New York Times. As of Monday, one person in Washington, D.C. has tested negative for the disease and two people are still undergoing testing after showing symptoms similar to those of the coronavirus, according to the D.C. Department of Health.
The coronavirus ranges in severity from mild respiratory illness to more serious symptoms including death. While experts originally linked the spread of the disease to human contact with infected animals, they now believe that the virus can be spread from person to person, according to the CDC. 
The university’s announcement comes after several study abroad programs independently announced the cancellation of their spring semester programming to their students.
The Council of International Educational Exchange announced the cancellation of all of its programs in China in an email to program participants Jan. 27. The decision was made with the best interests of program participants in mind, according to Sinclaire Jones (MSB ’21), who was set to take part in the CIEE program in Shanghai.
“Of course I’m disappointed to miss out on the opportunity to study in Shanghai, but I believe the program and the University made the right decision,” Jones wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I can only hope for the best for the country and its people and that this virus is somehow contained.”
While the exact number of students affected by the suspension is unknown, the university is actively working with students to coordinate travel plans away from the region, according to Groves’ email.
With the short notice given by the sudden cancellation, coordinating alternate plans will pose a logistical challenge to students, Jones wrote.
“They’re working to place us in alternative programs, but in the likely event that that doesn’t happen, I would have to return to Georgetown and somehow find a way to catch up considering we’re already a month into the semester,” Jones wrote.
Georgetown students who were scheduled to complete programs in Hangzhou and Kunming in collaboration with Middlebury College have the option to spend the spring semester at Middlebury’s campus in Vermont, according to William Mayers, assistant director of international programs at Middlebury.
Though this option is not ideal for some students, it is logistically easier for students since Middlebury’s spring semester does not begin until Feb. 10, according to Mayers.
“We are fully aware that this is not what they want to do, but since we can’t offer them an opportunity in China, we want to make sure that they at least have the opportunity to keep up with their studies so that they can graduate on time,” Mayers wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Replacement programs or opportunities will not provide students with the same caliber of language study, according to Philip Kafalas, associate professor and study abroad adviser for Chinese programs.
“They put a lot of work and long-range planning into getting to that point and were looking forward to both the learning and the adventure that was supposed to happen,” Kafalas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There is no substitute here for study abroad; our Chinese language curriculum is not designed to offer a full load of courses for a student at, say, a third-year level.”
As the outbreak persists, the medical and public health communities are working rapidly to learn more about the coronavirus, according to Jesse Goodman, professor of medicine and director of the Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship.
“While we wait to learn more about this virus and how it is spread, like other respiratory viruses such as flu, spread through contact with sick patients and their cough and other secretions is most likely,” Goodman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While it won’t protect against this novel coronavirus, if you haven’t yet had this year’s flu shot, it’s not too late to reduce your risk of flu, which causes similar symptoms and could be confused with coronavirus.”

Two members of the activist group Refuse Fascism were arrested for unlawful entry by the Georgetown University Police Department while demonstrating in Red Square on Jan. 27. 
Two activists, Luna Hernandez and Bo Login, entered Georgetown University’s campus alongside fellow members of Refuse Fascism, an organization that advocates for the removal of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence through nonviolent protest. Hernandez and Login were passing out flyers and speaking to students midafternoon Tuesday about the ongoing presidential impeachment trial and an upcoming related protest. 
GUPD officers asked the pair to stop distributing flyers on campus, so they decided to relocate to Red Square, which they heard was a free speech zone, to talk to students about their upcoming event without handing out flyers, according to Hernandez. 
GUPD officers arrived in Red Square and instructed the pair to leave. After the two activists refused to leave, officers handcuffed Login. He then began shouting, drawing passing students’ attention, according to video taken by The Hoya.
“Your police came and attacked us and threw us on these benches,” Login said, according to video taken by The Hoya. “We came on this university and we were having casual conversations with people about getting organized and driving out the Trump-Pence regime this Wednesday at the Capitol and your police came and arrested us.” 
After restraining and handcuffing Login, the authorities pushed and arrested Hernandez, she said. 
“They whipped me around, they knocked me to the ground, they pushed me to the ground, and I started yelling in pain, because it was painful, because he started putting his knee in my back, and another police officer came on top of me,” Hernandez said in an interview with The Hoya. “I was like, ‘You’re hurting me! You’re hurting me!’ I was trying to get up, and even when I was trying to get up they yanked me off the ground and they hurt my arm even more.”
Once Login and Hernandez were removed from Red Square, Hernadez then told GUPD officers that she could not feel her hand because the handcuffs were cutting off circulation to her hand, she said in an interview with The Hoya. The officers loosened the handcuffs and then took her and Login into custody where they were held for about three hours, according to Hernandez. 
Any member from the Georgetown community may protest as long as the speaker’s and listeners’ rights to free speech are not violated, according to a university spokesperson. Non-Georgetown affiliated visitors that have not been invited to protest, however, are not allowed to do so on Georgetown property.
“In this instance, as non-students, the protestors were informed that they could continue to protest outside of the front gates or elsewhere off-campus,” the spokesperson wrotesaid in an email to The Hoya. “When they refused, they were removed from campus by GUPD and arrested for unlawful entry.”
The GUPD crime log writes that an unauthorized protester was located in Red Square at 3:24 p.m. after they had been previously escorted off campus, with the case closing in arrest. The log separately lists that an authorized protestor was located in Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall at 3:24 p.m. after they had been previously escorted off campus, with the subjects being barred from campus.
GUPD has not responded to The Hoya’s request for comment at the time of print. 
Although the GUPD crime log says that Hernandez and Login were escorted off campus before their arrest, Raphael Kadaris, a representative from the D.C. team of Refuse Fascism, said that they were never instructed to leave before their arrest. 
“They were not protesting, they were inviting students to a protest this Wednesday at the Capitol,” Kadaris wrote in an email to The Hoya. “They were never actually told they had to leave before they were arrested. They had been told they couldn’t pass out flyers, which they stopped doing.”
The incident was unsettling to watch, according to Leo Rassieur (COL ’23), a Georgetown University Student Association Senator who witnessed the event. 
“I saw a police officer grab her wrist, then she yelled and was pushed to the ground. She was recording the arrest of the other protestor,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
People and groups not affiliated with the university are barred from flyering on campus, according to the university’s Speech and Expression Policy. Only members of the academic community are allowed to hang posters or hand out handbills or pamphlets, the policy reads.  
Open discourse is authorized in specific locations on campus, including Red Square, according to the policy. The policy does not specify if people outside the Georgetown community are welcome in those spaced without an invitation those spaces. 
“Certain areas of campus shall be considered ‘public squares’ and shall be available, without prior arrangement, for individuals and groups during daylight hours for the purpose of exchanging ideas,” the policy reads. 
Login and Hernandez were arrested despite complying with university policy, according to a Refuse Fascism twitter thread chronicling the events of Jan. 27. 
“@Georgetown’s core mission states it is a ‘university with a heart’ dedicated to ‘social justice’ and ‘restless inquiry,’” the tweet said. “Yet they brutally arrested activists engaged in nonviolent speech, simply inviting students to protest a white supremacist, fascist regime?”
Despite the previous day’s events, members of Refuse Fascism, including Hernandez and Login, returned to campus Jan. 28. Hernandez said Georgetown should apologize to her and Login and provide the pair a chance to speak about their experience. 
“I think the university should give us an apology,” Hernandez said. “That was unacceptable, that they violently arrested us, I think that there should be students and professors inviting us to their classes to talk about what actually happened.”

Welcome to the real world little boy and little girl. This country is in the best shape it has been in for a long time. The stock market is setting daily records, unemployment is the lowest it has been in decades and China is not taking advantage of this country trade wise anymore and is getting a taste of there own medicine. Yes the President calls people names ,has a potty mouth and wants people entering this great country to be documented so they can be found if they commit a crime instead of just running back to there third world country  nameless and w/o justice. Get over it and GROW UP.

The campus needs to be a place where students, faculty, and employees all feel safe.  If they have not been invited, someone cannot just decide they want to be on campus for whatever reason.  We all remember the University of Virginia protestors who also were not students and not invited.  And the fact that these intruders had been asked multiple times simply to relocate outside the gates made them even more unpredictable and possibly threatening. Add on top of that, after their arrest, they returned the following day claiming to be asking for an apology — this simply sounds like stalking. Dude, GU is just not into you. You just come on too strong and don’t follow the rules.  I am sure you have good intentions but this relationship is not going to work out. Don’t make it awkward or embarrassing for either side. GU just has other people with whom they want to partner on these very same issues. I know you think if GU could only get to know you, then they would definitely want to be at least friends (maybe more?) — but you don’t respect boundaries. And no means no. So as a parent of a student, I appreciate that GU Police responded to the situation appropriately.

A shared passion for public service guided Nicolo Ferretti (SFS ’21) and Bryce Badger (MSB ’21) to the Georgetown University Student Association, where the two bonded over advocating for student interests. Ferretti and Badger accumulated considerable experience and hope to employ their knowledge as GUSA executives. 
Ferretti and Badger, currently members of the administration of GUSA President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20), hope to use their GUSA experience to launch new initiatives surrounding sustainability, sexual assault and misconduct, facilities and inclusivity. 
In pursuit of their policy goals, Ferretti and Badger have oriented their campaign around several guiding principles, according to Badger.
“Our campaign is built on three core values: being realistic and be proactive, to recognize and embrace intersectionality, and also to own who we are and what we stand by,” Badger said in an interview with The Hoya.
Ferretti currently serves as the GUSA Executive’s director of university affairs. As executive director, Ferretti worked with the university to coordinate a Georgetown University partnership with the Capital Bikeshare University Program, as well as to update the school webpage. He previously worked as a GUSA senator until he resigned to join the executive branch in spring 2018. 
Within GUSA, Badger works as the chief of staff for the Francis-Olvera administration and supervises senior staff, coordinates with advocacy committees and attends meetings with members of the Georgetown administration. Previously, he worked as the GUSA executive treasurer and served as a GUSA senator during his freshman year.
In 2018, Badger also worked as student engagement director for former GUSA President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19). In fall 2018, Badger, alongside Rahman and nine other executive cabinet members, resigned to put pressure on Nair to resign amid sexual assault allegations against him. 
Ferretti’s and Badger’s GUSA experiences will inform how they operate their administration if they win the election, Badger said. 
“I’ve been in a lot of different roles throughout my years, and I think one thing that is really great about that is that Nico and I bring a lot of different experiences to GUSA and a lot of different perspectives from seeing it in different capacities and seeing how the holistic of the organization can implement things to be effective and advocate for students,” Badger said. 
If elected, Ferretti and Badger’s first priority would be to address sexual assault on campus, according to Badger. They plan to work with the Office of Title IX Compliance for survivor protection, particularly in light of the 2019 Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct, in which 31.6% of undergraduate women reported experiencing nonconsenual sexual contact. 
“I was very disconcerted by the sexaul assault climate survey from last year, and I think that really has to be where our efforts are right from the beginning,” Ferretti said. 
Ferretti and Badger would also advocate to move bystander training for first-year students to earlier in the academic year in hopes of lowering sexual assault rates. 
When addressing student facilities concerns on campus, Ferretti and Badger would push the administration to use a $75 million deferred maintenance fund for housing renovations and improved accessibility, Ferretti said. 
To improve inclusivity, Badger proposed working with the administration to allow queer and low-income students who have hesitations about going home to stay on campus during breaks. The Ferretti-Badger administration would also seek expanded resources for queer students and people of color in Counseling and Psychiatric Services. They would also encourage the university to hire more diverse faculty, CAPS staff and staff in the Office of Title IX Compliance, as well as advocate for implicit bias training for selection committees.
The ticket has also set a goal for Georgetown to get 50% of its energy from renewable sources. To reach that goal, they want the university to use greener vehicles, improve access to green transportation like bicycles, build a solar farm and hire a recycling manager, among other initiatives, according to their campaign website. 
Although the 2019 GUSA Executive elections saw the lowest voter turnout since 2007 and 2% of students polled ahead of the election reported strong trust in GUSA, Ferretti and Badger hope to reengage the student body through tangible, visible accomplishments from the beginning of their term. 
“The way that you get people to engage with your projects and engage with you is by having results and making sure you are effective in your advocacy,” Badger said. 
To execute their policy goals, Ferretti and Badger will seek to lower costs and highlight student needs for the administration, Ferretti said. 
“Present these projects as a need for the university,” Ferretti said. “This isn’t like ‘oh, this would be cool.’ This is a need of the students. Students need this now and the second thing is making sure projects are as budget neutral as possible.”
Although Ferretti and Badger have been involved with GUSA since their freshman years, they are both involved with other campus organizations. Ferretti is a science, technology and international affairs major who has participated in the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service’s D.C. Schools Project, school spirit organization Hoya Blue and dance performances Rangila and Reventón Latino. 
Badger, who is majoring in marketing and global business, serves as the director of communications of the Georgetown Aspiring Minority Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs and coordinator for the Business Undergraduates Invested in Leadership Development preorientation program and worked on The Blaxa, an on-campus media group. Badger is also president of the Asian American Student Association. 
As a queer person of color who identifies as Black and Asian and has dyslexia, Badger has felt the need to hide or neglect elements of his identity, he said. Badger is running for the GUSA Executive to advocate for those people who feel like they do not fit into the university community. 
“I’ve always felt like I’ve had to contort myself to fit Georgetown’s mold and not necessarily have Georgetown be accessible to me or work with me. I’ve always felt like I’ve had to fight for my spot in a room,” Badger said. “I’ve always wanted to push for making things more accessible to people like me and people who aren’t like me, so that’s kind of my personal reason of why I am running for GUSA.”

Julio Salmeron-Perla (SFS ’22) and Gabby Elliott Brault (SFS ’21) have teamed up in the past. The pair collaborated to advocate for socioeconomic inclusivity on campus, with Salmeron-Perla working from the Georgetown University Student Association Senate and Elliott Brault pushing in the executive. Their partnership entered a new stage when they petitioned to join the GUSA 2020 Executive election ballot Jan. 24. 
The pair is seeking to better the university by reshaping policies on mental health resources, sexual misconduct and inclusivity. At the core of these policy initiatives is a desire to rework what they perceive to be an ineffective and disconnected GUSA, according to an interview with The Hoya.  
After struggling to find a community that she felt accepted her on campus, Elliott Brault hopes to harness GUSA’s power to make sure every student feels recognized and included. 
“I’ve never felt like I had a very strong place on campus, a very strong identity on campus. I didn’t feel like I belonged to any one group or identity,” Elliott Brault said. “I wanted GUSA to be something that kind of brought students together, and I found that that wasn’t the case. I found that GUSA was lacking in so many different things: communication, transparency, even just getting things done.”
Drawing upon their experiences working in GUSA in the past, Salmeron-Perla and Elliott Brault hope to partner with other student leaders to find effective ways to accomplish concrete goals.
“A big part of our platform is the fact that GUSA is broken. Our slogan is ‘GUSA is broken, let’s fix it together,’” Elliott Brault said. “A big part of that is being together, and that is drawing students in from every different background on campus so that they can communicate with GUSA and actually make a difference within GUSA itself.”
To join the GUSA Executive ticket, presidential hopefuls needed to attend one of two information sessions hosted by the election commission, which only candidates Nicolo Ferretti (SFS ’21) and Bryce Badger (MSB ’21) attended. Salmeron-Perla and Elliott Brault instead joined the race days later via a petition requiring 100 signatures to enter the race. Since the pair launched their petition, two other tickets joined the race by petition. 
Though the pair boasts GUSA experience, they hope to bring fresh perspectives to the table with their candidacy, according to Salmeron-Perla.  
“I think that part of why we ran is because we heard the voice of the student body that was discontent and wanted a challenge to that first ticket, and wanted a second choice, wanted something different something fresh that will start GUSA on a clean slate,” Salmeron-Perla said.
As well as serving as a GUSA senator his freshman year, Salmeron-Perla has been involved in the International Relations Club and international relations publication The Caravel.
Elliott Brault has served as president of the now disbanded United Feminists Club and mentors freshmen in the Georgetown Scholars Program, a campus organization that provides support and mentorship to first-generation or low-income students. 
Elliott Brault also worked as Socioeconomic Advocacy Policy chair in the GUSA executive branch, including during the term of former GUSA President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19). In fall 2018, Elliott Brault resigned along with nine other executive members to put pressure on Nair to resign amid sexual assault allegations against him. 
To address one of the ticket’s policy areas, sexual misconduct on campus, the pair hopes to increase trust in GUSA by making an open space for students to come and talk to specially trained GUSA members who can support them through the Title IX process.  
“I think you can’t prevent sexual assault on campus. You can’t prevent sexual harassment. But you can hold students accountable for it,” Elliott Brault said. “I will walk with students myself to report these things if I have to. I just want them to feel like they have that space on campus.”
Salmeron-Perla and Elliott Brault are not the only students who have low trust in GUSA. According to a poll last year, only 2% of students indicated a strong trust in the student government. In period of low student faith in GUSA, the pair hopes to revitalize support in the institution by being more accessible on campus, specifically for sexual assault survivors.
“I think it’s a long process to rebuild trust in something. I think part of it will be making sure we’re open for survivors to come to us so that we have all the resources they need at the drop of a hat,” Elliott Brault said. “I think part of it is that a lot of students don’t know what GUSA is and they don’t know what GUSA does.”
During their time in GUSA, Salmeron-Perla and Elliott Brault found it difficult to make progress on initiatives with the administration because of the short length of GUSA terms. The team hopes to open up policy proposals and resolutions to the entire student body and encourage students outside of GUSA to spearhead projects, since their commitment to the project goals would likely outlast GUSA terms. 
While the pair does not yet have all of their concrete policies defined, the two hope to be adaptable to students’ current issues and to be more responsive to the Georgetown community, Salmeron-Perla said.
“I think that a big part of what we seek to do is actually stay informed. We’re not here to say, ‘We’re going to promise to end this, or we’re going to stop this,’ but rather, we’re here to start a movement of, ‘We’re going to meet with administrators and actually talk to students,’” Salmeron-Perla said. “We’re going to make GUSA actually be around the students.”
If elected, Salmeron-Perla and Elliott Brault would spend their first 100 days in office working to build a strong executive team and establish relationships with GUSA senators and the larger student body so that they can make progress on tangible goals.
“I think Gabby and I are the best candidates because we see our limitations,” Salmeron-Perla said. “We seek to work with students and the administration to try to work through some of those limitations and improve conditions for all students on campus.”

Arisaid Gonzalez Porras (COL ’21) and Anahi Figueroa-Flores (COL ’21) are both undocumented women who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border when they were toddlers. Both are low-income, first-generation college students, and neither ever expected to be at Georgetown University. 
Gonzalez Porras and Figueroa-Flores met their freshman year in the Community Scholars Program, an initiative organized by the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access to promote diversity and ease the transition of incoming students. Together Gonzalez Porras and Figueroa-Flores manage Hoyas For Immigrant Rights, a student-run advocacy group. Their story continued Jan. 24 when they filed a petition to join the Georgetown University Student Association 2020 Executive election ballot one day before the petition period ended.
After gauging positive interest in their candidacy through Instagram polls on their private accounts, they made the sudden decision to run; however, their motivation for running is clear, Figueroa-Flores said. 
“Sometimes you feel like you don’t belong here, but if you see people who look like us be president and vice president, then I think that’s gonna inspire other people to also run for office, like as senators, and they can feel more welcome on campus,” Figueroa-Flores said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Gonzalez Porras studies American studies and Figueroa-Flores studies computer science. Georgetown offered a full-ride scholarship to Gonzalez Porras, who is also one of 20 Baker Scholars, a selective Georgetown scholarship program. Both Gonzalez Porras and Figueroa-Flores mentor incoming students of color from low-income backgrounds, aiding them in their transition to Georgetown. 
The ticket’s platform is driven by a desire to increase inclusivity and bridge a gaping rift between students and GUSA, according to Figueroa-Flores. 
“GUSA has so many resources that students don’t know about, or at least I don’t even know about either, so it would be putting that knowledge for students and making it more accessible and making GUSA more inclusive, and just bridging that gap between students,” Figueroa-Flores said. 
Among their primary focuses is an expansion of resources for LGBTQ members of the community, according to Gonzalez Porras. 
“There are transgender folks that can still get periods, and they don’t feel comfortable entering the women’s bathroom, so we would want to have something stocked outside, so that none of those decisions don’t have to be made,” Gonzalez Porras said. 
Once in power, the pair would also strive to improve mental health services, particularly focusing on the lack of diversity among mental health officers, Figueroa-Flores said. 
“It’s unacceptable to have that lack of representation on campus and lack of space for students to heal,” Figueroa-Flores said. “I think expanding those spaces for students and also providing staff that is competent for those spaces, especially for communities of color, is really important.” 
Gonzalez Porras and Figueroa-Flores hope to extend their advocacy beyond the student body by celebrating the contributions of campus workers, Gonzalez Porras said. 
“When we see the workers here on campus, I see my parents. My parents do these jobs. My mom’s a housecleaning person and my dad sells used merchandise at flea markets and swap meets,” Gonzalez Porras said. “So seeing the workers here sometimes not even be appreciated — I feel so guilty sometimes being at this school. So one of our things would be a workers appreciation week.” 
Should their administration encounter resistance from university administration on issues like expanding inclusive student resources, the experienced activists are prepared to pressure the university through strategies ranging from conversation to sit-ins, according to Gonzalez Porras. 
“Where the university is now with the LGBTQ Center and having a director for undocumented student services, it hasn’t come out of the goodness of the university — it just hasn’t. It has come because of student activism,” Gonzalez Porras said. “I’m tired of being afraid of institutions in power thinking that they can tell us what to do, but in reality I think the power is in the people.” 
If elected, the ticket would measure their success more broadly than with just particular policy achievements, according to Figueroa-Flores. 
“Knowing that I helped make a change in a student’s life, knowing that GUSA helped make something happen, if that happens in 100 days — I think that would make me happy,” Figueroa-Flores said. 
Gonzalez Porras agreed with her running mate about how they would measure the ticket’s success when in office. 
“I would consider myself successful if you could call someone out on campus and be like, ‘Has GUSA reached out to you in any capacity or in any club that you’re in? Do you know that they’ve reached out to you?’ And if they say yes, that to me would be like we did something,” Gonzalez Porras said.
While Gonzalez Porras and Figueroa-Flores are the only candidates with no prior GUSA experience, they are unfazed by this hurdle, according to Gonzalez Porras. 
“We’re very new at this; we don’t know how GUSA functions,” Gonzalez Porras said. “We have a lot of the skills and tools, and we’ll figure out how we’re going to do it. So I don’t have a doubt that we’ll figure it out, but we just got to get elected first.”
During their tenure in HFIR leadership, Gonzalez Porras and Figueroa-Flores renewed the club’s activism and organized a walkout advocating for the rights of DACA recipients with over 150 students in November. Current members of GUSA have briefed the candidates on GUSA’s basic functions and structure, according to Figueroa-Flores. 
“We’ve already had a couple of meetings with people who are in GUSA, and I think just from hearing them and what they’ve experienced in GUSA, I’ve learned so much already,” Figueroa-Flores said. 
In an effort to empower overlooked perspectives, the ticket’s executive team would consist entirely of women of color, according to Gonzalez Porras. The fresh outlook the candidates bring to the GUSA race will rally student voters to their campaign. 
“We’re two women; we’re Latinas; we’re undocumented. That already says a lot. I think that we would be making history at Georgetown,” Gonzalez Porras said.

After meeting in the Community Scholars Program, an initiative organized by the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access to promote diversity and ease the transition of incoming students, Joshua Marin-Mora (SFS ’21) and Isbel Deleon (COL ’21) discovered a shared interest in advocating for student needs. 
Marin-Mora and Deleon joined the GUSA Executive ballot to continue this activism in the highest positions in student government. Issues the team hopes to highlight during their administration include decreasing the campus sexual assault rate, providing stronger student mental health resources, and improving accessibility and transportation, among other initiatives. 
When deciding to run, the pair emphasized the urgency of addressing issues often overlooked by GUSA, according to Marin-Mora. 
“There are really important issues that are affecting a lot of students that we haven’t seen a lot of impact on but we talk about. Costs continue to rise, the sexual assault rate hasn’t changed and students aren’t feeling supported in the classroom regarding mental health,” Marin-Mora said in an interview with The Hoya. “Georgetown’s most important resource is its students.”
Marin-Mora comes from Reno, Nev., where he was raised by immigrant parents from Costa Rica. At Georgetown University, he studies international politics and is involved with the D.C. Schools Project, CSP and the Georgetown Scholars Program, an organization that provides resources and support to first-generation and low-income students. Marin-Mora also participates with the Latin dance group Ritmo y Sabor. He has also served in the GUSA Senate since winning a seat in spring 2019. 
Deleon hails from the Dominican Republic and studies government in the College. Deleon is active in Blue & Gray and The Corp as well as CSP and GSP. She has also worked as a student guard, in residential living, in the residential hall office and at the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service. Deleon additionally served as a representative for Reventón Latino and is a member of the service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega.
Marin-Mora and Deleon will listen to all students’ concerns to best inform their administration’s initiatives, according to Deleon. 
“We want to see change and we want to drive the impact for the students. We want them to be heard, we want them to feel safe, we want them to feel listened to because I know that is something I have heard going on time and time again,” Deleon said. “We just want to make sure that we try to help them as best as we can. And make sure we find the ways to tackle those important issues and contain and make them at the forefront, because the way this is going it is just not a sustainable relationship.”
The ticket will consider such student perspectives when considering how to better provide resources for first-generation college students on campus. Deleon has proposed a student-faculty mentorship program to help students better communicate to professors their needs as first-generation students.
“I know there have been times I get intimidated to go up to my professor and tell them I am confused on something, and my imposter syndrome can sometimes become very real,” Deleon said. “This mentorship program at Princeton allows first-generation students to build that type of connection with faculty members, and in turn allows faculty members to understand the hardships not only first-generation students go through, but also other students in general.”
In addition to providing more resources for first-generation students, the pair also highlighted policy goals like improving sexual assault policies on campus. One initiative regarding sexual assault on campus that the pair highlighted requires the executive board members of all student clubs on campus to undergo specific training in order to receive club funding from the university. Marin-Mora additionally suggested exploring ways clubs could designate a student sober intervener at social events.
“This isn’t to replace a critical resource that a survivor may need, but a student ought to be able to know that their student leaders can at least recognize situations on how to intervene but also at the same time that they can at least direct a student to resources on campus that they will need,” Marin-Mora said.  
Current campus protocol ineffectively addresses student needs, according to Marin-Mora. The candidate recommended the university hire an administrator focused on university Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and general campus accessibility. 
The ticket also discussed implementing an Open Textbook Network that would make certain materials and textbooks available for free use in academic courses. A similar program at American University saved 1,500 students $251,000 between 2015 and 2017, according to the AU website. 
Though student trust and engagement with GUSA has been low, with last year’s executive election voting reaching its lowest turnout since 2007, Marin-Mora and Deleon hope to rebuild trust with the student body by actively engaging with student organizations. 
Such student engagement will become an essential lever to push the administration to advance GUSA and the student body’s agenda during Marin-Mora and Deleon’s tenure as executives, Marin-Mora said. 
“That is just a small step. But it is directly engaging the students because once that happens, I think that it really does show the administration that GUSA isn’t just as disconnected as it seems, and also importantly, I think it shows students that you don’t have to per se go to GUSA. You can reasonably expect GUSA is coming to you to gather your input,” Marin-Mora said. “We’re that bridge. And we really need to be that bridge.”

Undergraduate tuition to attend Georgetown University for the 2020-21 academic year is set to increase by 3.5% from $55,440 to $57,384, marking the ninth consecutive year of tuition hikes.
Provost Robert Groves announced the tuition increase for the upcoming academic year in a campuswide email Jan 23. This rise in tuition follows the 2.8% increase observed last year. 
Next year, Georgetown plans to make its largest investment in financial aid in university history, with more than $230 million dollars set aside for incoming students, according to Groves’ email. While the university works to minimize tuition increases each year, tuition rates must be set with the university’s commitment to offering a robust financial aid program in mind, Groves wrote.
“We maintain our deep commitment to attracting the brightest students regardless of their financial circumstances,” Groves wrote in his email. “We continue to prioritize cost containment efforts, and have renewed our commitment to securing scholarship funding.”
Georgetown follows a need-blind admissions policy, meaning that the university’s admissions process does not consider financial need when reviewing applications, according to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions website. The university also commits to a financial aid policy that meets all demonstrated need. 
To mitigate the effects of the general tuition rise, the university has worked to cut fees charged in addition to tuition. For the upcoming academic year, the university has eliminated fees for science and language laboratories and course material fees, according to Groves’ email.
Previously, certain language and science courses had a fee associated with their lab or technology components. Students registered for science lab courses were charged $150 per course, according to the university’s revenue and receivables website. A language technology fee of $70 contributed to the operation of Georgetown’s Language Learning Technology Center, which supports students studying a foreign language.
In addition to these set fees, students enrolled in fine arts or performing arts courses often had to shoulder the additional costs of purchasing required course materials, which could range from $50 to $100 in cost, according to the university website.
Groves’ announcement of the upcoming tuition hike comes after a monthslong student-led push for a universitywide tuition freeze. Georgetown undergraduate students called for a tuition freeze in a Feb. 15 editorial in The Hoya. In October 2019, the Georgetown University Law Center Student Bar Association submitted a resolution to Law Center Dean William Treanor, urging the administration to approve tuition rates for the next academic year that match those from this year adjusted for inflation. 
Since students are most directly affected by changes to Georgetown’s tuition, they should have a voice in the decision-making process on setting tuition, according to Georgetown University Student Association press secretary Harper Thomas (SFS ’22).
“The university administration has failed to solicit student feedback and participation in discussion regarding tuition rates and the allocation of funds,” Thomas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We deserve to be aware of discussions surrounding the level of Georgetown’s tuition, and how that tuition money is spent.”
Tuition revenue goes toward a variety of university expenses, including educational instruction, financial aid and student services, according to a projection of expenses included in Groves’ email. 
The university assesses a wide range of factors when considering whether to increase tuition, according to the university spokesperson.
“University leaders, faculty and staff take these investments seriously and work hard each year to reduce direct costs, increase philanthropic support for scholarships and mitigate rising expenses of providing a Georgetown education,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In setting tuition rates, the University must balance the competing needs of academic programs, students, faculty, staff, facilities, and infrastructure.”

Students will vote whether to designate Georgetown a Blue Campus on Feb. 6 after the Georgetown University Student Association Senate passed legislation to put forth a referendum to the student body Jan. 26.
The Blue Campus label would serve as a university pledge to commit to environmental sustainability and protection of ocean habitats. The referendum encourages the university to adopt particular sustainability policies, including investment in renewable energy sources and carbon offset programs, which seek to counteract fossil fuel emissions. The referendum would also call for increased education on environmental sustainability and reduced use of plastics and other possible pollutants.
The referendum will appear on the ballot of the GUSA Executive elections Feb. 6, alongside a separate referendum advocating for the university’s divestment from fossil fuels.
The idea of designating Georgetown as a Blue Campus began in the fall with the creation of the Blue Campus Working Group on Nov. 24, according to GUSA Senator Leo Rassieur (COL ’23), an early advocate for the referendum. Designating Georgetown as a Blue Campus could set a valuable precedent for other universities looking to pursue environmentally friendly policies, according to Rassieur.
“We started this idea of us declaring ourselves to be a Blue Campus and what it would look like to do that, because even though we want this to be a national movement that spreads to other colleges and universities, it’s obviously not something that has ever been defined before, in terms of what specific policies are required,” Rassieur said in an interview with The Hoya.
The referendum is critical to addressing climate change due to its emphasis on ocean preservation, Rassieur added.
“In terms of past environmental policy, especially by the university, there isn’t much attention to the effects of things like ocean acidification or plastic dumping or coral bleaching, and all of the available science suggests that these are things that are accelerating climate change,” Rassieur said.
The Blue Campus initiative will help the university consolidate its patchwork of environmental policies, according to Blue Campus Working Group member Ally Pyne (COL ’23). 
“I think the university does a pretty good job of having green and sustainability initiatives, but there’s not one cohesive space, and that’s what the point of the referendum is: to bring initiatives together,” Pyne said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The referendum’s first iteration failed to pass the two-thirds majority threshold for referenda at a senate meeting Jan. 20, with 17 senators voting in favor and seven voting against. Six of the dissenting senators, who cited lack of specificity in the original referendum, voted in favor of the renewed referendum, which passed 23-1. The new referendum added new details and slashed unnecessary ones, according to senator Juliana Arias (SFS ’20), who voted against the original referendum but supported the renewed version. 
Members of the Blue Campus Working Group added an additional section to the referendum that would create a task force to implement the policies, causing the referendum to appear more feasible, according to Blue Campus Working Group member Rowlie Flores (COL ’23).
“Our referendum is more broad and that’s why we wanted to create a committee to help address the policies we presented,” Flores said in an interview with The Hoya.
The task force would include GUSA senators, members of the student body, and university administrators, according to Rassieur. 
During the past decade, the university has worked to implement environmentally friendly policies. In early January, LEO MKT introduced reusable dishware. One year earlier, the Office of Sustainability, created to reduce the university’s environmental footprint, was nominated for a sustainability award. 
The referendum previously included policies that would ensure the university’s divestment from fossil fuels, but this section was removed before the new version of the referendum was introduced. The Blue Campus Working Group, however, is still supportive of the idea, according to Rassieur.
“The divestment referendum is a movement that we’re working really closely with, and obviously our values are super aligned because both of our referenda are about getting the university and the student body to take action to preserve the environment,” Rassieur said.
Rassieur also noted the importance of student support, saying that the university was unlikely to act without encouragement from the student body.
“Unless there’s a strong way to measure how much support we have for our policies, like a referendum, then the university won’t act,” Rassieur said. “Hopefully if we get the support that we want on this referendum vote then we’ll have the momentum we need to really accelerate this talk about climate change, because we really don’t have time to keep waiting around on these policies.”

Freedom of expression is a universal aspiration among people, but journalists and policymakers must be cognizant of diverse cultural and political circumstances when promoting free speech abroad, panelists said at a Jan. 30 event.
The event, titled “Exporting the First Amendment: Noble, Impractical, or Wrong?,” was hosted by The Free Speech Project, a nonpartisan initiative working to assess the condition of free speech in the United States. At the event, panelists discussed the intersection of international journalism and the spread of free speech around the world.
Journalists who attempt to promote free speech in countries with oppressive regimes face great risks, according to the Director of Voice of America, an international news and broadcast organization, Amanda Bennett, who moderated the event.
“Everyday I’m watching people in repressive regimes come to seek us out even when their countries block us out, and I take it from that that there is a huge demand around the world for a free press,” Bennet said. “But, one of the things that we notice, is also we find we’re putting our journalists often in great risk to make them a part of this endeavor.”
These foreign journalists who face censorship in their native countries may face dangerous repercussions from their governments for their commitment to free press, according to Foreign Affairs Columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer Trudy Rubin.
“What I find is that there is an instinctive hunger for young people who have an interest in journalism to try to get information, real information,” Rubin said. “Over and over again, I’ve found this bravery, but it does create moral issues.”
Rubin specifically cited cases in Syria where local journalists trained in reporting were killed as part of the ongoing conflict in the region to illustrate threats to free speech. An estimated 147 Syrian journalists have been killed between 1992 and 2020, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Austin Tice, a second-year law student at the Georgetown University Law Center, went missing in Syria in 2012 while traveling in the country to report on the escalating civil war between the Syrian government and rebel forces. Tice is believed to have been kidnapped by an affiliate of the Syrian government.
Other featured panelists for the event included Ethiopian Ambassador to the United States H.E. Fitsum Arega, Associate Editor at The Washington Post Karen DeYoung and U.S. Correspondent for the Straits Times of Singapore Nirmal Ghosh.
When covering political issues, such as ethnic conflicts in foreign nations, journalists need to educate themselves on the country’s history to gain a better understanding of the context of the situation, according to Ghosh.
“I think there should be cognizance of the nuances of the history of the ethic divisions, the bad baggage of post-colonial history,” Ghosh said. “I find that in the modern discourses, even in the media because the news cycle has become so franetic, and its instant, that it often lacks context. It lacks historical context, it lacks immediate context.”
When traveling to foreign countries, journalists can gain valuable perspectives from interacting with locals, according to DeYoung.
“We as correspondents going places, I think that we find in dealing with local journalists that they are really, without exception, in my case at least, are so eager to seek you out and actually help you,” DeYoung said. “And I think that as correspondents we really couldn’t even do our jobs if we didn’t have the assistance of local reporters.”
In a time when foreign countries face threats to free speech, many foreign citizens see the United States as the protector of free speech around the world, which is an image the U.S. must strive to maintain, according to Ghosh.
“America has always stood for something, despite its credibility issues and its had credibility issues all the time, supporting dictators, regimes and so forth,” Ghosh said. “But it’s always stood for something and if that gets eroded, that’s a problem.”

As students protested outside Healy Hall, speakers at the 21st annual Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life discussed the intersection of law, morality and human dignity within the anti-abortion argument Jan. 25. 
The theme of this year’s conference, “The Consistent Life Ethic and the Law: the Ethical Argument for Life,” focused on the rise of the anti-abortion movement, especially given the recent passage of anti-abortion laws on the state level and themes of public morality and human dignity. COCC has historically drawn student criticism. This year’s protests began Jan. 23 when student activists chalked messages in Red Square opposing the event.
Although fighting for anti-abortion causes may become tiresome, people must seek to develop a society that protects and cherishes all life, according to one of COCC’s keynote speakers Jonathan Reyes.
“There’s can be something romantic about finding a cause, falling in love with it. Caring for people. But romanticism about caring for the elderly, caring for the poor, caring for the unborn, caring for mothers, it will wear off,” he said. “Build a culture of life. Give everything you have for it. Not just because the culture needs you but because you need it. Let’s change the conversation that all may know they have an inherent dignity.”
Reyes serves as the executive director for the Department of Justice, Peace and Human Development and the assistant general secretary for integral human development at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The second keynote speaker at COCC was Bethany Madonna, vocation director for Sisters of Life, a Catholic religious community of women dedicated to promoting anti-abortion causes.
COCC, which was originally founded by Georgetown University students in 2000, convenes students, clergy and activists from around the country to engage in discourse over a variety of anti-abortion topics, according to the COCC website.
The pro-abortion rights argument’s emphasis on attaining greater dignity for all human beings is applicable to women who choose to get abortions, according to Madonna.
“We see in their hearts the sorrow, the pain, the shame, the guilt, the depression, the anxiety, the anger,” Madonna said. “Jesus comes. Jesus comes, and his mercy has real power to make them new, to restore innocence.”
Following the keynote addresses, the recipient for the Rev. Thomas King, S.J. Award was announced. The award, which was granted to two groups the University of St. Thomas Celts for Life this year, recognizes collegiate anti-abortion groups. The all-day conference also featured a panel discussion on the theme of consistent life ethic and the law later in the afternoon.
H*yas for Choice, an unrecognized pro-abortion rights student group on campus, organized a protest in Healey Circle on the morning of COCC. The protest was supported by the Georgetown University College Democrats and GU Pride.
The purpose of the protest was to raise awareness about the harmful beliefs propagated by COCC and to demand that the university end its support of COCC, according to HFC President Talia Parker (COL ’20).
“We’re out here today because we don’t believe in anything the Cardinal O’Connor conference stands for, and we think it’s crazy that Georgetown funds and supports this and that administrators come to this,” Parker said. “We’re out here to show that this conference actively makes students on campus feel unsafe and that Georgetown should not be supporting this in any way. Ultimately, we want this conference to be gone from this school forever.”
Cardinal John O’Connor (GRD ’70) has faced criticism for his condemnations of the LGBTQ community. He supported the prohibition of LGBTQ Catholics from the property of the Diocese of Brooklyn and opposed the 1986 passage of a New York City bill that would have banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, according to The New York Times.
Continuing to host an event in the namesake of a person who held anti-LGBTQ beliefs tarnishes the work student activists have done to promote inclusion on campus, according to GU Pride Co-President Siena Hohne (COL ’22).
“The Cardinal O’Connor Conference for Life has no place at Georgetown University, where we have worked tirelessly to foster an environment that is not only accepting, but celebratory of the LGBTQ+ community,” Hohne said.
Many OCC organizers and attendees were shocked by the heated nature of the protest against OCC, according to OCC Press Coordinator Sam Dubke (SFS ’21).
“We object to the particularly vitriolic rhetoric used by protestors this year,” Dubke wrote. “It was particularly shocking to watch our Georgetown peers shout slogans like ‘f**k the Church’ at students and nuns as they attempted to enter our conference.We hope that, in the future, we can engage in more respectful dialogue with our fellow Hoyas.”
Hoya Staff Writer Ashley Zhao contributed reporting.

Instead of celebrate the event, you choose to focus on student protestors? That’s ridiculous. Mediocre reporting at best.

Dan 1991 says 
February 2, 2020 at 5:29 pm
Are there any Catholics left on the Hoya? This author pays more heed to an aggreieved pro-abortion club than a conference seeking solutions wthin a central tenet of the Church, the same Church that Georgetown University is aligned with. Or do students not know this when they arrive? Funny how diversity is all supreme, until the diversity is of opinions you don’t agree with.

The Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees has entered into negotiations with Georgetown University by engaging in weekly bargaining sessions in an attempt to finalize its first union contract.
Every Tuesday for the rest of the semester, members of GAGE’s bargaining committee will speak with administrators in an attempt to reach an agreement on a union contract to go into effect for the fall 2020 semester, according to the GAGE website. 
GAGE hopes graduate student workers will attend the bargaining sessions to stand in solidarity with their fellow students, according to a Jan. 20 update posted on the GAGE website.
“By attending a bargaining session, you can learn more about the graduate experience at Georgetown and show your support for your friends and colleagues at the table,” the update read. “More importantly, you can remind the administration that you and hundreds of graduate employees like you will do what it takes to win a contract.”
Going into contract negotiations this semester, GAGE’s bargaining committee will emphasize specific areas of focus highlighted by responses to its January 2019 bargaining survey, which flagged key concerns of graduate employees, members and nonmembers of GAGE. These areas of focus include increased worker compensation, expanded health care coverage and improved reporting processes for harassment and discrimination, according to GAGE bargaining committee member Jewel Tomasula, who is pursuing a doctorate of philosophy in the department of biology. 
Finding ways to relieve the burden of health care costs for graduate students will be a priority in the upcoming negotiations, according to Tomasula.
“Most graduate workers’ only source of income and only option for healthcare is what Georgetown provides,” Tomasula wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, the stipends for PhD students and wages for hourly work are far below livable wages for DC, and the student healthcare options pose a financial burden.”
The university has already reached tentaive agreements with GAGE on proposals regarding management rights, union rights, grievance and arbitration procedures and procedures to address claims of discrimination and harassment, according to a university spokesperson. During the bargaining sessions, GAGE and university administrators will negotiate over topics including service hours, stipend levels for students who are serving as research or teaching assistants and benefits, according to a university spokesperson.
The university would like to reach a collective bargaining agreement by the end of this spring semester, a university spokesperson wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
“Georgetown University shares GAGE’s belief in the important role that graduate student assistants play and shares its commitment to giving them a strong voice as members of our community,” the university spokesperson wrote. “In order to respect the collective bargaining process, discussions on all matters subject to negotiation should take place at the bargaining table.”
GAGE voted to unionize in November 2018 following a yearlong push to receive official recognition as a union from the university. GAGE elected 14 members to the union’s bargaining committee Feb. 8, 2019 in preparation for the beginning of worker contract negotiations with the university.
The salary and stipends offered to graduate student workers are not sufficient to cover rent and other expenses, according to bargaining committee member Marya Hannun, a seventh year Ph.D. student in the Islamic studies department, who has worked as a teaching assistant while pursuing her degree. 
“Currently, we don’t have the protections or salary to make pursuing a phd easy for someone without a safety net or with any sort of dependents,” Hannun wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m so privileged to have that safety net of parents who can help me out, but I want a contract so people who don’t have those safety nets can also do this work.”

The Georgetown University Law Center has reconvened its Speech and Expression Committee to consider changing school policy on inviting speakers and responding to disruptive protests after a law student-led protest prevented an invited speaker from delivering a keynote address last October.
In October 2019, the Law Center invited then-acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan to give the keynote address at its annual policy and law conference. When McAleenan attempted to speak, protestors, which included law students and professors, shouted chants until McAleenan left the stage.
The Speech and Expression Committee will provide recommendations on whether there should be constraints on which outside speakers may be invited to speak on the Law Center campus, how the school should respond to disruptive protests during an event and whether the school should take disciplinary or other administrative action against students, faculty or staff disruptors, according to a Jan. 16 email sent by the Speech and Expression Committee to Law Center students. 
Students who participated in the October protest launched a petition Jan. 21 to oppose any potential rule changes, especially those that would punish peaceful protestors, according to Samuel Singleton-Freeman (LAW ’22), who helped craft the petition. The petition received over 140 signatures from students, faculty, staff and alumni by Jan. 26, according to Singleton-Freeman. 
The petition, which was addressed to Law Center Dean William Treanor, said the Law Center’s consideration of implementing disciplinary measures to punish protestors undermines its commitment to free speech.
“One does not have to support the cause of a specific protest to know that punishing peaceful protesters would have a chilling effect on free speech and expression across campus,” the petition read. “We urge you to respect the right to dissent. We urge you to not punish protesters and to reject any changes making it easier to punish protesters in the future.”
The Speech and Expression Committee, comprised of students, senior staff and faculty, will review practices at peer institutions and university policies and practices to develop its recommendations. The committee released a confidential Google form and hosted a listening session Jan. 24 to solicit student feedback.
The Law Center held the listening session in accordance with its commitment to upholding its values of free speech and expression, according to GULC spokesperson Tanya Weinberg.
“Georgetown’s Speech and Expression Policy provides that faculty and student groups may invite outside speakers and guests to campus,” Weinberg wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Similarly, it affords the right to members of our community to share their own views and objections about a speaker and to protest peacefully in a manner that does not interfere with the audience’s right to listen and with the safety and security of our campus.”
The committee hopes to find the best way to allow both future speakers and protestors to make their voices heard, according to Weinberg.
“The purpose of the committee process, including the listening sessions, is not to address or punish conduct at past protests,” Weinberg wrote. “The purpose is to consider the best path forward in balancing the competing concerns of the right to speak and the right to protest at the Law Center.”
Rather than only allowing administrators to choose which speakers come to campus, students, faculty and professors should have a say in deciding whose voices should have a platform on campus, according to Jeremy Penn (LAW ’21), who participated in the October protest.
“The situation as its currently structured is that all the power rests in the hands of the administrators, and so, we the students have very limited capacity to pick people as influential as Former Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, or any of the many other high profile speakers we have come to campus,” Penn said. “Because there is no accountability by students or by faculty, it’s really really hard to say this is something that is representative of the Georgetown community.”

The Georgetown Collaborative Diplomacy Initiative hosted its first Chinese New Year Celebration to promote cultural diplomacy between American and Asian Cultures on Jan. 24. 
GCDI, a graduate student organization funded by the School of Foreign Service, seeks to educate Georgetown University students about the factors influencing diplomacy, facilitate experiences with practitioners and seek new solutions to diplomatic problems. The event was celebrated a day before the 2020 Chinese New Year, also called Lunar New Year, an observance of the start of the new year in a lunar calendar. 
The event, which took place in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room, sold out with over 130 guests in attendance, according to second-year Masters student in the School of Nursing and Health Studies and President of GCDI Heerak Kim. GCDI and co-sponsors organized the event to promote intercultural engagement by embracing Chinese and other global cultures, according to Kim.
“The purpose of Chinese New Year Celebration is to practice cultural diplomacy by wanting people who are not Chinese to come and meet Chinese individuals who are students at Georgetown so that we have cultural exchange and creation of mutual understanding, which is the bedrock of cultural diplomacy,” Kim said.
The UCLA Network of Washington, D.C. and the University of California, Berkeley, Association of Washington, D.C.. were co-sponsors of the event. Both organizations offer opportunities and resources within the private sector, academia, civil society and cultural and religious institutions alongside traditional diplomatic organizations in D.C. for alumni and current students.
The event gave attendees the opportunity to learn about Chinese students’ experiences celebrating Chinese New Year in China, according to Greg Cooper, an attendee who heard about the event from the UCLA Alumni Association. 
“People were really friendly, the food was really good, and I heard some great singing,” Cooper said in an interview with The Hoya. “I learned, at my table there were a couple of students from China, so I learned about their traditions, and how they would celebrate with their family back in their hometown.”
The event featured performances by two Georgetown acapella groups, Georgetown Superfood and the Georgetown GraceNotes, as well as a blessing from Fr. Christian Wagner, S.J., a member of the Georgetown Jesuit community who has done mission work in Taiwan and mainland China, and a speech from Maryland’s 2nd District Republican Candidate Genevieve Morris.
The performances at the event by Superfood and the GraceNotes show how Chinese New Year is a celebration that can be appreciated by all, not just those with Chinese heritage, according to Kim.
“We brought Superfood and GraceNotes because cultural exchange goes both ways,” Kim said. “Having the two music groups allows the opportunity for global celebration of Chinese New Year as something that is not confined to the Chinese people, or Asian people, but that it is an international celebration, and an important one.”
The GraceNotes’ performance of “Gong Xi, Gong Xi,” a popular Chinese New Year song, was especially impressive, according to second-year Masters student in the learning, design, and technology program Sandy Lee.
“I was not expecting them to sing in Chinese, but that was unique, and in my experience I don’t know of any other schools that have the acapella groups singing in a different language so that was impressive,” Lee said in an interview with The Hoya.
The event comes days after the Georgetown University Student Association unanimously passed a resolution calling on the university to recognize the Lunar New Year on the official Georgetown University calendar and their social media platforms at a Jan. 20 meeting.
The celebration represented an important step for the Georgetown community toward intercultural appreciation and understanding.
“I think that this celebration is great, we have over 130 people attending today to celebrate Chinese New Year,” Kim said. “I think this is a monumentally important event for Georgetown University in terms of cultural understanding, cultural diplomacy, and/or encouraging understanding of Chinese culture, Chinese history and Chinese people.”

Former Georgetown University parent Karen Littlefair pleaded guilty in federal court Jan. 22 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud after prosecutors said she paid a private company to take online classes for her son.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office recommended a four month sentence, $9,500 fine and 12 months of supervised release, according to court documents. Littlefair entered into a plea agreement Dec. 9, according to a U.S. Department of Justice news release.
Littlefair paid William “Rick” Singer’s for-profit college counseling and preparation business, The Key, $9,000 to take online classes for her son James Littlefair (COL ’18) to satisfy his Georgetown graduation requirements, according to charging documents. One class was taken at Arizona State University, but then transferred to Georgetown for credit, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
Littlefair was the 53rd person and fifth Georgetown parent charged in the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal, a national investigation into parents who collaborated with Singer to illegally improve their children’s college admissions chances or fulfill graduation requirements. 
Littlefair reportedly emailed Singer with questions and concerns over ways to obtain college credits for her son without him taking courses, including asking for the completion of an online history course to satisfy Georgetown requirements, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen, the prosecutor on Littlefair’s case.
“The credits were submitted to Georgetown, and based in part on these credits, on or about May 19, 2018 Littlefair’s son graduated from Georgetown University and was issued a diploma,” court transcripts said.
In March, four Georgetown parents and former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst were charged by the Department of Justice in connection to the scandal. The university first discovered Littlefair’s misconduct through an internal investigation stemming from the indictments brought against the former parents and Ernst. 
Ernst, who was asked to resign by the university in 2017 after a university investigation, separately pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy charges in March 2019. Ernst was additionally indicted with over 10 additional charges, including mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering Oct. 22, according to ABC News. 
Ernst pleaded not guilty to the added charges in Oct. 2019, and does not have any further scheduled court appearances scheduled. A pretrial meeting for Ernst’s case is scheduled to take place in April 2020.
Manuel and Elizabeth Henriquez, Douglas Hodge and Michaelle Janavs, four other Georgetown parents tied to the scandal who were charged with bribery and fraud, previously changed their pleas from not guilty to guilty at a federal court in Boston on Oct. 21.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prevents university officials from commenting on the specifics of any individual student’s case, university spokesperson Meghan Dubyak wrote in an email to The Hoya. When alumni are accused of violating the Honor System, the university Honor Council reviews the case.
“When the University learns of a potential serious violation of the Honor System after a student has graduated, the Honor Council will investigate and adjudicate the case and may recommend sanctions up to and including the revocation of the student’s degree,” Dubyak wrote.
Previously, the university rescinded the admission of two students linked to the scandal through their parents. One of the two students, Adam Semprevivo, brought a lawsuit against the university alleging wrongful disciplinary actions. (Full disclosure: Semprevivo previously served as a cartoonist for The Hoya.) He then dropped the lawsuit two months after his degree was rescinded on May 15. 
Going forward, federal prosecutors do not have any present plans to investigate or charge Littlefair’s husband or son, according to Rosen. 
“It’s not our present intention to charge the son or the husband for this conduct and, again, we don’t view this as a promise or inducement, simply based on the information we know to date,”  court transcripts said. 
Littlefair’s attorney, Kenneth Julian, declined to comment. Littlefair’s sentencing date is set for May 13.

Bisi Okubadejo (LAW ’03) started the role as the Georgetown University’s first associate vice president of equal opportunity, affirmative action and compliance Jan. 27. 
Okubadejo will help oversee efforts to prevent instances of discrimination on campus, according to Rosemary Kilkenny (LAW ’87), the university’s vice president for diversity, equity, and inclusion and chief diversity officer. Okubadejo will also manage the daily operations of the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action, which works to promote equality in educational, employment and contracting opportunities, according to Kilkenny. 
Okubadejo will help address cases of discrimination filed with the IDEAA office, as well as with external federal and city agencies, and will help lead efforts at the university to promote nondiscrimination. 
“The role presents an incredibly unique opportunity to give back to my alma mater while addressing cases of discrimination, and working as part of a team that is committed to building an inclusive community,” Okubadejo wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Okubadejo previously participated in Teach for America and attended Hamilton College before attending school at the Georgetown University Law Center. 
Okubadejo taught in the Baltimore City Public School system, the same system that her mother and other family members attended when it was segregated, according to a university news release announcing her new position. She said her experience as a public school teacher influenced her decision to attend law school and pursue a career in promoting inclusion and equitable opportunities for all. 
Okubadejo worked at the law firm Ballard Spahr for the last six years, where she addressed higher education civil rights, regulatory compliance and Title IX discrimination compliants on gender, according to the news release. 
Before working at Ballard Spahr, she practiced law at the firms Venable and Hogan & Hartson, where she worked on employment issues. She also worked at the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education, according to her LinkedIn. 
In her new role, Okubadejo will supervise a multifaceted group including a senior investigator and counsel, a director of affirmative action training programs, a director of affirmative action compliance and data analytics, as well as an associate director, according to Kilkenny. 
Okubadejo hopes to lead her new team with a focus on improving the university’s response to student discrimination complaints, she wrote.
“I look forward to looking into the issues of equal opportunity and affirmative action, and working with Rosemary as well as the team at IDEAA, to strengthen the university’s capacity to address complaints of unlawful discrimination and harrassment,” Okubadejo wrote.
As part of Okubadejo’s new role, she will take over some duties that Kilkenny performed in her former role as vice president of institutional diversity and equity. In April, Kilkenny was appointed the university’s vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion and as its first chief diversity officer. The university created both Okubadejo’s and Kilkenny’s roles as part of a broader effort to promote an inclusive campus environment and equitable opportunities for all students, according to the press release. 
Kilkenny’s role expanded when the university appointed her as its first chief diversity officer and the vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion, according to the news release.
By hiring Okubadejo to take on some of her former responsibilities, Kilkenny will be able to allot more energy to expanding the scope of her diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, she wrote.
“Bisi’s new associate vice president role allows me to more fully expand institutional efforts to demonstrate Georgetown’s commitment to diversity and equity and inclusion, and I am excited by the new energy, skills and capacity that her role brings to our team,” Kilkenny wrote in an email to The Hoya.

All Ukrainians should work together to address ongoing human rights violations in Crimea, Ukranian writer, filmmaker and former political prisoner Oleg Sentsov said at a panel Monday.
Crimea has been a center of conflict between Ukrainians and Russians since the 2014 Ukranian revolution in Kyiv that resulted in the removal of pro-Moscow Ukranian President Viktor Yanukovych. Following Yanukovych’s removal, Russian President Vladimir Putin called on the Russian Federation to annex the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, officially a part of Ukraine, citing pro-Russian sentiments in the region. 
The conflict has created more than 10,000 civilian casualties and displaced an estimated 1.5 million within the region, according to the Council on Foreign Relations’ Global Conflict Tracker. The ongoing hostilities in Crimea has persisted into 2020 and continues to cause casualties, according to Sentsov.
“Six years. For six years they’ve been fighting and the fight is still going on,” Sentsov said. “14,000 people perished; that is too much. And the war is ongoing and is not ending.”
The conflict has also seen an increase in human rights violations in Crimea, such as the forced enlistment of Crimean citizens in the Russian armed forces, with those who oppose the draft facing criminal charges, according to the Human Rights Watch. 
Given the persistent conflict in Crimea, Ukrainians and Crimeans should unite to preserve Ukraine and fight for their freedom, according to novelist and President of PEN Ukraine Andrey Kurkov, who was one of the other panelists.
“In Ukraine, freedom is more important than loyalty,” Kurkov said. “Ukrainians from different regions should find the balance between respect and love for freedom, and somebody else’s opinion and loyalty to their country, because only when the country is in danger do Ukrainians unite, because they understand they can not only lose their country, they can lose their freedom.”
The event, titled “Fighting for Human Rights in Crimea,” was co-sponsored by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, PEN America, the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation and the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies. The panel included Sentsov, Kurkov and Ukranian civic activist and journalist Maria Tomak. The panel was moderated by former U.S. Ambassador to Lithuania, Georgia, Ukraine, and Russia John Tefft (GRD ’78).
Sentsov, who was vocal in his opposition to the Russian takeover of his native Crimea, was detained in May 2014 by Russian authorities and sentenced to 20 years in a Russian prison on terrorism charges in August 2015. He was released from a Russian penal colony in September 2019 after five years of detention.
Sentsov was awarded the 2017 PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award, which is an award that seeks to end the persecution of authors and defend free expression by honoring writers who have been imprisoned for their work. Sentsov’s imprisonment tested his integrity and loyalty to the Ukrainian cause, according to Sentsov.
“A person never knows how resilient his endurance is and what he’s capable of until he finds himself in a complicated situation. When he is faced with a choice of whether to fight for his dignity and for his country or to surrender,” Sentsov said. “What prison teaches you is patience to preserve your personality to preserve yourself as a person and not to break and to just live through it, overcome.” 
In December 2019, Putin defended rebel, pro-Russian leaders in Ukraine after the Ukrainian government denounced the rebels’ claim to independence as illegal, according to the BBC.  The annexation of and continued war over Crimea is a strategic move by Putin to expand Russian territory and to regain regions formerly controlled by the Soviet Union, Sentsov said. 
“Putin’s objective is not Crimea or Donbass and even not Ukraine per se,” Sentsov said. “His target is the sphere of influence that consists of all the former republics of the former Soviet Union, and he perceives these former republics as his sphere of influence and he’s punishing those countries that are trying to leave the zone of his influence.”
The Crimean government held a referendum in March 2014 to determine whether its citizens wanted to join the Russian Federation or restore the Crimean constitution. 95.5% of voters supported joining the Russian Federation with 83% voter turnout. The Ukranian and U.S. governments maintain that the referendum was illegitimate. 
Sentsov said the referendum was not conducted in accordance with Ukranian law and international standards, and pressure from Russia likely played a role in the passing of the referendum. 
“To that fake referendum that was conducted over there, no referendum can be conducted when the gun is pointed at your temple and under the knife of the foreign army,” Sentsov said. “So, I do not believe the results of the referendum.”

Georgetown University professor Uwe Brandes was sworn in as the chairman of the District of Columbia Commission on Climate Change and Resiliency on Jan. 15.
Brandes was appointed by Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) to chair the commission. The 16-member commission advises the mayor and the D.C. Council on the best practices to integrate issues associated with climate change into the city’s policies and budget, according to a news release from the Georgetown School of Continuing Studies. 
Through his role on the commission, Brandes hopes to push the city to take on a more significant role in combating climate change on both a local and global level, he said.
“I’m very much looking forward to crafting an important role for the commission in the context of Washington,” Brandes said in an interview with The Hoya. “But, because Washington is a global city with many other cities looking to Washington for best practices, I look forward to positioning the city in the global effort to mitigate climate change.” 
Although cities make up less than 2% of the Earth’s surface, cities consume 78% of energy production worldwide and contribute to more than 60% of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations Human Settlement Programme. Despite D.C.’s small size, changes made on the city-level has the potential to have a large global impact on alleviating the effects of climate change, Brandes said. 
“Climate change impacts everyone everywhere, and so the role of the city in advancing climate solutions should not be underestimated,” Brandes said. “The regulation of buildings has always been a city function, so you can see just with that example how strategic climate change and cities are.”
Brandes currently serves as the faculty director for the master’s in urban and regional planning program at Georgetown’s School of Continuing Studies. Focusing on careful planning when considering urban development and design can create a more sustainable city, according to Brandes. 
“The issues of urban planning relate to transportation, relate to buildings, relate to public spaces, and the impact of climate change and the sources of emissions relate directly to how those uses are organized in a city,” Brandes said. “The solutions lie before us in the functioning and operations of the city. So that’s why urban planning really is about climate planning.” 
The Commission on Climate Change and Resiliency was established in 2016 by the D.C. Council. The commission is comprised of 16 voting members, eight of whom are appointed directly by Bowser. Georgetown professors Kathryn Zyla, an adjunct professor of law, and Colin McCormick, an adjunct associate professor within the science, technology and international affairs program at the Walsh School of Foreign Service, will join Brandes on the commission. 
The commission brings together a diverse panel of experts from a variety of fields, Brandes said.
“I’m just overjoyed to see that other Georgetown faculty are participating in the commission,” Brandes said. “We are at a time where research and practice are coming together in the form of new, innovative solutions, and so it’s wonderful to see that we have other academics on the commission.” 
In addition to teaching, Brandes also serves as the faculty director of the Georgetown Global Cities Initiative, which aims to connect over 60 faculty scholars and practitioners on research related to urbanization, and as an affiliated faculty member at the Georgetown Law Center and within the STIA program.
Brandes’s appointment to the commission complements the SCS’s mission to inspire students to go beyond the classroom and solve global challenges, according to SCS Dean Kelly Otter.
“Georgetown is proud to have Professor Brandes at the helm of such an important commission to our city,” Otter wrote in an email to The Hoya. “His involvement is consistent with the charge of SCS to provide education that addresses the challenges of our changing world. I am confident that under Professor Brandes’ leadership, Washington D.C. will be better positioned to tackle climate issues and form innovative solutions for a brighter future.”

The Washington, D.C. Department of Transportation abandoned plans to extend a streetcar line into Georgetown on Jan. 14, marking the end to a yearslong push for the project’s completion.
DC Streetcar, a free light rail line that runs along city streets, began operating in 2017, running along H and Benning Streets in Northeast D.C. An expansion into Georgetown would have run for 3 miles along K Street NW, according to the DC Streetcar website. After conducting an internal assessment, the DDOT decided against seeking federal funding for the project, citing greater funding priorities and operational challenges, according to a Jan. 14 DDOT review sent to the Committee on Transportation and the Environment. 
In place of the extended streetcar line, the DDOT will establish a 1.3-mile K Street Transitway which will span from 12th to 21st Streets NW. The transitway will feature dedicated bike and bus lanes, as well as improved pedestrian amenities, according to the DDOT website.
The transitway will broaden transportation options within the Union Station-Georgetown Corridor with minimal disruption to residents, according to Janice Ferebee, who serves on Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2F, which represents Logan Circle and parts of Shaw.
“I did not feel streetcars were a good idea because of disruption and length of time the construction would cause,” Ferebee wrote in an email to the Hoya. “I don’t believe it’s worth the upheaval of the roads and the communities. I do, however, believe in improving transport from Union Station to Georgetown, and the planned enhancement of bus routes (transitway) is a viable alternative.”
The transitway will serve D.C. residents better than extended streetcar lines, which would be costly and would require allocating land for railcar storage and maintenance facilities, according to DDOT director Jeff Marootian.
“We’re pursuing the K Street Transitway because it’s expected to deliver a maximum impact in a quicker and more cost-effective way,” Marootian said to the Washington Post. “A streetcar project we know takes significantly longer and has several complexities, such as the need for another storage and maintenance facility.” 
The DDOT is still planning to extend the streetcar line east over the Anacostia River along Benning Road NE to the Benning Road Metro station, a project that is projected to cost $241 million, according to WTOP. 
The now-scrapped plan to extend the streetcar line to Georgetown was part of the city’s multi-year effort to provide faster and more reliable east-west transit. When DC Streetcar was implemented in 2017, residents praised the faster and more affordable means of transportation. 
However, opponents of the streetcar line pointed out the high cost of the project. The city spent over $200 million on constructing the first 2-mile stretch of the streetcar line, according to The Washington Post. 
As of Nov. 30, 2019, the DDOT had allotted $101,595 for the construction of the Union Station-Georgetown streetcar line, according to the DDOT review. That funding can now be used to support the transitway project, according to WTOP.
If completed, the transitway project will serve as a suitable alternative to an extended streetcar line, according to Christopher Mathews, board member of the Citizens Association of Georgetown, a civic organization composed of Georgetown residents.
“The city’s decision to cut streetcar to Georgetown is unfortunate, as it diminishes the potential value of the existing streetcar route. But more important, from CAG’s perspective, is that if indeed the city won’t move forward with the Georgetown leg of the streetcar that it nonetheless move forward with the K Street Transitway,” Matthews wrote in an email to the Hoya. “This ambitious project will improve cross-town bus service by the creation of high-quality, bus-only lanes. This will ultimately benefit residents, workers and visitors of Georgetown.”

Bipartisan cooperation within the U.S. government and communication between citizens with varied perspectives is essential for the future of the nation as President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial continues, panelists said at a Jan. 29 event.
The event comes months after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced the formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump on Sept. 24. Since then, the House has introduced and voted on two articles of impeachment. On Jan. 16, the House formally presented the articles of impeachment to the Senate, initiating the official impeachment trial.
The event, titled “A Conversation on Impeachment,” was hosted by the Institute of Politics and Public Service and moderated by Washington, D.C. Bureau Chief at Buzzfeed News Kate Nocera. The panel featured Former Chief of Staff for Speaker Pelosi Nadeam Elshami and Former Staff Director for the Senate Repulican Communications Center, which is a critical operation for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Antonia Ferrier.
Given heightened political polarization within Congress and the U.S during the impeachment trial, young people should contribute their perspectives to the political arena, Elshami said during the panel.
“Civil service, politics, is a noble profession,” Elshami said. “So for those of you who are here or interested and may one day want to do this, we need you. We need a new fresh, thinking, generation, whether you’re right, left or an independent, it doesn’t matter.”
As of Jan. 29, ten days after the House voted to impeach Trump, 84.1% of polled Democrats support impeachment proceedings, whereas only 9.4% percent of Republicans express support, according to data collected by FiveThirtyEight. Despite the large percentage of Democrats in favor of impeachment, an acquittal of Trump would be the best way to ensure a functioning government and democracy, according to Ferrier.
“I have some real concerns about this from a real institutional perspective,” Ferrier said. “I’m probably going to say something that will upset people, I actually think the best thing for this country is to have this end and end by meaning acquitted. Let’s go to the polls. Let’s let the democracy continue forward.”
Both Elshami and Ferrier are former GU Politics Fellows and moderator Nocera is a current fellow. The GU Politics Fellows Program began in fall 2015 and has brought five distinguished figures from the fields of politics, government and media to campus every semester to connect with students.
Given the historic significance of the impeachment trial, GU Politics organized the event to foster a dialogue in which students could better understand the political landscape Congress faces, according to according to Chief of Staff for GU Politics Carly Henry (MBA ’19).
“As part of our effort to convene bipartisan dialogue, we wanted students to hear from people on both sides of the aisle who understand the dynamics at play in this historic time,” Henry wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While Ferrier and Elshami may have worked for politicians on different sides of the aisle, they both agreed on the trivial nature of today’s political media coverage, which often sends mixed messages to the public.
“Now, there’s always been an element of that in a two-party system and you can see the sort of slide over time with mass media, so I’m a bit of two minds. It was definitely worse in real ways before, but there’s a pettiness to it now that is just exhausting,” Ferrier said.
For Nocera, in working as a political journalist and serving as moderator, today’s political divides, while not surprising, have taken a new level, she said in an interview with The Hoya.
“As they said, there’s always going to be a political divide between Democrats and Republicans, they’re motivated by very different things,” Nocera said. “They fundamentally disagree on a lot of things. I think that people are really tired of the sniping and just general exhaustion over ‘my team’s right’ and ‘your team’s wrong.’”

Former Washington, D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans filed Jan. 27 to join special election for the seat he vacated when he resigned a week prior amid investigations into ethics violations. 
After spending 29 years representing Ward 2 on the council, the council commissioned a report that found Evans had committed 11 ethical violations stemming from his legal and consulting work outside of the council. The council then voted unanimously to oust Evans; however, he resigned before the expulsion process could be finalized. Evans also filed to join the Ward 2 primary race held every four years. 
Evans is additionally the subject of an ongoing federal investigation, which led to a June raid of his Georgetown home. 
Investigations into Evans and his eventual resignation have weakened the public’s relationship with the council, according to Council Chairman Phil Mendelson. The chairman declined to support Evans’ bid because he considered it damaging to the council’s ongoing effort to improve its reputation with the District, Mendelson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The Council needs to rebuild the public’s trust. It would be a setback to rebuilding that trust if he came on the Council so soon after we nearly expelled him,” Mendelson wrote. 
All 12 sitting councilmembers issued a joint statement condemning Evans’ decision to enter the race as unwise and disrespectful, according to DCist. 
“All of us agreed to expel Jack Evans from the DC Council after an exhaustive investigation found numerous violations of our Code of Conduct,” the councilmembers wrote. “His decision to run for Ward 2 Councilmember again, which we do not and cannot support, shows a willful and arrogant disregard for ethics and is not in the best interests of the District.” 
If Evans were to win back his former seat, the council would again consider calling for his resignation, Councilmember Robert White (D-At Large) said to Washington City Paper. 
“I think the options are calling for his resignation or reformation of the ad hoc committee,” White said. “But unfortunately I now need to think through this ridiculous scenario to make sure Jack Evans is held accountable for his actions in office and also does not further tarnish the reputation of the city.” 
Evans joined the council in 1991. Since then, Evans has served on the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, the Committee on Transportation and the Environment, and the Committee on Business and Economic Development, among other committees.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) has long worked with Evans on various initiatives. The pair recently drew public attention as they participated together in Lunar New Year celebrations Jan. 26 despite Evans’ ethics violations and recent resignation. Once Evans announced his entry into the council’s special election and primary, however, Bowser called upon Evans to consider the implications of his decision. 
“I think he knows very clearly how I feel about getting on with the business of the District,” Bowser said in a news briefing. “We should all call on Jack to do not what’s best for Jack, but what’s best for the District of Columbia.”
Throughout the ethics inquiries and investigations, Evans has long been unpopular among Georgetown University College Democrats leadership. GUCD stands by their position that Evans was right to resign and his choice to run again is a mistake, according to GUCD Chair AJ Williamson (COL ’21). 
“GUCD does not support Evans’s decision to run again for his old seat,” Williamson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our organization condemned his ethical violations, and we were happy to see him do the right thing by resigning.”
Evans now enters a crowded primary race including three Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners: John Fanning (D-2F), Kishan Putta (D-2E) Patrick Kennedy (D-2A). Former Obama administration official Jordan Grossman, Marine Corps veteran Daniel Hernandez and health care executive Yilin Zhang, are also primary contenders. Each primary candidate has also filed for the special election alongside Republican Katherine Venice, an investment manager. 
A special election to fill Ward 2’s open seat will be held June 16, with the winner serving until January 2021. The Democratic primary for the Ward 2 seat will be held June 2.
