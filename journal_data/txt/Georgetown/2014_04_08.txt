Nearly 100 Georgetown students, professors and community members gathered by the front gates Saturday, posters in hand, and began their march down M Street toward the White House, chanting, “Obama, escucha, estamos en lucha!” or “Obama, listen, we are fighting!” and “What do we want? Justice!” in protest of the record numbers of deportations that have occurred during President Obama’s time in office.
The rally, protesting the nearly 2 million deportations that have occurred under the Obama administration, was part of a National Day of Action that occurred in over 40 cities across the United States. Protesters demanded that the president use his executive power to end deportations.
“We’re asking the president to put a moratorium on deportation, because he claims that he’s the champion of immigration reform, but in the process, it doesn’t seem like immigration reform is actually going to happen anytime soon. And while this is happening there are thousands of people getting deported every day,” President for Hoyas for Immigrants Rights Citllalli Alvarez (COL ’16) said.
En route to the White House, Georgetown protesters rallied with fellow advocates marching from Mt. Pleasant in northwestern D.C. The group included a large number of local immigrants.
“It was one of the most beautiful parts of the march when both sides came together, it was very loud, it was very emotional,” said Salvador Sarmiento, National Campaign Coordinator at the National Day Labor Organizing Network, who marched with the Mt. Pleasant group.
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights board member Martin De Leon (SFS ’16) described the meeting of the two groups as one of his proudest moments as a Georgetown student.
“I think my absolute favorite part of the rally and the climax was joining the other activists in D.C at that collision point where we joined their march, and they received us with cheers, and we were cheering also. I had not felt prouder to be a Hoya until that moment. It was just amazing,” De Leon said.
Once the combined group arrived at the White House, the march joined hundreds of protesters and listened to musical performances and speakers offering personal testimonials related to immigration law and reform.
“I’m sure that they heard our cries, I’m sure they knew that we were out there. They are aware that people are very frustrated with the president, that people are sick of hearing excuses and they want to see action,” Community Organizer for D.C. Immigrants Rights Coalition Anna Duncan said.
Among the speakers was a woman who stood up to speak about her husband being deported shortly after learning she was pregnant.
“We have a broken immigration system and we can’t allow that to continue. We need to move forward,” she said. “Obama had a dream and his dream was to be president. … Now it is time to make our dreams come true.”
While led and organized by campus immigration advocacy organizations Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and the Georgetown University Immigration Coalition, the march was characterized by the participation of numerous on-campus groups including the Black House, Students for Justice in Palestine, Moviemiento Estudiantil Chican@ de Aztlán and the College Democrats.
“We’ve definitely thought that the struggle for rights for undocumented workers is something that’s really essential to the democratic cause, and it’s something a lot of Georgetown students and our members are really interested in, so that’s our main motivation for sponsoring it,” College Democrats President Chandini Jha (COL ’16) said.
De Leon also stressed the universality of this issue as one that affects everyone in D.C.
“It’s not solely Hoyas for Immigrant Rights as much as it’s also Caribbean Culture Club, it’s also College Democrats, NAACP, BSA. We’ve gotten support from all types of cultural groups, it’s not so much a restrictive issue, it’s a universal issue,” De Leon said.
Rally attendee and President of Students for Justice in Palestine Leila Shebaro (SFS ’15) addressed the similarities between the struggles of undocumented Latino immigrants in America and those of the Palestinians.
“We feel that we have a responsibility to show solidarity with these people not only because, historically, there’s a very strong tradition of solidarity between Latino communities with Palestinians,” Shebaro said. “Many of the same structures of oppression that are faced by undocumented immigrants in the U.S. are very similar to those faced by Palestinians. The same kind of cycles of economic disenfranchisement, criminalization that you see down to the point where they’re not just coincidentally similar. For example, the same companies that helped build the West Bank barrier are helping to construct the border fence.”
SJP member John Flanagan (SFS ’14) compared the criminalization and lack of basic human rights he said both groups face because of the belief held by some that they are not citizens or are unworthy of citizenship.
“I think that there’s a lot of intersections in the way that the law is used to oppress people and to deny them their basic human rights,” Flanagan said. Georgetown students who attended the march from campus and the rally praised the high levels of support from the Georgetown community.
“It’s something that very directly affects our community and it is viewed as a very separate issue a lot of the time. There is a very human dimension to it and there are families that are separated because of it,” Coordinator for the Kalmanovitz Initative’s Day Laborer Exchange Program Sophia Sepp (SFS ’14) said. “They are just trying to find a job, and they face a lot of injustice and obstacles because of their legal status. We’re all kind of interconnected.”
“As students we have a lot of power to help these people and we have a voice,” said Araceli Vazquez (COL ‘14), a member of Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and Students Stopping the Trafficking of People. “A lot of these people are barely coming out of the shadows and it’s important to push along immigration reform.”

After attracting the likes of Big Sean, Calvin Harris and Wiz Khalifa in recent years, the Georgetown Program Board will face challenges procuring star headliners for its Spring Kickoff Concert with the event’s budget set to be cut by $15,000 next year.
When the university discontinued What’s After Dark in November, student groups that had collaborated with the late-night programming organization continued as planned with funding for this year. However, next year, money formerly allocated to What’s After Dark will go toward the Healey Family Student Center, leaving groups like GPB and Relay for Life, which often collaborated with and received funding from the program, without as many resources.
The decision to cut What’s After Dark was made with funding for the HFSC in mind.
“Any remaining funds will be redirected to the Healey Family Student Center and programming with that,” Center for Student Engagement Director Erika Cohen Derr said.
According to the Chair of GPB Tyler Deloach (COL ’16), What’s After Dark and GPB worked together frequently.
“We co-sponsored a lot of our events with them. Between the two of us, we came up with most of the late-night programming on campus,” Deloach said. “A lot of our events that did occur after dark did involve What’s After Dark. That’s no longer an opportunity that we have for late-night programming.”
GPB’s largest and most expensive event, the Spring Kick-Off Concert, received What’s After Dark funding this year. Next year’s concert, however, may face significant challenges because of the $15,000 loss in funding, according to Deloach.
“We are going to see if we can still pull from the same bracket of artists. The loss of $15,000 from What’s After Dark could change the artist bracket. It depends on what artist we choose to go with in the next coming year,” Deloach said.
GPB will lose about $4,000 in funding for other programs because of the termination of What’s After Dark, mainly affecting larger endeavors, like subsidized trips to New York City and Hershey Park. The trips continued this year, but GPB members are concerned about their status in the 2014-2015 academic year.
“We were able to do the New York City trip, but a lot of people were concerned about that. We can’t count on that for next year because of funding. A lot of people are upset about what we can and can’t do,” Deloach said. “It affects our programming in general. … [We are] concerned about what we’ll lose.”
Despite concerns, according to Cohen Derr, CSE will continue to invest in nighttime programming.
“There will still be an investment in late-night and weekend programming on campus,” Cohen Derr said. “GPB will be able to use their funds for their programming, and there will be some additional money that we will use for programming specifically at the Healey Family Student Center.”
Georgetown’s Relay for Life also felt the impact of the elimination of What’s After Dark. Relay for Life expected to receive $5,000 from What’s After Dark this past year, but had to reach out to the Center for Social Justice’s Advisory Board for Student Organizations to make up for the loss after funding was cut. According to Relay for Life Co-President Dan Silkman (COL ’15), the organization will try to adjust to the smaller budget by reaching out to other campus groups and administrators.
“We are cutting spots and scaling back a little bit,” Silkman said. “We have to set up a reasonable budget for the incoming presidents. … It will mean a few slight adjustments and a more concerted effort to find more campus partners — [with] possibly engaging Office of the Provost and the undergraduate schools.”
Aside from student groups, the elimination of What’s After Dark will impact Georgetown students as well. Scott Lowder (COL ’17) said he thought the elimination of What’s After Dark and its related programs could negatively impact student life.
“I would be very disappointed if Georgetown felt this was not a worthwhile endeavor to fund,” Lowder said. “Without opportunities like these and What’s After Dark, students are more likely to participate in weekend activities that the university might not deem as safe or appropriate.”
Courtney Maduike (SFS ’17) participated in this year’s GPB New York City trip, which costs students $25 apiece and covered a round trip bus ride, dinner at Hard Rock Cafe and a Broadway show. A California native, she stressed how the trip helped her to acclimate to the east coast.
“Georgetown knows how many people are coming from the western states, next year a lot of kids are coming from California, or they accepted a bunch of kids from California, that’s part of the college experience,” Maduike said. “I just can’t believe that they’re cutting that much of it, and I can’t see why it’s being cut. I know times are rough and we need to be wise in how we allocate our money, but we shouldn’t take away from our experience in college. Honestly, I’m so dumbfounded by that.”
The possible effect on the spring concert may also serve to reduce the event’s popularity.
“I would think the popularity would go down if they’re bringing artists that people don’t really know as well just because of lack of funds,” Adithya Rajan (MSB ’17) said. “What this does is it opens up more Hoyas to come perform; I could see more people like Tate Tucker having to supplement that to get people to come to see their friends than to just see the headliner, but I don’t think that’s going to be very helpful.”

Georgetown is known for many things: Bill Clinton, basketball and politics to name a few, but rarely are Georgetown and the arts synonymous, despite the theater and performance studies program, which touts a top-five ranking amongst programs outside of New York City. The inaugural Georgetown University Arts Week hopes to change that by promoting creativity with exhibits, performances and open mike nights across campus from April 5 to 12.
The Georgetown University Student Association Subcommittee on the Arts spearheaded GU Arts Week, starting planning this past fall.
“We made this decision to broaden the purview of it so it’s creative expression rather than arts. So the idea is that it is creativity in general,” Creative Expression Subcommittee Co-Chair Jonathan Thrall (SFS ’17) said.
The week consists of various theater performances, a cappella at Lauinger Library, a GU Jazz ensemble performance and extended Uncommon Grounds open mike nights.
The week hopes to show that the arts are worthy of student attention, as many students tend to focus on professional endeavors that stifle student creativity.
“Students aren’t as creative by themselves when they could be because they don’t really think that is something they should do. They think it might be a waste of time, they don’t know what resources are there, maybe,” Thrall said.“Creativity and professional aspirations aren’t mutually exclusive.”
For students already involved in creative arts, some feel as if it is only useful for resume building.
“I have a friend in the Phantoms who said, ‘If I’m going to do this artistic thing, I need to have a leadership role in it so it looks better on a resume,’” said Andrew Walker (SFS ’16), subcommittee co-chair and a member of the a cappella group.
Through Arts Week, the subcommittee hopes to show incoming students that Georgetown is not just a pre-professional school.
“We’d love it that students come to Georgetown and they are not like, ‘Oh, I love Georgetown, I really want to come here. I guess I’ll have to give up playing the violin, or I guess I’ll have to give up acting or singing. Maybe I’ll be able to dabble in it once in a while, but I’m going to have to focus on the academics or going into [International Relations] or going into business,’” Thrall said.“I want to make sure that that’s not the case.”
Arts Week is intended to reach out to a large audience.
“We are trying to communicate to two types of people, [including] people who didn’t fall into this pre-professional trap and are involved in the arts on campus, and we are showcasing all of their work throughout the year by publicizing their events,” Walker said.
Arts Week may even expand the definition of the pre-professional focus to show how arts can strengthen students intellectually.
“I think that if we were able to expand the definition of what it means to be an intelligent person and include creativity in that, I think that can only lead to more students being challenged in the way they learn best and other students being challenged in new ways that let them think differently than they usually do,” outgoing GUSA Secretary of the Arts T. Chase Meacham (COL ’14) said.
Additionally, Arts Week will give more visibility to the individuals involved in the arts and hopefully attract others outside of that group to join in collaboration.
“I think visibility is the best thing that can come out of this event. I think the arts community is for better or worse a little bit self-cyclical. It’s a lot of the same people that do the same shows or sing in the same songs,” Meacham said.
Although the events are mostly composed of performing arts, Thrall acknowledged that this was simply a reflection of what is here on campus.
“Honestly, when you think about arts, it’s majorly skewed on campus towards performing arts. That’s what exists,” Thrall said.
Arts Week coordinators hope that this week’s impact lasts more than the eight days of the event by getting students to give creativity a chance. Those involved want this week to be an opportunity for people to experience art and creativity on campus and to get to know the resources to seek out events in the future.
“If you look at the things that are happening this week, it’s about people knowing that they are there,” Walker said.
The committee hopes that this year’s success will be a jumping off point for next year. “I think that’s what we did really well this year was to make a really strong foundation for this not starting over but rather moving forward,” Walker said.
The organizers believe the week is intrinsic for the development for Georgetown’s arts.
“It’s tough with an event like this because you’re not going to really see an impact I don’t think for another couple of years. But I think that’s all the more reason that we begin now,” Meacham said.

Monday marked the first day of the 2014 Indian general election, which will span a record 36 days, culminating May 12. Voting will take place in all 543 constituency districts of India to elect members of parliament in the Lok Sabha, which will determine the new prime minister. Students are raising awareness for the election, which may have serious repercussions for Asia and the world.
On April 3, the government department paired with the Georgetown South Asian Society to sponsor the event, “Indian Elections 2014: An Interactive Panel Discussion” at the Mortara Center. Government professor Matthew Rudolph moderated the event, which featured presentations by associate for the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Milan Vaishnav, former U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh Howard Schaffer and Indian political author, journalist and visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins University Kota Neelima.
“I hope that this is part of a wave where we see more student and university interest and effort in India. China always gets the limelight when we refer to Asia, and I for one and students supporting this event would like to see some balance,” Rudolph said.
The focus of the event was to discuss the electoral prospects of the main political parties, and to determine what the results could mean for India’s relationship with the United States. There are two frontrunners for the position of prime minister: Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi.
Gandhi’s incumbent Congress Party, supported by the poorest factions of Indian society, focuses on welfare initiatives and increased socioeconomic mobility. Gandhi himself is the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has dominated Indian politics since independence. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party runs on a platform of good governance and economic development, hoping to expose the alleged corruption and wastefulness of the Congress Party and current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s coalition government.
The BJP is favored in the election, as Vaishnav explained that Indians care most about economic development and corruption.
“When the Indian voter is asked, the single most important thing is the economy. Number two is corruption, and number three is inflation,” Vaishnav said. “Because the Congress hasn’t performed well on these issues, the BJP have attacked the incumbents on these core tenants and have focused their platform on these issues.”
Although the BJP are expected to win the most seats of any party in the Lok Sabha and lead a coalition government, the many regional parties whose major voting bases consist of lower-caste, working-class Hindus and Muslims will ensure that a variety of parties hold a sizable presence in the parliament. It will be up to the BJP to convince some of these crucial smaller parties to join them in order to cross the 272-seat mark and effectively form a majority functioning coalition in the Lok Sabha.
Vaishnav explained the collaboration between various parties in terms of political and security motivations.
“In the case of Tamil Nadu, a southern state, political leaders entering the coalition would want the major party to let the foreign policy dealing with Sri Lanka, which has an ethnic Tamil majority, fall to their state,” Vaishnav said.
All three panel experts predicted that Modi will win the election — what this will mean for U.S.-Indian relations is up for debate.
“Modi’s party will want good relations with the United States, as most Indian leaders have in the past. However, in the past six months, relations have soured a bit due to the arrest of Indian Consular Officer Devyani Khobragade in New York City on charges of visa fraud and making false statements to the U.S. State Department about her work,” Schaffer said.
Despite this scandal, the relationship between the two major powers looks to remain a strong and vital partnership for years to come.
Luis Joy Pérez (SFS ’17), one of the approximately 40 students in attendance, came away from the panel discussion with a better understanding of the Indian political system.
“I am now able to better comprehend the issues of India’s election and why the media has been portraying Narendra Modi as the heir-apparent for New Delhi,” Pérez said.
SAS Marketing Chair Mariam Matin (COL ’15) was happy to see that students were developing an interest in foreign electoral races.
“It was exciting to see the room filled with a combination of people both directly invested in the elections and people who were just curious to learn more. I think people got a good idea of some of the key trends at play for this election,” Matin said.
Yash Johri (SFS ’17) from Delhi, India, is a research assistant under Rudolph, and helped arrange the event. He agreed with the panel’s conclusions.
“I think that it will be a coalition government because I don’t think that any party will attain a majority. Modi’s party has captured the imagination of the youth interested in the main issues. What he’s focused on is economic development and not the regional or religious issues,” Johri said. “This election is more about the shortcomings of the incumbent party. The rampant corruption and mismanagement of the past five years is the main talking point for Modi and the reason why he will win.”
He hopes that the panel will create greater interest in India from the Georgetown community.
“This event is the beginning of a larger effort to bring India to Georgetown and to the D.C. community in particular. While I see an immense amount of emphasis laid upon studying China as the next great hegemon, having been in Washington for over eight months I have sensed that India’s presence isn’t really felt, and I feel it is important to educate the community on India’s importance in the world,” Johri said.

Georgetown University Women in Leadership, a club founded by two current sophomores, is only in its second year on campus. Yet, the young student group has already partnered with the Office of the President and Bloomberg L.P. to put on an all-day conference featuring 28 speakers, ranging from journalist Alex Wagner and the inspiration behind Olivia Pope of “Scandal,” Judy Smith, to journalist Maria Shriver (CAS ’77), the former first lady of California.
The Own It Summit, led by Co-Chairs Kendall Ciesemier (COL ’15) and Helen Brosnan (SFS ’16), will take place in the Rafik B. Hariri Building on Saturday.
Events co-sponsored by the Office of the President usually take place in conjunction with another academic department or administrative arm, like University Information Services or the Office of the Provost. It is relatively rare for the president’s office to so prominently join with a student group for an entirely student-run event.
The Office of the President referred all comment to the Office of Communications, which sent a statement clarifying that the conference would be broadcast online Saturday.
“Once we had gotten Bloomberg as the official sponsor of the event, that partnership opened a lot of doors for us. For some reason, Georgetown all of a sudden wanted to be involved,” Ciesemier said. “It suddenly became a big thing on everyone’s radar, and everyone was talking about it.”
Brosnan, who completed two Bloomberg internships spanning nearly half of 2013, pitched the summit to the company’s events team last semester. After receiving the sponsorship, the summit’s organizers connected with university administrators to discuss the possibility of expansion.
“Bloomberg came on and they had talked about a media plan and a press plan and all these sorts of things like expanding the conference to more than we had imagined in the beginning, which was awesome,” Brosnan said.
GUWIL has worked with the Office of the President, the Office of Advancement, the Office of Communications and the Office of Financial Affairs to develop the summit.
Provost Robert Groves, Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis and Senior Advisor to the President for Faculty Relations Lisa Krim are among the summit’s hosts. University President John J. DeGioia is both a speaker and a host for the event.
The $20 tickets went on sale Feb. 28 and sold out by the next day. The conference released 15 additional tickets April 1.
Over 100 leaders were invited to present their viewpoints at the conference, with Saturday’s summit featuring 28 speakers from a variety of fields, including politics, media, business and technology. Although most invitees declined, the feedback was largely positive.
“Most people were more than happy to do it, but a lot of them had conflicts,” Own It Summit Director of Speakers and Host Committee Liz Buffone (COL ’14) said.
The summit’s organizers utilized their connections with female business leaders to create a large network of potential speakers.
Ciesemier started by reaching out to eBay Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Richelle Parham, whom she met at a Google conference during her freshman year.
“I reached out to her just for advice and I thought that maybe she’d come, but I didn’t even ask her if she’d come. We set up a time to talk on the phone and she said she would love to come,” Ciesemier said. “I hadn’t assumed she would want to just because she has no relation to Georgetown, but she was super pumped about it.”
Parham connected the organizers with Smith, the crisis management expert who served as the inspiration for Olivia Pope of “Scandal.” The conference attracted Kara Swisher (SFS ’84), a technology columnist for the Wall Street Journal, who also connected GUWIL with her wife, Megan Smith, a vice president at Google, as well as both former CEO and Chairman of America Online Steve Case and Case Foundation CEO Jean Case.
Through this kind of networking by GUWIL members and between speakers, the Own It Summit expanded its list of participants to the final 28.
Shriver, who founded the Shriver Report, which focuses on cultural and societal changes affecting women, was one of the first people to sign up for the host committee to serve as a moderator last summer. After promoting women’s leadership initiatives in California, Shriver wanted to expand her efforts to her alma mater. She already participates heavily in the community, including speaking at an Office of Advancement event in Los Angeles last year. Her daughter, Christina Schwarzenegger (COL ’13) graduated last May.
“I had met her … and she told me that she had wanted to start something like this at Georgetown, or do a women’s conference at Georgetown,” Ciesemier said. “As a first lady of California, she had done a lot of women’s conferences. This is a very natural fit for something that she would want to be involved in.”
Dee Dee Myers, who served as the first-ever female White House press secretary during the first two years of President Bill Clinton’s administration, is one of the event’s keynote speakers and will be presented with the Own It Award at the summit.
“[The award is] given to a woman who really exemplifies a 21st-century leader and owns all of the hard responsibilities that come with her job, but most importantly … we’re giving it to a woman who is a ‘first’ in her industry or a ‘first’ in her position,” Brosnan said.
Steve Case and Jean Case will give the other keynote presentation.
The event will also include four panel discussions focusing on policy, media, business and science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Throughout the day, participants will attend experiential sessions hosted by speakers that will focus on key issues such as self-promotion, salary negotiation and women of color.
“We want to have a lot of like-minded men and women come together and gain this new sense of empowerment and confidence to go set the world on fire,” Buffone said.
GUWIL plans to continue to work with the university in the future to promote female leadership at Georgetown.
“[The university] really wants this to be not just a one-year thing. They’re rallying together all these different groups of people to make a much more succinct and sustainable women’s leadership initiative on campus,” Ciesemier said.
Although Summit committee members have not yet begun plans for their post-summit endeavors, Ciesemier said that she envisions unifying pre-existing efforts to promote women in leadership at Georgetown. Apart from the summit, GUWIL has continued its meetings and programming as a student group.
“We should see some real unification happening after the summit and a more formalized effort,” Ciesemier said. “The goal is to create an umbrella organization that would house all of these different initiatives.”
Such pre-existing efforts include an initiative led by Davis to promote leadership among female faculty members.
“I’m an advocate for women leaders in any capacity and am especially proud of the GU women who put together the Own It Summit,” Davis wrote in an email. “Their leadership in putting together the summit and rallying men and women across the country to participate exemplifies the positive impact that can occur when women take ownership of a larger societal need.”
Correction: An earlier version of the article stated that the summit would take place in Gaston Hall. It will be held in the Rafik B. Hariri Building. Additionally, Richelle Parham did not connect organizers with Kara Swisher. Swisher expressed interest to better connect with her alma mater.

Concealed carry, banned. Assault weapons, banned. A background check, online training and gun safety testing — all required before purchasing a firearm. According to ABC News, the gun laws in the District of Columbia and the DMV area are among the strictest in the nation, forcing area residents to jump through hoops in order to purchase and own firearms in the city.
Until 2008, D.C. law prohibited possession of a handgun in the District — even in a private citizen’s home — unless it had been registered prior to 1976. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court in D.C. v. Heller invalidated that provision of D.C. law, ruling that the Second Amendment guaranteed the right for D.C. residents to possess handguns.
Following the court’s ruling, the D.C. Council passed a series of regulations for owning a handgun in the District, including a 10-day waiting period for all purchases, a minimum ownership age of 21 and the requirement that all gun licenses be renewed every three years with the Metropolitan Police Department.
Despite these tightened regulations, MPD still estimates that there are around 30,000 registered gun owners in the city. At the same time, homicide rates in the District have been steadily decreasing since the 1990s, although 2013 saw a slight rise to 104 reported homicides from 88 in 2012, according to data from MPD.
To understand the intricate rules and regulations of the District’s firearms laws, many D.C. residents turn to Charles Sykes Jr. As operator of CS Exchange, the District’s only Federal Firearms Licensed dealer permitted to transfer guns into D.C., for 20 years, Sykes provides information and assistance to individuals and armed security companies completing the firearm registration process in D.C.
“When I obtained my license in 1994, there were several other people that had licenses to do the same thing. Over the years, those individuals stopped doing it, and I continued to keep my license updated,” Sykes said. “When the law was overturned in 2008, I happened to be the only licensed person in the District that could perform the services I can perform, helping people get their firearms registered in the District.”
Sykes now operates out of the D.C. police headquarters in downtown Washington. He said that while the stream of customers isn’t constant, he continues to offer his services to those who want his help.
“There are not a lot of people in the District going out and buying firearms to register them in the District. It’s a little sparingly that they need my services. There might be anywhere from maybe three to six a week sometimes,” Sykes said.
Despite his expertise and up-to-date license, Sykes does not sell guns in the District, and as of today there is no physical location where consumers can go to purchase firearms in the city — the nearest location is Atlantic Guns in Silver Spring, Md.
Even with people like Sykes helping District residents register firearms, those seeking to purchase firearms in Maryland and Virginia face further restrictions, adding another layer to an already complex system.
Dan Floyd, assistant manager of Atlantic Guns, which operates less than a mile from the D.C.-Maryland border, said the current system has changed drastically since the shop he works at opened in 1950.
“It’s interesting to note that in Virginia, you can walk into any Wal-Mart with a handgun strapped to your side without a permit, no problem. In Maryland, the same thing will get you in jail. In the District, not only will you be facing jail time, but you get a felony on your record and can never purchase a gun again,” Floyd said.
When Atlantic Guns first opened, Floyd said the store mainly revolved around hunting, but as the population has increased over the years, that customer base has dwindled, leading most people to purchase their guns for either target shooting or self-defense purposes.
“There aren’t a whole lot of places to go hunting around here anymore unless you want to drive at least three hours. As suburbia has expanded, the number of customers coming in to buy guns for hunting purposes has definitely diminished,” Floyd said.
In May 2013, Maryland enacted among the most restrictive gun laws in the nation, banning the sale of certain semi-automatic firearms that the state defines as assault weapons, limiting magazine capacity to 10 rounds and requiring handgun purchasers to be fingerprinted and pass a training course before obtaining the proper licensing.
While advocates like Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley, a Democrat who signed the bill into law, praised the laws as a step in the right direction toward curbing gun violence in the state, Floyd and others say the laws have created a process too arduous for most Maryland residents looking to purchase a handgun.
“Before they even look at the guns for sale, they have to go through the process of getting a license, getting the proper training, making sure they have the proper paperwork. The new handgun laws have certainly hurt our business and discourage people who look at the process and say, ‘This just isn’t worth my time to go through,’” Floyd said, “After these laws I would say the process is actually easier in the District when it comes to purchasing handguns and getting them registered.”
Sykes concurred with Floyd’s judgment, saying he believed that despite what many may think, the laws in the District are not as restrictive as those recently passed by Maryland.
“A lot of the laws that Maryland has imposed since Oct. 1 were a lot like the District laws when the District first had to start letting people register handguns. Since then, the District laws are a lot easier — the requirements are a lot easier than it is to get firearms registered or purchase firearms in Maryland,” Sykes said.
Despite these uneven regulations, according to Sykes, his most frequent customers are new gun owners that purchase firearms outside the District.
“I elected not to sell guns in the District even though I’m licensed to sell guns here. So people will purchase firearms out of state, and by federal law those guns have to be transferred from the dealers that they purchase them from outside of Washington to me,” Sykes said.
Chairman of the D.C. City Council Phil Mendelson, who authored many of the regulations passed after the Heller decision, said that he doesn’t foresee any major changes in gun regulation, noting that the council’s approach to gun laws in the District both pre- and post-2008 has been to focus on individuals whose past history indicates they should not possess a firearm.
“Looking at what types of behavior are indicators, based on evidence, of a higher risk of violence, those are the people that would be restricted or prohibited from possessing a firearm,” Mendelson said.
Gwendolyn Crump, director of the MPD’s Office of Communications, concurred when it came to the police’s two main goals in enforcing the District’s gun laws.
“The Department’s priorities are twofold: first, to ensure that any illegal firearms are taken off the streets and, second, to provide District residents with a streamlined process to register their legally owned firearms,” Crump said.
According to Crump, the punishment for possession of an unlicensed firearm is a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. Going forward, Sykes said he will continue to monitor any changes to D.C.’s gun laws, and ensure that he remains the city’s one-stop shop for assistance.
“I can explain these laws to people a lot easier probably than what they can find on the police department’s website. I can simplify the process and show them that it’s not a very hard process. It’s not as difficult as people make it out to be,” Sykes said. “People have a tendency to want to find out how to do something the easiest way. The easiest way is to hear it from someone else, instead of investigating it for themselves.”

An uptick in robberies targeting the Georgetown neighborhood, including four involving an armed weapon since the beginning of 2014, has local residents concerned.
Since January 2014, there have been eight robberies in the Georgetown neighborhood, four more than occurred during the same time period last year. While two of these robberies targeted businesses, including robberies at Domino’s Pizza at 3255 Prospect St. and TD Bank at 1611 Wisconsin Ave., the majority have targeted individuals on the street.
Metropolitan Police Department Captain Jeffrey Herold said there is no way to know whether these robberies are related.
“The only evidence for these crimes being related is that they occurred in the same geographical area and within a short time,” Herold said, while emphasizing that physical descriptions of suspects are not sufficient to establish a connection between the cases. “As far as descriptions go, they are shaky at best. Could they be related? Yes. Are they? We don’t have the information to know.”
At an Advisory Neighborhood Commission meeting Monday evening at Georgetown Visitation School, MPD Lieutenant John Hedgecock addressed residents’ concerns over the increase in robberies.
“It’s not just Georgetown. The city as a whole has seen an increase in street robberies for at least the last few years,” Hedgecock said. “We couldn’t forecast this happening. We’ve done a lot in response. I can’t get into specific strategies because I don’t discuss them publicly, but you certainly will see an enhanced presence and surveillance will be going up.”
Georgetown resident and MSFS student Andrew Gibbs (GRD ’15) took issue with the District’s firearm regulations, which he claims inhibit residents’ ability to protect themselves.
“Given the prevalence of firearms in these crimes, I think we are once again seeing the folly of D.C.’s restrictive gun laws. Average citizens such as myself cannot protect themselves. Meanwhile, criminal elements are clearly flaunting the law. I feel that having the option to conceal carry, because the criminals clearly already are, would provide a deterrent, and would diminish the number of crimes in our neighborhood, even if a handgun was never used in self-defense,” Gibbs said.
Ed Solomon, chair of the ANC’s Public Safety Committee, said that the ANC is working in conjunction with the university and MPD to ensure that the neighborhood remains as safe as possible.
“We rely on the statistics that MPD gives us and respond accordingly as far as re-evaluating our resources.” Solomon said. One tool used to fight crime in the neighborhood is “reimbursable details,” where the ANC pays MPD officers to patrol in the neighborhood when they are off-duty, usually late at night and on weekends.
ANC2E Commissioner Craig Cassey (COL ’15) did not find 2014’s spike in crime to be out of the ordinary.
“It does not seem out of the ordinary to have this number of crimes occurring. Typically, crime rates increase as we move into the spring and summer months so an increase from January and February to now is common and to an extent should be expected,” Cassey wrote in an email.
John Wiebenson, deputy executive director of the Georgetown Business Improvement District, concurred with Cassey.
“I think it is always sometimes patterned seasonally, as you know, you get nicer weather, people are leaving their windows open, they may be more prone to burglaries of houses, so there’s always sort of upticks and changes from everything from weather to sort of the general lay of the land,” Wiebenson said.
Additionally, Solomon said that the ANC has formed a working relationship with the university to fight crime.
“The community has formed a partnership with the university and we’re working together as a team to address not only the robberies but safety in general,” Solomon said. “I would say we have formed a very positive bond with the university and also with the public safety department. We’re very transparent and we reach out to each other.”
Yet neighborhood resident Michael Gerber said that he remains wary of his surroundings, despite his confidence in local law enforcement.
“I would say that at night I would think twice about walking too far from my house. I feel relatively confident that GUPD and MPD are doing their jobs, but they can’t be everywhere all the time,” Gerber said.
Georgetown University Chief of Police Jay Gruber also said that while MPD is the primary authority for investigating off-campus robberies, GUPD is doing all they can to assist.
“GUPD Officers are in the neighborhoods around the university going back and forth to university properties,” Gruber said. “The officers stay current with information provided by the MPD and remain alert to suspicious persons and activities.”
Gruber and Herold both emphasized the importance of awareness when ensuring personal safety.
“Georgetown is a relatively safe neighborhood and will remain that way, but we are in the middle of a city and there are unfortunately some people who will take advantage of easy victims.” Herold said.

Since the contentious battle over who would operate Georgetown’s waterfront boathouse last spring, Key Bridge Boathouse, has continued its success while maintaining its long-standing relationship with Georgetown Outdoor Education.
In December 2012, the National Park Service, which owns the land on which the boathouse operates, notified Jack’s Boathouse operators Frank Baxter and Paul Simkin that the boathouse’s lease, which the Baxter family had held since 1945, would have to compete with other businesses to bid for the right to operate on the land on a concession basis.
In March 2013, the NPS officially awarded a two-year contract to operate on the property to B&G Outdoor Recreation, which operates six boating based ventures in the Boston area.
According to Stephen Benkert, the program coordinator at Key Bridge Boathouse, the boathouse has maintained the friendly atmosphere of Jack’s Boathouse but with more efficient business procedures.
“People were concerned because Jack’s had been here for so long,” Benkert said. “We still keep that funky vibe that has been down here forever but operation is running more smoothly with the procedures we’ve put in place to make use of the site effectively.”
The new management has implemented new operations systems, including the ability to accept credit and debit cards, installation of a new check in/out system, as well as new safety procedures.
Despite the procedural changes that have been implemented under the new management, Key Bridge Boathouse has maintained its partnership with Georgetown Outdoor Education, allowing the group to store its kayaks and paddle boards at the boathouse.
“So far it’s been a wonderful relationship. I know that Outdoor Ed has had a long-standing relationship with Jack’s … and Key Bridge from the get-go has been willing to honor that same relationship that we had, so that was exciting news when I first showed up,” Outdoor Education Director Kris Nessler said.
In an effort to keep students engaged with the boathouse, the Key Bridge Boathouse has also added new programming, such as stand-up paddleboard yoga classes.
“This is the latest trend and we are quadrupling our programming,” Benkert said.
Nessler said that he hopes to promote a working relationship with the Outdoor Education staff to encourage more interaction between the university and the Key Bridge Boathouse.
“We really think there are some opportunities for some good crossover training, and then clearly Outdoor Ed wants to be able to program, as the weather gets nicer, maybe four or five trips before the end of the semester,” Nessler said.
Benkert said that the Key Bridge Boathouse has been able to maintain a close working relationship with the NPS, who owns the land on which the boathouse operates.
“We work closely with them and definitely are always aiming to make right by them,” Benkert said. “It is their land and they are letting us run a concession here so everything goes through the Park Service.”
According to NPS Concessions Management Specialist Walter McDowney, the Key Bridge Boathouse has successfully upheld the requirements of the NPS’ contract, which is required for each of its concessions.
“As far as following the contract is concerned, they’re doing a good job,” McDowney said.
Future negotiations concerning B&G Outdoor Recreation contract renewal are ongoing.
“We definitely hope to extend for sure,” Benkert said.

While the defeat of incumbent Mayor Vincent Gray by Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) dominated headlines after last Tuesday’s Democratic primary, smaller D.C. Council races revealed a District-wide distaste for D.C.’s reputation of corrupt politics.
Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1) and Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) both won their respective wards in Tuesday’s race and currently face no opposition in the Nov. 1 general election.
After an intense campaign that revolved around ethical accusations from both sides, Nadeau was able to unseat four-term incumbent Council member Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), winning with 59 percent of votes.
According to David Super, a professor of administrative law at Georgetown Law Center, ethics and corruption figured heavily, not only in the mayoral race, but also in smaller elections as well.
“Ethics definitely focused heavily on not just the mayoral race but other races throughout the District,” Super said.
Nadeau attributed her victory to voters’ desire for a fresh start in D.C. government and their dissatisfaction with a political system notorious for corruption.
“Voters were telling me that they were ready for change. That after 15 years, they were looking for a new energy. But also they were fed up with the pay-to-play politics culture that we’ve come to see perpetuated in D.C. politics,” Nadeau told The Hoya.
Graham, a local politician well known for both his bow ties and his advocacy as chair of the Committee on Human Services, has served as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center. A two-time chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s board, Graham had been fighting allegations for more than two years that he acted unethically by intentionally steering a Metro land development project away from Banneker Ventures and toward a firm that had contributed to his political campaign.
The District government’s Ethics Board ruled in February that there was a “substantial body of evidence” that supported the claim that Graham violated the city’s Code of Employee Ethics; however, the board did not formally punish Graham, saying that because the alleged wrongdoing occurred in 2008, the board lacked the purview to impose punishments.
As for her priorities should she be elected to the council after the Nov. 4 general election, Nadeau said she looks forward to using her past experience to accomplish the goals set out in her campaign, namely education.
“We focused on strengthening our schools, increasing affordable housing and rooting out corruption in our government,” Nadeau said. “I’m no stranger to the bureaucracy of the D.C. government, so that’s something that helps me hit the ground running … The relationships I’ve built across the ward and the District will serve me well on the council, and I look forward to a collaborative approach in that role.”
Two sitting members of the council — David Grosso (I-At Large) and Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) — took the rare step to endorse Nadeau in the April 1 primary. The norm for councilmembers is to stay out of close races, especially those involving incumbents.
In Ward 6, two candidates with considerable political experience faced off to replace Wells, who resigned his seat on the council to mount an ultimately unsuccessful campaign for D.C. mayor.
Charles Allen, former chief of staff to Wells, defeated Darrel Thompson, former deputy chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev) with 58 percent of the vote.
While most of his political experience has taken place at the federal level, Thompson sought to paint himself as someone knowledgeable about the needs of the local community in Ward 6.
“I’ve lived in this Ward for over 20 years. In terms of my experience, I’ve worked a lot at the federal level, but on issues that affect the District of Columbia,” Thompson said during a debate in late March. “I’m looking to harness my relationships at the local — and yes, at the federal level — to move this Ward forward for everyone.”
Allen said that his priorities on the Council would be much in line with his predecessor, Wells, but would also include a higher emphasis on education and economic reform.
“When Tommy talks about ethics and accountability, you’re going to see some of the same things: same goes for investments in our transportation system and connecting our neighborhoods,” Allen said. “But I’m also the dad of a 19-month-old girl, and I’m going to wake up every day thinking about early education — education is going to be a big part of what drives me on the Council.”
Super agreed that, moving forward, councilmembers would need to address the economic disparity present in the District.
“The challenge of figuring out how to move forward in a period of economic growth and lingering inequalities is definitely a challenge that the D.C. government faces,” Super said.
Like Wells, Allen highlighted the need to move past the District’s culture of corruption toward a government that the people can actually trust to get things done.
“Our elected leaders in the District have to stop being selfish and start solving problems,” Allen said. “Too many people talk about making a change, but that alone isn’t enough. You have to be willing to make hard decisions and to lead by example. This is exactly what I’ve done and promise to continue to do as your councilmember.”
Correction: a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Charles Allen (D- Ward 6) defeated an incumbent in last Tuesday’s primary. The seat was, in fact, open after the incumbent, Councilmember Tommy Wells (D- Ward 6) stepped down to run for mayor.
