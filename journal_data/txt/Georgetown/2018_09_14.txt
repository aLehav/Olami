Naba Rahman (SFS ’19), the acting president of the Georgetown University Student Association, and Chief of Staff Aaron Bennett (COL ’19) will resign Friday, effective at 11:59 p.m., according to a draft of a news release provided to The Hoya on Thursday night.
Rahman and Bennett’s resignation comes after the GUSA senate demanded Rahman and 10 senior GUSA executive staff resign for failing to disclose to the body and to other executive members allegations of misconduct raised against former GUSA president, Sahil Nair (SFS ’19).
The Hoya approached Rahman and Bennett for comments on their resignations. Nair did not respond to requests for comment until May 2019.
No complaints had been filed against Nair through the Title IX office or the Office of Student Conduct, he wrote in a May 28 email to The Hoya. A university spokesperson confirmed that, as of May 2019, Nair was not the subject of any complaints through either office nor had he been found responsible for any violations of the Student Code of Conduct.
Tuesday morning, Rahman and 10 GUSA senior staffers, including Bennett (COL ’19) announced resignations, effective Friday, due to an inability to serve in their roles, given the “present environment within the organization,” according to resignation statements provided to The Hoya.
About two hours after the resignations, The Hoya reported the existence of a letter circulating among senior leadership of student organizations that demanded Nair’s resignation and referred to allegations of sexual misconduct. Rahman and senior staffers announced they would rescind their resignations after Nair resigned 10 a.m. Tuesday. 
The GUSA senate then called an emergency meeting for 10 p.m. Tuesday to evaluate the transition of power and the news of the allegations. But senators at the meeting said Bennett briefed the senate in a private internal forum before the emergency session on a timeline of Rahman and Bennett’s knowledge of the allegations made against Nair. 
At least six senators said Rahman, Bennett and other senior members of the GUSA executive’s  staff allegedly knew during the GUSA presidential campaign in February about misconduct accusations against Nair but did not disclose them, as discussed during the senate meeting.
In an interview with The Hoya on Wednesday, Rahman said she stands by her course of action.
“If this were about a job for me, I wouldn’t have resigned on Tuesday. This was about doing what was right,” Rahman said. “Values are very important to me, whether they be my own religious values, how I feel about being a woman, a woman of color, and so, that drives me every day, especially in times like this. I did what I thought was right.”
Bennett said in an email to The Hoya that he and Rahman both acted to preserve the interests of the student body.
Rahman said she will no longer be part of GUSA this year and hopes that the organization continues to advocate for students’ needs. 
“The important thing to recognize about GUSA is that it is way more than the president and vice president, we are ultimately leaders for an army of students who want to see change,” Rahman said. “I don’t want to see GUSA for the next year miss out on a year of policy, advocacy and student empowerment that it could’ve had. So I implore individuals to do what they can to still make GUSA a place for change.” 
During the senate meeting Tuesday night, senators said that in the earlier forum, Bennett said Nair denied the first allegations of misconduct raised during the election campaign and that he and Rahman believed him.
Bennett and Rahman confirmed this account in an interview with The Hoya.
When the allegations resurfaced at the end of the summer, Rahman delivered a welcome address to new students during the New Student Orientation welcome session instead of Nair, but Rahman and Bennett again did not disclose the allegations to the GUSA senate. Traditionally, the GUSA president delivers a welcome address to new students.
At the emergency meeting Tuesday, senators unanimously agreed that Rahman and Bennett should no longer hold positions representing the student body, after failing to disclose allegations to GUSA staff. The senators said the failure to inform the community about the allegations made Rahman and Bennett unfit to advocate for student issues like mental health and sexual assault prevention.
This article was updated June 23  to indicate the absence of Title IX or Office of Student Conduct complaints against Nair and to include comment from Nair.

I have not seen an argument explaining why the senate should be informed regarding concerns about a member of the executive. I feel that the CSE would have been the more appropriate venue for Rahman and Bennett to address their concerns.
At least from the reading the articles, it seems that the crux of the senate’s argument is that the executive administration should be dissolved because they were not included in conversations. I hope I am wrong on this.  However, were I in the COS’s shoes, I would work entirely with the actual administration concerning this issue. The senate does not have a record of past behavior that suggests they would approach this matter in a sensitive and productive matter.

I’d refer Jack the Bullfrog to the open letter of Sept 14th from the Hoya Editorial Board.  Spoke to the heart of the matter for me.
For my part, I shouldn’t even have to cite the fact that we are in an era of #MeToo and at a moment in the world when we are all focusing on the importance of honor and character in our leaders. I’m a parent who cares about my child’s safety and that of every young person on GU’s campus and every campus in the country for that matter. That’s my main concern in following this.
This is a very difficult and sensitive situation peppered with much uncertainty. For what it’s worth I think that the student body generally and the Senate in particular are handling this in a measured and mature way.
A big shout out too for The Hoya. It can’t have been easy navigating the coverage of this issue and they have done so in exemplary manner including the Editorial Board letter. Kudos to the Fourth Estate.

Observe D.C., a nonpartisan initiative started by McCourt School of Public Policy student Ben Mindes (GRD ’19), will pilot a “sample-based” election-day observation program to provide an independent analysis of voting efficiencies in Washington, D.C.
Observe D.C. will send volunteer “observers” to 83 of the 143 polling locations throughout the District to create a random sample that will be representative of the district as a whole, according to Mindes. These observers will give reports of any irregularities, imperfections or abnormalities at polling sites, and report their findings to a call center based in the Ethics Lab in Healy Hall.
“The idea is to build confidence in elections,” Mindes said. “We provide a level of independent oversight the D.C. BOE [Board of Elections] can’t because they’re the ones administering the election.”
All observers and call center operators will be volunteers, but observers will get $50 and a certificate for being part of the first observer-based statistical analysis in the country, Mindes said. Mindes also said he reached out to leaders from both Georgetown University College Republicans and Georgetown University College Democrats to discuss the initiative.
The effort will provide the first independent analysis of how elections are run in the District and offer citizens a way of engaging the election process that isn’t phone-banking, Mindes said.
The initiative will primarily look at the accessibility of polling sites, though it will also analyze other aspects of voting precincts, Mindes said in an interview with The Hoya. 
“I want to make sure that if you need a wheelchair to vote, that voting machine is positioned so you can vote,” Mindes said. “If the door is heavy, it’s propped open.”
While charities like Disability D.C., a D.C.-based organization that has meetups to increase accessibility around the city, have already begun to conduct independent surveys of polling locations to determine their accessibility for people in wheelchairs, these have not been on the same scale as Observe D.C., Mindes said.
“There’s a problem if you feel like your vote is not safe or you don’t feel safe going to a polling station,” Mindes said. “We’re trying to set the example for everybody else,” he said.
The findings from the sample will allow Mindes and his Observe D.C. team to compare voting across the District’s eight wards and compile reform recommendations that can then be submitted to the D.C. Board of Elections.
Leaders of both GUCR and GUCD both said they valued the efforts of Mindes to improve voting systems in D.C.
“A nonpartisan initiative like Observe DC is a great way for people fulfill a part of their civic duty and try to help make our democratic system a little better,” GUCR President Jake Lyons (SFS? ‘20) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“I have heard and read so many stories of people who have been intimidated at the polls, given misinformation regarding their polling station or voter ID requirements, or who have found polling stations to be inaccessible,” GUCD Chair Maria Cornell (SFS ’20) wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This should be unacceptable, and I think Observe D.C. will take us one step closer to ending this type of voter suppression and will revolutionize our electoral processes,” she said.
Mindes came up with the idea for Observe D.C. while working for the National Democratic Institute, where he researched international affairs and elections. NDI helped develop sample-based observations that relied on sending observers to random polling locations and acquiring representative data about voting patterns in the country, Mindes said.
Mindes hopes the pilot will serve as an example for jurisdictions around the country that may lack trust in electoral processes, so that they will be able to put on similar efforts in future elections.
The U.S. has over 10,000 jurisdictions each with different voting procedures so the initiative will only be implemented in Washington, as it is tailored to the district’s voting methodology, Mindes said.
However, the initiative has the potential to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of such nonpartisan analyses for improving voting across the country, according to Mindes.
“The long game is introducing this type of election observation as a new avenue, especially for young people, to engage in the political process and have oversight over elections in their backyard,” Mindes said.
The funding for Observe D.C. came from a $20,000 dollar grant from the Baker Center for Leadership and Governance at McCourt. Mindes was one of five recipients of the Baker Innovation Award.
“Adding a level of oversight that is citizen-led and independent can help safeguard the institution of elections in the United States,” Mindes said. “For people who care about elections without an avenue to improve the system, this is your opportunity.”

When it comes to his dreams, Bradley Cooper (COL ’97) doesn’t take no for an answer.
The actor and director attributed his success in film and life to hard work, dedication and authenticity at a discussion with Blair Rich (COL ’97), the worldwide director of marketing for Warner Bros., and Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia on Tuesday evening in a fully packed Gaston Hall.
Cooper will make his directorial debut next month with his remake of “A Star Is Born,” in which he also stars, but his dream of directing has been with him as long as he can remember. As an undergraduate, however, he didn’t disclose his directorial aspirations, saying that expressing his hopes of being an actor seemed more realistic.
“I always wanted to be a director,” Cooper said. “But I was so terrified of the prospect that I don’t think I ever even verbally said those words, I said actor instead.”
Cooper, whose film is set to release Oct. 5, said when he initially decided to shoot a third remake of the classic 1937 film of the same name, his friends tried to discourage him from doing so. But after attending a Metallica concert and feeling the energy from backstage, Cooper said his vision for the film began to solidify and he felt he had to make it.
The film follows seasoned country musician Jackson Maine, played by Cooper, as he discovers and falls in love with a struggling singer named Ally, played by Lady Gaga.
“Everybody told me not to make this movie,” Cooper said. “I just didn’t really listen to anyone. I just really kept my head down and focused the way I did when I wanted to come to this university.”
Cooper was dead set on transferring to Georgetown from Villanova University for his sophomore year after first being rejected by Georgetown out of high school. Much like his mindset for creating “A Star Is Born,” he said he ignored those who told him he shouldn’t transfer.
“The thing I learned from trying to get into this school was never to give up,” Cooper said. “Everybody told me that I couldn’t go here, that I shouldn’t be here, that I don’t deserve to be here. But I had one of the most incredible experiences of the entirety of my life.”
Connection, Cooper said, is something that is vital in making a good film, and something he kept in mind as he was working on his most recent project.
“The more personal that I can make something, the better chance I have at affecting you,” Cooper said. “I really do believe in this day and age, in this dark period in humanity that we really do all have a deep need to connect to each other.”
Cooper said he hopes to deeply affect people with “A Star Is Born,” and took time to ensure that the story felt authentic. Of the four years he spent working on the film, Cooper spent a year and a half of that time taking vocal lessons five days per week and learning guitar and piano.
Key in ensuring the authenticity of the film was having a female lead who was a singer. Lady Gaga, then, was a clear choice, Cooper said.
“There were certain things that I wanted to maintain the integrity of with this property, and there had to be a real singer, a real iconic person in the female role. I had seen Lady Gaga at a cancer benefit the previous night before I met her and she did La Vie En Rose and I was completely floored by her energy,” Cooper said. “I thought, ‘Wow, this is gonna be the one.’”
In selecting a story for his directorial debut, he was careful to choose one he felt he could relate with so that he could deeply affect the audience, Cooper said.
“I feel a tremendous amount of responsibility,” Cooper said. “The best thing I can do is come from a very deep, personal place and have a point of view about the story I want to tell.”

H*yas for Choice President Angela Maske (NHS ’19) is publicly pressing Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) (CAS ’80) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) in a push to stop Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation by visiting the senators’ offices multiple times a week.
Brett Kavanaugh, United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, was nominated July 9 to fill the seat on the Supreme Court of the United States vacated by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Reproductive rights advocates have expressed concern that Kavanaugh will overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision which legalized abortion nationwide, based on his conservative reputation and President Donald Trump’s expressed desire to see the precedent overturned.
Maske began visiting the offices of Murkowski and Collins three times a week in July shortly after Kavanaugh was nominated. She said she feels a responsibility to speak out against the nomination.
“I’m president of a reproductive justice student organization, and I recognize just how much of a threat his confirmation to the Supreme Court would be, especially for young people all over the country,” Maske said. “I know that if I didn’t do everything I could about the issue, that I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself for it if the outcome is that he is confirmed.”
Her attempts have garnered public support from pro-abortion rights organizations NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood, and both organizations invited her to speak at their rallies. Maske has also been featured in news coverage by Spectrum News and Rewire.
Maske said she chose to appeal to Murkowski and Collins because their past voting records indicate they are the two senators most likely to vote against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Maske, a Kentucky native, does not reside in either senator’s constituencies, but she said she did not believe her senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, would fight for reproductive rights.
“I’ve been visiting Senators Collins and Murkowski’s offices because it’s the best way I can find to make my voice heard about Kavanaugh’s nomination, since my own senators won’t stand up for my reproductive rights and health,” Maske said.
H*yas for Choice Vice President Kory Stuer (COL ’19), said that Maske’s advocacy serves to remind senators of the citizens who will be affected by Kavanaugh’s addition to the court and shifts the focus away from the politics of the nomination process.
“Angela and her work has spoken to a real need to correct the media narrative,” Stuer said. “So often, the media is focused on the political chess, and we aren’t looking at the people that will literally die if this man is confirmed to the Supreme Court. This is literally life or death, and that’s what Angela has been trying to uplift.”
HFC is used to battling against great obstacles to spread their message and support reproductive rights, Stuer said.
“As a group working at a Catholic and Jesuit University, the idea of defunding a reproductive health organization feels familiar to us,” Stuer said. “As a group who has frequently faced barriers doing the most simple things, the kind of barriers that they are trying to obstruct feels familiar to us.”
In addition to the support the group has garnered from other organizations, political student groups on campus have supported her right to free speech.
“Even though the Democratic platform is pro-choice and does support women’s bodily autonomy, because we are a funded student group on campus, we do have restrictions as to what kind of stances and what kind of actions we can do around reproductive justice, just because of Georgetown’s criteria,” Georgetown University College Democrats Chair Maria Cornell (SFS ’20) said. “It’s always really great to see H*yas for Choice able to be more vocal about those types of things.”
Georgetown University College Republicans President Jake Lyons (COL ’20) also supported H*yas for Choice’s vocal expression, regardless of the club’s collective opinion of Kavanaugh.
“Even though we do not agree with H*yas for Choice’s position in opposing Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination, we support HFC in freely expressing their opinions and being active in this nominating process,” Lyons said in an interview with The Hoya.
The activism Maske has participated in has not always felt positive or productive, she said.
“I have learned that activism is, at times, exhausting and feels like you’re yelling into the void. I think that, especially when you’re doing things on a day-to-day basis, it can feel very frustrating, especially when you don’t feel like your voice is being heard,” Maske said. “I have seen that a lot of people don’t value the voices of young people.”
While Maske recognizes that all of her work from the last two months may not result in the outcome she desires, she said she feels thankful for the experiences of activism.
“Whatever the outcome is in this fight, I feel very privileged that I’ve had the opportunity to engage in this work,” Maske said. “Obviously not everyone does have the ability, and so even though it has been really a lot of work, I’m really happy that I’ve been able to work on this issue. Regardless of the outcome, I think I will look back on this and be glad that I did everything I could to make my voice heard.”

The outer bands of Hurricane Florence are expected to pass over Washington, D.C., this weekend, with only some showers and above average breeze expected through Sunday. However, remnants of the storm may return next week, bringing greater rainfall and potential flooding.
Hurricane Florence was upgraded from a tropical storm to a hurricane on Sept. 9 and grew to a Category 4 Hurricane by Monday, according to The New York Times. By Sunday, states of emergency had been declared in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, according to CNN. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) declared a state of emergency the District on Tuesday, according to a news release.
In the Carolinas, 1 million people have evacuated in advance of the storm, according to The  Times. Florence is expected to make landfall Friday morning, according to the Weather Channel. Warnings of severe weather in the D.C. area also surfaced earlier in the week.
Geoffrey Chatas, senior vice president and chief operating officer for Georgetown University, urged students to take precautions before going outside.
“In anticipation of possible adverse conditions, the university has begun planning to ensure preparedness and is taking steps to prepare the campus for severe weather,” Chatas wrote in a          universitywide email Monday. “We ask that students consider conditions before going outside and stay out of restricted areas during a storm, for their safety and the safety of emergency personnel.”
Despite early warnings of severe weather, forecasts have downgraded the hurricane to a Category 1, according to the National Weather Service. Forecasts suggest it will now move farther south as storm tracks inland this weekend, sparing the District from the harsher weather expected farther down the coast, Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Based on the forecasted track of the storm we will be monitoring the storm closely as its effects close in on the Washington Region,” Gruber wrote. “At this point we are looking at moderate rain and winds arriving early next week.”
The storm’s path, however, is expected to reverse and return back north, possibly bringing increased rain next week, according to The Washington Post. The flood risk stems largely from the high levels of rain the region experienced earlier on in the week, according to
The Washington Post.
Chatas wrote a follow-up email to the Georgetown community Thursday, updating it on the status of the storm and the university’s expectations for the weekend.
“While we do not anticipate any changes to the University operating status, in the event of changes to our regular operations, we will send notification through the HOYAlert emergency notification system,” Chatas wrote.
“Because of the lowered expectations for rainfall, most scheduled events will continue as planned throughout the weekend,” Chatas wrote.
“At this point, all religious services and athletic events are scheduled to go forward as planned this weekend. Please check with event sponsors and websites regarding the status of any scheduled events for this weekend,” Chatas wrote.
Mary Watters (SFS ’21) has tracked the storm’s progress for the past few days because of plans to go home. She said while she is grateful she does not have to change her plans, she does not look forward to classes, which are set to take place as regularly scheduled.
“I have been watching the storm this past week because I have travel plans this Friday,” Watters wrote  in an email to The Hoya. “I’m so excited to be able to catch my train. However, I’m also a little bummed to be going to my 9:30 Econ Stat class tomorrow. ”

A new facial recognition system at Washington Dulles International Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport will replace boarding passes for all international flights by the end of the year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority announced Sept. 6. 
The biometric screening system, known as veriScan, is set to increase both convenience and security, according to a Sept. 6 MWAA news release. All international passengers will be required to stand in front of an iPad for a facial scan rather than have their boarding passes checked by hand. 
Dulles will join airports in major cities around the country like Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, Miami, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City, San Diego and Houston in using facial recognition technology.  
Customs and Border Protection will cross-reference the live photos of travellers with a collection of photos gathered from other government databases of that traveller, CBP said in a Sept. 6 news release.
“CBP uses airline manifest data to retrieve existing traveler photographs from government databases, including passports and visas, to build a photo gallery of travelers who are expected to arrive and depart the United States,” the release said. “CBP then compares the ‘live’ photographs of travelers taken with those that are already on file in DHS holdings. No new data is required.” 
Christina Saull, corporate communications manager at MWAA, said the technology, which was developed in-house at Dulles International Airport, is continuously evolving to become more effective and passenger-friendly. 
 “It’s something that we will continue to see evolve. There could be a future version of this which enables you not to have a boarding pass,” Saull said in an interview with The Hoya. “The basis of this technology certainly can enhance passengers’ experience as our end goal. As an airport, it’s to ensure that our passengers are having the best experience possible as they’re traveling through with us, and if our technology can play a role in that, we’re very happy to do that.”
The biometric facial recognitions system will send encrypted photos of the passengers to the CBP Traveler Verification Service, an online program that stores traveller information that will be used to verify each passenger’s identity, according to a Sept. 6 news release from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. The agency’s database will then analyze the real-time photo for similarities with past portraits of the passenger, according to The Washington Post. 
CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan highlighted how facial recognition technology will improve both efficiency and security for international flights in the unveiling of the technology.
“CBP and our airport and airlines partners are redefining travel by using biometric technology to add convenience, efficiency and security to international arrivals and departures,” McAleenan told The Washington Post. 
The system can be quickly integrated into all major U.S. airports with little challenge or delay because it is easy to install and only requires a short training session, according to the MWAA. 
“The veriScan system is uses battery-powered, Wi-Fi / cellular connected tablets that are portable and interchangeable among gates. Because of this, veriScan is easy to install, requiring only a 30-minute training before it can be used by airline gate agents, and costs one-tenth that of other commercially available solutions,” the MWAA news release said.
MWAA President and CEO Jack Potter said he is hopeful that the new technology will increase airport security. 
“In addition to helping meet the congressional mandate, we hope this technology becomes a useful and cost-effective tool for airports and airlines that process the growing number of travelers entering and leaving the United States,” Potter said in a CBP statement. 
The biometric system will also accelerate the entry and exit processes, as the photo verification takes less than two seconds. In the event the system malfunctions, gate agents can manually clear a passenger to the gate.

Georgetown University Alumni Association named Julia Farr (CAS ’88) its first female executive director and Paul Lanzone (MSB ’15) associate vice president of alumni engagement in a Sept. 10 announcement.
Farr is replacing Executive Director Bill Reynolds (CAS ’79), who served for 17 years and stepped down from his position in June. She previously worked as a corporate securities attorney, fashion designer and entrepreneur. In the years since her graduation, Farr has actively participated in the Georgetown community as a volunteer for the GUAA, including serving as president.
Lanzone is coming to Georgetown with 15 years of experience in alumni affairs, according to a Sept. 10 announcement from The Vice President for Advancement R. Bartley Moore. Lanzone previously worked on the alumni relations teams for George Washington University, the University of Rochester and Georgetown.
Founded in 1881, GUAA’s purpose is to build support for the university and connect over 175,000 alumni around the world for social, service and career opportunities, according to the GUAA website.
Moore commended Farr, a sixth-generation Washingtonian and third-generation Hoya, for her service to the Georgetown community in his announcement.
“Since graduating from Georgetown in 1988, Julie has had an extensive history of volunteerism with the Georgetown University Alumni Association,” Moore wrote in the announcement. “In addition to serving on the GUAA Board of Governors and as a Class Ambassador for many years, she served as President of the Georgetown University Alumni Association from 2010 to 2012.”
Farr could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.
Moore also highlighted Lanzone’s qualifications to be a leader of GUAA in the announcement.
“Paul joined Georgetown in 2010, and in his six years of service he supported Regional Clubs and Reunions, worked closely with the GUAA Board of Governors, and ultimately grew into a very capable leader as Assistant Vice President of Class Programs & Reunion Campaigns (CPRC) where he oversaw two alumni engagement and fundraising teams,” Moore wrote in the  announcement.
Lanzone said he looks forward to rejoining the Georgetown community.
“Returning to Georgetown feels like coming home,” Lanzone wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I have grown so much professionally, academically and personally here, and the Hoya community is like no other.”
Although students may not interact with him on a day-to-day basis, much of the work that he will do involves the well-being of students, Lanzone said.
“In my new role, my primary objective is to partner with the broader Georgetown community to ensure that every student has the opportunity to maintain a positive, meaningful relationship with Georgetown, and its one-of-a-kind alumni community, for life,” Lanzone said.

Washington, D.C.’s public school authority mistakenly posted the personal information of 2,000 students experiencing homelessness on a website run by the D.C. Council, where the data remained for seven months before its removal Aug. 9. 
Posted by District of Columbia Public Schools on Feb. 5, 2018, the information included names, dates of birth, identification numbers, schools, grade levels, attendance history, housing status and eligibility for special education and English Language Learner services, according to the Associated Press. 
A DCPS spokesperson told The Hoya that DCPS developed a plan to notify all affected families immediately after learning of the unauthorized disclosure.
“DCPS takes the safety and security of all student data seriously,” a spokesperson for DCPS wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Immediately after learning of the unauthorized disclosure, we began developing a plan to notify all affected families. Moving forward, DCPS will ensure that our personnel are fully aware of proper protocols around sensitive information so that the privacy of our students and families is always protected.”



The error occurred when DCPS “mistakenly included the student information in a spreadsheet it provided to the Council, which could be accessed on the Council’s website,” according to a letter sent by DCPS Interim Chancellor Amanda Alexander on Aug. 31 to the parents and guardians of the affected students. 
The website on which the information was posted is specifically linked to Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large), according to DCist. School officials provided Grosso’s office with the information in response to questions posed at a performance oversight hearing in the education committee, which Grosso chairs. 
After the information was discovered and reported by a student, it was removed from the Council’s website. The Council also destroyed all files containing the information. 
The Council violated federal law in publishing the information, but “authorities are reluctant to impose the penalty of removing federal funding,” according to the Associated Press. 
The letter from Alexander to affected families included a list of the categories of information shared, an assurance that the information was no longer available, an apology and resources for the families to receive more information. 
“Protection of student and family privacy is of utmost importance to DCPS and we consider this incident unacceptable,” Alexander wrote. “We apologize for this situation and want to assure you that we are taking steps to ensure a situation like this does not happen again.” 
DCPS has been dogged by scandals in the last two years. After boasting a record rise in graduation rates and test scores, an internal investigation revealed that several D.C. high schools had granted diplomas to students who should not have received them due to chronic truancy. In one school, investigators uncovered 4,000 alterations to attendance records to falsely mark absent students as present. In light of the new enforcement of truancy rules, the expected graduation rate in Washington, D.C., has dropped to 60 percent. 
Former DCPS Chancellor Antwan Wilson was forced to resign in February after allegedly using his position to bypass the 600-person waitlist and enroll his daughter in a top-rated District high school.
DCPS has also faced problems of residency fraud, losing over $500,000 in tuition collection after failing to follow the proper measures to verify the residency of students.

The Hoya Hub, an on-campus food pantry which will offer free food to members of the Georgetown community experiencing food insecurity, is slated to open in early October.
The project, which seeks to respond to concerns raised by the results of a 2016 Georgetown University Student Association survey in which 54 percent of respondents reported they were experiencing food insecurity while on campus, is chaired by Caroline Barnes (COL ’19). Sam Dubke (SFS ’21) and Madison Álvarez (SFS ’21) serve as the vice chairs.
Assistant Dean for Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr is working as an adviser on the project. Saxa Fund, a fundraising platform for Georgetown students, will fund the project and now has a page up where donations can be made.
Although the project is still a work in progress, the team recently acquired a space on the fourth floor of the Leavey Center, so Barnes is hopeful that the space will be up and running soon.
“Finally, we have this space right now, it’s on the fourth floor of Leavey,” Barnes said in an interview with The Hoya. “We don’t have the space right now for refrigerators or a freezer, so we can’t do anything more than nonperishables. But it’s a place to start, and it’s a place that we didn’t have a month ago.”
The leadership of the Hoya Hub used food pantries that exist at other universities as a model for the Georgetown pantry.
In a system similar to The George Washington University’s “The Store”, where students can fill out a form and use their IDs to enter the pantry, any student will have the ability access to the Hoya Hub. A key difference between the two pantries is the decision to implement an open-door policy for Georgetown’s pantry, where the doors will remain unlocked to allow unfettered access whenever a student needs it.
“We just thought that this would be the best way, especially when we’re getting things off the ground, to have people self-identify [with] an open-door policy,” Barnes said. “For the most part it’s going to be: if you know about it, if you could use it, you access it.”
The open-door policy allows for the students who use the pantry to remain anonymous, a plan the three student leaders sought, as students at other universities sometimes resort to drastic measures to protect their privacy because of the stigma attached toexperiencing food insecurity, Dubke said.
“There were people that would go at three in the morning to avoid being seen, unfortunately, because the stigma is real and people are afraid to be seen accessing that resource,” Dubke said in an interview with The Hoya.
The Hoya Hub will not collect data on or information from any of its patrons, but in the future, the team hopes to track the usage of the pantry, Álvarez said.
“One day hopefully we’ll be able to track how many people are visiting, when and what days,” Álvarez said.
The team working on the pantry, all former or current GUSA senators, found that the release of the 2016 survey findings made their conversations with university administrators easier. The results provided clear evidence to provide to administrators that food insecurity was a campuswide issue, Dubke said.
“There were administrators who didn’t believe that it was a problem,” Dubke said.
Álvarez said the situation needed to be addressed by the university.
“For an institution that tries so hard to meet the needs of all of its students, it can be hard to admit that what it’s providing is imperfect and that students are suffering now,” Álvarez said.
A university spokesperson said the university is seriously addressing the issue of food insecurity on its campus.
“Georgetown University meets the needs of students who require financial assistance paying for college, which includes tuition, housing and meal expenses,” Matt Hill, Georgetown’s media relations manager wrote in an email to The Hoya. “After the food pantry opens, we will continue broader dialogue about food insecurity across our campus so we can ensure the university is addressing the needs of community members seeking additional food resources.”
The team is hopeful that the project will develop beyond the food pantry, transforming the Hoya Hub into a place where students can raise concerns, bring ideas about food insecurity solutions and host events for students.
“Once we’re really up and running, we want there to be programming, we don’t just want this to be a place where you can come to go and get food,” Álvarez said. “The immediate solution that we’ve been spending a lot of time on is creating a food pantry, but we don’t plan on stopping there.”

A new Inclusive Innovation Fund is set to invest in developing Washington, D.C. businesses owned by minority entrepreneurs, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced Sept. 5. 
The fund, which is being organized in partnership with The Marathon Foundation, is meant to benefit people of color, women, members of the LGBTQ community, individuals with disabilities, and members of other minority communities.
TMF is set to begin investing in companies by mid-2019, planning on raising private capital for the fund over the next few months, according to a Sept. 5 news release. Although TMF will manage the new investment fund and the process of acquiring capital, the city has endowed $1.5 million in seed funding to initiate the program. In addition to raising capital, TMF will be tasked with orchestrating the actual investments in local startups.
A local, D.C.-based organization which focuses on helping entrepreneurs gain access to capital, TMF is led by Vernon Lee Jr. and Duane McKnight, experienced investment professionals. The foundation seeks to form strategic relationships consisting of access to capital and opportunities for developing talent, according to the TMF website.
The fund is a step in the process of expanding economic opportunity to D.C. residents, especially those in underrepresented communities, Bowser said.
“This partnership will break down financial barriers and move us one step closer to ensuring all Washingtonians, including underrepresented entrepreneurs, are able to share in our city’s continued prosperity,” Bowser said in the Sept. 5 news release.
The announcement comes as the newest part of the Bowser Administration’s overarching inclusive innovation strategy entitled Pathways to Inclusion. Released in November 2016, Pathways to Inclusion reiterated Bowser’s commitment to making Washington, D.C., a hub for innovation and technology on the East Coast and a global model for prosperity through diversity.
Since the beginning of her term, Bowser has prioritized the technology sector as a driver for future growth, a push that has been seen in numerous instances, including the city’s bid last year to host a new second headquarters for Amazon. 
Businesses eligible for fund money and assistance must be under the majority ownership of an individual or individuals from underrepresented groups and be in the pre-seed, seed or pre-Series A stages, which refer to young companies who have not entered or just begun entering the first round of venture capital funding, according to the Sept. 5 news release. In addition, the fund will direct its investments toward businesses that have the opportunity to scale. 
The design of the fund was developed by the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, which put out a Request for Information in February. The call for input from Washington, D.C. citizens received over 30 responses which guided the Bowser Administration’s approach in creating the fund. In April, the city began its search for a potential partner.
The fund is the next step in creating more economic opportunities for lower-income households in the District, Bowser said.
 “Together, we will build on our progress in making Washington, DC the capital of inclusive innovation and create more pathways to the middle class for District residents,” Bowser said in the Sept. 5 news release.
The Office of the Mayor and The Marathon Fund did not respond to requests for comments.

The School of Nursing and Health Studies is being recognized as a Center of Excellence in Nursing Education by the National League for Nursing in a ceremony in Chicago on Sept. 14.
The departments of advanced nursing practice and professional nursing practice, which are the school’s professional and advanced nursing programs, are both set to receive the designation. Georgetown’s recognition as a Center of Excellence is for 2018 through 2022, and is based on six National League for Nursing criteria: professionalism, values, educational innovations, curriculum, clinical engagement and community collaborations.
Patricia Cloonan, dean of the NHS, praised the school’s history and those in the school who applied for the designation for their success.
“This NLN designation shines a bright light on our distinguished history; a collective group of exceptional Georgetown nursing students, faculty, and alumni; and a future oriented toward innovation and enduring values,” Cloonan said in a July 24 news release. “I congratulate my colleagues on this successful application and the broader community for all that it says about them and their dedication.”
Edilma Yearwood, chair of the department of professional nursing practice, led the initiative to apply for the designation, working alongside colleagues to complete the application. The almost 95-page application explains how the NHS’s response to the six criteria.
“I thank Dr. Maggie Nolan and Dr. Jane Fall-Dickson who worked tirelessly with me on our application,” Yearwood said in the news release. “I also appreciate the efforts of Dr. Mary Haras, who reviewed the final product and provided suggestions to the team. We are happy to represent Georgetown in Chicago and bring home this prestigious designation.”
The NHS is specifically recognized for its achievements in “creating environments that enhance student learning and professional development,” a designation that Chair of the department of advanced nursing practice Mary Haras said is thanks to Georgetown’s Jesuit values.
“The National League for Nursing Center of Excellence designation for Creating Environments that Enhance Student Learning and Professional Development recognition is a testament to NHS’ commitment to our Jesuit values and values-based nursing model,” Haras wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This national recognition highlights the Departments of Nursings’ sustained commitment to creating a learning environment through program innovation in order to develop students’ values through engagement with community partners and faculty.”
Jane Fall-Dickson, assistant chair for research in the department of professional nursing practice, sees the value of cura personalis as essential to why the NHS earned the recognition.
“Our nursing programs are infused with Jesuit philosophy demonstrated by our students and faculty as they embrace working with vulnerable and underserved populations in local, national, and global communities informed by the value of cura personalis,” Fall-Dickson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The National League for Nursing is the oldest nursing organization in the United States and was founded in 1893, just 10 years before the NHS was established in 1903. The organization focuses on nursing education and is recognizing 15 other institutions at the Centers of Excellence ceremony during the 2018 National League for Nursing Education Summit.
The Centers of Excellence program is designed to create a model for other institutions of nursing education, National League for Nursing CEO Beverly Malone, who holds an honorary doctorate from Georgetown University, said in a news release.
“Centers of Excellence help raise the bar for all nursing programs by role modeling visionary leadership and environments of inclusive excellence that nurture the next generation of a strong and diverse nursing workforce to advance the health of the nation and the global community,” Malone said in the news release.
Margaret Nolan, interim program director of the Clinical Nurse Leader Program in the department of professional nursing practice, echoed Malone’s remarks on the significance of building the next generation of the nursing workforce.
“The NLN designation of Georgetown’s nursing programs as a Center of Excellence affirms what we have been doing since 1903, educating a world-class nursing workforce,” Nolan wrote in an email to The Hoya.“It both recognizes and advances that tradition of excellence.”

Yates Field House held its first annual Red Cross blood drive Tuesday to observe the 17th anniversary of Sept. 11.
Yates collaborated with the Student Health Advisory Board, Georgetown University’s Veterans Office and the McDonough School of Business MBA program to organize and host the event. Dog Tag Bakery served as an official sponsor and donated baked goods.
With a capacity of 85 students, faculty and members of the administration, the blood drive registration reached capacity well before the actual day of the drive, according to Yates Field House Director Meghan Dimsa. Hoyas turned up in such high volumes to donate blood that the Red Cross’ registration server crashed and many donors had to be turned away.
“We had one complication that I am extremely proud to share,” Dimsa wrote in an email to The Hoya.  “The interest from the Georgetown University Community completely crashed the American Red Cross registration site.  Our students, faculty, and staff truly stepped up, and we are grateful!”
Though not all were able to donate today, there will be another blood drive this fall taking place in the Leavey Center, according to Hannah Lee (GRD ’19), one of the organizers of the blood drive. Lee added that many of the donation slots would be filled with the donors who had to be turned away from Tuesday’s blood drive. According to her, the unexpectedly high turnout has sparked discussions to add more blood drives to the calendar for this year.
“Due to the massive success of this drive, the Yates team and I are discussing making this event biannual and combining forces for a spring blood drive,” Lee wrote in an email to The Hoya.
SHAB began to look into the possibility of holding a large blood drive on campus last spring because they thought there were large numbers of students and faculty that wanted to donate, according to the Assistant Vice President of Student HealthVince Winkler Prins.
“Blood donation on campus has been going on for a long time, some of it organized on main campus through the Hoya Blood Donors student group and some of it on the medical campus,” Winkler Prins wrote in an email toThe Hoya. “We felt that we could go bigger with events targeting faculty, staff and students and a communications campaign to support it.”
The SHAB selected Yates to host the blood drive because Yates Fieldhouse Director Meghan Dimsa sits on the advisory board and offered for it as a possible location for the event.
Though SHAB initially conceived the idea, Winkler Prins said Yates’ staff contributed significantly to the actual development of the project.
“The student health advisory board developed the vision and the good people at Yates were responsible for developing the partnership with the business school and the veterans’ office,” Winkler Prins wrote.
When considering possible dates for the blood drive, Assistant Director of Yates Field House Bethany Bower suggested Sept. 11 due to the day’s historical significance.
“[Bower] noted that 9/11 was a day of service and rightly suggested that Yates would be honored to bring this day of service and memory for students to easily access while on campus,” Dimsa wrote.
Lee wrote that she wanted to provide a venue for Hoyas who wanted to donate blood, but may have had trouble finding one.
“I just wanted an easy way to donate. In Florida, I can easily run into a Red Cross whenever I go back to my hometown. However, blood drives in the D.C. area are less visible,” Lee wrote.
Blood drives used to occur twice a month in Bulldog Alley due to the efforts of Georgetown student group Hoya Blood Donors, an organization established to promote blood drives on campus. However, since the organization’s dissolution last year, blood drives no longer occur with such frequency.
The group suffered greatly from its inability to recruit new donors, Maria Jose Rivera (COL ’19), a former member of Hoya Blood Donors, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“In the most recent years, the organization began to rely on these ‘regulars’ rather than try to incorporate more new donors by reaching out to the undergrad community. As a result, many people just never really knew that the drives were going on,” Rivera wrote.
Rivera wrote that the blood drive today benefited from the large coalition that supported it, and added that she hopes blood drives will start to occur more often again.
“I am very glad that a blood drive was held today, and that it was so successful in terms of recruiting donors. It also benefitted from lots of faculty support and outreach to the grad community,” Rivera wrote. “I would love to be able to coordinate blood drives more than once a year, as I think the Georgetown campus is a great place to find donors and volunteers.”
Special to The Hoya

Ann and Bruce Blume (LAW ’80) donated $10 million to the Georgetown University Law Center, the largest-ever one-time donation to the Law Center, to create the Blume Public Leadership Institute.
The Blume Institute will provide full-tuition scholarships to students who demonstrate public leadership potential, according to a Law Center news report.
Bruce said the $10 million gift is an opportunity to serve Law Center students in a way that aligns with Georgetown values.
“Ann and I are so honored to be part of the Georgetown Law community. It is such an important global institution, and it is very exciting to be connected to it,” Blume wrote in a Sept. 6 news release. “For Ann and me, the concept of providing scholarships in perpetuity to the top students in the country in public leadership speaks to what we both believe in, our mission in life, and to Georgetown’s ethos of service to others.”
Blume is the founder and chief executive officer of Blume Company Real Estate, a real estate development firm based in Seattle. He serves on the University of Washington Foundation’s board of directors, as well as the Law Center Board of Visitors, which is a group individuals chosen from the public and private sector to offer advice to the dean of the Law School on how to better the program.
Ann Blume serves on Seattle University’s Board of Trustees and the Cornell University College of Human Ecology Advisory Council, an outside advisory group for the College.
Together, the Blumes founded the Bruce and Ann Blume Fund, which supports public health, educational and environmental projects. The pair has also contributed to SightLife, a global health nonprofit that works to eliminate blindness through corneal transplant tissue recovery.
Outside of their fund, the Blumes’ philanthropic work has included hosting fundraising dinners for former President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2014.
William Bailey, the senior director of campaign management and Strategic Initiatives at the Law Center, said that selection is underway for eight Blume Scholars this academic year. Ten additional first-year students will receive Blume Scholarships in subsequent years.
“Per the Blumes’ gift agreement with Georgetown, selection is to be done by at the direction of the Dean,” Bailey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Currently, we are collaborating with colleagues administering the existing Public Interest Law Scholars program. Long term, planning is underway to determine whether a committee will convene to select Blume Scholars.”
Though the Blumes’ gift is the largest one-time donation to the Law Center, others have contributed more over many years, according to Bailey. Other donors include alumni Linda and Tim O’Neill, who have donated totals over $20 million, including $12 million to Law Center initiatives, specifically the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, according to Bailey.
The Blume Institute furthers Georgetown’s mission of service in leadership, Law Center Dean William Treanor said.
“By enabling Georgetown to attract and educate the next generation of public interest leaders, the Blume Institute aligns perfectly with our Jesuit tradition of service,” Treanor wrote in a Sept. 6 news release. “In years to come, I fully expect to see Blume Scholars emerge as leaders in all branches of federal and state government, as well as at major nonprofits, NGOs, and in the business sector.”

Local government has the potential to create influential change, panelists at the first Hoyas in Politics and Public Service Career Chat of the year said on Wednesday.
The panel, hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, featured former Nebraska State Sen. Tanya Cook (MSB ’86), Vice Chair of the Arlington County Board Christian Dorsey (SFS ’93) and Managing Director of Georgetown Public Affairs David Catania (SFS ’90, LAW ’94). The event was moderated by Chris Murphy (LAW ’98), the vice president for government relations and community engagement at Georgetown.
The Hoyas in Politics and Public Service chats, dubbed HIPPSter Chat by GU Politics, began in 2015 when Dan Pfeiffer (COL ’98), former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, came to a chat.
While discussing their own experiences working in government, each panelist touched on the ability of state and local officials to impact the everyday lives of their communities.
“I was able to do things that I was very proud of; things like reforming our tax code, incentivizing tech businesses, medical marijuana, minimum wage increases, things you take for granted,” Catania said. “You were able to actually do things and see them.”
Dorsey emphasized the efficient nature of local government in its ability to enact change.
“I can tell you most assuredly that this is where you get things done,” Dorsey said. “When it comes to the daily gratification of a job done that improves people’s lives, I can’t imagine a better venue than local government.”
Dorsey also stressed how fulfilling state and local work can be and the massive potential for impactful societal change.
“I can honestly say that there is not a single day, no matter how frustrating or how challenging, where I can’t fundamentally explain to my children at home: here is how I made a positive contribution, and that to me is the world,” Dorsey said.
In addition to telling their own stories, the panelists, who are all Hoyas themselves, also took the time to give advice to current students.
“You’re going to exceed expectations and anticipate needs,” Catania said. “There’s no substitute for being the hardest worker in the office.”
HIPPSter Chats began in 2015, when the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service was first launched. The purpose of the program is to connect students with successful alumni working in a diverse range of fields in politics and public service, according to Jennie Fay, director of fellows and career programming at GU Politics.
Previous HIPPSter events have brought in speakers such as Boris Epshteyn (SFS ’04, LAW ’07), a Republican strategist who worked on President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, as well as Speaker Paul Ryan’s chief of staff, Jonathan Burks (SFS ’99). This year, GU Politics is looking to expand the program further and potentially host up to three events each semester.
Ultimately, HIPPSter Chats intend to be a resource for students interested in politics, according to Fay.
“The program hopes to accomplish a greater connection with the political and public service community, as well as help open students eyes to the many career paths they can take in those areas,” Fay wrote in an email to TheHoya.
Dorsey remembered her time as an undergraduate and emphasized how important events like these are to students.
“The reason I even accepted the invitation was because I thought back and ruminated about how useful this would’ve been when I was a Georgetown senior,” Dorsey said. “This is really what alumni networks should be about.”
Cook emphasized the large breadth of experience that alumni have to share with students, which makes the discussions meaningful.
“I think the value may really be on the alumni side, because they get to tell the students things that they weren’t able to learn in the classroom, things about how to value their elite education here,” Cook said.
Students at the event reiterated the significance of connecting with alumni and learning from their professional experiences.
“We students are getting ready to go into the professional world, we are getting ready to have our say,” Joshua Marín-Mora (SFS ’21) said in an interview with TheHoya. “I think it’s important to learn from people who have already been there and by learning this, we are a little bit more prepared for getting out and trying to have our own impact.”
