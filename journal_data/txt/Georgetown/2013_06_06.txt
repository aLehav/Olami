Tuscany Cafe is currently closed and, according to unconfirmed reports, the cafe is closing permanently.
The restaurant usually opens at 11 a.m. on weekdays, according to its website.
Public records show that Tuscany’s license was set to expire May 31. According to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs,  Aokas Brothers Inc.’s license was not renewed. The DCRA could not provide information as to whether or not Tuscany’s applied to renew its license.
The owners did not respond to request for comment by press time.
