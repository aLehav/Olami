The Georgetown University Master of Science in Foreign Service program hosted former U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker on Feb. 22 for a discussion on a career in diplomacy and current events in global affairs.
The event was moderated by Paul Miller, a School of Foreign Service professor of the practice of international affairs. Crocker, a decorated career foreign service officer who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009, discussed his experience as U.S. ambassador to six Middle Eastern countries under former U.S. Presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.
Crocker served as U.S. ambassador to Lebanon from 1990 to 1993; ambassador to Kuwait from 1994 to 1997; ambassador to Syria from 1999 to 2001; ambassador to Pakistan from 2004 to 2007; ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009; and ambassador to Afghanistan from 2011 to 2012. 
Crocker spent his childhood traveling around the world as the son of a career officer of the U.S. Air Force. Crocker’s experiences visiting the Middle East inspired him to join the foreign service in 1972.
“I had the opportunity to visit Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, with my parents and just fell in love with it. Just something about it. It just grabbed me,” Crocker said. “Fascinating part of the world. I’ve gotta figure out a way to get back to it at some point.” 
Crocker served mainly in the Middle East after joining the foreign service — including as a staffer in Lebanon when jihadi militants set off a suicide car bomb outside the U.S. embassy in 1983, killing 63 — and said he adapted quickly to these wartime environments.
“Danger, per se, was never that big of an issue for me,” Crocker said. “You do responsible things, of course, not to get gratuitously killed. Creates a lot of paperwork, but beyond that, I discovered I actually liked it.”
“Time would seem to slow down. Things would become much clearer than they would without the artillery in the background,” Crocker added. “Either you have that gene or you don’t, and I guess I had it.”
Crocker said life as a foreign service officer has changed substantially since he joined, with families of officers often now unable to join them in posts abroad. 
“Back in the olden days, an individual joined the foreign service who could have a reasonable expectation that she or he would travel to interesting places with family, the kids would have a wonderful educational experience studying in international schools and so forth,” Crocker said at the event. “That foreign service has changed a lot.”
Crocker said a knowledge of regional history and the perception of that history by locals is crucial for any aspiring foreign service officer to understand the countries in which they serve. 
“I didn’t really know much history. Most of us don’t in America. We’re not about yesterday, and we’re about today and tomorrow. That’s how we build our country,” Crocker said. 
Although the United States has typically been active politically and militarily in the Middle East and Central Asia, recent years have seen U.S. presidents take a more passive role in Middle Eastern and Central Asian affairs — culminating in President Joe Biden’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.
“I would say that acceptance and assertion of a global leadership role by the United States has now been increasingly called into question, not so much by potential international rivals, but by our own population and our own leaders,” Crocker said.
As a veteran diplomat and expert on Middle East affairs, Crocker said U.S. leaders need to readopt a more active policy toward the region. 
“My view of the Middle East and where it was and where it’s going has a lot to do with, frankly, what we decide to do as Americans, whether we are still ready and able to play the principal external role in the Middle East, which is what we have done since the end of World War II,” Crocker said.
Crocker said Biden’s foreign policy choices regarding the war in Ukraine set an example for strategies that the United States should be pursuing in the Middle East. 
“He’s pretty much got it as right as you could ever hope,” Crocker said. “Hours and hours and hours spent with the European Union, with NATO, with others, doing whatever it took to send the signal that the U.S. is, in fact, back. We are ready and able to stand up for global peace of security, and we can still rally a very strong alliance to support us in this.”
Crocker said there is a long-term need for U.S. leaders to exercise careful judgment in every decision in an age of foreign policy insecurity.
“Your major actions, whether to intervene or to disengage, carry with them not just third and fourth order consequences, but 40th and 50th order consequences that you cannot maybe even imagine,” Crocker said.

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate unanimously approved three resolutions at its Feb. 19 meeting, which aim to address student concerns about the Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD), meal exchange options and finding roommates.
At the meeting, the senate passed an act to set up a student survey review of GUPD, an act to improve the campus Living Preference Questionnaire (LPQ) form and a resolution to clarify meal exchange options at Epicurean & Company, an on-campus restaurant. The senate also swore in new member Ana Martinez (SFS ’24) at the meeting, who will fill the class of 2024 senate seat, which was vacant following the Feb. 5 impeachment of former Senator Olivia Valante (CAS ’24).
Senators Megan Skinner (SFS ’24) and Rhea Iyer (CAS ’26) sponsored the act to encourage student feedback on GUPD. The act asks GUSA to distribute and publish an annual survey on students’ experiences with GUPD and to conduct a yearly review of GUPD’s efficacy after publishing survey results.
GUSA will set up a roundtable discussion with GUPD officials, students and GUSA members under this act with the aim of ensuring students feel truly protected on campus. 
“Concerns about the conduct of GUPD have been heightened in the 2022-2023 school year,” the resolution reads. “Gathering data on student experiences with GUPD is in the interest of campus safety.”
GUPD has faced recent student backlash after conducting an investigation into a hate crime committed against LaHannah Giles (CAS ’23). GUPD lost footage related to the hate crime, and the university and GUPD have failed to take action against the perpetrator.
Skinner said that GUPD wants to hear from GUSA members and other students about how GUPD can better serve the community. 
“We are hoping to actually institutionalize that feedback cycle to improve GUPD, especially because tensions between students and GUPD and the administration have been extremely high this semester,” Skinner said at the meeting. “GUSA can have a student experience survey that they distribute to the whole student population every year just to hear feedback, hear students’ experiences, hear what their concerns are, what they hope we can talk to GUPD about.”
Senators Meriam Ahmad (CAS ’26) and Jibril Syed (MSB ’24) also introduced a resolution urging Epicurean to better represent items on its meal exchange menu, which Senate Speaker Manahal Fazal (SFS ’24) co-sponsored. Currently, the ordering kiosks do not list certain meals that are available under the Meal Exchange plan, like the vegetarian Beyond burger, cheese quesadilla and vegetable quesadilla.
“There are limited vegetarian options covered under the Meal Exchange plan for students at Epicurean, and lack of visibility of the options prevents students with such dietary restrictions from using the meal exchanges,” the resolution reads. “To order Meal Exchange items that are not visible on the kiosk students have to order through an Epicurean employee at checkout which creates unnecessary barriers to ordering food.”
Ahmad said the act urges Epicurean to accurately advertise items available via Meal Exchange and make those meals available through its ordering kiosk.
“Epi is having inconsistencies with what’s on the Meal Exchange plan, what’s covered and what’s not,” Ahmad said at the meeting. “This resolution would encourage Epi’s to adopt the clarity on that so that people know what they can eat, what’s covered and to make sure that there isn’t any discrepancies in what’s on the kiosk and what’s actually covered.”
The final resolution, which Senators Rogan Zangari (SOH ’23) and Dylan Davis (CAS ’26) introduced and Senator Lucy Sonsalla (SFS, MSB ’23) co-sponsored, would modify the LPQ form, which the university uses to determine roommate compatibility in the Campus Housing Roommate Matching System (CHARMS).
The current LPQ form, which incoming first-years and some upperclassmen use to find roommates, consists of several multiple-choice questions, including whether students think it’s important for their rooms to be clean and whether students plan to get involved with extracurricular activities. 
“It is understood that there are more components of a healthy roommate relationship than what is contained in the current questions,” the act reads. “The current LPQ form is lacking in open ended questions.”
Zangari said there are changes that can make the form better. The act proposes adding questions discussing political preferences, overnight guests and comfort sharing life experiences with potential roommates. 
“The CHARMS form right now is complete garbage as understood,” Zangari said at the meeting. “It’s like five, six questions, and we think there’s a lot of improvements that can be made.”

The United States Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo spoke to Georgetown University students Feb. 23 to discuss department efforts to increase U.S. manufacturing capabilities and the future of technology. 
Raimondo, the current secretary of commerce and former governor of Rhode Island, delivered individual remarks in the Lohrfink Auditorium at the McDonough School of Business before participating in a moderated question-and-answer session. Raimondo largely discussed the importance of the 2022 Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act (CHIPS), which aims to establish the United States as a semiconductor-manufacturing superpower by allocating federal funds to subsidize companies within the industry.
Vice President Kamala Harris swore in Raimondo two months after President Joe Biden’s inauguration. Before serving as secretary of commerce, Raimondo graduated from Harvard University, Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and Yale Law School. 
Raimondo said the CHIPS Act will be vital to the longevity and future of technological manufacturing in the United States, given America’s loss of semiconductor jobs to countries like Taiwan, which produces 92% of the world’s most advanced chips.
“The research, innovation and manufacturing sparked by this law will enable the U.S. to be the technological superpower,” Raimondo said at the event. “The money is intended to incentivize companies to manufacture semiconductors in America.”
Raimondo said several key U.S. traits, like a commitment to innovation, have allowed it to maintain a significant technological influence in the global market over the years.
“We have always been a nation of invention, entrepreneurship and innovation,” Raimondo said. “That’s our edge. We have to keep that edge.”
Focusing on educating traditionally underrepresented groups in chip technology through high schools and community colleges will be key to the future of the industry, according to Raimondo. 
“To meet the demand of the industry, I am calling on semiconductor companies and their supply chain to work with high schools and community colleges to train 100,000 new technicians in the next decade through creative apprenticeships, career and technical education and career programs,” Raimondo said. “This is doable.”
Raimondo said that universities need to also recruit historically underrepresented groups and encourage technical degrees so that they can jumpstart their careers in the industry and boost the economy as a whole. 
“These colleges and universities have to expand their recruitment pipelines so that women, people of color, veterans and underserved communities can get these degrees and launch their careers,” Raimondo said. “I am challenging us and calling on colleges and universities to triple the number of graduates in semiconductor related fields, including engineering. This isn’t a political agenda. This is math.” 
Given the vast growth and power of modern technology, it is important to keep such technology out of the hands of those with bad intentions, according to Raimondo.
“AI and quantum cloud, big data, the foundation of chips — every one of those technologies can be used for good or, in the wrong hands, can be used for malign purposes like we’ve never seen,” Raimondo said. 
Raimondo also said that the CHIPS Act and semiconductor manufacturing are integral parts of U.S. foreign policy.
“This is fundamentally a national security initiative,” Raimondo said. “The return on our investment is the achievement of national security goals.”
“I am here to issue a call to all of America — public sector, private sector, private investors — to get in the boat, row with us, achieving this mission and invest in the CHIPS industry. Invest in the supply chain. Invest in the talent,” Raimondo said.
