Students of Georgetown, Inc. was forced to close all its storefronts for two hours Monday in response to a hack on its servers.
This measure was taken as a precaution to protect the integrity of its Square payment software. The Corp’s website, which is still not operational as of press time, has redirected to a page showing that the website was undergoing maintenance since Saturday night and listing its services’ hours.
CEO of The Corp Taylor Tobin (COL ’17) wrote in an email to The Hoya that no employee or customer information was lost in the attacks.
“We apologize for any inconvenience imposed on students, faculty, or other members of the Georgetown community,” Tobin wrote. “We would also like to emphasize that personal information was not compromised, either from our employees or customers.”
According to Tobin, it is not yet known who launched the attacks or what the motives may have been. Members of The Corp IT service worked Sunday and Monday to fix the data damage the hack caused.
Nick Gloria (COL ’19) said he was disappointed to find that he was unable to pick up a drink at Midnight Mug on his way to class Monday.
“I go to Midnight Mug almost every morning, so it was pretty inconvenient that I couldn’t today,” he said. “It’s sad to see a campus organization hacked like this. Hopefully they recover quickly and no serious damage was done.”

After a decade of work and more than $200 million in investment, the District Department of Transportation and Mayor Muriel Bowser officially unveiled the D.C. streetcar Saturday.
The streetcar, which begins behind Union Station and runs for 2.2 miles along H Street and Benning Road N.E., east of the Capitol building, offers eight stops. The cars will operate every day except Sunday, from 6 a.m. until midnight on weekdays and 8 a.m. until 2 a.m. on Saturdays. In 2010, officials estimated that the cars would carry 1,500 people every day, according to The Washington Post.
Bowser announced that the streetcar will be free to passengers for six months. The District Department of Transportation has not yet decided on the amount it will charge passengers when it has the means of doing so, as the fare collection system was not finished in time for the launch.
“I’m proud to announce that Streetcar is ready for passenger service,” Bowser said in a press release Feb. 27. “As a way of saying ‘thank you,’ fares will be free on the system for an initial period of time.”
The District’s attempts at establishing an operating streetcar system have been plagued with issues in the past. Bowser is the fourth mayor to hold office since plans for the streetcar were announced in 2004. Former Mayor Vincent Gray had intended to launch the system by the end of his term, but during DDOT testing the streetcar simulation service was involved in eight collisions (“Streetcar Project Delayed Repeatedly,” The Hoya, Jan. 23, 2015).
Over the years, the streetcar system has cost over $200 million to implement.
The DDOT plans to expand the streetcars westward, through center city toward Georgetown. The project will be completed by 2022 according to officials, who are also open to expanding the railway eastward.
D.C. already has X-Line metro buses that run further east and west on the same route and carry more than 12,000 riders a day. According to The Washington Post, these buses take about 19 minutes to pass through the same 2.2-mile route, which takes the streetcars 26 minutes to complete. To walk the route would take about 27 minutes. The streetcars currently run every 15 minutes, but DDOT officials said they hope to reduce this to 12.
Because areas of the track run next to parking spaces on H Street, streetcar operators must constantly slow down to look for drivers pulling out and in as well as other pedestrians going to their cars.
In a press release Feb. 27, DDOT Director Leif Dormsjo said the Bowser administration discovered several issues with the streetcars shortly after the mayor took office in 2015, including poor safety oversight and faulty infrastructure that required replacement. However, Dormsjo expressed cautious optimism about the future of the streetcars.
“Mayor Bowser charged my team with taking a failed streetcar program and making it work for District residents,” Dormsjo said. “After years of overspending, mismanagement and a lack of direction, we made it happen.”

The D.C. Public School system announced plans Feb. 16 to bolster its alternative high schools, which are designed to cater to students who may need flexibility in their schedules or extra assistance in academics, by allocating an additional $4 million to nontraditional programs in its 2017 budget.
Alternative high schools aim to allow students who have had extended absences from school, possibly due to factors such as pregnancy or imprisonment, to return to the conventional high school process.
DCPS currently has four existing alternative high schools: Luke C. Moore, Washington Metropolitan, Roosevelt STAY and Ballou STAY.
D.C. Councilmember and Chairperson of the D.C. Committee of Education David Grosso (I-At Large) emphasized the importance of alternative schools in promoting educational success for students from different backgrounds.
“These alternative schools are designed to make sure that every student in the D.C., no matter what their struggles are in life, or what’s happening in their world, can have the opportunity to get a traditional high school diploma,” Grosso said. “It’s a smart, strong commitment to make sure that every student has the best opportunity to succeed.”
DCPS Chancellor Kaya Henderson said the increased budget allocation to alternative high schools is intended to ensure success in alternative school students.
“D.C. Public Schools serves all students and, in that mission, we need to do more for our students taking alternative paths toward graduation,” Henderson said in a press release Feb. 16. “This $4 million investment will ensure students in comprehensive high schools stay on track and students in alternative schools have a plan to graduate high school prepared for college and career.”
D.C. has increased its budget for schools by 22 percent since fiscal year 2012, which Henderson said has aided her in fulfilling her promise to serve all grade levels through investments in elementary, middle and high schools. Additionally, DCPS has seen an 18 percent increase in teachers since fiscal year 2013.
“Over the years, DCPS has made strategic investments to improve outcomes for all of our students,” Henderson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This new investment in alternative schools shows that DCPS is living up to its commitment to serve all students. Here at DCPS, all means all.”
The budget allocates for the hiring of directors of pathways, who will provide individualized support to overage, undercredited high school students. They aim to help students work toward graduation by providing services such as counseling and personalized academic plans.
“This is an effort to target students and equip students who have been disconnected,” Grosso said.
The Empowering Males High School, which will open in the fall of 2016, is a new type of alternative school. It will be the District’s only all-male, college-preparatory high school with an emphasis on humanities and classical languages. The school will have smaller class sizes, community service projects and leadership programs. According to Grosso, the school was established because of the major achievement gap in D.C.’s Latino and African-American males.
Grosso said Empowering Males aims to celebrate students’ cultural history and their individualism as community members in D.C.
“We needed to put something dramatic in place that can give them the opportunity to shine for greatness in our schools,” Grosso said.
DCPS Press Secretary Michelle Lerner said she hoped that this year’s increased investment will help to secure the future of struggling students.
“DCPS is investing $4 million in alternative schools for Fiscal Year 2017 because we believe that we need to do more for our students taking alternative paths toward graduation,” Lerner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This investment will ensure that students in comprehensive high schools stay on track and students in alternative schools have a plan to graduate high school prepared for college and career.”
Maddy Taub (COL ’18), a D.C. resident and graduate of DCPS school Woodrow Wilson High, stressed the importance of alternative and nontraditional programs as options for students who may not do well in mainstream high schools.
“There is definitely a good reason for the push towards alternative high school. Traditional D.C. public schools tend to try and prepare kids for standardized testing and college when a lot of kids do not want to go to college or do not have the means to go to college,” Taub said. “Alternative high schools would give these students a greater opportunity to get a specialized education that could allow them to go towards other career paths.”
