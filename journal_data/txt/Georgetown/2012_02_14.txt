The seven candidates vying for the GUSA presidency strived to set their platforms apart in this year’s crowded field at a debate Sunday night.
The candidates’ opening statements in the Leavey Program Room largely emphasized the components that made their respective plans for the presidency unique, although all the tickets propose several overlapping initiatives.
Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), Georgetown University Student Association senator and Finance and Appropriations Committee chair, began the debate by praising GUSA’srecent progress while touting his platform’s comprehensiveness and relevance to students.
GUSA Senator Daniel LaMagna (COL ’13) claimed to be the candidate with the most experience with facilities and government transparency. LaMagna, who represents half of Henle Village, has provided video updates for his constituents on his progress in the senate.
The debate was one of LaMagna’s first opportunities to advocate for himself as a candidate, because he delayed launching his campaign until Monday. Other candidates began campaigning last Thursday at 12 a.m.
LaMagna suffered a few setbacks during the debate – his cell phone rang and he rebutted GUSADirector of Special Projects Tyler Sax’s (COL ’13) point about engaging the student body with a nearly verbatim response.
Candidates made expanded student outreach a focus of the debate, although the most effective way of engaging with students was a point of contention. GUSA Fund Chair Murphy Kate Delaney (COL ’13) advocated for increasing the student services that GUSA offers, such as a bike share program. Sax proposed creating a website that would allow students to suggest initiatives for GUSA to pursue.
“No individual, not even a small group of people, can have a monopoly on good ideas,” he said.
Senate Vice Speaker Nate Tisa (COL ’14) worked to dispel possible criticism due to his standing as the campaign’s lone sophomore presidential candidate.
“The word ‘experience’ will be thrown around a lot tonight, and we want to remind you that it’s about quality, not quantity,” he said.
While fielding questions from moderators, Malkerson was asked to explain two controversial components of his proposed budget, which was publicly released on Friday. His estimated budget is $162,000, six times larger than the allocated budget of the previous winning campaign. Malkersondefended his budget by noting the increase in money available for allocation to student activities, as well as parts of his budget that would assist other student organizations. Malkerson’s GUSA-specific budget totals $19,000, while additional items, such as funding for the spring concert and the Collegiate Readership Program, are projected at $144,000.
Senator Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), whose projected $23,400 budget represents a decrease from the previous administration’s, disagreed with Malkerson’s reasoning. She believed that other clubs should be allocated more money so that they can independently control how it is spent.
Malkerson was also asked to respond to a question submitted by GUSA Director of Funding and Administration Reform Shuo Yan Tan (SFS ’12), who expressed concern that elements of Malkerson’sbudget could be considered executive overreach. Malkerson emphasized that he does not wish to increase GUSA’s power and instead aims to protect student groups through his initiatives.
Malkerson also called Tisa’s platform much more concerning. Tisa has proposed removing what he terms a hierarchical structure in favor of an executive branch that would work collaboratively with the student advisory boards. Tisa said in response that he is inviting the boards to engage in a “cooperativedialogue,” not attempting to absorb them into GUSA.
The candidates initially struggled when asked who they believe is the second-best candidate in the field.LaMagna and Gustafson eventually settled on Malkerson, while Malkerson named Gustafson’s as the second-best ticket. GUSA Executive Deputy Chief of Staff John Morris (COL ’13) and Tisa selected Delaney, who in turn chose Morris. Sax avoided naming a candidate by jokingly asking voters to write him in as their second choice.
As the debate drew to a close, candidates were asked to name their top two priorities if elected. Morris cited strengthening the Student Advocacy Office and implementing a GUSA student fellows program that would allow students to lecture on topics in which they are well versed. Tisa, who has made increasing GUSA’s diversity a focal point of his campaign, proposed a unity fair that allows students of different races, religions and sexualities to come together to celebrate diversity.
In his closing statement, Sax praised the ideas that other candidates have proposed, and said that he hoped candidates implement them if elected. He distinguished his platform by emphasizing his ticket’s method of obtaining and implementing initiatives.
“I stand before you today not because I disagree with my opponents and the ideas being brought to the table, but because I believe in a different way of getting there,” he said.
Vice presidential candidates will debate at 8:20 p.m. Wednesday in White-Gravenor 201A.
Correction: The article previously stated that the vice presidential debate will be at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday.

The university is seeking a site in downtown D.C. to become a new home for its School of Continuing Studies, according to the university’s latest financial plan.
“The new location is needed to consolidate its programs in Virginia and Georgetown in a single footprint, thus enabling SCS to grow its programs and meet its strategic goals,” the document states.
In the past three years, the SCS has increased its enrollment by about 360 percent. The school’s center in Clarendon, Va., houses the university’s Center for Continuing and Professional Education and the master’s degree programs in Technology Management,  Journalism and Public Relations and Corporate Communications.
In a letter introducing Georgetown University’s Financial Plan 2013-2016, COO Chris Augostini wrote that the new downtown location will be more accessible to prospective students who work downtown.
He added that the new site would allow for the expansion of the SCS in fields such as emergency management and urban and regional planning as well as programs that would prepare students for biomedical industries and related government agencies.
The creation of the additional campus, which was dubbed “Georgetown Downtown” by University President John J. DeGioia earlier this year, is expected to cost $11,507,000 between fiscal years 2011 and 2013 according to the financial plan. The projected expenses include planning, designing, constructing and installing the necessary furniture and fixtures. About $7,500 is anticipated to come from operating surpluses, while the rest would be financed by debt.
According to Director of Media Relations and Public Affairs Rachel Pugh, the administration is considering several locations throughout D.C. The university hopes to lease an approximately 85,000 square foot space for 15 years.
“We are still determining our exact space needs but hope to be near a Metro station and are exploring options across the [metropolitan] area,” she wrote in an email.
The relocation of 1,000 graduate and professional students off of Georgetown’s main campus by Dec. 31, 2013, was originally a concession made by the administration during the ongoing debate over the 2010 Campus Plan. The measure was intended to address complaints about noise levels and lower home maintenance levels due to increased graduate student residence in Burleith and West Georgetown.

After the D.C. Zoning Commission announced a third deferral of its ruling on the university’s 2010 Campus Plan Thursday, representatives of both the neighborhood and university voiced exasperation at the continuing delays.
Thursday’s hearing, the sixth before the Zoning Commission, was intended to be the last in what has been a long and contentious process.
Chris Clements, president of the Burleith Citizens Association, said that his constituents were displeased that no conclusion was reached last week, and are eager for solutions to the issues that have divided local residents and the university in recent months.
“We are disappointed that a decision wasn’t made, honestly,” Clements said. “It’s been going on for quite some time, and I think everyone was looking for some finality.”
Clements added that, regardless of the commission’s final decision, the delay has simply prolonged the longstanding conflict between the university and its neighbors.
“The main effect is that it keeps the issue going. … It’s one of those things where everyone is looking forward to a decision one way or the other,” Clements said.
Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) expressed similar frustration, but stressed that the commission should take the necessary time to make a balanced decision.
“While I was disappointed that the Zoning Commission decided to delay their decision, I can understand it if the commissioners felt they did not have information to make a reasonable and informed decision,”Laverriere said.
The decision to put off a final ruling on the plan leaves several key issues up in the air, most significantly the question of how many students will be allowed to live off campus in the coming years.
A report released by Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E in November cited off-campus student housing as the key problem associated with the university’s plan.
“The overwhelming objectionable impact … is that it would keep in place a very large number of off-campus transient student group houses and all the problems they bring,” the report said.
The ANC, the D.C. Office of Planning and several neighborhood organizations have all called on the Zoning Commission to require Georgetown to house 100 percent of students on campus.
In January, the university officially announced that it would convert the Leavey Hotel into a dorm by 2014, adding an extra 250 on-campus beds.
But 1,199 students were living off campus as of 2010, according to a supplementary filing Georgetown submitted to the Zoning Commission in January. It is not clear where these students would be housed if the commission did choose to ban students from living off campus.
Despite the uncertainty about housing, many of Georgetown’s long-term goals will not be jeopardized by the delay, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr.
Several of the construction projects included in the plan are extensions or continuations of schemes that had already been approved as part of the 2000 Campus Plan. Such projects include the construction of the Intercollegiate Athletic Center and the renovation of Reiss Science building. Plans for the athletic facility are still under review by the Old Georgetown Board, but construction of the center does not depend on the Zoning Commission’s ruling.
Projects that were newly introduced in the 2010 plan, including improvements to the hospital and a potential bridge between Reiss and the soon-to-be-completed Regents Hall, will still be contingent on approval from the Zoning Commission.
The delay also postpones the point at which the university will have to honor its agreements to cap student enrollment through 2020.
As part of its initial filing, Georgetown agreed to cap undergraduate admissions rates at current levels and cap the increase in graduate enrollment at 967 students if the Campus Plan is accepted.
“Our voluntary commitment to these maximum enrollment levels is contingent on the approval of the Campus Plan package as we’ve proposed [it],” Kerr said.
She added that despite the continuing delays to the Campus Plan, the university will continue the good faith measures it began during the process, such as a twice-daily trash collection program instituted last fall.
Laverriere said he supports the university’s proactive approach.
“The university is committed to showing the District of Columbia that Georgetown can coexist with the surrounding community,” he said. “If that means implementing some programs ahead of the campus plan approval, so be it.”

For some students, running is not just a way to burn stress or calories, but also a means to foster lasting relationships with those that they may often run past — the homeless.
Since last spring, the Georgetown Running Club has been partnering with Back on My Feet, a national running program focused on helping the homeless find a path back to healthy living.
The D.C. chapter of Back on My Feet, which uses running as a means to build confidence, strength and self-esteem, organizes teams of volunteers and homeless men that run three mornings a week.
The Running Club participates in the exercise once a month, gathering at 5:30 a.m. to meet the regular runners at Clean & Sober Streets, a residential drug and alcohol treatment and rehabilitation center. The group huddles in prayer, warms up, stretches out and engages in group reflection before the morning run.
During the run almost everyone is silent, which quickly changes once the group crosses the finish line, according to GRC Vice President Tim Dougherty (COL ’13).
“It’s all smiles and high-fives,” he said. “Everyone’s on the same playing field, and you’re just going for a run.”
Three students, Pat Fogerty (SFS ’14) and sisters Katie (COL ’14) and Maggie Ferrato (COL ’14), run with the program nearly every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
“[T]he runners at BoMF have been unbelievably motivating and have inspired me to sign up for my first marathon, the National Marathon in March,” Katie Ferrato said. “I will be running in support of Back on My Feet D.C.”
All three are training for the National Marathon in D.C. and are motivated for the early morning runs by the friendships that they have formed with the program participants.
“You would think that waking up at 4:45 [a.m.] would get easier as time went on, but every morning I still wake up and feel miserable and exhausted,” Fogerty said. “However, knowing that there are people standing out in the cold expecting us to be there is usually enough to get us out of bed.”
Building a sense of community for people experiencing homelessness is one of the main missions of Back on My Feet.
“Our team has become really close; we always have each others’ backs,” Margaret Ferrato said.

Undergraduate tuition will rise 3.5 percent to $42,360 this coming year, according to the university’s latest financial plan.
The increase from the current rate of $40,920 per year is the largest percentage change in tuition since 2009, when tuition increased 5.5 percent. The Financial Plan 2013-2016 projects a 3.5 percent tuition increase each year through 2016.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, the increased costs are largely due to the new expenses associated with the operation of Regents Hall, which is set to open this summer.
Including tuition, room, board and fees, an undergraduate education will cost $55,640 in fiscal year 2013, a 3.2 percent increase from this year’s $53,910.
All room rates will increase about 2 percent, although the cost of living in a townhouse is set to increase by over 11 percent in fiscal year 2013 due to a new policy that will charge townhouse residents for utilities as part of their room rates instead of as a separate charge.
Graduate tuition will increase by 3.5 percent in fiscal year 2013, while tuition for the Masters in Business Administration program will increase by 4 percent. School of Continuing Studies rate increases range from 3 to 4.5 percent.
Georgetown was the most expensive university among its peer institutions in 2009 but has retreated to the middle of the pack since then. The university’s total costs of living have grown an average of 2.7 percent between fiscal years 2009 and 2012 while its peer institutions have raised costs by a collective average of 4.3 percent.
Still, some students believe that the university’s tuition increases are unfair. Joseph Vithayathil (COL ’12) recommends that Georgetown adopt The George Washington University’s fixed tuition policy, which prevents tuition hikes from affecting already enrolled students. GWU students pay tuition at the rate that was charged when they enrolled throughout their time at the university.
“They should go with GWU and lock in the same rate for the next four years. You don’t have to worry about a 5 percent increase next year,” he said.
Georgetown will also increase available need-based financial aid by $1.9 million in fiscal year 2013, $4.7 million in 2014, $6.5 million in 2015 and $5.6 million in 2016.
More than 40 percent of undergraduates, about 2,800 students, receive financial aid each year, according to the university.
“While tuition everywhere is rising, Georgetown is still making an unprecedented commitment to meet full demonstrated financial need,” Kerr said.

University President John J. DeGioia joined about 1,800 D.C. residents to propose new ways to improve the city at Mayor Vincent Gray’s first One City Summit on Saturday.
The event was designed to seek input directly from citizens rather than government officials or policymakers.
“[This is] grassroots democracy, D.C. style,” Gray said in his opening remarks. “This project will be a roadmap of D.C. to truly reflect one city.”
The summit was orchestrated by AmericaSpeaks, a nonprofit whose mission is to organize large-scale town halls that engage citizens in making public policy decisions.
Drawing on the idea that local residents know their neighborhoods’ problems best, the summit divided participants into groups of seven or eight people and asked them to come up with a list of concerns they wanted the D.C. government to address. The groups then voted on their preferred priorities and policies.
Participants ranked improving education and creating jobs as top concerns.
Carolyn Lukensmeyer, AmericaSpeaks’ president and a facilitator of the summit, said D.C. universities have an important role to play in improving the District’s economy through providing educational opportunities and creating jobs. She lauded DeGioia for the commitment he showed to this goal by attending the summit.
The university has participated in previous initiatives designed to help the D.C. economy, such as Gray’s “One City, One Hire” program, through which local institutions make a commitment to hire D.C. residents who have been in long-term unemployment. Georgetown, the largest private employer in the District, has hired at least one new employee through this program since signing on in the fall.
“The One City Summit gave us the opportunity to continue our dialogue with Mayor Gray and leaders throughout the city about Georgetown’s commitment to strengthening our role as a contributor and partner within the District of Columbia,” DeGioia wrote in a statement.

The Program on Justice and Peace and the university’s chapter of  PeaceJam kicked off a week of events focused on fostering peace education and awareness Monday.
Peace Education Week will feature speakers with experience in the field, such as directors of nonprofits, researchers who focus on conflict resolution and formerly incarcerated criminals.
“We’d like to use this kickoff week as an emphasis for students to start asking themselves whether we are doing things for the right reasons, whether we are really passionate about the things we are doing rather than simply going through the motions,” Joe Donovan (SFS ’13), president of Georgetown’s PeaceJam chapter, said. PeaceJam is an international program that connects Nobel Peace Prize Laureates with students.
The event planners aim to address these questions through student-led events, such as “Peace Jamming,” where various performance groups on campus present relevant issues through art, and “Peace Talks,” a conversation about how peace education can be furthered on campus.
The idea for a week of events focused on peace education originally grew out of discussions about the importance of education efficiency, according to Donovan.
“What tends to be left out of the discussion is not only how to make schools more effective, but what schools should be doing. Peace education is a way to do that. It is a way of framing the discussion,” he said.
Donovan believes that a week of this nature is perfect for focusing group energy on these ideas, especially on a campus with such an active student body.
“What makes something like Peace Education Week so important for a school like Georgetown is that there is so much energy here for positive change,” he said. “Through letting everyone know about the value of peace education, we are hopefully directing that energy in the right direction.”

As the national debate on policies governing insurance coverage of contraceptives continues, H*yas for Choice took to Red Square Monday to express support for more accessible birth control.
H*yas for Choice and Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington piled $600 worth of ramen noodles in the square to represent the amount that the average American woman currently spends on contraceptives every year.
“We wanted to do something that, you know, hits home to college students,” Planned Parenthood Public Affairs Associate Gabrielle Martinez said.
The demonstration came after President Obama altered his administration’s position on mandated contraceptive coverage Friday in a compromise that has been met with mixed reviews on campus.
According to the announcement, religiously affiliated univerisities and institutions will no longer be required to pay for contraceptive coverage, though any independent insurance provider these groups contract with will still be required to provide coverage.
The decision followed a firestorm of political and media backlash to an earlier announcement from Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, which stated that almost all providers of insurance — religiously affiliated or otherwise — would be required to provide coverage for birth control in their plans.
The revised policy means that Georgetown is unlikely to see any major change to its health care policies because the university already provides employees with two healthcare options. The first plan, which is underwritten by the university, does not provide contraceptive coverage, while the second option allows employees to subscribe to a national plan administered by Blue Cross Blue Shield.
Contraceptives will not be covered for the minority of students who subscribe to the university’s health insurance under the new mandate.
For students who subscribe to private insurance plans, carriers will be required to cover contraceptives if they did not already do so.
Besides piling a pyramid of ramen noodle boxes in Red Square, members of H*yas for Choice collected petition signatures and Valentine’s-themed messages to support the mandate Monday. Last week, group members tabled in Red Square to ask students to sign thank you cards to the president.
According to H*yas for Choice President Ashley Bradylyons (SFS ’12), they collected about 300 cards, although Planned Parenthood workers were asked to leave campus by the Department of Public Safety last week because they were not students.
Despite the incident, Martinez felt that backlash against their recent events on campus had been minimal.
“You can’t really get mad at that, we’re talking about women’s health,” she said.
“When we were here before, I was dressed as a human pill pack … a priest walked by and laughed at me and was like ‘nice costume,'” she added. “And that’s all that we can ask for, that people be open.”
Critics, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, criticized Obama’s annoucement as political manuevering. They argue that in forcing private insurance companies to cover contraceptives, the federal government is still placing the burden on religious institutions who pay or contribute to their employee’s private insurance.
“Forcing plans to cover abortifacients violates existing federal conscience laws. Therefore, we [call] for the rescission of the mandate altogether,” the group said in a statement. “Coverage is still provided as a part of the objecting employer’s plan, financed in the same way as the rest of the coverage offered by the objecting employer. This raises serious moral concerns.”
University administrators will not comment on the policy until the official regulations are released because details of the plan are still unclear.

Georgetown student Eva Hogan (COL ’14) has found her sea legs in the Sea Scout program as its national boatswain, a position akin to the organization’s president.
Hogan will represent the program at the Boy Scouts of America’s annual Report to the Nation this week.
The Sea Scouts, an offshoot of Boy Scouts of America, attracts both males and females interested in sailing and nautical activities.
This week, Hogan will serve as one of eight Boy Scout representatives to address House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
According to Hogan, the representatives will outline the accomplishments and advances of the Boy Scouts programs throughout the past year as well as their future initiatives.
“It’s kind of like the State of the Union address for the Boy Scouts,” Hogan said.
In addition to presenting the report, Hogan and her fellow representatives will meet President Barack Obama and visit the Pentagon, the CIA and the Supreme Court.
Hogan holds the highest Sea Scout rank, quartermaster, an echelon equivalent to BSA’s Eagle Scout. She became the National Sea Scout Boatswain last April.
“Within that job, I represent Sea Scouts at all national events,” Hogan said.
Hogan admitted to being nervous yet excited for the upcoming events.
“If I weren’t, I’d be really worried,” she said, although she also noted her excitement about the week’s opportunities.
“This is just one of those things that I am going to tell my grandkids about, and it’s one of those things where I can tell people that they should really get involved with the program, because it’s fantastic and then some day they might be able to do this.”
Besides participating in the Boy Scouts’ Report to the Nation, Hogan updates the Sea Scouting blog with information about the program’s centennial activities and celebrations.
Hogan first became involved in Sea Scouts during her freshman year of high school. She credits her experiences in the program for the time management, communication, leadership and teaching skills she has acquired.
Throughout her tenure as a Sea Scout, Hogan has especially enjoyed the exposure to interesting people and novel opportunities, citing as her favorite experience the week she lived and trained on the Coast Guard Academy’s Tall Ship.
“It’s kind of like living on a pirate ship for a week, so that was a lot of fun,” she said.
Even though Sea Scouting has an age cap at 21, Hogan hopes to continue her involvement as long as she can.
“I’m not sure how, but I plan on staying involved,” she said.

Most school projects begin and end in the classroom, but for a group of 18 Georgetown students, their work is designed to connect with people half a continent away.
This weekend, professors Jiva Manske and Wendy Jason, who teach “Social Justice/Conflict Studies,” launched a semester-long writing exchange program between students and members of the JustWrite program at New Mexico’s Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention Center. Each week, students in D.C. and Albuquerque will be given the same writing prompt, and the class members will be able to share their written responses through an online forum or by having their work read aloud in class.
Manske said that the program will have an important impact on a class whose main focus is understanding and analyzing social conflict.
“One of the key elements of conflict transformation is being able to humanize people, and this is a great way to humanize a group of individuals who are often demonized by society or, at best, ignored,” he said.
Manske and Jason worked for a year as facilitators of creative writing programs at the detention center prior to coming to Georgetown.
They hope the collaboration will allow participants to explore the similarities and differences in people’s backgrounds, and they expect students to be surprised by the commonality of human experience.
Carlos Contreras, the facilitator of the JustWrite program at the detention center, stressed the program’s positive impact on both students and inmates.
“JustWrite is an honest, real and unique dialogue attempting to create itself for the betterment of numerous lives, given that poetry shows us all as simply human,” he wrote in an email. “The JustWrite program will consist of honest-hearted human beings, being themselves on the page and sharing it with anyone that will read or listen.”
Annie Dale (COL ’14), a participant who has worked with a prison outreach program in the past, is excited to see the responses from both classes.
“Prisoners are people with a social stigma, and you don’t know who they are — you don’t know their story. The program really humanizes them and lets you see them as individuals,” she said.
Contreras expects both students and prisoners to draw important lessons from the experience.
“Inmates current and past that I’ve worked with on poetry have always had a positive experience,” he said. “Growth comes from the honesty allowed via this art form.”
