In the wake of the Newtown tragedy, initiatives promoting kindness and service have earned a prominent position nationwide. And with Georgetown Individuals Vocal and Energetic for Service — or GIVES — establishing its presence on campus, Georgetown is no exception.
The club was founded by Phil Dearing (COL ’15) and Brigit Goebelbecker (SFS ’15), who both hope to create a kinder, happier attitude on campus.
“Our mission is to … involve students in creating an environment of gratitude, happiness and service,”Dearing said. “You have the energy and the ability: you want to harness and do something good with it.”
According to Dearing, GIVES encourages students to collectively plan acts of kindness that will make others smile. But rather than focusing on the D.C. community like most Georgetown service clubs, GIVES aims to first serve the Georgetown community.
“[Georgetown] is a Jesuit university, and everyone wants to do service.” Goebelbecker said. “We want to up the atmosphere of Georgetown as a whole.”
At their first meeting Saturday, the club planned to participate in Free Hug Day, draw cheerful chalk artwork in Red Square, leave encouraging notes in Lauinger Library, give out candy next Halloween as “reverse trick-or-treating” and celebrate Star Wars Day on May 4.
“It’s just doing a little bit and having a lot of fun,” Dearing said. “Everyone … is caught up with their studies, caught up with trying to get a job. So many things distract you. It is really easy to let being appreciative and giving back fall by the wayside.”
GIVES is also encouraging its members to participate in 26 Acts, a nationwide movement inspired by the Newtown shootings. The movement urges participants to perform 26 acts of kindness between Feb. 4 and Feb. 17 in remembrance of the Newtown victims.
Dearing stressed that GIVES, which meets weekly, is not a large time commitment and will not turn away any interested students.
“We just want to make it super easy for people to get involved,” Dearing said.
GIVES member Aisha Babalakin (SFS ’15) agreed.
“I think it’s really important it’s not so much of a time commitment,” Babalakin said.
Currently, the club is focusing on small acts on campus, though Dearing expressed interest in expanding and working in the D.C. community.
“Long range, it’s possible we’ll be doing big days of service more out in the community,” Dearing said.

Travelling to President Barack Obama’s second inauguration on Monday, most commuters arrived at Capitol Hill without a hitch. The journey home, however, was a different story. Long lines, inactive escalators and stalled trains clogged the Metro after the ceremony. “On the way there, it would’ve been smarter to take the Metro,” said Stefan Gavrilovski (COL ’15), who opted for the bus instead.  “From what I heard it was crowded but it was quick. That would have been helpful on the way there.” According to Gavrilovski, bus travel brought its own surprises. Barricades set up for the parade following the inauguration ceremony blocked off much of downtown D.C. “I didn’t realize where [the bus] would be stopping so when we got to Foggy Bottom it was just, ‘oh that’s it?’” Gavrilovski was glad to take the bus back to campus, however, especially after hearing of Metro passengers’ frustration. “On the way back I heard [the Metro] was horrible,” he said. Although the 779,787 people who rode the Metro on Monday matched  average weekday traffic, the concentration of riders in stations around the National Mall — particularly L’Enfant Plaza and Federal Center SW— that swarmed the stations immediately after the inauguration ceremony placed a greater strain on the system than a typical business day. In addition, a stalled train in Virginia further clogged transit. “Any time there is a disabled train that causes delays across whatever line that train is on. So that certainly did cause delays on the orange and blue line,” Caroline Lukas, media relations manager for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, said. The unanticipated delays created headaches for tourists who had come to the District for the inauguration, some missing outgoing flights or busses, according to the Associated Press. The clogged system also posed problems for Georgetown students. Karen Luo (COL ’15) was unfazed by the large crowds and delays. “I’m from New York. I’m used to insane numbers of people and trains breaking down,” Luo said. “I don’t blame DC Metro because there’s only so much they can do. When you gather large groups of people, honestly it’s really difficult. I understand [that] metros break down.” In addition to the stalled train, inactive metro escalators added to the frustration among commuters. But according to WMATA, however, the escalators were not broken. “That’s a big misconception,” Lukas said. “[Inactive] escalators were part of our crowd management plan right from the beginning. They weren’t broken. That was an intentional thing and a tool we use to make sure that our stations don’t become overwhelmed with people.”
