Georgetown University students and professors joined bipartisan calls for the full release of the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference after Attorney General William Barr submitted a four-page report to Congress on March 24.
In a letter submitted to Congress, Barr summarized the report’s general conclusions, writing that the findings of Mueller’s investigation do not prove that President Donald Trump or members of his presidential campaign conspired with the Russian government in 2016. However, Mueller did not offer a conclusive stance on whether Trump obstructed justice.
Since the election, 34 people and three companies have been indicted by the committee on allegations encompassing election interference charges, false statements charges and various other crimes. That group includes five of six former advisers to Trump.
Members of Georgetown University College Democrats are unsatisfied with the summary and are hoping Barr will release the special counsel’s full report, said Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21), chair of GUCD.
“We’re surprised, we’re a little shocked; people were arrested during this process,” Hollister said. “So, we’re confused and we want more information is the bottom line.”
Members of GUCD are calling for the release of the full report in order to get a fuller understanding of what the investigation found, according to Hollister.
“We stand in support of House Democrats and Republicans who want the full report to be released because the truth is, if it does completely exonerate Trump, then there should be no issues releasing at least a large majority of the report,” Hollister said. “An attorney’s letter is not the equivalent of a report.”
Mueller was appointed special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May 2017 to investigate Russian interference in U.S. elections, as well as possible obstruction of justice by Trump in his interactions with then-director of the FBI, James Comey.
Barr and Rosenstein ultimately decided that the evidence was insufficient to prosecute on charges of obstruction, according to Barr’s summary.
Georgetown adjunct assistant professor and former Democratic National Committee Chief Donna Brazile said on Twitter that it was critical for the full report to be released, in order to prevent similar attacks in the upcoming November 2020 election. Many of the Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 have also said the report should go public in its entirety, according to Fox News.
Republican senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Democrats and called on Barr to release the full details of the investigation, according to the Des Moines Register.
Not all members of the Georgetown community reacted with skepticism to Mueller’s judgment that Trump did not collude with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.
Georgetown University College Republicans welcomed Barr’s letter and elected to dedicate a portion of their March 26 scheduled general body meeting to host a “No Collusion Celebration Party,” GUCR President Hayley Grande (COL ’21) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Along with students, Georgetown professors have also said Barr’s letter is not sufficient to judge Trump’s conduct accurately and clear his name in the eyes of the public.
In an opinion piece published in The New York Times, Georgetown Law professor Neal Katyal discussed several questions that arose after Barr submitted his letter to Congress.
Katyal argued that Mueller refraining from completely exonerating Trump of obstruction of justice forces the attorney general to either reveal his justification for not pursuing any charges or release the report publicly in its entirety.
“No one wants a president to be guilty of obstruction of justice,” Katyal wrote. “The only thing worse than that is a guilty president who goes without punishment. The Barr letter raises the specter that we are living in such times.”
Though the Mueller investigation did not find that the president clearly committed a crime by obstructing justice, Mueller did not go as far to exonerate the president, leaving the decision to Barr. Barr’s summary did not cite any specific incidents that could be considered obstruction of justice, but said many of them were the subject of public reporting, such as pressuring Comey to stop investigating former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, firing Comey and two attempts at firing Mueller.
The wording of the memo suggests the full report might present a challenge to Democrats intending to use the document as reason for impeachment, Victoria Nourse, also a Georgetown Law professor, said in an interview with Vox, a left-leaning news outlet.
“Obstruction would be difficult legally and factually to prove,” Nourse wrote. “This report is likely to make efforts by those who seek to impeach the president more difficult.”
The reports of the investigation’s initial findings should not come as a surprise to Georgetown students, Grande said.
“It’s nice to see that a story that was created by the leftist media has now been completely disproved in a sense with the no means of impeachment and no means of collusion made by Attorney General Barr,” Grande said. “We should be happy that our president wasn’t found colluding with the Russians, something that’s a net positive and I think people forget that, so that’s the best outcome in this situation.”

Mono Diner, located on Wisconsin Avenue NW in Georgetown, unofficially opened March 4 following multiple cases of property mishandling, lawsuits and corporate conflicts over the past few decades involving its owner Mohammad Esfahani. 
The diner, which aims to recreate the atmosphere of the golden age of Hollywood, remains open from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Mono also operates between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. for the remainder of the week and between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Sundays. A date has not yet been set for the restaurant’s official opening, even though the diner began serving patrons March 4, according to Harmon. 
The diner’s hours are designed to accommodate late-night drinkers and Georgetown University students, according to Mono Diner supervisor Neil Harmon.
“We’re trying to take advantage of Georgetown’s great nightlife,” Harmon said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Since opening, the restaurant has also been popular at early morning hours during the week, according to Harmon. Mono Diner distinguishes itself from other Georgetown dining establishments because of its attention to clients and all-day breakfast menu, Harmon said. 
Eric Spruill-Jenkins, the former general manager and leading chef of Mono Diner, recently left his positions with reasons for his departure unknown, according to Harmon. 
Spruill-Jenkins, formerly a corporate trainer at a since-closed pizza restaurant in Maryland, met Esfahani through a work contact. Despite severing ties with Mono Diner, Spruill-Jenkins still plans to work with Esfahani to create branches of the fast-food branch All About Burger in Chinatown, the Ballston Quarter and Virginia, according to D.C. Eater. 
Esfahani previously owned stores on M Street NW, including Mon Cheri Cafe, where Sprinkles now stands, and Tahoga, where Le Pain Quotidien is now located, according to a local news network. 
Esfahani leased another property located on Wisconsin Avenue in 2002 as part of his earliest venture into opening a diner in Georgetown. However, the mid-19th century building collapsed shortly after he assumed ownership of the building after he placed a tar machine on the roof. Esfahani was fined $1,000 for the damages, and the diner he had planned to establish at the location was never built, local media reported. 
Esfahani publicly denied any responsibility in the building’s collapse, even refuting that he had ownership of building at the time, though city permits indicated these claims were false, according to the Patch.
In 2011, Esfahani leased another address on Wisconsin Avenue NW where he planned to open a franchise of a local burger chain, Z-Burger, according to The Washington Post. The entire back of this building collapsed in November 2011. 
Although Esfahani claimed that this damage was caused by a water leak in the property next door, a Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs inspector determined that the collapse was most likely caused by removing too much dirt from underneath the footings of the building’s north and south walls, according to local media.
Following the collapse, Esfahani hired workers to pour a new concrete slab. A Washington, D.C. DCRA inspector, who visited while the work was being performed, found that the contractors were operating without a permit. Esfahani denied that his contractors were performing work illegally and claimed that he had a permit to perform the work, according to local media. 
The Esfahani brothers ultimately split with Z-Burger co-founder Peter Tabibian after Tabibian claimed they shut him out of the day-to-day operations of their Z-Burger branch. The dispute ended in a lawsuit, which determined that the Esfahani brothers had to rebrand their restaurants, according to The Washington Post. 
While Esfahani attempted to reconstruct 1424 Wisconsin Avenue without a permit in 2011 and again in 2013, no outstanding claims or issues exist that would prevent Mono Diner from operating legally, according to Tim Wilson, spokesperson for the DCRA. 
“There’s nothing that should keep them from running a 30-seat restaurant that can fit 37 people,” Wilson said. “They’re all good, unless something changes.”

The full Georgetown University Student Association senate voted unanimously to approve the 2019-20 fiscal year student activities budget March 24, after passing an amendment to change the budget previously approved by the finance and appropriations committee. 
The amendment, proposed by FinApp Chair Hayley Grande (COL ’21), reallocated funds from the Student Activities Commission, the Media Board, Georgetown Program Board and Outdoor Education to GUSA.
The FinApp committee, which is made up of 12 GUSA senators, first released its draft budget Feb. 26, allocating $1,092,000 to six advisory boards, GPB, the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, the GUSA executive and other applicants. Though the overall budget increased 2.4 percent from last year, student group funding requests totaled $1,321,040.80, resulting in cuts to individual budgets.
Budget deliberations began Feb. 26 at the FinApp summit, where applicants for funding gave presentations explaining their budget requests. Public appeals sessions in which the student groups appealed against the draft budget were held March 13 and 17. The FinApp committee approved the budget at the end of the appeals session March 17.
Of the 13 student groups and boards FinApp funded for the 2019-20 academic year, six appealed their allotments. The six groups that appealed were the Center for Social Justice Advisory Board for Student Organizations, the Student Activities Commission, GPB, the Advisory Board for Club Sports, the Performing Arts Advisory Council and Outdoor Education.
The Lecture Fund received $85,000 of its $98,000 request, matching its allocated funding from last year.
The Advisory Board for Club Sports received an allocation of $225,000, a decrease of 27.36 percent from its initial request. This allocation is $10,000 less than the board’s budget from last year.
The FinApp committee allocated $304,300 to the Student Activities Commission, a 6.4 percent cut from its request but $32,000 more than its budget last year. As the advisory board for the majority of clubs on campus, SAC distributes funds to over 110 student organizations.
The committee also approved $140,942.61 for GPB in its budget, 5.09 percent less than the club’s requested budget of $148,500 and $5,000 more than its allocation last year.
GUSA allocated Georgetown Opportunities for Leadership Development $4,500, 56 percent of the group’s initial request. This marks an increase of $500 from fiscal year 2017-18, the last time GOLD applied for funding. GOLD was funded as a Part B applicant, an option open to any student groups not supported by an advisory board who can apply for funding but are not guaranteed consideration by FinApp. 
The other two Part B applicants who received funding were Outdoor Education, who received 53 percent of their requested funding, and the Transfer Council, who received 94 percent. 
The budget requested by GUSA executives Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) for GUSA as a whole faced the largest cuts, with the pair receiving only 11 percent of their requested funds. The executives initially requested a budget of $26,760, which was cut to $1,735 in the budget approved by the FinApp committee March 17. Last year, FinApp granted GUSA $13,955.
At the senate meeting Sunday, GUSA senator Grande proposed an amendment allocating an additional $1,222.39 toward GUSA expenses. Grande proposed the bill in her capacity as a senator, and not as FinApp Chair. The amendment moved $200 from the Student Activities Commission, $200 from the Media Board, $322.39 from GPB and $500 from Outdoor Education to provide GUSA with a final budget of $2,957.39.
While most of the cuts to GUSA’s original request were manageable, more money was needed to cover necessary expenses, according to Grande. These expenses include a fee for the group’s partnership with the group TurboVote, charges for the GUSA and SaxaFund SquareSpace website, and money toward funding for an ongoing GUSA initiative, which began during the term of former executives Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Jessica Andino (COL ’18), to replace broken ropes on the existing hammocks on campus. 
Grande said the additional allocation to GUSA this year comes from unexpected fees left behind by previous GUSA executives.
“In short, it seems that previous administrations have gotten tied into certain contracts, complications that were not put into the record, were not very explicit, and were not known by the committee until this morning,” Grande said. “I have a lot of problems with this, but it’s kind of the current state of things.”
The amendment changed a decision made during appeals last week to increase funding of Outdoor Education to properly train guides and subsidize trips for students. No representatives from Outdoor Education were present at the Sunday meeting.
Senator Dylan Hughes (COL ’19), a member of FinApp and liaison to the transfer council, proposed an amendment to Grande’s amendment, requesting that the $500 taken from the Outdoor Education budget instead be taken from the performing arts council. Hughes’ amendment failed on voice vote.
The senate then gave unanimous approval of Grande’s amendment and voted unanimously to approve the budget as a whole. The budget awaits final approval from Francis, who plans to sign the budget, according to Winston Ardoin (SFS ’21), chief communications director for the GUSA executive.
The GUSA executives hope to expand the FinApp funding procedure to include greater student input in the future, according to Ardoin.
“Norman and Aleida believe that the process could be improved to promote student voices,” Ardoin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Though Norman and Aleida still do not know exactly how they wish to implement this change, they do wish that students who worked more directly within the funding boards or within the clubs themselves had more of an input.”
This article was updated March 28 to reflect that Hughes’ amendment failed on voice vote and that GOLD has been funded in the past.

Washington, D.C. Councilmember Brandon Todd (D-Ward 4) was fined $4,000 by the Office of Campaign Finance March 18 after he improperly used government resources in an attempt to influence the D.C. State Board of Education election last year. 
A number of Ward 4 constituents received a Nov. 30 campaign email from Rhonda Henderson, Todd’s favored candidate in the SBOE race. Recipients had been placed on the email list because they had contacted Councilmember Todd at some point, according to the emails.
D.C. law strictly prohibits the use of government resources to endorse or oppose a candidate running for office. The law specifically states that these resources include “nonpersonal services, including supplies, materials, equipment, office space, facilities, and telephones and other utilities.”
The OCF, which administers campaign finance law in D.C., referenced this law in their order released March 19, which fined Todd $4,000 for violating the D.C. law by misusing government resources to create the email list. Todd’s fine may be decreased to $2,000 if he attends ethics training at the D.C. Council’s Board of Ethics and Government Accountability within the next 60 days, according to the order.
Recipients of the emails were concerned by the idea that their emails had been shared without their knowledge. Ward 4 resident Andrew Hunt was bothered by the email he received because he supported another candidate in the race and therefore had not agreed to receive mail from Henderson, he said in an interview with WAMU. 
Todd is currently reviewing the order from the OCF, according to Joshua Fleitman, Todd’s director of communications. 
“He looks forward to moving past this and remains focused on doing the important work of advocating for and serving the residents of Ward 4,” Fleitman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
However, this is not the first campaign scandal that Todd has faced. In 2015, after he won the special election to fill D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) vacated seat, Todd’s campaign finance came into question. After a city audit of his campaign, Todd’s campaign was unable to provide documentation for over $150,000 worth of contributions and donations. Todd was issued a minor fine after this incident, according to the Washington Post.
Because Todd is well-funded, fines and reprimands do not do much to discourage him, according to Todd Brogan, an elected member of the D.C.’s affiliate of the Democratic Party. 
“Councilmember Todd is well known as a legislator who doesn’t particularly like legislating and as a lawmaker who doesn’t particularly like following campaign finance laws,” Brogan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He is well-funded by the District’s deepest pockets, and the occasional fine has never been much of a deterrent for him.”
Todd’s fine was issued the day before Evans was reprimanded by the D.C. council for using his government email to solicit corporate deals. Todd voted in favor in of reprimanding Evans.
A competitive 2020 primary would give voters a chance to make a statement about appropriate conduct from D.C. councilmembers, Brogan said. 
“Hopefully we’ll have a competitive primary in 2020 so the voters of Ward 4 can decide whether they want to keep a councilmember who cheats to win, or whether they want someone who holds themselves to a higher standard,” Brogan wrote.

A Maryland House of Representatives Joint Resolution urging Congress to grant Washington, D.C. official statehood is under consideration for the Maryland General Assembly, contributing to both regional and national pushes for D.C. to become the 51st state. 
The bill was first heard Feb. 25 but did not receive enough votes to move forward, meaning it will be held under review by the House Rules and Executive Nominations Committee until it receives another hearing.
A Maryland House Joint Resolution undergoes the same procedure as a bill; however, resolutions are generally introduced to supplement continuing or emergency appropriations. House Joint Resolution 7, introduced to the House of Delegates by Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-District 39) continues the ongoing resurgence in support for D.C statehood. 
The Maryland House Joint Resolution, co-sponsored by 36 delegates, follows the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, or H.R. 51, which was introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) on Jan. 3 and aims to establish D.C. as the 51st state. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, the primary investigative committee in the House, promised to hold a hearing and markup on the bill. This is the first time a D.C. statehood bill has received a hearing in 26 years, according to D.C. Statehood Yes We Can!, a group which advocates for D.C. legislative and budget autonomy. 
Despite its positive reception among Democrats, D.C. statehood should be received with bipartisan support, according to Josh Burch, founder of Neighbors United for D.C. Statehood, a grassroots advocacy group. 
“We’re the only democracy in the developed world where we deny the residents of the capital equal political rights. So, to me it’s not a partisan issue,” Burch said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think that the real question is: Why isn’t the other party supporting it? I think that’s the real tragedy.” 
The For the People Act, or H.R. 1, was introduced to the House on the same day as H.R. 51 and includes language endorsing statehood. The For the People Act, sponsored by Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), has since been passed by the House and awaits a vote in the Senate. 
The District’s population of over 700,000 residents is comparable to the populations of other registered states and even supersedes the populations of Wyoming and Vermont, according to a 2017 Census Bureau report referenced in the House joint resolution. 
However, D.C. currently operates as a district under federal jurisdiction. D.C. voters are allowed to participate in mayoral and city council elections and elect a delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. This delegate can only participate in procedural votes and may not vote on the house floor.
Although H.R. 1 was passed in the House by 236 votes, it is unlikely to pass the Senate, as the majority Republican Senate has historically opposed D.C. statehood. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell previously referred to H.R. 1 as a terrible bill, and said he would not give it any floor time in the Senate. 
D.C. residents have not received the same benefits as other U.S. citizens, and achieving statehood will allow residents to have more of a voice in government, according to Burch. 
“It is a power grab by the people of the District of Columbia who have been denied power in our union for over 200 years,” Burch said. “It’s about ensuring the people of the nation’s capital have shared rights and responsibilities.”
While the District’s statehood presents valid concerns for both Democrats and Republicans, other aspects, such as D.C.’s small size, have the potential to affect its viability as a state, according to TJ Mukundan (COL ’21), director of roundtables for the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition. GBC seeks to promote discussion between Democrats, Republicans and independents.
“D.C. would be an incredibly small state, and I would be more interested in examining alternative means of giving D.C. residents representation that stop short of full statehood,” Mukundan wrote in a statement to The Hoya.

Washington, DC used to belong to Maryland, why not just return DC to Maryland…All that would have to be changed  are the license plates and drivers permits….The residents of DC would than win the right to vote for Senators and congressman…
