Auxiliary Services is replacing restaurants in Hoya Court with healthier options, Chief Business Officer for University Services Deborah Morey announced in a campus-wide email Friday.
Elevation Burger, which serves organic, grass-fed burgers, and Salad Creations will replace Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC. Hoya Court will also include a “new and better Subway.”
To implement these changes, Hoya Court will be closed for renovations beginning June 22.
