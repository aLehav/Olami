Around 50 students and faculty demonstrated in solidarity with victims of police brutality in light of the recent police shootings of two black men in Tulsa, Okla., and Charlotte, N.C., in a student-organized rally Friday in Red Square.
Since mid-September, racial injustice in America was once again brought to the forefront of national consciousness when Terrence Crutcher was shot by Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby on Sept. 16 and Keith Lamont Scott was shot by police officers in Charlotte  on Sept. 20.
Both shootings were caught on video and have been widely circulated on media networks and social media platforms.
Shelby has been charged with manslaughter by the Tulsa County district attorney, while the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Justice are currently investigating the Charlotte shooting.
The event included a moment of silence, prayers, time to share and reflect and singing of “We Shall Overcome.” Students held signs with messages including “Black lives matter more than white feelings” and “Stop killing us.”
Several activists offered brief speeches over the course of the event, which lasted an hour and a half. The activists said phrases including “Blackness is beauty, blackness is power.”
Black students also discussed the experience of still being perceived as a threat by police, even though they are students at Georgetown.
Jonese Austin (SFS ’19), one of the organizers of the demonstration, said she and other students felt compelled to speak up on how these recent tensions around the country affect the university community.
“We are tired of seeing our people killed with little to no justice being served. Furthermore, it can be very traumatic to repeatedly see stories as such,” Austin wrote in an email to The Hoya after the event. “We oftentimes feel like we have to continue on with our lives while at the same time dealing with racial oppression while our counterparts remain unaffected.”
Austin said she hoped the event would serve as a safe space for students to share and come together.
“The goal of the vigil — we decided against a die-in — was to create a space for sharing that could foster healing and community,” Austin wrote.  “We wanted to bring attention to all that’s going on and how it has affected us as students on Georgetown’s campus.”
Symone Wilson (COL ’19) said it is important for students and faculty to join together against oppression of black people.
“I attended the event because I thought and still think that it is important for people on Georgetown’s campus to see the black community along with allies gathered with each other in a show of solidarity against institutionalized racism and oppression, and more importantly to participate in a safe space in which people could air their feelings about the murders of two more black men by the police,” Wilson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Jess Frankovich (COL ’20), who attended the demonstration, said it succeeded in providing an opportunity for the community to reflect.
“I think it really served as a healing space and there was a lot of sharing of people’s emotional responses to it,” Frankovich said. “So I think it was really powerful to come together and for people to know that they’re not alone in hurting and feeling unsafe or worried about their families and friends.”
Frankovich said the vigil helped reignite campus dialogue on racial tensions.
“I definitely don’t think this will be the last Black Lives Matter or anti-police brutality event on campus,” Frankovich said. “This is the first time this year that the community has come together around this issue so it definitely felt more like a starting point than closure.”
Austin said the event is just the beginning of other efforts in the future to achieve a common understanding on racial issues and foster healing within the Georgetown community.
“This is not the end, but only the beginning of an effort to create healing spaces for the sake of self-care and bring about effective and tangible change on campus and in this nation,” Austin said.

Concerned Hoya, Col 18 says 
September 27, 2016 at 11:24 am
I think it’s really important to note that this was not quite a protest against police brutality –– that’s a very narrow and irresponsible way to frame the space that we created Friday. This was a healing space for Black students and community members to share insights, reflections, calls to action, all related on validating and affirming Blackness and Black experiences, which we too often completely disregard and degrade.

A new Washington, D.C. mandate announced Sept. 15 will require D.C. Metropolitan Police Department officers to confirm that they have switched on their body-worn cameras with dispatchers when responding to calls, following the fatal Sept. 11 shooting of motorcyclist Terrence Sterling, which was not caught on the officer’s body camera.
Sterling, a 31-year-old from Fort Washington, Md., was shot by an unnamed police officer at the corner of Third Street and M Street NW. According to an MPD press release, Sterling was fleeing after hitting the police vehicle. The officer who shot Sterling was equipped with a body camera but did not turn it on until after the shots were fired — a violation of protocol.
Previous to this incident, protocol regarding body cameras, established Oct. 21, 2015, required officers to turn on their cameras when an interaction with the member of the public is initiated. The new policy, announced by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), will require all police dispatchers to remind officers to turn on their cameras when they are giving information to the dispatcher.
Two officers, including the one who discharged the weapon, have been placed on administrative leave after the incident. Bowser said in a Sept. 12 press conference the officers are being investigated for two further violations during the incident, including using their cruiser to barricade the path of the motorcycle and firing from inside the vehicle.
“Our preliminary review does not show any camera footage before the shooting,” Bowser said in the press conference. “The footage that we have reviewed at this point happens after the shooting incident.”
Bowser’s 2015 initiative to purchase and distribute 2,500 body cameras for $5 million has thus far equipped nearly 1,300 MPD officers — around half the police force — with cameras. The United States Justice Department awarded this program $1 million last September, which is combined with the amount already allocated in the mayor’s budget.
MPD Commander of Tech Services Ralph Ennis said the annual cost of the program has barely scratched $1 million, contrary to claims the program is a drain on the city’s resources.
“The body camera is a huge project underway,” Ennis said. “We currently have one of the largest programs nationwide with over 1,300 active cameras and the number is expected to reach 3,000 soon.”
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber said though he believes body camera programs are beneficial to police forces in D.C., he also expressed skepticism that they are worth the expense.
“The funding for body cameras is astronomical —not just the camera itself, but the storage of the video, the time spent processing it, redacting the video if it’s requested by an outside agency or the court,” Gruber said. “Costs add up very quickly for these cameras.”
Gruber said he believes that policing and the necessity of body cameras varies by neighborhood.
“Policing is very different depending on the place,” Gruber said. “Here at Georgetown, our encounters with the students and the public are rarely of a negative nature.”
Georgetown University Law Center professor Vida B. Johnson, who teaches criminal law clinics for third-year law students, agreed that different areas require different techniques to combat crime and boost police accountability.
“Policing is very different in rural areas than in cities for a number of reasons,” Johnson said. “The biggest issue being the concentration of people in urban areas and the number of police out there. There are certainly more opportunities for people to interact with police in urban settings.”
Johnson added that despite the recent shooting of Sterling, the District has seen fewer police shootings than the rest of the nation. According to The Washington Post’s database on police shootings, of the 990 police shootings in the United States in 2015, only four occurred in the District.
“Police brutality is nothing new, but we in D.C. have not seen the same level of police involvement in shootings that we have been seeing in other cities throughout the country,” Johnson said.
Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19), who participated in Georgetown’s Alternative Breaks Program Ethics of Criminal Justice in D.C. and New York, commended enforcing body cameras for drawing attention to problems endemic to the criminal justice system.
“The fact that we can see footage of these events, I would say has a net positive effect because it mobilizes people and makes people aware of the issue,” Mondolfi said. “When you see how outrageous this is, it gets people involved.”

With Aramark’s new meal exchange policy, students may not receive the actual monetary value of their meal swipes when using them at Hoya Court and Cosi.
Aramark’s dining policy reforms this year saw an increase in food options and added flexibility for meal swipes and have been received positively by students interviewed by The Hoya. However, wait times at dining establishments that offer the meal exchange program have reportedly increased, and questions remain over whether students are receiving the value paid per different exchange swipe.
This year, meal swipes, which were previously only usable at Leo O’Donovan Hall, Einstein Bros. Bagels and the Leavey Center Grab ‘n’ Go, have been expanded to include Elevation Burger, Subway, Salad Creations and Cosi. Students can select between three and five meal combinations from each restaurant, which usually consist of one entree, one side and a beverage.
Though demand is high for the new meal exchange options, students are restricted to using meal exchanges within certain time constraints. Elevation Burger, Subway, Salad Creations and Cosi do not accept exchange options until after 3 p.m. The Leavey Center Grab ‘n’ Go no longer serves dinner this year.
Still, the meal exchange program may not give students good value for their money. The standard 18 weekly meal plan costs $2,726 for a duration of 15 weeks. After subtracting the $220 Flex Dollars that come with the plan, dividing by the 15 weeks, then by the 18 meals per week, the cost per meal comes out to $9.28 — assuming all meal swipes are used every week.
Using the same methodology, the 14 weekly plan costs $11.17 per meal, the 10 weekly plan and 150 block plan — consisting of 150 meal swipes that can be used as a student wishes — cost $13.79 per meal, the 115 block plan costs $14.44 per meal, the 75 block plan costs $14.51 and the 60 block plan costs $15.27.
When compared to the price equivalents of the food received from a meal swipe, the cost per swipe do not always add up.
For instance, Subway’s meal exchange program includes any 6-inch sub, chips or whole fruit and regular fountain beverage. On its regular menu, this meal costs around $6.60. At Cosi, the first meal exchange option includes taste two — a combo that includes two menu items — and regular fountain beverage, which could be purchased for around $11.86.
Despite the potential cost difference of up to $8.67 per meal, many students — particularly freshmen and sophomores who live in residence halls and are required to purchase meal plans — still appreciate the value in having more options.
Karissa Prayogo (SFS ’20), who has a 14 weekly plan, said she believes she is still getting a good value for her meal swipes.
“Just because I personally don’t eat that much, so all the meals make me full. But I could see why other people would feel like they need more for a meal swipe,” Prayogo said.
The meal exchange program has caused increased traffic to Hoya Court and Cosi, which has resulted in some ingredient shortages as well as longer wait times. The mobile ordering app Tapingo — which has helped reduce waiting times — has shown 30-minute waits for Cosi in the evening on weeknights.
Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Business Services Joelle Wiese said dining staff has adapted well to increased business.
“Operationally, the team went from summer business to a full campus population business volume. We increased staffing to meet the higher business demands, which are now similar to the lunch business volume,” Wiese wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Sinmi Tinubu (MSB ’18), who has a 75 block meal plan, said Tapingo has improved her meal exchange experience.
“The first time I got Elevation Burger and the line was pretty long and then I waited quite a while for my order after that,” Tinubu said. “The second time, I went to Cosi and used Tapingo to order beforehand, which made the wait a lot shorter and much more efficient.”
Students have also had more flexibility with their dining programs with the ability to add extra Flex Dollars to their accounts. Flex Dollars, which are tax-free, can be used at select locations on campus, such as Epicurean and Company and all Students of Georgetown, Inc. locations.
Georgetown Dining has also developed Leo’s To-Go, which allows students to take meals out of Leo’s. Students who registered by Sept. 9 received two tags, which can be exchanged for two to-go boxes. Students can bring the boxes to Leo’s and fill them with as much food as they can.
In the long run, Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said Georgetown Dining could have much broader reforms than the ones implemented this year. Both Aramark’s and Sodexo’s proposals for taking over a 10-year dining contract in December are being reviewed.
“We’ve been able to make some great progress, so this is an exciting time. What’s most exciting is that we are in the process of shaping the next 10 years of dining,” Khan said.
Khan said it has been exciting to see the changes implemented and their popularity among students, and hopes to continue to work with Georgetown Dining to make improvements.
“I think [Georgetown Dining] underestimated the popularity and demand of the program, which is why we’re seeing these long wait times. This reflects just how much students care about meal exchange,” Khan said. “Addressing wait times and advocating for popular meal stations at Leo’s are the short-term dining areas we will focus on.”

The Georgetown chapter of the Alexander Hamilton Society hosted its first event, a debate between School of Foreign Service professor Daniel Byman and George Mason University professor Colin Dueck on the legacy of President Barack Obama’s foreign policy decisions, on Sept. 20 in the Intercultural Center Auditorium,
The chapter of the nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, which has been at Georgetown since 2010, held the event to relaunch its organization following a failure to get Student Activities Commission recognition last year. The debate focused on the Obama administration’s foreign policy, as well as the foreign policy proposals of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Professor Matthew Kroenig moderated the debate.
The first phase of the debate concerned the current administration’s foreign policy record. Dueck began by criticizing Obama’s policies.
“I think he had a strategy at the macro level,” Dueck said. “At the micro level, when you look at specific cases like Syria, there never really was a coherent strategy in the sense of means and ends being coherently matched.”
Byman disagreed with Dueck’s perspective, arguing that Obama has achieved some success while stumbling on other issues.
After the opening remarks, the discussion shifted as both professors offered their analyses on the critical foreign policy decisions of the Obama years, including the decision to re-establish relations with Cuba after a 50-year embargo and the Iran nuclear deal.
Byman defended the deal, arguing that the accord with Iran was the best approach the administration could have taken.
“I also think the Iran deal was a success. It is not a perfect deal, and I could describe my own criticisms about it,” Byman said. “It is certainly not everything I wanted or others wanted. But I think it is better than no deal and that’s a reasonable bar.”
Dueck said the deal was both unnecessary and detrimental to American interests in the region.
“I agree that this was as much as Iran was willing to concede. But I am not sure why we had to have any deal,” Dueck said. “What you are doing now is you are lifting sanctions and you are handing back a lot of wealth to that regime, which it can use in the way it wants to. In a way, it legitimizes the regime.”
Byman and Dueck agreed that the intervention in Libya was mismanaged and that the administration was not sufficiently prepared to deal with its aftermath. They also defended the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Both professors also denounced Trump’s candidacy and his foreign policy proposals.
Byman said Trump is a danger to the United States because of his favorable perceptions of dictatorships and his complete disregard for the truth in relation to his policy plans.
“Part of it is, he is someone who doesn’t seem to care about the truth in any way,” Byman said.  “We could argue about policy X, Y and Z, but he is someone who really has no problem saying something, you know, 99 percent of all Muslims support ISIS, he could say something like that and just not care that it is completely false. And will do that to thematically cause an issue. … The idea that someone would knowingly distort is troubling.”
Byman also said Trump’s success in securing the Republican nomination concerned him since it showed that he did not understand an important part of his own country.
Dueck said Trump is not representative of Republican ideals and condemned him for helping to legitimize conspiracy theories, including the theories that Obama was not born in the United States and that Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Texas)’s father had been involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
“Trump is the ultimate disappointment. Because how do you defend him? He is indefensible. So I feel like it’s frustrating in the sense that he is not representing what I believe what it means to be a conservative or a Republican,” Dueck said.
Dueck said he would not be voting for Trump and hopes that he loses the election in order to provide anti-Trump Republicans an opportunity to regain control of the party.
Some audience members said they were disappointed the speakers did not evaluate the Republican candidate’s proposals more critically.
“I am a Democrat, and I have always wanted to hear from a real-life Trump supporter what exactly Trump’s foreign policy would entail,” Gabe Hammoud (SFS ’20) said. “I was a little disappointed that we didn’t get to have one of those [discussions].”
Alexander Hamilton Society President Jeff Naft (COL ’17) said he was satisfied with the organization’s first event and hopes more students attend the organization’s functions. (Full disclosure: Naft is a staff writer for The Hoya.)
“I thought professor Dueck was a great ambassador for American conservatism,” Naft said. “Professor Byman did a great job arguing on behalf of the Obama administration and offered some insight that was in the center and was genuine, sincere and authentic. I walked away learning a lot more, and I hope that the Hamilton Society can hold more events like this in the future.”

Black men are expected to live almost 15 years less than white men in Washington, D.C., according to a report released last week by the School of Nursing and Health Studies’ department of health systems administration.
The study is the first of three reports in a series analyzing the state of black individuals in D.C. at the request of history professor and D.C. Commission on African American Affairs Chair Maurice Jackson. The report is the result of a year-long project aiming to address issues facing the black community.
Assistant professor and Project Faculty Lead Christopher King said disparities in access to health care are often ignored.
“You can have the best health care in the world, but if we’re not thinking about the communities in which people live, we’re not going to see any changes in these disparities,” King said. “The whole purpose of the report is to challenge people to think more holistically about what health really means at the community level.”
Examining the health of black Washingtonians, the report details racial disparities in obesity, mental health and access to food, as well as the disparity in life expectancy between blacks and whites.
According to the study, life expectancy has improved for all populations in the city, except black residents. White males are expected to live almost 15 years longer than black males — 68.8 years compared to 83.2, respectively.
The report shows that clinical care — direct medical attention — accounts for only 20 percent of an individual’s degree of health. The remaining social determinants come from health behaviors, social and economic factors and the physical environment.
NHS Dean Patricia Cloonan said holistic health care requires concern beyond the traditional model of clinics and preventative health care.
“Clean air, sidewalks, safe neighborhoods, access to good education and good economic communities all contribute to our overall health and well-being. This report illuminates the inter-connectedness between a person’s health and his or her life outside of clinical care,” Cloonan said.
The report also suggests potential solutions for policymakers to implement, which require addressing those other social determinants of health. The report suggestions include increasing education around structural causes of poor health, increasing diversity in health care leadership and better integrating mental health care into primary care.
Vice President for Government Relations and Community Engagement Christopher Murphy said the university is already working on ways to implement the report’s recommendations.
“Georgetown is brilliant in conducting research and sharing its findings, but there’s a bit of connective tissue sometimes missing between the university and policymakers, so my colleagues and I are trying to bridge the gap between academia and practitioners so that the research is getting in front of an audience in a meaningful way,” Murphy said.
King said the health care system must be reformed in a manner that focuses on individual needs.
“At the doctor’s office, are we asking you questions about social support at home?” King said. “We need to make sure we have a health care system that’s asking questions about what life is like at home, because we know that hospital and health systems are incentivized to keep people out of the whole system.”
The next two reports, set to be released over the next few weeks, will address issues black D.C. residents face in housing and economics.
Jackson said housing costs significantly impact disadvantaged people.
“The cost of housing is astronomical, and people will leave because of that. We’ve offered some ideas, but the big idea is to create more affordable housing stock,” Jackson said. “There are many spaces to do so.”
King said professors should emphasize the importance of implicit bias in medical care and in medical education, since it can exacerbate these disparities.
“We’re doing a lot around implicit bias, because there are differences in how patients are treated as a result of race or social class,” King said. “We all have biases, so we’re doing a lot with medical education to make sure that our students are aware of the reality of implicit bias and how it may impact their decision making.”
Murphy said the report has sparked discussion among students and faculty about the role of the city in the lives of black D.C. residents.
“The city is wrestling now like never before with these issues. We’re acutely aware that many communities have so little, despite the prosperity of the city as a whole,” Murphy said. “People are thinking about what it means to be African-American. What really is the state of African-Americans in D.C.?”

Former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) criticized President Barack Obama’s administration’s reticence in foreign policy during Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service’s national security “Exit Interview” counterpoint event Sept. 23 in the Intercultural Center Auditorium.
GU Politics, a subset of the McCourt School of Public Policy, presents the counterpoint sessions to supplement the perspectives of speakers hosted in the newly launched six-part “Exit Interview” series, which examines the legacy of the Obama administration. Moderated by the School of Foreign Service Senior Associate Dean for Graduate and Faculty Affairs Tony Arend, Roger’s counterpoint session followed a Sept. 14 event that featured National Security Advisor Susan Rice.
Rogers was introduced by GU Politics Fellow and former senior advisor to Gov. Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign Michael Steele and GU Politics Student Advisory Board Co-chair Kelly Schneider (GRD ’18.) The pair described his achievements as a leader in cybersecurity and national security policy, as a CNN commentator and as the host of syndicated radio program “Something to Think About.”
“This will be a robust discussion about the Obama administration’s foreign policy from the point of view of someone who has watched it very carefully and closely, not always with a positive view,” Steele said.
The discussion, which around 35 people attended, centered on Rogers’ lamentation of Obama’s refusal to engage in new military conflicts.
In particular, Rogers chastised Obama for failing to intervene in Syria when President Bashar al-Assad crossed the “red line” by employing chemical weapons.
“The Syrians had violated the red line, multiple times,” Rogers said. “The world saw that, our allies in the Middle East saw that and they saw the United States take no action whatsoever. In a dangerous game like diplomacy, that works against you in a hurry.”
Rogers also held up the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia as an example of the administration’s failure. Rogers argued the administration wanted a quick win to showcase success on the global stage, so it engaged in a short-sighted treaty with Russia. He also accused Russia of cheating and not sticking to the treaty, while indicting the Obama administration for accepting Russian noncompliance.
“They gave away too much, including our ability to counter any reductions in missile defense technology,” Roger said. “Remember, Russians aren’t the only threat when it comes to nuclear weapons.”
Nevertheless, Rogers praised the administration’s continuation of National Security Agency programs.
“They understood the value of that program. That was another pretty tough decision for them,” Rogers said. “It seems kind of small and tactical, but it had huge outsized impact on our ability to track terrorist overseas.”
Rogers acknowledged the philosophical differences between his interventionist American policy and Obama’s more reserved approach, but argued the partisan divide is detrimental to national security.
“Unfortunately, in the last few years foreign policy and national security have seen that partisan divide,” Rogers said. “And that, I argue, is very, very unfortunate.”
Rogers also contemplated the future, remarking that he views all outcomes of this election with a sense of foreboding.
“Whoever is elected is going to get a slap in the face about our real challenges in so many different places around the world,” Rogers said. “I think we’re going to be farther apart after this election then I’ve certainly ever seen.”
Javon Price (SFS ’20) said he wished Rogers had further elaborated on certain issues.
“I wish it was paired with more context and knowledge,” Price said. “For example, he declined to go into more detail in the Iran deal.”
However, Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) noted the intimate nature of the conversation due to the small audience size, and contended it broached many policy details.
“There’s a certain implication that the audience will have a base of knowledge and skipping over that lets the speaker get into deeper conversations,” Estes said. “He touched a lot on personal experiences that we are always looking for, not general conservative party line responses, but actual personal stories, like bringing personal relationships that he had with foreign leaders into the conversation.”
Correction: The print issue of this article misidentified a photograph as Mike Rogers.

The Washington, D.C.’s Fiscal Policy Institute’s analysis of U.S. Census Bureau federal data found deep racial disparity in the District’s economic recovery after the recession. Although the overall median household income in the District has recovered steadily since the crash, rising some $13,000 above prerecession 2007 levels, incomes for black residents stagnated. In 2015, median incomes for black households were recorded at around $41,000, while median incomes for white households were recorded at $120,000.
Additionally, while the poverty rates for other racial and ethnic groups have improved since the recession, black Washingtonians make up the only racial or ethnic group to see a rise in their poverty levels since the recession. According to DCFPI, around 23 percent of the District’s black residents lived in poverty in 2007. In 2015, the number rose to 27 percent.
DCFPI policy analyst Claire Zippel (GRD ’15) said this report may challenge some common assumptions about the recovery.
“A lot of people think the recession is over, D.C.’s doing great,” Zippel said. “But D.C.’s economic growth since the recession has not been equally shared among the city’s racial groups and that racial inequality continues to be incredibly persistent and troublesome for our city.”
Zippel said the growing number of residents living below the poverty line poses a new challenge by putting a strain on the city’s services.
“There are more poor people in D.C. now who are going to need services from the government to meet basic needs, get back on their feet, get back to work or get a better job,” Zippel said. “The city needs to be increasing its investment in order to meet a greater need.”
McCourt School of Public Policy professor Harry Holzer said the District needs to make a stronger commitment to combatting poverty.
“We absolutely should be trying a lot harder,” Holzer said. “The problems are complex, and people who tell us there are easy solutions, I think, are leading us down a false path. And yet, I think there are things we can do that can help.”
Holzer proposed a modest minimum wage increase and an expanded earned-income tax credit as possible ways to raise the incomes of laborers. Currently, the D.C. minimum wage is $11.50 an hour, whereas the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. He particularly stressed the importance of creating opportunities for children in low-income communities to escape the poverty cycle.
“Even if you think the adults are getting what they deserve, the children born into these families are going to have a hard time in life,” Holzer said. “There is no way that we can say that their opportunities in life are going to be equal to kids in middle-class families or high-income families growing up in the suburbs.”
Holzer emphasized the importance of early childhood education and expanded pathways to apprenticeships and career and technical schools. Holzer said there is no easy solution to addressing poverty, but that these efforts are crucial nonetheless.
“Just because these things are complex and hard to do doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try,” Holzer said. “Even if we can accomplish a little bit along all these dimensions, you add it up and it can really make a difference in people’s lives. Saying something is complex is not an excuse for inaction.”
Albert Lee (MSB ’17), a volunteer for the Georgetown student group Hoya Taxa, which helps low-income D.C. residents file tax returns, echoed the importance of taking action.
“I think getting involved with issues of inequality is very much aligned with the mission of the university: contemplation and action, women and men for others,” Lee said. “There are a lot of problems with poverty and inequality in D.C., but sometimes we don’t acknowledge them because we don’t want to.”
Zippel encouraged Georgetown students to stand in solidarity with the broader D.C. community by informing themselves and engaging in these issues.
“We may be a city divided into four quadrants, but we’re all still one city,” Zippel said. “I think it’s important for everyone to be attentive that there are people in this city who are struggling every day. It’s important to support policies that would help improve lives.”

Following a failed coup attempt this summer, Turkey may become a new source of conflict in the Middle East, according to Georgetown’s Institute of Turkish Studies Director Sinan Ciddi and Aykan Erdemir, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, in a panel discussion sponsored by the School of Foreign Service Europe Forum at the Mortara Center on Thursday.
On the evening of July 15, the Turkish military attempted to seize control of major locations in Istanbul and Ankara, but it was ultimately stopped by forces still loyal to the state after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan urged Turkish citizens to take to the streets and fight back against the instigators.
Close to 300 civilians were killed during the coup, and thousands were left injured.
According to Ciddi, the lack of secularism and democracy and a collection of human rights violations in Turkey contributed to the schism between Erdogan and the Turkish military.
“The coup attempt did not occur in a vacuum.  It didn’t come out of nowhere,” Ciddi said. “The primary reason the coup attempt happened on July 15 is because the president of the country was in political alliance with the single other biggest political Islamist force in the country, and now they’ve fallen out with each other.”
In the months following the coup attempt, the Turkish government has accused members of the Gülen movement — an Islamic cultural and educational movement led by Turkish Cleric Fethullah Gülen — for being responsible for the coup.
More than 20,000 individuals including military officers, educators, prosecutors and judges have been arrested and detained for allegedly being loyal to Gülen. More than 60,000 public servants have been dismissed from their posts, while the Turkish military has seen a 40 percent purge of its officers since the failed coup attempt.
Erdemir said the coup could indicate that Turkey will become a source of conflict for the United States and its interests in the region. Turkey is currently a key partner for the United States and NATO in fighting ISIS and handling the Syrian refugee crisis.
“Turkey is a ticking time bomb with great potential for the Transatlantic alliance, as well as [the potential to be] the black swan that could bring the house down and NATO along with it,” Erdemir said.
Turkey’s role in the region is far more complex in the aftermath of the coup, according to Ciddi.
“What we have now is a grandiose mess,” Ciddi said. “I think we would have a much clearer picture had the coup actually been successful.”
SFS Europe Forum Chair Dante Mazzari, who moderated the event, said Turkey was a good choice for the Forum’s first event of the year given its relevance and complexity.  The SFS Europe Forum is a graduate student organization that organizes events on current events affecting transatlantic and European relations.
“[Turkey] is something that I think a lot of folks are really interested in, and yet it’s very difficult to understand. We thought that the speakers we would be able to get would shed a little bit of light on that,” Mazzari said. “Sometimes here we get so steeped in these broader trends, but often you have to take a step back and look at what is going on beneath the headlines.”
Forum member Teresa Eder (GRD ’17) said the event helped shed light on the current situation in Turkey.
“I thought that the speakers were very much on point and did a lot to help people who maybe have never heard about Turkey understand what the environment was like and what’s going on,” Eder said.
Mazzari said the event offered a unique opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of an important topic.
“It all comes back to how lucky we are in this community to have access to people like Professor Ciddi who can pull these issues apart and really pull back the layers of the onion and give us a much more nuanced understanding,” Mazzari said.
Gozde Meseli (GRD ’18), a Turkish student who experienced the coup attempt firsthand and attended the discussion, said she was excited to hear another perspective on the state of her country.
“I really wanted to hear what these professors had to say. They were fairly objective, which I really like,” Meseli said. “It’s a very complicated issue, but I really enjoyed it.”

The Dear Georgetown Freshmen website – a website launched by Misty Li (MSB ’17) showcasing letters written by upperclassmen to their freshmen selves – has garnered over 17,000 views since its launch Sept. 12.
The Dear Freshmen program was originally founded at the University of Pennsylvania by Lauren McCann this past February, and has since spread to Georgetown, Cornell University and Carnegie Mellon University among other schools. Georgetown’s website currently has 11 letters from upperclassmen to freshmen.
McCann, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania last year, said she started the program to connect with freshmen and help other upperclassmen leave their legacy at the school.
“Maybe someone will read their letter and not resonate with them, but if even just one person can read your letter and something spoke to them about that, then I think people found that to be really valuable and a way for them to connect with younger people and leave some sort of legacy,” McC¬ann said in an interview with The Hoya.
Li, who worked with McCann on implementing the program at Georgetown, said the movement is intended to support both upperclassmen and freshmen: for upperclassmen to reflect on their own freshman year and for freshmen to realize they are not alone in navigating their college experience.
“Hopefully it’s a two-part reflection process that seniors when they write the letter they see how far they’ve come since freshman year but also on the flip side of that, freshmen that are reading these letters are going to see that a lot of seniors have these perspectives,” Li said.
The website also hopes to dispel the idea that everyone is having the same first-year experience, according to Li.
“The culture is almost in a way that you don’t want to quit anything because you feel that you can do it all. So I would say that that’s like, beyond a stress culture, which I don’t think Georgetown really is,” Li said. “I think that it’s like a culture that promotes being busy.”
Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17), who wrote a letter on embracing challenges at Georgetown, said she hopes the website can bring upperclassmen and freshmen together.
“I hope that these letters can be a tool to connect new students and upperclassmen that serves to develop and grow mentoring relationships,” Hinerfeld said.
According to Hinerfeld, the project is not only geared toward freshmen, but is an opportunity for upperclassmen to evaluate their own college experience as their college careers come to an end.
“I think it’s a great way to reflect on our time at Georgetown and to distill our thoughts on what we care most about at this school,” Hinerfeld said.
Since the launch, the response from freshmen has been mixed. While one student reached out to the website an hour after the site launch, others, such as Marie-Claire Hazbun (SFS ’19), said the letters may not be helpful.
“I understand the concept of older, ‘wiser’ people passing their knowledge down, but in my experience, sometimes listening to these ‘enlightened’ individuals isn’t always beneficial,” Hazbun wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Often they just echo conventional wisdom — so I think it’s important to take this kind of advice with a grain of salt.”
The university is supporting the program on social media, to help raise awareness and reach more students according to Media Relations Manager Ryan King.
The Dear Georgetown Freshman website will also include a section, called Transfer-to-Transfer, to provide advice and support for transfer students, according to Li.
“The transfer experience is different from the freshman experience,” Li said. “We didn’t feel that it would do either group justice to combine them together.”
Li said she hopes the Dear Georgetown Freshmen Letters program will eventually help foster a closer campus community.
“These letters would help to be a small step towards the progress of building a renewed campus environment around, like as I think the website description says, creativity, curiosity, kindness, an appreciation of all the little things that we have come to love about Georgetown,” Li said.

The Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics — a theater performance group that seeks to humanize global politics using the performing arts — is integrating with the School of Foreign Service, four years after its foundation as an independent lab in 2012.
In its four years on campus, the Lab has sought to bring unheard voices to light in order to bridge the gap between foreign policy and global performance. The Lab is moving to the SFS in an effort to fulfill its interdisciplinary approach, while also presenting a new, unique perspective on foreign affairs to the members of the school.
Managing Director for the Lab Jojo Ruf said the Lab hopes to bring attention to complex issues and encourage dialogue through performance.
“It’s the idea of shining a light on stories and people and narratives that are rarely seen or that aren’t as front and center and providing opportunities for people to emphasize or to relate or see a new perspective on something,” Ruf said.
Co-director for the Lab Cynthia Schneider, a professor of diplomacy and culture in the SFS and the former U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands, said the move to the SFS is one of the greatest accomplishments of the Lab thus far.
“The stamp of approval and validation as well as the understanding of what we are trying to do that comes with the invitation to be part of the School of Foreign Service, that’s a great leap forward for us,” Schneider said.
Ruf said she expects the Lab’s new home will help it better achieve its mission, while enabling it to adapt its goals.
“I feel like the Lab’s mission is being refracted in a slightly different way, which feels really exciting to me,” Ruf said.
Schneider said the Lab hopes to disrupt the typical academic-based approach to foreign affairs and cultivate new ideas regarding foreign policy.
“We are really trying to transform these two fields — to disrupt them and transform them,” Schneider said. “Bringing those real voices here to Georgetown where there are so many brilliant minds grappling with the policy perspective — we think that combination can help produce a really extraordinary human-centered approach to foreign policy.”
Currently, The Lab is working on a play titled “The 272,” which focuses on the 272 slaves sold by the Maryland Jesuits to a Louisiana plantation in 1838. The Lab is collaborating with Richard Cellini, creator of the Georgetown Memory Project, which works to commemorate the sold slaves and their descendants.
Schneider hopes “The 272” can incite further dialogue concerning this painful part of Georgetown’s history, which has become the subject of national attention.
“We hope that ‘The 272’ can become a conversation piece, can become something that people attend and then are able after seeing it to open up and think with fresh eyes and ears about this very painful history, not just of Georgetown, but of our whole country,” Schneider said.
Ruf sees the message and mission of the Lab as increasingly crucial in the current political climate, both in the United States and internationally.
“Any time our program, intentionally or unintentionally, is reflecting back [on] what’s happening in the world,” Ruf said. “The political climate is becoming more and more polarized, and it’s becoming more and more evident that we need a space where we can show stories on stage and help humanize what’s happening worldwide.”
In addition to making an impact on audience members, the Lab also aims to encourage the artists involved in the performances, according to Schneider.
“We want to empower the artists with the tools to study, learn about and understand these global challenges and have them feel that they’re able to bring their artistry in understanding them and presenting them to people,” Schneider said.
To celebrate the move, the Lab hosted a conversation with Bassem Youseff, an Egyptian comedian. Youseff used satire to fight political injustice and evoke social change in Egypt, beginning during the Arab Spring movement.
Schneider said the dialogue with Youseff was the perfect way to celebrate the Lab’s integration within the SFS.
“To have him here and displaying his extraordinary wit and the razor-sharp satire that he’s used to undermine the authority, which is such a given in the Arab world, that reflects a lot of what we are trying to do,” Schneider said.
Devika Ranjan (SFS ’17) became involved with the Lab in her sophomore year at Georgetown. Ranjan coordinated dancers and choreographed for Ajoka Theatre’s “Amrika Chalo” from Pakistan, part of the Lab’s Myriad Voices: A Cross Cultural Performance Festival, and was on the devising team of Generation (Wh)Y, which celebrated the voices of Muslim youth from around the world.
Ranjan said the Lab’s new role in the SFS will fit perfectly with its academic perspective.
“I could not be more thrilled that the Lab will be housed in the SFS,” Ranjan said. “It’s such a natural fit; the school prepares us for a future of foreign service, and an essential part of that is performance, diplomacy and cultural understanding.”
Ranjan echoed Ruf’s comment on how projects such as the Lab hold more importance than ever due to today’s political and social climate.
“Performance is an entertaining, organic, grassroots way of teaching us about the world around us,” Ranjan said. “In a time in which xenophobia and racism run rampant, the intersection of theatre and politics has a greater responsibility than ever to showcase the importance of diversity, cross-cultural understanding and pluralism.”

D.C. Cannabis Campaign, a marijuana advocacy group, organized a march from Dupont Circle to the White House on Sept. 24 in what organizers hailed as an act of civil disobedience. The protest, which mirrored a similar event held last April, involved a mass “smoke out” on federal property in order to get President Barack Obama to take action toward legalizing cannabis.
Currently, marijuana, along with drugs like heroin, LSD and ecstasy, is listed as a Schedule I drug according to the Controlled Substances Act. Schedule I drugs are defined as having high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use.
The group, also known as DCMJ, was responsible for drafting Ballot Initiative 71, which was subject to a Districtwide referendum passed by 65 percent of the vote in November 2015 and enacted into law in late February 2015. The law prohibits the sale and public consumption of marijuana, but allows for limited personal growth, consumption and possession by those over 21 years of age.
DCMJ Chairman Adam Eidinger said the protest brought attention to incarceration of 6 million people for marijuana use.
“Protest needs to be public and we want the White House to know we are not satisfied,” Eidinger wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s a shaming in public that makes marching and speaking out a protest.”
However, just last month, Drug Enforcement Administration Chief Chuck Rosenberg cited the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s research on marijuana as a reason to keep it classified as a Schedule I drug. Rosenberg wrote a letter Aug. 11 in response to Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D), Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) and New Mexico nurse practitioner Bryan Krumm, who petitioned the federal government to reconsider their classification of the drug.
“It does not have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, there is a lack of accepted safety for its use under medical supervision, and it has a high potential for abuse,” Rosenberg wrote. “lf the scientific understanding about marijuana changes — and it could change — then the decision could change. But we will remain tethered to science, as we must, and as the statute demands. It certainly would be odd to rely on science when it suits us and ignore it otherwise.”
The theme of the protest, “March of the Clones,” referenced the evil organization in “Star Wars,” which Eidinger said parallels the agents complicit in the prohibition of marijuana.
“Old political leaders stuck in the prohibition mindset, big pharma and police all need to get over it,” Eidinger wrote. “We are running people’s lives with criminalization and it needs to stop for America to heal.”
The event began with a rally in Dupont Circle in which speakers from DCMJ as well as other lobbying groups including the Massachusetts Cannabis Reform Coalition spoke about the benefits of legalizing cannabis. Free homegrown marijuana plants in red Solo cups were distributed to those in attendance.
The protesters later marched 1 mile along Connecticut Avenue to the White House where, at 4:20 p.m., participants smoked marijuana. Though protesters had been urged to bring cannabis within the legal limit of 2 ounces or less, possession on federal property such as the White House remains a punishable offense.
Gabriel Shapiro, who attended the event, said it promoted issues greater than just the ability to get intoxicated.
“Remember that this is about humans enjoying life and having fun, but it’s also very importantly about racism and the living hell that a skewed portion of our population has to experience, through the generations,” Shapiro wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is about getting high but it’s also about addressing our racist government structure and the unfettered exploitation of humans and the planet.”

Students have reported an accumulation of trash in the hallways, walkways and bushes of on-campus apartments such as Village A and Henle Village after the Office of Planning and Facilities Management began consolidating trash disposal services in off-campus townhouses last year.
Trash in Alumni Square and Nevils Village has also accumulated over the past weeks.
According to Tina Cheesman (SFS ’19) who lives in Henle Village, there is a particularly large amount of trash buildup in and surrounding her apartment complex on the weekends.
“There’s a used condom from the first week of school that’s still on the staircase leading to our apartment,” Cheesman said.
Director of Residential Education Ed Gilhool said trash is not only a nuisance but also a hygiene issue.
“The Office of Residential Living encourages students to take ownership for the care of their communities, which includes disposing of trash appropriately,” Gilhool wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In addition to the burden litter has on members of our Housekeeping and Facilities team, excessive trash invites rodents and detracts from the overall student and guest experience.”

Multiple administrative offices and student groups have begun considering options for trash reduction, litter prevention and sustainability to address the issue.
The Office of Sustainability currently runs GU Litter Free – a student-led litter cleanup initiative for campus and surrounding neighborhoods – while the Georgetown Community Partnership is developing a “Clean Block Competition” this fall to provide motivation for keeping neighborhoods litter free, according to Office of Sustainability Director Audrey Stewart.
Georgetown University Student Association Senator Ben Baldwin (SFS ’19), who co-chairs the sustainability policy team, said GUSA has been considering ways to raise awareness of the prevalence of litter on campus to help address the problem.
“Right now, GUSA is just looking at ways to make sure that people are being stewards of their own environment,” Baldwin said. “We are trying to make sure that students are responsible for the things that they litter and that they are responsible for the things that they leave on the ground.”
Baldwin said GUSA has pushed for more opportunities for students to recycle on campus, especially during large events.
“We are working on ways to expand recycling opportunities on campus,” Baldwin said. “Right now we are looking at ways to potentially change the way that we hold events on campus so that we can actually have either catering options or other event options that allow for either recyclable plastics or other types of materials to be used so that we don’t have such a large amount of trash or waste left over after the events that we hold.”
Kyle Rinaudo (SFS ’18), a resident assistant in Village A, said that he and other resident assistants are considering options to combat litter in their residential blocks, including offering a program where RAs monitor waste and litter in each of the blocks and award prizes to the cleanest block on a monthly basis.
“We have started this new program this year called ‘Battle of the Blocks,’” Rinaudo said. “Every night the RA on duty would go back and look through how much trash is in each of the boxes publicly accessible, and then whoever the cleanest is at the end wins a prize.”
Rinaudo said the sustainability project aims to encourage residents to prevent litter from building up around apartments and provides an incentive to maintain cleanliness.
“The idea is that there are going to be these really good prizes and we want to make it so that it’s something that will really encourage people to think when they’re walking down these apartments, walking down in between blocks or outside doors,” Rinaudo said.
Until the university shifts its focus from waste management to on-campus litter control, Rinaudo said the onus is on students to keep the campus clean.
“Every student is expected to take ownership of their living space and clean up for themselves,” Rinaudo said.
