The Georgetown University Black Leadership Forum mounted a Week of Action this week to reflect on recent events in Ferguson, Mo., and draw attention to racial and criminal justice issues following a week of protests in Washington, D.C., that included a march in Georgetown last Saturday.
Almost 200 students took part in the Week of Action to protest the St. Louis grand jury’s Nov. 24 decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.
The Week of Action consisted of a walkout and 4.5 minutes of silence in Red Square beginning at 1:07 p.m. on Monday, the time of Brown’s shooting in August; a Day of Action to Stop Police Brutality on Wednesday, where participants contacted elected officials calling for reform in police practices, including the demilitarization of U.S. law enforcement and the mandated front-facing body cameras while on duty; and an HIV screening and letter writing campaign to Michael Brown’s family, followed by a Black Student Alliance Kwanzaa Dinner on Thursday.
On Friday, participants will engage in Freedom Friday, a day of “civil disobedience and demonstration,” according to the Facebook event.
Georgetown NAACP President Mikaela Ferrill (COL ’15) identified the dual educational and practical aims of the Week of Action.
“Being taught in the classroom is very important. Sometimes being in people’s face about things is a great strategy to bring issues to the forefront, and so that’s been kind of why we have a mixture of both educational components and visual demonstrations, because sometimes you need to bring demonstrations to people for them to actually see and understand what’s going on,” she said.
Khadijah Davis (NHS ’15), president of GU Women of Color and a member of the GU Black Leadership Forum, said that the Week of Action, which was inspired by demonstrations happening nationwide since August, was intended as a means to continue the conversation about race and justice on campus.
“We are ultimately hoping to encourage both campus-wide dialogue and compassion for each other,” Davis wrote in an email. “Many members of our campus community need a time to talk, a time to engage in open discourse with one another. We needed a time to conceptualize the gravity of the situation in Ferguson and the hundreds like it, and a time to heal.”
Davis said that the events this week were planned to open up a safe space on campus to talk about the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in August and other issues of race across the country.
Coinciding with the Week of Action was the decision of a Staten Island grand jury on Thursday not to indict a white New York police officer in the death by chokehold of 43-year-old Eric Garner, which incited further protests around the country and in the District.
“All of the events were planned with the intention to create a safe space on campus to talk about the incredibly heartbreaking and traumatizing events taking place in our country. The killing of Mike Brown is not an isolated incident. There are Mike Browns in all of our states and in many of our cities,” Davis wrote. “With them and the hundreds of others in mind, we wanted to plan these events to finally give people the space to talk with an open heart and mind and to think actively about how we can help salvage our communities all across the country.”
Despite the high levels of participation in the Week of Action, BLF members faced opposition as well. A collage including photos of people killed by police violence and law enforcement statistics, which was hung in Red Square on Monday, was torn down on Wednesday around 5 p.m. After being reposted, the collage was again torn down.
“Following the candlelight vigil on Wednesday night, over 50 students gathered in Red Square on Wednesday night to hang up the poster in solidarity for a third time,” Esther Owolabi (COL ’15), a member of the BLF and a convener of the Patrick Healy Fellowship, said. “There is no camera footage of the perpetrators.”
History professor Marcia Chatelain, who started the Twitter hashtag #FergusonSyllabus and has been active in campus conversation on the issue, underlined the importance of reflecting on and learning from the issues raised by Ferguson.
“As people on the ground in Ferguson are being tear gassed and their rights not respected, the least we can do at a college campus is learn and grow together in learning about the political and social contexts that have created Ferguson,” she wrote in an email.
The week of discussion on campus follows a series of protests in the District immediately after the grand jury decision, organized without central planning and largely through social media under the hashtag #DCFerguson, aided by multiple city coalitions including Hands Up Coalition D.C. and One D.C. Among the protests was a “Boycott Georgetown” march on Saturday in which protesters marched up M Street from the Foggy Bottom Metro station.
Crystal Walker (SFS ’16), who traveled with a delegation of Georgetown students to Ferguson in October, ran into the protest on her return to campus this weekend and recognized organizers from her trip to Ferguson.
“It was great to just be there and — I haven’t been able to go to anything since then — but it was really great to see them there and follow on social media what the different coalitions and groups are doing, because it kind of shows the solidarity that what happened in Ferguson is not just a Ferguson problem. It’s an American problem,” she said.
The Georgetown protest follows previous marches outside the White House on Nov. 24 and at Mount Vernon Square on Nov. 25, both of which were attended by Georgetown students.
In addition to the Week of Action and the off-campus protests, Georgetown students and faculty have engaged in discussions on campus throughout the semester in an attempt to address race, the law and police brutality, including a vigil and panel in August. Ferrill expressed gratitude for the administration’s response to promote open dialogue.
“The faculty is doing a great job, but even the administration, [said] a few words on post-non-indictment. [University President John J. DeGioia] — he supported us at the vigil and that was really important and we want to continue the administration’s involvement in these issues because they affect the larger community here at Georgetown,” Ferrill said.
The university has not released a statement on the event, though the Law Center hosted a panel on Wednesday reflecting on the grand jury decision, featuring Chatelain and former federal professor and current law professor Paul Butler. Additionally, sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson, who drew attention for his debate with Rudy Giuliani on “Meet the Press” in advance of the grand jury decision, wrote an op-ed in The New York Times.
Center for Multicultural Equity and Access Director Charlene Brown-McKenzie noted that the role of administrators was primarily in the background, supporting the reflection of students.
“Our focus is supporting students as they react and respond on how the events in Ferguson challenges us to examine social justices issues,” Brown-McKenzie wrote in an email.
The BLF also held a silent demonstration in Red Square on Nov. 25 in protest of the jury’s decision, and the BLF co-hosted a discussion panel with the Center for Social Justice and the Program for Justice and Peace reflecting on the “Weekend of Resistance” in Ferguson, after 17 Georgetown students travelled to Ferguson for the weekend to participate in the protests in October.
Davis said that the events of the Week of Action, while similar to previous events on Ferguson, will focus more on action-based demonstrations. She did not comment about what the future of the movement would hold.
“In many ways, these events are all similar in that they have combined the efforts of both students and administrators,” Davis wrote. “These conversations appealed more to the emotional gravity of the situation and help us begin campus conversations on race. As the name implies, this week will involve more action, in addition to a time to reflect.”

1.	There is nothing written in the US constituion guaranteeing a “civil right” for young black males to steal, assault and disobey law enforcement. The only civil rights that were violated were those of Officer Wilson. This man’s life is now in shambles because he did his job. He can no longer work as a public servant, nor can he even show his face in public. Officer Wilson is portrayed as the bad guy, while the family of Michael Brown is shown on national TV encouraging destruction of the community with no public reprimand.
The most disturbing and sad aspect of the whole situation is the ignorance of not just the black activists, but also the white liberals. Justice was served long before the grand jury made a decision. Michael Brown made the decision, not the grand jury. His parents should be outraged because their son was not the “gentle giant” they thought he was. Unfortunately, situations like this will surely happen again. It was a tragedy that a young man lost his life, but the real tragedy is the lack of common sense, morality and indivual accountability in the black community. The law was followed and a decision was made. Deal with it, move one and rise up against the thugs who are destroying our way of life, not those who are fighting to protect it.
As for the protestors across the USA, where is the line drawn between making a point and causing criminal acts? Blocking highways and intersections to protest civil right violations causes gridlock, inconvenience and anger. Protesters are violating the rights of those who wish to travel freely. How is this acceptable? How does inconveniencing the general public help your cause? The level of ignorance surrounding this entire matter from day one is sickening and unbelievable. Protests such as those that we’ve seen are pointless and will only serve to work against those trying to affect change.
Protesting will not solve the problem. We need parents to teach respect, morals and values to our children. We must teach our children to do the right thing, not to find fault with what is wrong. This is only a matter of race because black activists make it so. What if it had been a black officer and a white victim? What if it were an Asian or a Hispanic? Does it really matter? A crime was committed and a police officer who was sworn to protect and serve the community did his job. There is a system in place to ensure justice. The system worked. And now, for those who choose to use this as reason to cause violence and destruction, you too will find out how the justice system works when you are arrested and removed from society.

The invincible ignorance re Ferguson on campus now reaches Gilbert and Sullivan slapstick hilarity.

December 5, 2014 at 3:41 pm
The idea that *alleged* criminals suddenly don’t have rights in this country is laughable. And its even funnier, because the notion only comes up with the accused is black. 
Our core principles, as documented in the very basic Bill of Rights provide ALL people the right to a speedy trial BY JURY, which is supposed to determine guilt or innocence, NOT a police officer with a loaded gun. There is also ALWAYS supposed to be the presumption of innocence until guilt is PROVEN IN COURT. Police officers are not supposed to be the jury, judge, AND executioner. 
Riddle me this. How can one prove someone’s guilt if they are dead in the middle of the street? How can someone defend themselves in a court when there are 6 bullets pumped into their body, two of which went through their head to guarantee their silence? And why was so much of Amerikkka so eager to give this presumption of innocence to Darren Wilson who left a human being on the street exposed to an entire community for 4.5 hours and washed away evidence but NOT to Mike Brown, who may or may not have had an altercation with Wilson?
But, I suppose it is true. “A system cannot fail those it was never built to protect”, right? These laws really weren’t made for all Americans, especially the ones that were “once” considered three-fifths of a person. 
(BTW, the protestors purportedly inconveniencing people also have the RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE.)

Kit Marlowe says 
December 6, 2014 at 9:02 pm
Are you actually arguing that Policeman Wilson should have done nothing whatever to stop Michael Brown from reaching him and possibly beating him to death so that Brown could have a chance in court to tell his side of the story? And just one more thing: yes, of course you have a right to assemble but you do not have the right to disrupt or inconvenience the lives of others, especially those who have absolutely nothing to do with Brown’s tragic death.

Tiffany says 
December 8, 2014 at 12:18 am
At no point did I say Darren Wilson should have done “nothing”. There are a LOT of options in between “nothing” and shooting someone 6+ times. 
That’s an overkill. That’s inhumane. 
It’s interesting. The fact that he saw killing someone – because that’s pretty much all that will come out of shooting someone in the head twice – as his only option to “neutralize the situation” is a huge part of the problem. In other countries, like the UK, police officers don’t even carry guns and still figure it out. 
Perhaps he could have used a less-lethal taser? Oh right, that was too “uncomfortable” to carry on a regular basis. But a gun wasn’t? Where on earth do they do that at? America. 
Just think about this. Why are these choices made on behalf of police officers not being interrogated and corrected? Why are non-lethal options along use-of-force continuums “optional,” but guns are not? 
To your second point, as Americans, we should ALL have something to do with assuring justice for one another. As Desmond Tutu said, “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.” Those who are willing to ignore inequities and mistreatment  of others are a part the problem. They allow it to perpetuate. Their indifference is a piece of an oppressive systemic pie that allows this to keep happening. Their indifference has every right to be challenged and inconvenienced. Their thoughts or lack there of need to be disrupted. Take a different route.

And so where were the protests about this:
“Gilbert Collar, a white, unarmed 18-year-old under the influence of drugs was shot and killed Oct. 6, 2012, by Officer Trevis Austin, who is black, in Mobile, Alabama. Despite public pressure for an indictment, a Mobile County grand jury refused to bring charges against Officer Austin, concluding that the officer acted in self-defense.”

President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and first lady Michelle Obama brought together hundreds of educators from across the country in the second White House College Opportunity Day of Action to propose federal initiatives and discuss innovations in the national education system.
Gathered in the amphitheater of the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center on Pennsylvania Avenue, participants listened to a series of panels and speakers who discussed all aspects of the nation’s schooling with an emphasis on improving accessibility for higher education to low-income students, announcing over 600 new actions by various organizations toward this goal.
In addition to the main speakers, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Director of Domestic Policy Council Cecilia Muñoz and Director of the National Economic Council Jeff Zients addressed attendees at the event, with intermittent panels featuring educators discussing key educational issues, including immigration and graduation rates, throughout the day.
Obama’s nearly 30-minute speech highlighted the main points of the day, incorporating themes of contributing to overall economic growth, supporting college students toward graduation and increasing accessibility for low-income and first-generation high school students. He called for bipartisanship in achieving these aims.
“This should not be a Democratic issue or a Republican issue, making sure more of our young people have access to higher education and can succeed and complete their work and get their degree — that has to be an American issue,” he said.
He stressed economic stratification as a source of disunity and tension within the country, specifically pertaining to the rising cost of higher education, explaining that middle class families who receive minimal or no financial aid often feel excluded from the conversation. In addition to the education frustrations, Obama alluded to the national response to the events in Ferguson, Mo., as an example of mistrust in the current political system.
“When it comes, as we’ve seen unfortunately in recent days, to our criminal justice system, many Americans feel deep unfairness when it comes to the gap between our professed ideals and how laws are applied on a day-to-day basis,” he said.
Obama stressed restoring equality to the education system as the solution to combat these divisions.
“As a nation, we don’t promise equal outcomes, but we were founded on the idea everybody should have equal opportunity to succeed, no matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, you can make it,” he said.
All speakers emphasized how higher education affects the nation and specifically results in a stronger economy.
Biden highlighted the 1944 GI Bill as the turning point in equalizing American education, ushering in the most educated generation of workers in the world for its time. Obama elaborated on this 20th-century success of American education, urging the participants at the summit to search for ways to bring the nation back to this glory by maintaining an emphasis on skilled, high-wage jobs filled by educated workers.
“The skills of our people, the investments we made in human capital — We were ahead of the curve,” he said. “If we make sure they remain the best educated generation in American history, there’s no limit to what they can achieve. There’s no limit to what this country can achieve.”
In light of his executive order issued Nov. 20, Obama referenced his immigration policy to attract skilled professionals to the United States, drawing extended applause from the auditorium.
“The immigration issue is, I recognize, one that generates a lot of passion, but it does not make sense for us to want to push talent out rather than to make sure that they’re staying here and contributing to society,” he said.
To reap the economic benefits of education, the day emphasized the need to support college students toward graduation. Obama pointed out that students who fail to complete their degree are left with an added burden of debt, but without the skills necessary for a higher-wage job.
“If they’re simply enrolling and not graduating, if they’re enrolling and not getting the skills that they need, then we’re not delivering on our promise,” he said.
During the first discussion of the day, panelists brainstormed initiatives to change campus culture in order to encourage students to remain enrolled.
Arizona State University President Michael Crow noted the need to pay special attention to science, technology, engineering and mathematics majors who often drop after introductory courses. He said a re-evaluation of one required physics course resulted in a 40 percent reduction in students dropping the major from fall 2012 to spring 2013.
The final broad theme of the day was a critical look at increasing accessibility for low-income and first-generation high school students. Speakers emphasized that a change in higher education stems from fundamental improvements in primary and high school learning.
Muñoz said this change must span the entire life of the student.
“[The approach is] really zero to 16 [years old] if we’re going to be successful and reach the kind of scale we’re talking about,” she said.
Michelle Obama’s speech focused on her Reach Higher Initiative, which aims to further the education of college counselors helping high school students through the admissions process. With a national average of one counselor per 471 students, many students lack the attention they need to get to college.
The first lady described this process as two divided worlds. The first, she said, is full of kids who lack the resources to be competitive in the college process, suffering from misinformation about topics such as the SAT or ACT, how to apply for financial aid or even where to look. The second is a narrower world of students who have all of these resources readily available.
“The fact is that right now, a small number of students are getting every advantage in the college admissions race while millions of other students who are just as talented can’t even begin to compete,” she said.
Biden echoed the stratification of high school students in the admissions process.
“I’m worried that we may end up with a two-tiered college system,” he said. “The most elite universities are limited to those who are truly exceptional intellectually and regardless of income are able to get scholarships to go or have significant resources.”
As part of her Reach Higher Initiative, the first lady announced a challenge to university campuses in her speech to send her videos of how they are targeting recruitment of lower-income, first-generation students. She agreed to speak at the commencements of schools with her favorite submissions.
She concluded her call for innovations in the college admissions process by reiterating the national benefits that could be gained from a more educated young population.
“We are depriving ourselves of so much human potential in this country,” the first lady said. “From the scientific discoveries these kids might make to the businesses that they might build to the leadership that they one day might show in all of our communities — we’re missing all of that.”

December 5, 2014 by Xinlan Hu 5 Comments 
The Office of Planning and Facilities Management announced a long-term plan to construct two new buildings and two add-ons to campus as a part of the university’s 2017 Campus Plan.
The buildings will be located on Regents lawn, Harbin patio and on top of the Leavey Center. The add-ons on top of the Leavey Center will serve as academic and residential spaces, while the Regents lawn building will serve as academic space and the Harbin patio building will serve as a mix of both. While the plans for the buildings are not finalized, construction will most likely begin by 2020, Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said.
The 2017 Campus Plan, which will be slated for approval in December 2017 after the expiration of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, is being developed by university administrators and the Georgetown Community Partnership. The GCP, a group that was created as part of the university’s 2010 Campus Plan to engage the community in the planning process, includes six working groups of students, faculty, senior university officials and elected neighborhood leaders.
The Office of Community Engagement helps coordinate the GCP’s development of future campus plans within its master planning steering group. The Office of Planning and Facilities Management presented the plan at a Planning 301 meeting Nov. 20, the latest of a series of community forums hosted by university administrators in an ongoing process to develop new student spaces on campus.
Morey said that the buildings were proposed to fulfill students’ expressed desire to live on campus and to strengthen the university’s living community. The proposed spaces will also help fulfil the requirements of the 2010 Campus Plan, which includes a commitment to house 90 percent of undergraduates on campus by fall 2025.
“We know that students want to be here on the Hilltop,” Morey said. “Last year, the students did a survey and that survey said that we want to be on the Hilltop on campus. We want to strengthen the residential living and learning environment on campus and we want to make it a place where students want to be. So those are principal in our planning factors.”
Morey said that the two proposed construction locations, the Harbin patio and the Regents lawn, were chosen based on a complete analysis of infrastructure and available empty spaces.
“We’ve done a complete analysis and study of all the potential spaces to locate housing,” Morey said. “We look at factors like can the surrounding infrastructure support it and where do we need to strengthen community. … We want to keep true to districts, athletic, humanities core, sciences and residential. Quite frankly, when you look at the campus, where else would you put them? It gets challenging when we have limited land use.”
According to Morey, the two new construction projects are close to being confirmed, although some details remain undecided. Morey said that the administration will be open to student feedback in the upcoming years about these construction projects.
“We think of those [projects] as pretty solid,” Morey said. “We are planning 20 years on. … We might not start construction on the Harbin one until 2020. No decision has been made. These are literally concepts that we still have to go around and engage with in the next two years.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson stressed that no decisions have been made and that Planning 301 was an opportunity for representatives to provide feedback.
“I will note that no decisions have been made — these are concepts that are being explored for the long term,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The planning presentation last Thursday was an early opportunity for members of the university community, including students, to see these ideas and share feedback.”
Morey also said that students saw the construction as opportunities for better apartments.
“These ideas have been well-received by the students,” Morey said. “Students recognize that we do need more apartment-style complex, high-quality apartments. Certainly this should be one of them.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) helped develop the 20-year plan with the GCP, as the student body’s representative to the organization. Tezel suggested that the neighborhood community likely had an influence on the dorm project and pointed to the partnership’s efforts in these negotiations.
“The neighborhood community does have an interest in ensuring [that] students are housed on campus,” Tezel said. “We as the Georgetown Community Partnership hoped that our proposed project based on our main campus finances will convince neighborhood leaders that the university needs much stability and not deadlines in terms of building new dorms.”
However, Tezel said that the administration should prioritize dorm maintenance projects rather than starting new construction.
“From what I experienced from students, the administrators should prioritize the maintenance projects before building new buildings, whether dorms or academic buildings, on campus,” Tezel said. “For instance, projects like renovating Henle dorms or improving the elevators. These are all projects that the university needs to take on first. New buildings are always nice, but if we are not fixing something we currently have, that’s a problem.”
Although Morey admitted the possible inconvenience brought by construction, he said that construction will bring about a better future for the university.
Currently, the university is constructing the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall, renovating the former Jesuit Residence to convert it into a residential space and working on small renovations of existing residential areas, including the Leavey Center hotel.
“It’s painful to go through construction,” Morey said. “But the university has been here 200-plus years. While it is painful to go through construction and I do recognize that the time frame is a short four years. But it will be a better place after construction. … If we wouldn’t allow construction, we wouldn’t have what we have now on the Hilltop.”
Morey said that he expected oppositions to the plans, but pointed to a series of student-engagement opportunities provided by Master Planning, including asking students to propose ideas and holding forums such as Planning 301.
“Planning is hard work. I suspect that there will be oppositions to some planning factors,” Morey said. “But we have a core set of principles. … Everybody has their opinions, thoughts and objectives. I think it’s our job that we set up the campus for the future of the university and make a sustainable effort.”
Lydia Brown (COL ’15), a student who attended Planning 301, said she was disheartened that the plan was approved without student input.
“It is incredibly disappointing but not at all surprising that students have not been consulted at all about these planned changes to the campus landscape and available spaces,” Brown said. “This announcement, presented as a given, should be a major point of contention. It seems that the administration presented this information quietly, hoping that more students would not notice.”
In the past, construction projects have been affected by student opinion. The construction of a satellite campus, which was a part of the 2010 campus plan, was squashed after more than 93 percent of voters expressed opposition to it in a student body-wide referendum in September 2013. In addition, student concern about lack of green space on campus led Northeast Triangle architects Sasaki Associates to incorporate greenery onto the building’s rooftop.
Kathleen Osea (NHS ’16) said that she is disappointed that the university is constructing over minimal available green spaces.
“It seems like they want to build essentially where anything green is,” Osea said. “We already don’t have green space, and we’re losing some in the Northeast Triangle. This is cutting out the green space even more. They’re trying to fit even more things on an already small campus. I think we already have enough classrooms.”
Rio Dijwandana (SFS ’16) said that he believes the new buildings could overcrowd campus.
“It would be an adjustment, but I don’t know if it would be a bad or good one. The campus will definitely feel more crowded with so much less space,” Dijwandana said. “I don’t know why we need any more buildings; why can’t we just improve the ones we already have? I don’t think we’re necessarily running out of classrooms, either.”

So, um, one the one hand we have:
“Lydia Brown (COL ’15), a student who attended Planning 301, said she was disheartened that the plan was approved without student input.
“It is incredibly disappointing but not at all surprising that students have not been consulted at all about these planned changes to the campus landscape and available spaces,” Brown said. “This announcement, presented as a given, should be a major point of contention. It seems that the administration presented this information quietly, hoping that more students would not notice.”
On the other hand, we have:
“Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson stressed that no decisions have been made and that Planning 301 was an opportunity for representatives to provide feedback.
“I will note that no decisions have been made — these are concepts that are being explored for the long term,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The planning presentation last Thursday was an early opportunity for members of the university community, including students, to see these ideas and share feedback.”
So Ms. Brown is upset that the plan was approved without student input, despite the fact that no decisions have been made, no plan approved, etc.  There seems to be… a lack of comprehension on someone’s part here.

Michelle says 
December 5, 2014 at 1:25 pm
Really, Georgetown? You just gave us Regents Lawn as a nice, wonderful green space. And you’re already planning to build over it? Are you determined to make the south end of campus feel as crowded as an urban city? Geez. By the time I come back for my 20 year reunion, I won’t even be able to recognize the place.

Dizzy says 
December 5, 2014 at 2:10 pm
Michelle: if you look at the slides, “Regents Lawn” is something of a misnomer as far as the location of the proposed building goes.  It would really be the space south of Regents, next to Harbin, rather than the lawn between Regents and Hariri.  
Not sure why The Hoya didn’t link to the actual presentation: https://georgetown.box.com/shared/static/dmih1vq11ht4nmooj68k.pptx

Wow, good thing we’re building a new athletic center. Meanwhile, Is Kober-Cogan still sitting unused?

Josh says 
December 6, 2014 at 10:26 am
Right, people don’t seem to understand where these buildings will actually go.  Yes, it will increase overall building density, but the projects will not really take away much existing green space.  They’ll cover (ugly) Harbin patio and the unattractive bend in Tondorf Road north of Harbin.
And for the Leavey addition that would take the place of the Esplanade, there’s no reason a new Esplanade couldn’t be added on top of the addition.

The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security held a conference Wednesday morning in Gaston Hall on the inclusion of women in peacekeeping efforts, featuring former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Norwegian Minister of Defense Ine Eriksen Søreide.
Clinton opened the event, “Smart Power: Security Through Inclusive Leadership,” with an introduction of the conference goal, the creation of a National Action Plan Academy, which will discuss the action plans of individual countries regarding the role of women in peace and security. The academy is a joint effort by GIWPS, Inclusive Security and the Clinton Foundation’s No Ceilings Initiative.
Clinton emphasized the importance of including female perspectives in decision-making on security and peacekeeping.
“We know that when women participate in the peace processes, often overlooked issues such as human rights, individual justice, national reconciliation, economic renewal are often brought to the forefront,” Clinton said.
Clinton also discussed the importance of women playing an active role in decision-making. According to Clinton, the use of “smart power,” which she defined as the collaboration between all partners in advancing peace and security, is essential in creating peace.
“[Smart power means] leaving no one on the sidelines, showing respect even for one’s enemies, trying to understand and, insofar as is psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective and point of view, helping to define the problems, determine the solutions,” Clinton said.
But historically, few women have been included in peace and security issues. According to Clinton, out of hundreds of peace treaties that have been signed since the early 1990s, fewer than 10 percent had any female negotiators, and fewer than 3 percent had any female signatories. Clinton attributed the failure of these peace agreements to their lack of female participants.
“Is it any wonder that many of these agreements failed within a few years? Legal and structural barriers still prevent women from participating in conflict resolution and peace processes,” Clinton said. “Cultural norms, real or imagined, create physical threats that prevent them from attaining a formal role. But these barriers are not insurmountable.”
After Clinton’s speech, Søreide spoke about the various human rights violations against women occurring in the world. Søreide emphasized the necessity of considering female perspectives in confronting these challenges. She also emphasized how better gender balance in the military not only promotes equality, but also increases effectiveness.
“[It’s] not primarily about gender equality, it’s more specifically about capability and operational effectiveness,” Søreide said. “We will replace bias of inclusive security, being soft or women’s participation in armed forces as part of a gender quota. It is time that we get rid of that perception.”
After Clinton and Søreide’s speeches, a panel took the stage to answer questions, featuring U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations Deputy Military Adviser Adrian Foster, Special Representative of the NATO Secretary General for Women, Peace and Security Marriët Schuurman, Japan International Cooperation Agency President Akihiko Tanaka and retired Director of the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Students Lieutenant General Daniel Leaf.
Foster said that including women could help to protect civilians in U.N. peacekeeping missions.
“We need to make the connection with females so that we understand what the threats are, where they’re coming from,” Foster said. “Imagine females in villages traumatized over a number of years by men wearing uniform. How can we make that connection if we have men wearing uniform but with a blue beret? It is very difficult. That is why we are pushing very hard to increase the number of female peacekeepers.”
Lizzy Peet, an exchange student from Edinburgh studying at Georgetown for the year, said she found the event inspiring.
“I thought all of the speakers were very engaging and they presented a lot of creative ideas for how to solve the problems facing the world today,” Peet said. “I just feel a lot of hope for the future.”
Renata Garcia (SFS ’17) said she also enjoyed the event, which fell during the last week of classes, but noted its unexpectedly low turnout. Gaston Hall only filled about halfway, with around 400 occupied seats.
“I know a lot of people had classes during that time … Also, the thought of having to wake up at 5:30 in the morning to stand in line on a cold rainy day is discouraging,” Garcia said. “For some, it’s a ‘been there, done that’ kind of thing.”
The low attendance was picked up by a variety of media outlets after Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank tweeted a photo of Gaston Hall’s empty seats.
“Secretary Clinton’s visits to Georgetown are always met with great enthusiasm here. She was here four weeks ago and students lined up overnight for that visit and we had to turn people away due to the interest,” University Spokesperson Stacy Kerr said in a statement to Business Insider. “This is the last week of classes for the semester and many students are preparing for finals. Gaston Hall holds about 700 — the bottom holds about 400 and it was full for today’s visit.”
University Communications Officer for Arts and Sciences Maggie Moore said that the low turnout was expected because of to upcoming final exams.
“The first floor of Gaston was full for this event so I’m not sure why this is considered ‘particularly low,’” Moore wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But as you know it’s the last week of classes for the semester and many students are preparing for finals.”
Clinton has spoken on campus two times this semester and four times since fall 2013. Gaston Hall filled to capacity at her three previous speaking events.

For the fourth time in 44 years, the School of Foreign Service is in the process of searching for a new dean.
University President John J. DeGioia appointed a group of 17 professors, students and other university officials in early fall to make recommendations of candidates for the deanship. DeGioia chose members to represent a variety of university interests and strengths. The group, known as the Executive Search Committee, has begun reviewing applications after the application deadline formally closed Nov. 20. after opening in early fall.
Currently, a period of confidentiality is in place to protect the privacy of high-profile candidates. Members of the search committee declined to comment on the number of applicants and their criteria.
Search Committee Chair and SFS government professor Angela Stent, who chaired the search for the SFS dean in 2010, spoke about the committee’s process during a Nov. 24 meeting with SFS students in which students voiced their opinion about what qualities the new dean should embody.
“What we’re doing right now is collecting names,” Stent said. “And then what we do as a committee is we will meet in a couple of weeks, and we narrow down a list of maybe 15 to 20 people.”
According to a Leadership Profile put out by Witt/Kieffer, the recruiting and consulting firm managing the search, applicants submitted their applications by Nov. 20. Witt/Kieffer declined to comment on the search process.
Interim SFS Dean James Reardon-Anderson temporarily took over the deanship in November 2013 after former Carol Lancaster was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Lancaster, who died Oct. 22 at the age of 72, formally submitted her resignation in April. Lancaster’s original term would have been set to expire in summer 2015, and, before her illness, she had stated that she would not seek to renew her contract, desiring a return to academia.
While the search for a permanent dean continues, Reardon-Anderson said that he has been running the day-to-day operations of the SFS, such as fundraising and balancing budgets. He has also begun to prepare staff for changes the new dean may make.
“With respect to serving as interim dean, my strategy is twofold,” Reardon-Anderson said. “One is to keep the operation of the school going at the highest possible level … and then secondly to prepare the school in the best possible shape for the new dean, whoever that person might be.”
Although Lancaster previously served as interim dean, replacing Robert Gallucci, before being named permanent dean, Reardon-Anderson declined to comment as to whether he is being considered for the deanship on grounds of confidentiality. Previously Reardon-Anderson served as the first dean of the SFS campus in Qatar, from 2005 to 2009.
Provost Robert Groves said that the university hopes to announce the Executive Search Committee’s choice for dean by the end of spring semester, which would allow the new dean to begin by July 1, 2015.
“There is a period of confidentiality in part because not everyone who is applying for the position would like it to be widely known that they’re applying,” Reardon-Anderson said. “Almost all of these people are currently in other jobs. They may not want to reveal at this point that they’re looking elsewhere.”
During the last SFS dean search five years ago, Josh Rogin, a reporter for Foreign Policy, broke a story that James Steinberg, the then-deputy secretary of state under Hillary Clinton was being considered for the post. Since then, Stent said confidentiality is of the utmost priority.
“We don’t want any more articles in Foreign Policy magazine. We don’t want Josh Rogin to break another story like he did last time,” Stent said during the Nov. 24 meeting.
Students at the meeting with Stent said that they wanted to see a dean who could combine public sector experience with experience in education. Faculty members have also said that such dual-world experience is invaluable.
“In the past the deanship of the SFS has always looked for people who have both academic and public affairs experience,” Reardon-Anderson said.
SFS Academic Council President Megan Murday (SFS ’15) echoed the hope that the new dean will be someone with a wide range of experience.
“We need a visionary — someone who really has an idea of where the school has been and where it can go in the future,” Murday said. “And we also need someone who has that dynamic background of academia, of experience in the field, so that they can bring the tools of the public and private sector into academia to really build a unique institution.”
Groves said that in addition to someone with a wealth of experience, he hopes to see a dean who is open to collaboration with other academic institutions.
“The world has changed,” Groves said. “There are opportunities to collaborate with other schools at Georgetown in new ways to bring inter-disciplinary programs to the fore. … We need a leader who is attuned to the faculty interests and abilities but also has an eye on initiatives that make the school even stronger than it is now.”
Whoever is selected as the next dean of the SFS will serve at a pivotal time for the school, which will celebrate its 100-year anniversary in 2019.
“The School of Foreign Service is one of the jewels and the crown of Georgetown,” Groves said. “It will, under the dean, celebrate its 100th anniversary. So it’s an interesting historical moment for the school. At the very least, we want to maintain the core strengths of the school.”

The lead is just stupid. Why is the most significant thing in this story that the SFS is looking for its 4th dean in 44 years?? that is totally normal and not even noteworthy.

Members of the university administration and the Georgetown University Student Association have collaborated to create the Student Employee Experience Committee, a group of students and administrators who will investigate the experiences of student employees to create a list of recommendations for improvements.
The committee, which will launch in January 2015 and release a report in late September, will consist of 14 to 18 members — including seven to eight selected students and about 10 administrators from different campus offices that work with student employees.
The creation of the SEEC stems from recent reports of concerns from student workers, which include allegations of sexual assault, mistreatment and negligence. The GUSA senate passed a bill Nov. 16 calling for the administration to investigate all claims of resident assistant mistreatment, and Tuesday a group of RAs presented a bill to the administration that calls for reform of the RA working experience to create more protection and transparency.
“We’ve been made aware of a set of concerns that students have raised and want to make sure that we are taking a thoughtful, institutional look at these issues and the status of all sorts of student employees at Georgetown,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said. “So, we are excited to be partnering with GUSA and with student leaders as administrators to do a thorough and comprehensive look at this set of issues.”
The committee will conduct one-on-one interviews, focus groups, surveys and other techniques to conduct a full investigation of the student worker experience on campus. According to Olson, the SEEC can guarantee anonymity and job security for student workers with whom they speak.
“We want to listen to and make sure we understand student experiences. We certainly want to learn about positive experiences as well, but of course we’re interested in looking at where there are areas that we might improve on, create more coherence, clarify or strengthen things where they need to be strengthened,” Olson said. “We’re committing to doing this in a way that’s transparent, in a way that is as comprehensive as we can be and a way that’s focused on solutions.”
Students on the SEEC will include members from GUSA and represent various groups of student workers. Office of the Student Worker Advocate Founding Director Julia Hubbell (COL ’15) started OSWA as part of GUSA in November to address the concerns of student workers. Hubbell said that the SEEC will create a necessary connection between students and administrators to bring about change.
“We [OSWA] spent a semester really engaging with students, talking to them and really hearing about their day-to-day experiences,” Hubbell said. “A lot of the time, when problems would come up, we had very little executive power or ability to change the experience or to work with the student. Obviously, that has to come to the university. What we’re really excited about is how the university is taking this seriously and is working with us and has formed a committee so quickly to help take these problems on.”
In the months before the SEEC releases its report, GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said that GUSA and the administration will work to enact certain changes more quickly.
“This in no way indicates that this is the only step that’s being taken to ensure that there’s the best employment experience for students,” Tezel said. “As the committee is working, through GUSA and through OSWA and other means, we’re going to continue to identify along the way the things that we can be doing right now in order to address, specifically, communications issues, clarification on student-worker rights and all that works on going in addition to the report and recommendations that will be released by this committee.”
Olson said that through the SEEC and rolling reforms, Georgetown can provide a more supportive and positive student-worker experience.
“What we want and what we, certainly, have always wanted — we just need to renew our vows and take a fresh look at,” Olson said, “is for the experience of being a student employee and worker here at Georgetown is one that involves a sense of support, a sense of clarity about the role, an opportunity for learning and developing new skills and capabilities, a sense of feeling at home, feeling welcomed, feeling supported and respected in the work environment and a place that’s a positive part of the overall experience of being a Georgetown student.”

A Georgetown University Law Center student filed a lawsuit against Georgetown University on Tuesday, in response to the university’s employment of Rabbi Barry Freundel, who was arrested for voyeurism on Oct. 14.
Freundel, who faces six charges of voyeurism for recording devices in women’s private baths at the Kesher Israel Orthodox synagogue in Georgetown, is accused by the suit of luring the unnamed third-year law student to the bath. The suit names the rabbi, the synagogue and Georgetown University as defendants, charging Georgetown with improperly vetting the rabbi before hiring him.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh declined to comment on the litigation but expressed the university’s horror at the allegations against Freundel and its willingness to respond to the situation.
“We are horrified by the behavior reported to have taken place at the mikvah,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The university is cooperating fully with law enforcement activities, as well as conducting our own investigation of Rabbi Freundel’s conduct.”
Freundel had served as an adjunct professor at the law center, teaching a course on Jewish law since the early 1990s. He last co-taught a seminar in the spring of 2014.
The lawsuit alleges that Georgetown “undertook no investigation into Freundel’s background prior to hiring him,” and aims to implicate the university in “willful blindness.” Steven Silverman, the attorney who filed the suit, could not be reached for comment.
In addition to the lawsuit, Freundel faces six criminal charges of voyeurism to which he pled not guilty in October. Freundel will face a D.C. Superior Court hearing Jan. 16.

University President John J. DeGioia met with GU Fossil Free last Tuesday to discuss the fossil fuel divestment proposal and inform them that the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility will vote on their proposal in January 2015.
The vote was originally scheduled to take place at the end of the academic year, but DeGioia met with CISR Chair and Associate Dean for Transnational Programs Jim Feinerman to encourage an earlier vote.
“CISR originally didn’t tell us a vote date when we met in October, but did indicate it would be in the distant future,” GU Fossil Free member Chloe Lazarus (COL ’16) wrote in an email. “We feel the change in the vote date has to do with the positive involvement of President DeGioia on our proposal and this environmental and moral issue.”
If CISR votes in favor of the proposal, it will be sent to the university’s board of directors for approval. GU Fossil Free members hope to see the vote on the board’s agenda in February of 2015.
CISR is made up of 12 members: four students, three professors and five university administrators. The group votes on written proposals from Georgetown community members and makes recommendations on socially responsible investment to the university board of directors.
According to GU Fossil Free and CISR member Caroline James (COL ’16), who attended the meeting, DeGioia expressed support for the initiative.
“From DeGioia, I get the sense that he is very interested, very aware of both the urgency of the issue and also of it as it pertains to a nationwide issue among universities,” James said. “I think that he thinks it is very much the right thing to do.”
Lazarus said that DeGioia seemed interested and engaged during the meeting.
“We are very thankful to President DeGioia for taking the time to meet with us. We all share the same goals of environmental justice and combating climate change not only through initiatives on campus, but also in the larger movement,” Lazarus wrote in an email. “We appreciate the positive feedback we received from President DeGioia about our proposal and campaign.”
However, James said that she expects CISR to vote against the proposal in January.
“What I predict will happen right now is that CISR will vote ‘no.’ I think out of cautiousness,” James said. “I think that it’s possible to say that [DeGioia] and CISR as a whole are very cautious of what divestment would do to the endowment and think that the better solution is inaction for now.”
The proposal calls for divestment from about 200 fossil fuel companies from the endowment, which make up approximately 8 to 10 percent of the fund. Since many of these companies are in mutual funds with Georgetown, the university would have to divest from entire funds, which would likely take out more than 8 to 10 percent of the total endowment investments.
“I think that [DeGioia] also is very much aware about his fiduciary responsibilities to the endowment,” James said.
DeGioia has averted several divestment attempts in the past. When DeGioia was the dean of student affairs in 1986, a group of students organized prolonged demonstrations on the White Gravenor patio calling for the university to divest from businesses operating in apartheid-era South Africa. As there was no free speech policy, DeGioia called in police to forcibly disperse the protesters, resulting in 35 arrests. CISR was established in the aftermath of the apartheid divestment protests.
According to a statement released by DeGioia’s Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara (GRD ’96) after the meeting Tuesday, DeGioia acknowledged GU Fossil Free’s efforts in getting CISR to vote on the proposal.
“It was a great meeting. President DeGioia commended GU Fossil Free on their hard work on this issue,” Ferrara wrote. “He indicated that he was aware that GU Fossil Free had had an opportunity to engage with [CISR] and that this process was ongoing.”
Ferrara also said that DeGioia anticipates further productive discussions with GU Fossil Free, which will occur after the vote from CISR in January.
“One topic of conversation was the best and most appropriate way to engage with the board of directors on the topic of fossil fuels,” Ferrara added. “We are considering those options and look forward to those discussions.”

After the November midterm elections left the Republican Party firmly in control of both the House and the Senate, the change in power could halt the unionization of adjunct professors around the country, despite a breakthrough year for union advocates in the District.
Following the unionization of adjunct professors at Georgetown University in 2013, at The George Washington University in 2006 and American University in 2010, Howard University and the University of the District of Columbia are currently negotiating their contracts with adjunct professors to improve their work experience, while professors are also organizing at the Catholic University of America and Trinity University of Washington.
To support the District-wide movement, union organizers working for the D.C. branch of the Services Employees International Union, SEIU Local 500, which represents 2,400 adjunct professors at universities in Maryland and D.C., including the professors at Georgetown, discussed plans this year to create a contract that encompasses all the universities in the District. If the plans come to fruition, Washington, D.C., would be the first city to have such an approach.
However, SEIU Vice President for Higher Education Kip Lornell, who is also an adjunct professor of music at GWU, said that the recent transition of power in Congress could hinder these efforts, due to the GOP’s general wariness of unions.
“I think the rhetoric will be that unions are costing jobs, unions are costing money,” he said.
Lornell predicted that progress around the country, particularly at public state schools, would stall in the future, particularly because of university funding cuts.
“I think probably that part-time faculty members at state schools are less likely to be unionized because what has happened at most state schools is the continued decrease in funding, which is why tuitions in state and out of state continue to go up and even though the part-time faculty there save universities money, there may be more of a cry for full-time faculty to teach more classes and not rehire part-time professors,” he said.
The issues surrounding adjunct professors received increased national attention this year when Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) (SFS ’66, LAW ’69) introduced a bill earlier this year to assist adjuncts with loan forgiveness plans. While Republican control of Congress will likely lead to little movement on such measures, Lornell did not anticipate that Congress would directly target adjunct professors.
“I don’t think adjuncts are looking toward Congress, I think the idea there would be to just leave us alone to unionize as we are able to do by law and I really don’t see Congress meddling in that change at all,” Lornell said.
Despite cries for federal support of the adjunct unionization movement and Durbin’s bill, Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president for government relations and public affairs for the American Council on Education, released a statement earlier this week opposing such intervention in the relationship between universities and adjunct professors.
“Colleges — like all employers — are already subject to extensive labor law regarding the treatment of employees, and I doubt that new federal regulations focused specifically on adjunct faculty are necessary or desirable,” he wrote.
SEIU Political Director Anne McLeer disagreed, stating that government intervention could help facilitate change.
“I am all for the government being more involved in how colleges are run and I think that the government, not that this is going to happen, should look at where people’s tuition dollars are being spent because they’re not being spent on instruction. They’re being spent on executive salaries, bloated administrations,” she said.
Lornell added that universities save money by hiring part-time professors. According to the 2013-14 American Association of University Professors survey, the average salary of an assistant professor at Georgetown is $101,200, compared to $177,900 for full professors.
In spite of the bleak outlook for the future of unionization, adjunct professors have won victories, such as the success of adjunct professors at Georgetown in negotiating a contract with the university. The experience sets Georgetown apart from other Jesuit institutions that object to the unionization of adjuncts based on a religious exemption to the National Labor Relations Board.
“I think a significant accomplishment was our ratification of a contract at Georgetown,” McLeer said. “Georgetown stands out as a model for collaboration with their faculty for, first of all, not opposing the organizing to begin with and in collaboration with the adjuncts, negotiating a really good contract.”
Lornell also praised the high salaries of Georgetown adjunct professors. While Georgetown assistant professors earn $101,200 on average, the average salary at GWU was $87,500.
“You can be sure that Georgetown salaries are level one AAUP salaries — that is the top level for salaries for full-time faculty,” he said.

Georgetown launched a new website for the Office of Global Engagement on Nov. 24, highlighting the university’s involvement with initiatives around the world and providing information about research, study abroad and other opportunities.
According to a statement from University President John J. DeGioia in a video on the new website, the site exemplifies Georgetown’s mission to grapple with global issues as well as question what it means to be a “global university.” The university hosts over 2,000 international graduate and undergraduate students from 130 countries and counts over 400 international scholars among its faculty.
“Georgetown University has been engaging this question, living this question, as we reimagine our mission for the present day,” DeGioia said.
Vice President for Global Engagement Thomas Banchoff wrote in an email to The Hoya that the website is designed as a way to organize the international engagement activities across the nine schools within the university, adding that the website uniquely synthesizes the information.
“It is designed not to duplicate what is on the websites of Georgetown’s schools and programs, but to point users to them,” he wrote.
One of the more notable features of the website is an interactive map that allows users to explore international activities across 7 regions and 135 countries. Office of Global Engagement Communications Manager Sarah Rutherford described the map in more detail as a way for students to receive more information about their international prospects, listing fellowship, scholarship, study abroad and even extracurricular opportunities available through Georgetown in the area.
“Let’s say you’re particularly interested in the Middle East, or maybe Jordan within that region. You’ll be able to use the map to search for study abroad programs or maybe academic offerings or faculty research in that particular country or that particular region,” she said.
In addition to the exploration of university programs, the website also includes a word cloud that allows users to explore Georgetown’s offerings on a variety of global issues.
“So if you’re interested in human rights or inter-religious dialogue or peace and security or any of these twenty global issues, you’re able to navigate throughout that word cloud to find different activities or programs or faculty members that relate to that issue,” Rutherford said.
She emphasized the website’s ability to provide information to both students and the wider community of people interested in Georgetown.
“It’s both an internal and an external audience. Externally, perspective students who want to learn about Georgetown’s global profile or global programs to use the site to get that information. Internally, students, faculty and staff can use the website in order to share information about ongoing international activities and they can also think about ways to collaborate on current projects or room for development on projects and international activities in the future,” Rutherford said.
Banchoff, who also serves as Berkley Center Director, was appointed as the university’s first Vice President of Student Engagement in June 2013 to work with faculty members and other leaders in the university to strengthen Georgetown’s partnerships around the world and improve opportunities for research and outreach.
Rutherford explained that the website and, by extension, the department showcase Georgetown’s identity as a global university.
“It highlights our academic excellence, our international reach, our Washington D.C location and the advantages that come from that as well as our Catholic and Jesuit identity,” she said.

Professor Daniel Nexon discussed the link between various forms of popular culture and politics in “The Hunger Games” trilogy Wednesday afternoon at the Mortara Center.
Nexon began his talk by examining the historical instances in which entertainment meshed with government. He said that popular films and books have shaped the political discussion for large audiences, and he gave examples such as the connection of “Star Trek” to NASA as well as the link between popular television show “24” and enhanced interrogation techniques used against suspected terrorists.
“There’s long been a general interest, I think, in the relationship between popular culture and politics,” Nexon said. “Exposure to certain ideas in popular culture might then condition our understanding and ethics about the way the world works.”
Nexon said that the most powerful genre for these sorts of connections is science fiction.
“In science fiction there is a tremendous emphasis on constructing worlds and giving them truthiness or verisimilitude,” he said.“They pretend to be real and therefore they have to work out their own rules, their own logic.”
Nexon then turned from the history of how popular culture influenced politics to what he said is a current example, “The Hunger Games” by Suzanne Collins. According to Nexon, because the influence of “The Hunger Games” has extended to real-world politics, it cannot be classified simply as an interesting story
“People are using the solidarity gesture [from]‘The Hunger Games’ as a way of expressing their political aspirations,” he said.“We see some really interesting examples of this in the Thai protest and Hong Kong protest.”
The politics of the tyrannical Panem, the fictional setting of “The Hunger Games,” have many parallels to the real world and follow similar patterns of current regimes that restrict free speech, according to Nexon. Specifically, Nexon likened Panem to the People’s Republic of China, a country infamous for violations of human rights.
“This is a very classic imperial strategy and it works in empires the same way that it works in Panem,” Nexon said. “When you keep [people] isolated, when you don’t give them very significant glimpses into one another’s lives and you don’t let them communicate with one another, it makes it very easy to contain unrest.”
“The Hunger Games” also provides a good representation of historical trauma and the difficulty it takes countries to move past it, according to Nexon. Prior to the timeline in the movies and books, Panem was torn apart during a period known as the Dark Days. They had a lasting effect that continued to dog society when “The Hunger Games” begins.
“Panem is trapped in re-inflicting the same trauma over and over and over again and picking at the wound,” Nexon said. “How does it do that? It does it through the Hunger Games.”
Nexon said he saw the theme of politics of trauma as being representative of the human condition in general. He examined a scene in “The Hunger Games”in which the protagonist is forced to explain to children that they are standing on the graves of other citizens from District 12. Nexon said he found this scene particularly moving.
“We all play and operate on the graveyards of the past and on the graveyards of past atrocities,” Nexon said.“Like Panem, we need to figure out for ourselves how we reconcile to that fact.”
Nexon also discussed the link between “The Hunger Games” and the popularity of reality television shows. He said that they are similar because in both, entertainment comes from laughing at or making fun of the suffering of others.
“The broader issue of course is one about voyeurism, particularly the voyeurism of pain and suffering,” Nexon said.“The way that a lot of reality television shows work [is] by essentially putting us in the position of voyeurs.”
Nexon was introduced by Director of the Mortara Center for International Studies Kathleen McNamara, who said that symbols can play an important part in political messages. She said that the use of symbolism from the “The Hunger Games” in real life political movements shows a connection between the book and current issues some countries face daily.
“The point is that the symbols are actually doing potentially a lot of work in rearranging political coalitions,” McNamara said. “[They’re] reshaping the way that people think about their preferences and the potential possibilities of politics.”
Zachary Burdette (SFS ’17), who attended the event, said he did not see the parallel between media and “The Hunger Games” as unique.
“I think in a sense that a lot of people get a masochistic voyeurism from a lot of different things in life,” he said.“Being aware that there are systems of oppression that you aren’t actively challenging has the same kind of effect.”
Jesse Reiff (SFS ’17) said he has renewed interest in the movie after hearing Nexon explain its relationship to politics.
“I want to rewatch ‘Hunger Games’ to reexamine the themes discussed,” Reiff said.

British journalist and author Austen Ivereigh spoke about Pope Francis’s rise to the papacy and read from his biography Francis, titled “The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope” Wednesday night. The event, which was cosponsored by the Berkley Center and the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life took place in the Intercultural Center Auditorium to around 150 people.
Ivereigh spoke about the Francis’s rise in the Catholic Church and about the type of change that the Church needs to stay relevant in a divisive world.
“Here is a man who had actually dedicated his life intellectually to one thing really—if you can boil it down—which is the spiritual discernment of how institutions and bodies are united and why sometimes they can end up in division and schism,” Ivereigh said. “I began to realize…this actually is his life’s work.”
Ivereigh said that the creation of conservative and liberal factions within the Catholic Church following the Second Vatican Council has led to false reforms of the 2,000 year old institution.
“False reform is driven by ideas in self-imposed groups, distanced from the ordinary faithful,” Ivereigh said.
Francis, on the other hand, has recognized that the Church needs to become more true to itself and focus on ordinary people and the poor, according to Ivereigh.
Ivereigh also used the talk to clear up the controversy surrounding a misleading passage in his biography in which he suggests that Francis lobbied cardinals for their vote prior to the 2013 conclave, an act which is strictly illegal. The Holy See Press officially denied any collusion earlier this week.
“They had learned their lessons from 2005. They first secured Bergoglio’s assent,” Ivereigh wrote on page 355 of his book, referring to a number of cardinals who supported Bergoglio.
“No such deal as it were took place. And I am happy to make that clarification,” Ivereigh said.
Journalist and Georgetown Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs Senior Fellow Paul Elie moderated a discussion with Ivereigh following his talk.
One of the main talking points during the moderated conversation was the role of Francis’s Jesuit roots in his papacy, especially his use of the Ignatian idea of discernment or perceiving God’s desire in a particular situation.
“Francis is convinced… that a process of genuine discernment happens when you are willing and able to live in the tension between two things that seem humanly incapable of reconciliation,” Ivereigh said.
Ivereigh answered a handful of questions from the audience following his talk and moderated discussion. Question topics ranged from women in the Catholic Church to the tension between conservative and liberal forces in Vatican politics.
Gregory Cleva, a volunteer in the Ignatian Volunteer Corps who is assigned to Georgetown’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, said he attended the talk because he has always had an interest in Pope Francis.
 “I’ve always been confused as to how to define Pope Francis and his point that he’s not a conservative or liberal but a radical in the sense of gospel living and that he approaches any ideology–whether it’s liberal or conservative–that gets in the way of gospel living and gospel thinking. So this [talk] resonated completely with me,”Cleva said.
Bennett Stehr (SFS ‘18) attended the event to come to a deeper understanding of Pope Francis.
“I am Catholic, but… I’m really questioning my faith,” Stehr said. “So I have faith in and a lot of hope in Pope Francis as a new directional leader. And so I heard [Ivereigh] was talking about Pope Francis, and I heard how he is an expert on him. And so that’s why I wanted to come out and just hear what he had to say.”

The Hoya has transitioned to a new editorial and publishing staff for spring 2015. The new staff, who began their terms Nov. 22, after selections on Nov. 15, 16 and 20, produced their first print issue today.
Former executive editor Mallika Sen (SFS ’16) begins a yearlong term as the 141st editor-in-chief of The Hoya, taking over from Emma Hinchliffe (COL ’15).
Carolyn Maguire (COL ’16), who served as sports editor last spring, is now executive editor.
“As a former sports editor, I did not follow the traditional executive editor trajectory. But I believe this is one of my greatest strengths. I am excited to bring my unique background to the position,” Maguire said.
Former two-term photography editor Alexander Brown (COL ’16), will serve as managing editor once he returns from abroad. In the meantime, fall 2014 managing editor Robert DePaolo (COL ’16) will serve as interim managing editor.
Former Guide Editor Jess Kelham-Hohler (COL ’17) has become The Hoya’s fourth online editor, taking the mantle from Ian Tice (COL ’16).
“One of the great things about working on The Guide was having the opportunity to develop new ideas. The Hoya’s online platform is still evolving and I’m excited to be a part of that process,” Kelham-Hohler said.
On the publishing side, former Director of Sales Brian Carden (MSB ’16) takes over for a yearlong term as General Manager, following Michal Grabias (MSB ’15).
“I look forward to maximizing The Hoya’s capabilities as a business and engaging with the campus community and beyond,” Carden said.
Chair of the Board of Directors Sheena Karkal (COL ’15) will continue to serve her yearlong term, which concludes in April.

ArtsAction D.C., a new coalition pioneered by D.C. Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large), aims to promote the growth, funding and support of arts in the District and provide a forum for collaboration among art-focused institutions.
Grosso started the AADC coalition because he saw a need for more stable arts funding in the city.
“I saw it as a way to bring people together to have a blunt conversation about what they needed, but also to be a group that would come up with solutions that could be implemented,” he wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Development of the project began in spring 2014 and has since brought together 50 already existing organizations into the coalition, including Dupont Underground, the Humanities Council of Washington, the Shakespeare Theater and Washington Performing Arts.
The coalition of the various organizations aims to establish a “comprehensive, intelligent and progressive strategy” to advocate for funding and integrate support for the arts into the District’s economic development strategy, according to its mission statement.
AADC Research Committee Chair Sam Sweet noted the inclusiveness of the diverse organizations as the coalition’s major asset.
“We are inclusive, creative, proactive, generous and unified in working together to advance the common goal of critical support for the arts and the creative economy,” he wrote.
The coalition includes both smaller start-ups and more established institutions. Washington Performing Arts President and CEO Jenny Bilfield credited the organization with voicing the variety of opinions and noted that the large number of included parties allow the coalition to have a real influence on the city.
“Although we vary in scale, our collective impact is significant. Not only upon the artists and audiences who live here, but also upon the businesses that derive revenue from the work we do,” she wrote. “ArtsAction D.C. gives voice to the collective value and impact of the arts.” “The concerted effort of so many organizations — 50 and counting— around the recent election gives us a voice at the table … as a voting group, as a tax base and as a major economic driver within D.C.”
Dupont Underground, one of the organizations involved, was created with the goal of revitalizing the abandoned trolley station under Dupont Circle for producing and presenting arts and creative endeavors. Dupont Underground Managing Director Braulio Agnese explained his organization’s involvement in the coalition as inevitable.
“The Dupont Underground was created to foster arts and design, so our support for AADC was a no-brainer,” he wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Commitment to the belief that the arts and culture should be a greater priority for the D.C. government.”
Although AADC is a new initiative, Agnese expected it to gain a strong following and really impact the arts, crediting Grosso for his vision in leading the organization.
“Councilmember Grosso has a clear passion for the issue, so I expect that as long as he’s in office, the AADC will be around,” Agnese wrote. “Hopefully the coalition will get to a point where it can maintain itself beyond Grosso’s time on the D.C. Council.”
As AADC is such a new program, the specific effect that it will have on the Georgetown community is unclear. However, Grosso was eager to include the input of universities in his effort to promote art in the District.
“We are hoping that the city will develop a cultural plan that reflects what each neighborhood wants, [and] I think that Georgetown and its students will have input in that study because they often stay to live and work in DC even after they have graduated,” Grosso wrote. “The consortium of universities in the District is a great resource for studying our city’s economics and creative economy.”
Grosso added that he hopes the creation of the AADC will spark a stronger advocacy for the arts in the city with a focus on the concrete economic contributions made by art to the District.
“I hope it stands out rather than fits in,” he wrote. “My hope is this group is thinking differently about how we can approach supporting the creative community and economy so we are no longer just talking about making it better, but instead offering concrete solutions.”
Introduction to Drawing student Place Wilson (COL ’18) was excited for the creation of the AADC and its advocacy of art.
“Art is important in our society because it is a forum for expressionism that sometimes is stifled in other areas of academia,” she said.

In the six days leading up to Thanksgiving break, the staff at O’Donovan Hall were forced to serve food with paper and plastic utensils, plates, cups and bowls because of a breakdown of the dishwashers.
Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Business Services Joelle Wiese attributed the breakdown to a malfunction in the dishwasher’s water level sensor.
“The water level sensor reached the end of its life and caused the dishwasher to shut down,” Wiese said.
Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18), a student member of the Georgetown University Student Association Dining Committee, said that the remaining dishwasher was not adequately heating the water to clean the dishes.
According to the D.C. Health Regulations and Licensing Administration, operating a dining establishment with a dishwasher that does not reach a high enough final rinse temperature is a critical health code violation.
In 2009, an inspection of Epicurean & Co. found that they were in violation of this code. Had the restaurant not immediately corrected the problem, it would have faced automatic closure.
Because both machines were out of service, Leo’s utilized a backup supply of paper and plastic utensils that is kept for emergencies.
Wiese did not specify the cost, but said that the repair of the dishwashers was inexpensive. Paper and plastic dining supplies were taken from storage and did not cost Leo’s any additional money.
“We sourced the parts and the in-house engineer at Leo’s was able to repair the unit,” she said. “The cost was minimal.”
The machines were fixed by the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, with Leo’s returning to standard operation on the same day.
A dishwasher normally lasts between 15 to 20 years. Wiese said that measures exist to prevent dishwasher malfunctions from happening in the future.
“The sensors, like other parts on the machine, wear out with use,” Wiese said. “There is a preventative maintenance program in place, though it is hard to determine when these kinds of items will finally give out.”
Shinbrot said that while it was certainly an inconvenience, Leo’s staff did the best they could to accommodate the students.
“It would have been nicer to have it fixed sooner, absolutely,” Shinbrot said. “But Leo’s did the next best thing, and I think we should commend them for that.”
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) noted the potentially harmful environmental impact of the dishwasher malfunction.
“I personally didn’t mind using disposable plates, but I wish they had chosen a more sustainable alternative than Styrofoam,” Goldstein said. “It’s unfortunate that the incident happened at such a busy time. … I’m sure Leo’s management was doing their best to get the dishwasher fixed as quickly as possible.”

The Georgetown University Italian Research Institute and the Embassy of Italy hosted Adam Riess, the 2011 Nobel laureate in physics and astronomy, and Massimo Stiavelli, the James Webb Space Telescope mission head, the James Webb Space Telescope mission head, in a discussion on astronomy as part of the celebration of the 450th anniversary of Galileo’s birth on Tuesday.
The discussion, titled “Galileo: The Exploration of the Universe,” was part of a series of activities in celebration of Galileo in D.C. Physics professor and Joseph Semmes Ives Chair in Physics Peter Olmsted moderated the event.
Director of the Italian Research Institute Sara Hager opened the discussion with remarks about Galileo’s outstanding achievements.
“During his turbulent yet very productive life, Galileo’s discoveries, with the help of his telescope, and his strong belief in the Copernican heliocentric view of the universe, began a revolution which shaped modern astronomy,” Hager said.
Riess, who delivered a talk entitled “Using Telescopes to see Dark Energy”, described how his team discovered the acceleration of the universe, which was identified by NASA as the greatest achievement by the Hubble telescope to date.
“Over the last decade, this measurement has been confirmed in at least eight different independent ways, different ways that we have of measuring the universe,” Riess said.
However, Riess said that understanding the nature of dark energy is still one of the greatest challenges faced by physicists today.
“We did win the Nobel Prize, in 2011, and that was a lot of fun, but behind this there is a much darker concern,” Riess said. “We know that the universe is accelerating, but we don’t really understand the quantum underpinnings of gravity.”
Riess also acknowledged the difficulty in understanding black holes and the vastness of the universe.
“If you are an optimist, you are probably very impressed at this point, as we have discovered the recipe of the universe,” Riess said.“If you are a pessimist, you will say that most of the universe is made up of stuff that we don’t understand yet.”
Stiavelli, who delivered a keynote titled “Then and Now: The Evolution of Astronomy Since the Time of Galileo,” contrasted the differences in the basic understanding of astronomy between Galileo’s time and now.
Hager said that Galileo’s discoveries have continued to inspire modern physicists, such as Riess and Stiavelli.
“His legacy lives on, as exemplified by tonight’s guest speakers, two leading physicists and innovators,” Hager said. “Both have gone beyond Galileo’s explorations and continued to explore the immensity and the unknown forces that govern the universe,The mysterious and fascinating world of galaxies, planets, supernovae, black holes and dark energy. When we ponder on the vastness of the universe, the findings and the discoveries of leading astronomers never cease to amaze us. We are simply spellbound.”
Georgetown College Dean Chester Gillis attributed the work of both physicists to the advancement of modern science.
“They are among a select group of scientists who dare to venture in an ambitious and challenging journey into our expanding universe and reveal to us the very complex forces that govern our universe, such as dark matter,” Gillis said. “Their curiosity and research have contributed to the advancement of science, enabling us to begin to grasp the mysteries of nature and of the universe itself.”
Deputy Chief of Mission at the Embassy of Italy Luca Franchetti Pardo also noted the physicists’ contributions.
“These distinguished scientists have inspired us with their contributions, and we look forward to continue to follow their scholarly enterprises, which continue to enhance the world of science, and provide many advancements in the knowledge of the universe,” Franchetti said.
