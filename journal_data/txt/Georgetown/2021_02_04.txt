Georgetown University will punish first and second-year medical students who received COVID-19 vaccines despite being ineligible.
Currently, only third and fourth-year students who interact with patients in the health care setting qualify to receive vaccines as a “health care worker,” which is one of the categories now eligible to get a vaccine in Washington, D.C. Vaccines are being administered through providers authorized by the District of Columbia Department of Health. Neither Georgetown nor MedStar Health authorized the vaccination for the first and second-year students who were not working in a health care setting, according to a university spokesperson. The university did not release information on where or how many ineligible medical students received vaccinations.
The ineligible medical students who received vaccinations  broke with Georgetown’s moral standards, according to a university spokesperson.
“These actions run contrary to Georgetown’s values as a Jesuit institution, teaching our students to be in service to others,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The School of Medicine takes violations of professionalism extremely seriously and will be taking appropriate action as outlined in its Code of Professionalism in the Student Handbook.”
For students enrolled in professional doctoral programs, an adjudication committee can  recommend sanctioning actions if a student is found responsible for professional misconduct to the dean of the student’s program, according to the graduate student bulletin.
The disciplinary actions from the university are, in part, meant to discourage other students from receiving vaccines who are not yet eligible, according to Karli Gilbert (GRD ’23), treasurer of Georgetown’s Medical Center Graduate Student Organization.
“I believe that the university’s decision to discipline the students is partially to send a strong warning message against any other students, medical or otherwise, who may be inspired to receive the vaccine themselves prior to their time of eligibility,” Gilbert wrote in an email to The Hoya.
An anonymous letter written by a medical student that was addressed to Georgetown urges the university to carefully consider the actions taken by the first and second-year medical students who received the vaccine while ineligible. The university must also examine the access to resources and health care in D.C. that caused this issue to occur in the first place, according to the letter.
“Now, the first and second year student bodies are divided on how to proceed after this blatant disregard for professionalism, with many calling for leniency, and again I am at a loss that the high standards for our profession are being impugned by medical students who have decidedly pursued their own interests,” the letter reads.
The situation of first and second-year students who were ineligible receiving vaccines suggests that a broader issue with vaccine distribution at the medical center exists, according to Gilbert.
“The fact that our medical students felt compelled to receive a vaccination not yet meant for them may hint at a larger systemic issue at GUMC,” Gilbert wrote. “If our students were receiving adequate support and safety mechanisms instituted by Georgetown to feel safe during this pandemic, then the flawed vaccine distribution method may not have been challenged in the first place.”
Despite actions that the university has taken to bar ineligible students from receiving the vaccine in the future, Georgetown urges anyone who is currently eligible to receive the vaccine to pursue receiving one, according to Provost Robert Groves.
“We urge any member of the Georgetown community who is eligible to be vaccinated to take advantage of vaccination opportunities provided through your healthcare provider, or state or local government,” Groves wrote.

I understand the university’s position regarding these students’ moral and ethical lapse. But now that they are immunized, they can “volunteer” to work administering the vaccine.
What upsets me is the anonymous letter. I keep hearing stories about people everywhere turning in neighbors, classmates, teammates, or anyone for “COVID violations”. Are we becoming East Germany or like the chivas in Cuba where this type of action is encouraged? I’m sure there was a better way to address this. Everyone just needs to be respectful of others.
Also, I think Georgetown needs to get 15-20,000 vaccine doses, immunize students, faculty, and staff ASAP and get everyone back to campus. I would support a fund for that.

Several downtown Washington, D.C. storefronts remain boarded with plywood as businesses struggle amid the COVID-19 pandemic and continued political unrest.
Businesses began putting up boards prior to the Nov. 7 election in anticipation of possible protests and disruption, the majority of which were removed after minimal demonstration activity. Businesses replaced boards in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the United States Capitol.
Boarded-up storefronts have only added to the financial stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Bruce Klores, who owns GCDC Grilled Cheese Bar, a fast-casual restaurant on Pennsylvania Avenue.
“COVID was practically a death knell for lots and lots of particularly small restaurant businesses,” Klores said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “There’s not a single restaurant that’s doing anywhere near the amount of sales that they’re doing the year before. We’re off probably 75%. Many, many restaurants have closed.”
Numerous M Street storefronts, including the America Eats Tavern, Le Pain Quotidien and Peet’s Coffee, have closed since the start of the pandemic.
Downtown businesses, which faced the brunt of the impact because of their close proximity to the White House and the Capitol, have had to adapt quickly in order to stay afloat, according to Klores. 
“Their client base is gone. No tourists, no office workers,” Klores said. “They’re all gone. That’s like there’s been an atomic bomb that has been dropped on our neighborhood.”
Pandemic-related struggles were further compounded by a lack of communication from city leadership during last month’s unrest, according to Elliot Spaisman, founder of Astro Doughnuts and Fried Chicken, a grab-and-go restaurant on G Street.
“With all the different forms of protest, that really hurts the business,” Spaisman said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “During inauguration, streets were closed pretty much for 10 days, but they weren’t really telling us where they were closed until they were finally closed and nobody could get down here. The same thing happened this summer, this fall. We’re always the last to know, and it’s hard to run a business that way.”
As businesses struggle to keep their doors open, many have covered their windows with plywood boards. While business owners and landlords originally boarded up their stores to protect their storefronts from potential threats of violence during the election and inauguration, the cost to take the boards down quickly became another burden, especially for stores that permanently shut down, according to Spaisman.
“Most of the stores I see with boards are temporarily or permanently closed,” Spaisman said. “And that logic, I get it, because they don’t know what’s coming next month or next week. Why keep taking them up and down if they’re not even open?”
After the insurrection at the Capitol, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) urged the city to reopen. 
“DC, let go of your boards. If you know a business that still has boards up, please remind them to pull them down,” Bowser wrote in a Jan. 27 tweet.
Stores that are keeping their boards up may be damaging the city’s economy more, according to Spaisman.
“Having your neighborhoods boarded up, it just doesn’t draw people around,” Spaisman said. “When businesses around you are open, the area becomes more vibrant. When boards are up, it’s just not welcoming for the city. I hope everyone listens and thinks about [Mayor Bowser’s tweet] and does it.” 
The city’s leadership has attempted to assist businesses throughout the pandemic and political unrest, according to Klores. Efforts have included modifying zoning laws to allow for more seating outside, providing funding programs to give small businesses and restaurants money for outdoor dining equipment and allowing restaurants to serve to-go alcohol.
In order to expedite the removal of boards, the city should consider subsidizing the removal process, according to Spaisman.
“When you put the boards up, they’re not as easy to come down,” Spaisman said. “If a business closes and doesn’t want to take them down for that reason, either temporarily or permanently, if the D.C. government wants them down, they should absolutely take them down.”
Despite the lingering boards, D.C. is moving in the right direction, according to Klores.
“North of the White House, there’s still some boarded-up stuff, but it’s been much, much better,” Klores said. “There’s been a really nice, refreshing air of calm since the day after the inauguration. I think that in the city, we’ve learned our lesson and that we understand now to take threats seriously and create perimeters to try to keep the downtown business safer.”

After a month marked by protest, unrest and political turnover in Washington, D.C., the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E is responding to residential concerns and fears about the possibility of increased danger in the District. 
In the weeks surrounding the election and Inauguration Day, many businesses downtown and in the Georgetown community boarded up their windows, while law enforcement and the national guard filled the streets. At a Feb. 1 meeting, the first since the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol building, ANC 2E, which represents Georgetown and surrounding neighborhoods, heard from law enforcement officials on the state of security in Georgetown, surrounding neighborhoods and D.C. as a whole. 
The fallout stemming from the insurrection and smaller protests leading up to it in the months since the election have contributed to increased residents’ anxieties about safety in D.C. neighborhoods, according to Commissioner Kishan Putta. 
“Those first few Trump rallies were not that big, but then we got hit with the big one. And there were definitely protesters from that rally around in the neighborhood. There was no violence thankfully, but it has all served to create this climate of hesitancy and a little bit of fear,” Putta said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
At the meeting, which was held virtually, commissioners and residents heard Assistant U.S. Attorney Doug Klein speak about the legal progress in the Capitol riot investigations. Klein noted that 177 individuals had been arrested, with 120 cases in federal district court, and more than 50 cases in the superior court of D.C. 
With most political activity concentrated in downtown D.C., there are no immediate threats posed to Georgetown, Burleith and Hillandale, the neighborhoods represented by ANC 2E, according to Commissioner Matias Burdman (COL ’21). (Full disclosure: Burdman previously served on the Editorial Board of The Hoya.) 
“In the period leading up to and immediately following the inauguration, the ANC coordinated with MPD to ensure that proper security precautions had been taken in our neighborhood,” Burdman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In our latest ANC meeting, however, MPD did not make any indication that there is still a heightened threat of political instability or violence — in fact, in that sense things seem to mostly be returning to normal.”
Aside from the political unrest following the election, the ANC discussed reports of vandalism and hate speech that surfaced in the neighborhood last year. In May 2020, antisemitic graffiti was discovered on the grounds of Hardy Middle School in Burleith, leading to condemnation from neighborhood officials and residents. 
Despite a 29% decrease in overall crime compared to last year, the neighborhoods have seen a spike in robberies and carjackings, including two armed robberies and two armed carjackings in January, according to Assistant District Commander Brian Bray, who also spoke at the meeting. 
Emptier streets may be contributing to this uptick in crime, according to Putta.
“It has created an atmosphere of some fear,” Putta said. “With less people walking around, it makes a situation where crimes can, a criminal might find it an opportune time because there are less people out there watching.” 
Although tensions in D.C. have seemingly calmed after the insurrection, the city should stay alert, according to Putta.
“I think that is now subsiding just with time and no recent major issue and with the new administration trying to take control,” Putta said. “Our city is still dealing with it, with all the fences around the Capitol as a reminder to the rest of the city. I think that fear remains, although it’s a little bit less. But we do need to stay diligent.”

Georgetown University graduate students are calling for a tuition reduction to match the 10% tuition reduction granted to undergraduate students in an open letter sent to Georgetown University’s Board of Directors.
Tuition Equality Now, a student-led coalition, began circulating the letter Jan. 27, calling for a 5% tuition reimbursement from the fall semester, a town hall meeting with the Board of Directors by Feb. 12 and transparent communication concerning future financial aid decisions that directly affect students. 
Graduate students are paying thousands to utilize Georgetown’s resources and networks that are now unavailable or limited because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they therefore deserve the same tuition reduction as undergraduate students, the letter states. 
“Georgetown University’s decision to provide unequal discounts is unjust, indefensible, and ultimately demonstrates that the university values undergraduate students’ contributions to and role in the university’s community more than that of graduate students,” the letter reads.
As of Feb. 3, the letter has garnered over 400 signatures from students, alumni and professors who have pledged to withhold future donations and participation in alumni events if the coalition’s demands are not met. 
TEN is calling for a 5% tuition reimbursement for last semester and a 10% tuition discount for this semester after undergraduate students received a 10% discount for both semesters. The reimbursement would be a life-changing amount of money for graduate students who rely heavily on loans, according to Nicole Dan (GRD ’21), a coordinating member of TEN.
“For me, that means not having to have as much out in loans, being able to pay for rent, being able to pay for medicine, being able to pay for food,” Dan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I know that there are people who are going to be using this money to pay for therapy. I know that for some people this is like several months of food; this is like a year or two of food expenses, so this is huge.”
While undergraduate students were offered a 10% tuition discount for the fall semester, graduate students received a 5% tuition discount and the proposal of hybrid classes. However, Georgetown never implemented the hybrid system because of the severe impact of COVID-19 on the Georgetown neighborhood.
The university’s spring plan again proposes a hybrid environment with some in-person learning courses available for select graduate programs. The plan mentions the potential for creating graduate-only spaces on campus, provided that local health and safety regulations permit. The website states that this plan is tentative and may be altered under changing circumstances, depending on the course of the pandemic.
The university’s reluctance to offer an adequate tuition reduction is disruptive and harmful to international students already facing additional struggles during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Fernanda Estrada (GRD ’21).
“Without COVID it is extremely expensive for us to come, but that is our decision. We decided, we took the loan, we chose to make the investment to come here,” Estrada said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Now, there is this crisis in the middle of our program, and it becomes even more expensive for us to be here, to be in the U.S.”
In addition to inadequate tuition reduction, graduate students have not received proportionate benefits from pandemic-specific financial aid, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, according to the letter. 
The CARES Act allocated $14 billion in funding to colleges and universities to provide support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Half of each institution’s allocated funding must contribute to emergency student financial aid grants. The remaining portion can be used for other expenses that relate to campus disruptions caused directly by the pandemic. 
The university distributed a smaller portion of CARES Act grants to graduate students because they could qualify for greater amounts of aid and loans in comparison to undergraduate students, according to a university spokesperson.
“As an institution committed to cura personalis, care for the whole person, with a deep belief that we are enriched and strengthened by each and every member of this community, we are all compelled to respond and support our community through this crisis,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This crisis has impacted all of us in profound ways, and we strive to provide our graduate students, as well as the rest of our student body, with resources, from financial support, to career guidance, to mental and telehealth services.”
A tuition reduction would provide necessary relief for graduate students who are dealing with more responsibilities than usual during this semester, according to Anna Downs (GRD ’21), a TEN coordinator.
“There are so many students that are taking care of family members who are sick, taking care of children, who are having a very hard time juggling multiple tasks with childcare and school and work,” Downs said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “So I think there’s just a lot of stress that’s happening that could be alleviated with just a little more acknowledgement of the pressures and crises that graduate students are going through.”

Georgetown University faculty have called for increased action from the administration as they struggle to balance the full-time responsibilities of caring for children, conducting research and teaching courses.
Faculty members are citing caregiving concerns as a new semester starts, calling for further financial compensation and understanding from the university. After faculty members sent an October memo to the Georgetown administration detailing university failures to prioritize family care, the university expanded the GUCares dependent fund, an emergency fund that provides support ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 to full-time faculty and staff facing sudden financial loss, through June 2021. The university also convened the Family Care Working Group to tackle caregiving challenges among faculty and appointed a dependent care coordinator to help faculty navigate the university’s dependent care resources. 
Despite these new policies, many faculty members feel the university has failed to acknowledge the caregiving crisis’ impact on research and productivity, according to Brian Hochman, associate professor of English and single parent to a kindergartner.
Hochman was forced to delay his book publication by a year and a half due to his child care responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, he said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.
“The pandemic, and its cascading consequences, has put parents into situations that can only be described as nightmarish. With schools going virtual basically from the beginning, I was faced with having to teach preschool and college at the same time with no help whatsoever,” Hochman said. “There were times when my daughter was Zooming on the computer and I would take the computer from her because her classroom would end, and I would run upstairs with that same computer, open my Zoom and then teach my class in the spring, going back and forth.”
The Family Care Working Group has already had several meetings and will be meeting regularly throughout the spring semester, according to Charles DeSantis, chair of the working group. The working group was created by the Office of the Chief Operating Officer and the Faculty Senate, a body of faculty members from all three university campuses that advises the university president on relevant issues.
“The charge of the committee is to develop recommendations to help improve the support provided by the University in the context of what has been accomplished to date and the budget,” DeSantis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The working group has been focused on outlining specific goals and plans of action to help faculty and their families, according to Jennifer Whitney, associate professor of pharmacology and physiology at the Georgetown School of Medicine and a member of the working group.
“I think a lot of it is trying to figure out what the needs are, and I think more importantly is really, what can the university do to help families at this point?” Whitney said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Ultimately this is a crisis of time. Parents don’t have the time to be doing what they need to do. Somehow we need to figure out how to give them back that time. So they’ve thrown out so many possible ideas about how to get that time back.”
In addition to the formation of the working group, the university appointed Elizabeth Andrew, who has worked in the early childhood education field for over eight years, to the position of dependent care resource coordinator in the fall, where she works to assist faculty and staff in accessing resources for dependent care support.
“I like to think that I can serve as a support system and advocate for families that need some extra help. This is a living role which is growing and evolving constantly depending on the needs of our Georgetown community,” Andrew wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I do my best to listen to each family and bring those thoughts to administration in an organized and clear way to think through what the University can continue to do to support our community members during this unprecedented time.”
The university responded to the crisis and implemented helpful policies, according to Hochman, who said he was able to use the expanded dependent care support fund this fall for paid care for his daughter. However, more action is needed to address the long-term effects of productivity losses during this time, especially for non-tenured and part-time faculty, he said.
“I can imagine five, 10 years down the road, faculty still feeling this,” Hochman said. “I think the best thing Georgetown can do is understand that these effects are not going to go away when the pandemic goes away.”
With the development of the Family Cares Working Group and Andrew’s appointment as dependent care resource coordinator, the university maintains its support of faculty and staff facing caregiving challenges.
“We are incredibly grateful for the commitment of our faculty, AAPs, staff, graduate assistants and adjuncts who have gone above and beyond in their support for our community during the COVID-19 pandemic,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We remain committed to supporting our campus community through the COVID-19 pandemic and recognize the challenges faced by many in our community, including those who are responsible for serving as the caregivers of family members.”
However, faculty members will continue to face dependent care challenges until the university provides further support, according to Rebecca Riggins, an associate professor in the oncology department of the School of Medicine and the mother of a fifth-grader.
“I have failed to see empathy in general for the careful balancing act that simultaneously performing 2 full-time jobs — parent and academic — requires. Mitigating the long-term effects will require intervention on multiple levels, financial and cultural. Fixing this will take money and empathy,” Riggins wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Let’s put Cura Personalis into real practice for our faculty, especially those with dependent care responsibilities.”

Georgetown University community members have raised almost $17,000 for a university dining hall employee facing housing and food insecurity amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Dajourn Anuku (COL ’22) and Laissa Aw (NHS ’22) launched a GoFundMe fundraiser for Stacey Walton, an employee at Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall, in December 2020 with a goal of raising $8,000. Despite hesitation that the goal was too high, donations passed $8,000 within one night, according to Anuku.
“Stacey is worth every ounce and fiber of support, safety, and love both in and outside of the Georgetown community,” Anuku wrote on the GoFundMe page. 
As of Feb. 3, the fundraiser has raised $16,975 for Walton. While the donation turnout is an accomplishment, the responsibility to provide for university employees should not fall on the shoulders of Georgetown students, according to Anuku.
“It shouldn’t have to get to this point,” Anuku said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “While we were joyful about this and even eventually sharing the news with her, the fact that it even has to be this is already something troublesome.”
Since the start of the pandemic, Walton has lost her home and her dog, struggled with food insecurity and experienced a drastic pay cut, she told Anuku and Aw. 
“Not enough support, security, protection, nor love is provided to her while she’s here on campus relentlessly caring for students seeking to be fed,” Anuku wrote on the GoFundMe page.
Although Georgetown dining employees are employed by Aramark, the university’s food service provider, the university is committed to the well-being of Aramark employees, according to a university spokesperson.
“When we become aware of an Aramark employee who may be in need of assistance, we communicate with Aramark’s on-campus management team leadership so they can see if support is available through the Aramark’s Employee Assistance Program, which provides emergency funding,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Aramark’s Employee Assistance Program provides tools for employees and their families to manage COVID-related anxiety at no cost, according to Aramark’s website. Aramark also provides additional virtual health resources and paid sick leave for employees who have contracted or been exposed to COVID-19.
Georgetown community members have also raised concerns about the Redeploy Georgetown program, which was intended to protect staff members from furloughs, salary reductions and layoffs by offering voluntary semester-long public health-related jobs, but it now requires some employees to either accept new, in-person redeployment positions or take unpaid leave without benefits. 
The university has implemented a number of important health and safety measures to protect the on-campus workers, such as regular COVID-19 testing, daily symptom monitoring, mask wearing, and physical distancing, but these measures are not enough, according to GUSA Senator Leo Rassieur (COL ’23). 
“Leo’s is crowded. People aren’t wearing masks. People aren’t observing social distancing. There is a risk of getting COVID,” Rassieur said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “If you are forced to decide between working in a really unsafe environment that could put you, your family and your kids at risk versus not taking any pay at all, especially in an economy that’s not doing very well, that’s not really a choice. You’re choosing between two different kinds of very intense suffering.”
GUSA hopes the university will take measures to ensure its employees are avoiding housing and food insecurity, in addition to tightening up safety regulations so workers can stay healthy, according to Rassieur.
“We basically have just gotten started on what I think could very well be a very, very long campaign pushing for these issues,” Rassieur said. “We want to be optimistic in saying the university will find our requests to be reasonable, but we also know that change is very, very slow at Georgetown.”

The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security launched a five-part event series on advancing gender equality, which aims to expand upon and share findings from a GIWPS research report highlighting the key issues facing women currently.
The series kicked off Jan. 28 and will cover ongoing obstacles to achieving international gender equality, with monthly events scheduled throughout the spring 2021 semester. Each topic will address the GIWPS report “Beijing+25: Accelerating Progress for Women and Girls,” which was published September 2020. The report assesses the state of global gender equality 25 years after the adoption of the Beijing Declaration at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995. The declaration established objectives for female protection in areas such as education, health and violence. The report found that some issues laid out in the declaration continue to affect women today. 
The report and lecture series is not only an opportunity to highlight the mission of the Beijing Declaration and its goal to secure gender equality but also to invoke a new sense of urgency in solving pressing issues, according to GIWPS Executive Director Ambassador Melanne Verveer. 
“On the occasion of this anniversary, we wanted to review the progress women and girls had made — and there has been progress — but we still haven’t closed the equality gap,” Verveer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The report highlights best practices and ways that each of us — wherever we live and whatever we do — can be part of the solution.”
Each event in the series focuses on one of five important key levers for progress for women and girls brought up in the Beijing+25 report, according to Verveer. These five levers are challenging gender stereotypes, bridging gaps between law and practice, countering backlash to gender equality, advancing women’s leadership in politics and peacebuilding, and harnessing technology to advance gender equality.
The first event, titled “Attitude is Everything: Challenging Gender Stereotypes,” focused on the role of gender norms in society and the threat they pose to women while also highlighting successful programs that combat such norms, according to Verveer.
“We spotlighted a program based in Senegal that has been extremely effective in social change, in ending often deeply entrenched practices like child marriage or female genital cutting,” Verveer wrote.
Anisya Fritz, chair of the Georgetown Ambassadors for Women, Peace and Security, was a featured panelist at the event and said it was a success, with views from more than 1,000 people and professors planning to assign the recording in their courses. GIWPS events are attracting a global audience in over 90 countries, according to Fritz. 
Highlighting the findings of the report is crucial considering the need for continued research on gender equality to expand women’s rights, according to Jeni Klugman, the lead author of the report. 
“Despite major progress over the past 25 years in such important areas as girls’ education, legal reforms and prohibitions against intimate partner violence, there is much much more to do — and especially to expand the rights and opportunities of girls and women living in poverty and marginalized due to race and other sources of discrimination,” Klugman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While writing the report, Klugman and her team used the U.S. Women, Peace and Security Index to analyze which gender-related issues are most pressing for women in the United States today. Concerns highlighted in the report directly affect members of the Georgetown community, according to Klugman. 
“The analysis revealed several important priorities — which cut across disciplines — including legal protections, affordable childcare, and access to sexual and reproductive health,” Klugman wrote. “Some women in the Georgetown communities have faced these barriers and discrimination directly in the lives.”
The series will also examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender equality in the upcoming events, according to Verveer.
“A major theme across the events is that Covid-19 has exposed and exacerbated gender inequalities. It’s urgent that gender be a critical component of any relief and recovery efforts in addressing the consequences of COVID,” Verveer wrote. 
The next event in the series will take place Feb. 25. Verveer hopes the program will highlight that gender equality is a pressing problem that everyone should be invested in.
“It’s so important to put a spotlight on what’s working to overcome persistent obstacles and barriers. We learn from each other and lessons without borders are important lessons to learn,” Verveer wrote. “I think we are all inspired by people who are making a difference, and we will be putting a spotlight on changemakers and effective programs throughout the series.”

Georgetown University is broadening access to mental health resources to provide more support for students in the virtual environment during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In January, the university launched HoyaWell, a new telehealth resource, to meet increased demand for virtual mental health resources from students without access to campus. The new system offers virtual mental health services to students, including free, on-demand virtual counseling and up to 12 free scheduled counseling sessions for all students.
The implementation of HoyaWell demonstrates the university’s creativity in meeting students’ needs during the pandemic, according to Dr. John Wright, interim co-director of Georgetown’s Counseling and Psychiatric Services. 
“We are committed to helping Georgetown students live meaningful lives, be confident in their mental health and wellbeing, and feel supported by a community upholding the values of diversity, equity and inclusion,” Wright wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
At the start of the pandemic, the university waived all fee-for-service charges for appointments with CAPS. However, since CAPS can only serve students in the Washington, D.C. area and states where CAPS clinicians are licensed, many students did not have access to the university’s mental health services, according to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson.
“Living through a global pandemic is challenging for all of us, and we recognize the extra pressures our students are facing while balancing academic coursework, co-curricular obligations, home life and other personal challenges,” Olson wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “We encourage all of our students to take care of their mental health and wellbeing.”
In the two weeks since HoyaWell’s launch, almost 400 students have registered to use the service, according to Olson.
While HoyaWell is an encouraging step in the right direction, it is not sufficient for all students’ needs, according to Sonya Hu (COL ’22), the Georgetown University Student Association Mental Health Policy Chair.
“In a time characterized by mental health and financial stress, putting a paywall on mental health resources is misguided and prevents students, particularly low-income folks or students who are unable to discuss their mental health with their parents and must therefore independently pay for their care, from continuing to access the care that they need,” Hu wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The best way the university can support students is by facilitating conversation that de-stigmatizes mental illness and seeking help, according to Amanda Gao (NHS ’23), president of Georgetown’s Active Minds chapter, a national student organization dedicated to raising mental health awareness on college campuses.
“It’s important that the administration, deans, and professors help create a safe space for students. More collaboration with student groups to better understand our mental health needs is also very important,” Gao wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Many students at Georgetown are passionate about mental health and can understand each other’s struggles right now. It would be great to see the administration and student groups more united, and working together.”

When Whitney Maddox (GRD ’11, ’19) was not leading seminars about race and prejudice with new graduate students, hosting events for the Georgetown University Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service, or organizing student immersion trips to Jamaica, she could be found engaging with Georgetown students. 
After over a decade at Georgetown, Maddox has left the university to serve as the diversity, equity and inclusion manager at NPR, beginning Feb. 1. Maddox was selected from a group of 499 other candidates and will now be involved in running workshops across the country and engaging with employees at NPR on a personal level, according to a Jan. 8 announcement from Keith Woods, chief diversity officer at NPR.
Maddox served as the assistant director for leadership development and racial justice initiatives at the CSJ since 2017. She also received two graduate degrees from the university. Her experiences with students at Georgetown exemplified the power of conversation when working toward goals of diversity, equity and inclusion, Maddox wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“As I reflect on having been at Georgetown for over a decade, nothing has filled my cup like my time getting to know students,” Maddox wrote. “My time at Georgetown has solidified my belief that the work of DEI does not work without spending intentional time caring, listening, immersing and advocating with and for others.” 
During her time at the CSJ, Maddox facilitated conversations about race with over 800 students. She also launched the Start Talking About Race curriculum, in which she led conversations about the role of race, prejudice and privilege in participants’ lives. 
At NPR, Maddox is most looking forward to listening to the stories and experiences of  perspectives that have previously gone unheard.
“I believe it is impossible to do the work of diversity, equity and inclusion without centering the voices, needs and realities of the people within the organization, and in particular those who have been historically marginalized in society,” Maddox wrote. 
Maddox also worked with student groups at Georgetown, including the Advisory Board of Student Organizations, a group of students and faculty who oversee and facilitate the allocation of resources to student-run social justice and service activities. 
Brianna Rodgers (COL ’22), a student chair of ABSO, worked alongside Maddox over the past two years and was influenced by her energy and care. 
“She would serve as my adviser for some of the groups that I would have to advise, and we would have meetings, and the meetings would end, and then Whitney and I would sit and talk for 10 to 20 minutes,” Rodgers said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Not only talk about how it went but also catch up about how things were going in my life as well as her own life.”
In an environment where Black voices are silenced, Maddox created a space where Black students could feel inspired and empowered to express themselves, according to Rodgers. 
“A general thing that most Black people have to do, specifically Black women, when we enter a space where there aren’t a majority of other Black people, we’re expected to, like, tone it down,” Rodgers said. “We’re expected to exude a level of professionalism that means that we have to sacrifice what personality we do have. I never felt the need to because she never felt the need to.”
Maddox made students feel at ease while giving them opportunities to challenge themselves, according to Rachel Newman (NHS ’22), who worked with Maddox at the CSJ.  
“She wanted to help people, and so she constantly was giving people responsibilities and believing in them to be able to accomplish them and celebrating people’s successes,” Newman said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I think that the environment that was created was one that I’ll remember and cherish forever.”
Maddox hopes her legacy at Georgetown will be one that reminds students there is unique beauty in their identities and selves, she wrote. 
“To the Black, Indigenous and People of Color at Georgetown, you belong here,” Maddox wrote. “There are times over and over when we question if Georgetown is a place where we can be ourselves and flourish, and I understand why that question might come. But, had you not shared with me your realness, your joy and your struggle — I would not be leaving Georgetown with the boldness that I have. You made my voice loud and gave me so much to say. Be you, because I promise, you are the soul of Georgetown.”
