In a brief yet personal account of her experience immersed in Pakistani flood recovery over the summer, Morial Shah (SFS ’13) shed light on the victims’ suffering to an audience in McShain Lounge Thursday evening.
“In the last week, 250 villages – 1,400 homes – were evacuated,” she said.
Shah spoke at a panel discussion sponsored by the International Relations Club that aimed to address where Pakistan stands since floods first began to ravage the Indus Valley in July. Today, flooded areas remain in the region, a sign of political and economic tension in the South Asian nation, according to Ambassador Howard Schaffer, former diplomat, former deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia and a senior counselor in the School of Foreign Service.
“The devastation could not have happened in a worse time or in a worse place,” he said.
Schaffer highlighted the perceptions of the civilian government and the military in response to the disaster. According to him, the incompetence of the civilian government in responding to the floods has weakened support for the Asif Ali Zardari administration, and the military response has generally been more effective.
Schaffer concluded that the military wants no authority as the insurgency in the country increases in tempo. Forces would prefer to let civilians take the blame for any failures, he added.
oderated by Paula Newberg, director of Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, the panel also featured Allan Jury, director of the U.N. World Food Program’s U.S. relations office, who provided information on the ongoing humanitarian relief efforts. He emphasized that the level of response varies in different areas of the country, especially as the WFP seeks to overcome three challenges: logistics, funding and security.
“It’s a massive logistical problem,” he said. The WFP has banded with other U.N. organizations, non-governmental organizations and the Pakistani government in successfully distributing food to 6 million people. It is expected that 7 million will be reached by the end of October.
aggie Ronkin, School of Foreign Service professor and a scholar from the American Institute of Pakistan Studies, spoke on the humanitarian situation in Pakistan as a result of the flooding.
“Flood waters destroyed the health care infrastructure,” she said. Ronkin also stressed the loss of vast agricultural lands and products, the increase of petty crimes, as well as problems of sanitation, disease and a lack of access to clean water – problems that existed in some areas well before the disaster.
“Food is needed for 8.2 million,” she said. “Water is needed for 7 million.”
Ed Dunn, foreign service officer on the State Department’s Pakistan Desk, rounded off the discussion with a talk on how the United States has contributed to the relief efforts in the wide-reaching disaster. The Pakistani floods have affected more people than the 2004 tsunami, the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir and the 2010 Haiti earthquake combined, according to Dunn.
Twenty-eight U.S. military helicopters as well as a number of civilian helicopters are currently carrying out the relief efforts. The U.S. government has also been working with private enterprises as well as on-the-ground contributors from Japan, China and the United Arab Emirates. Nevertheless, Dunn stressed the need for boosted coordination.
“It is still ongoing,” he said. “We’re still doing emergency relief.”
Engaging with audience members, the panelists emphasized the need for donations and better coverage to narrow the trust deficit that Pakistanis have for Americans.
IRC Chair Eitan Paul (SFS ’12) expressed his satisfaction with the event.
“I think it’s very important to start this conversation at Georgetown,” he said, “about arguably the most serious humanitarian crisis in the world today. It was nice to have a variety of perspectives.”
Information for donations as well as a donation box was made available to guests.
The event was run by the International Relations Club and held with the support of the South Asian Society, UNICEF Georgetown and the GU Task Force for Pakistan.

The Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union lowered the annual rate of interest it pays on savings accounts by 60 percent on Oct. 1, catching many account holders off guard.
The credit union announced the change in its monthly statement emails sent to account holders last Friday, when the change from 1 percent to 0.4 percent interest took effect.
The rate of 0.4 percent remains above the national average of 0.18 percent. The credit union also lowered rates from 1.25 percent to 0.7 percent on six-month certificates of deposit and from 1.5 percent to 1 percent on 12-month CDs.
By comparison, the only other bank with an on-campus office, Chevy Chase Bank – which was bought in 2009 by Capital One – pays 0.05 percent interest on savings accounts with balances below $10,000.
Chief Executive Officer Arjun Mehta (SFS ’11) said the realities of the market made the changes necessary, even if the credit union seeks to offer its niche group of customers a better deal than competing banks.
“The credit union constantly seeks to offer the highest interest rate possible … but I think ultimately [1 percent] is not feasible in this low interest rate environment,” Mehta said. “This is still a very good rate.”
Some students, like Rita Pearson (SFS ’13), felt that the credit union should have made a greater effort to notify account holders about the changes.
“I wouldn’t have known until I checked [my statement] a month from now,” Pearson said.
Although she is not very concerned, Colleen Tapen (COL ’13) expected more personal customer service from the credit union.
“Maybe more warning.that they were considering this, to get people’s feedback, would have been good,” she said. “That’s the whole reason you choose a bank like GUASFCU, because it’s more personal.”
ehta said the credit union has given careful thought to how it distributes key announcements to its members.
“We don’t intend to spam them with emails … The way we communicate with them is by statements and on the website,” he said.
The suddenness of the cuts upset some GUASFCU account holders, such as Michelle Pliskin (MSB ’13).
“[The cut was] 60 percent. I’m very upset. They should’ve made an announcement … I had no knowledge that they were even thinking about it,” Pliskin said.
Some students were ambivalent about the change.
“It didn’t surprise me,” said Spencer Daum (SFS ’13), who has an account with the credit union to save money for tuition. “And the rate is still higher than most banks around here.”
Madeline Collins (COL ’13) said that she did not choose GUASFCU for the rate of interest it paid.
“I bank with them because they’re a local institution and I like that, not because of the interest rates and financial policies,” she said. “It’s not one of those big national banks or a corporate behemoth.”

The CIA, members of Congress and other government experts descended on Georgetown this week for Government Week, a Career Center showcase for students in search of exposure to the field.
The events throughout the week ranged from a workshop that focused on ways to develop a resume for government positions, to debunking myths that surround federal government jobs. Although there was a good turnout for most of the events–averaging about 35 students–the CIA Roundtable event which featured opportunities to hear from CIA representatives about the security clearance process drew 131 students.
Another event, Interning on Capitol Hill, highlighted the experiences of two Georgetown students, Geoffrey Bible (SFS ’12) and Bryan Woll (COL ’12). Despite their ideological differences — as Bible is chairman of College Republicans and Woll is president of College Democrats — their experiences on the Hill were quite similar.
Both mentioned that their days were spent mostly answering phones and sorting through mail, but occasionally included going to hearings or receptions. Woll offered some good tips for students who wanted to pursue an internship.
“Set realistic expectations and be humble,” Woll said. “Go in there realizing where you stand and learn to embrace your busy work, embrace the small tasks. Be the best phone answerer or mail sorter.”
Bible emphasized the opportunities he had to make connections and the importance of the overall experience. “I learned way more there about D.C. than I actually learned being here on the Hilltop,” he said.
Students who attended the talk found the speakers to be informative.
“I left the meeting with a much more realistic idea of what a congressional internship involves and how to get one,” freshman Wells Robinson said.
Tara Duprey, assistant director of external relations at the Career Education Center feels strongly about why these industry-focused weeks are so important.
“The weeks are designed for students. The whole purpose is to make students aware of the variety of career options available to them, regardless of their school or major,” she said. “We do this because we’re committed to all Georgetown students and have resources that can be of use to all of them.”
Duprey mentioned that there has been plenty of support for the industry-based weeks sponsored by the Career Center, from not only alumni but various employers.
“We want to combat the idea that our resources and tools are only designed for business students. We have tools that all students can benefit from,” she said. “We really want to get students to notice the opportunities available to them.”
With six industry focused weeks last year compared to this year’s four, the hardest task for the Career Center has been to get student interaction and involvement. In previous years, similar career events were spread throughout the academic year but now they have been grouped together in the hopes more students will take notice and this will yield stronger attendance.
“We basically repackaged the programming we have always done to reach a wider student audience,” said Duprey.
Government Week will be followed by a Health and Science Week; Education and Non-Profit Week; and Marketing, Advertising and Public Relations Week.”

Standing before a group in the Fischer Colloquium Wednesday evening, Texas oilman and Chair of BP Capital Management T. Boone Pickens kicked off his talk with some levity: “I know why you’re here. You’re thinking, `I’m going to learn something on how to get rich.'”
Pickens spoke to the McDonough School of Business students in a talk moderated by William Finnerty, an adjunct lecturer in the MSB. In the Q-and-A session, Pickens addressed his expansive career in energy and shared some of his personal business philosophies.
Following a light start, Pickens’ responses to audience questions took on a heavier tone, placing a focus on the need to halt America’s dependence on foreign oil.
“We [Americans] have to get on our own resources. The country is importing more and more foreign oil. You’re fools if you do it and you don’t have to,” Pickens said.
In September 2008, he introduced his “Pickens Plan” to a crowd in Gaston Hall. On his most recent visit, he told a new audience how his proposal might reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by using domestic alternatives. The plan is also meant to buy time to develop more and more advanced technology and distribution systems. Relying heavily on building new wind-generation facilities to produce 20 percent of America’s electricity, the plan also counts on using the domestic natural gas supply as transportation fuel and power generation.
When asked just how environmentally friendly he was, Pickens said, “You’ve got to be realistic when talking about the energy, you can’t shut all the coal plants down. We need a base load of coal and natural gas.”
Pickens made it clear, however, that the most important aspect of his plan was freedom from foreign dependency. “My issue is security; I want the country secure on energy, I want to go all-American. I’ll take anything if it’s American,” he said.
Pickens didn’t limit his commentary to his policies, but also provided advice to young businesspeople and entrepreneurs.
He noted that being an entrepreneur was all about pushing the limits, both by challenging oneself and in taking chances in business.
“You get so many chances at the bat and you’re never going to make a home run if you don’t swing,” he added.
In the face of his great financial success, Pickens recognized the need to give back to the community. He founded the T. Boone Pickens Foundation in 2006, and has donated over $800 million.
Pickens said that his first inspiration to be a philanthropist came from his grandmother, who he said made a simple request of him: “Don’t ever forget where you came from.” He added, “And I haven’t.”
The talk was well-received by students and faculty of the MSB. Every seat in the Colloquium was filled as the crowd listened to Pickens speak.
“To have the opportunity to spend time with an American icon like Mr. Pickens is an incredibly opportunity for all. We got to hear what he had to say about his environmental policies and were also able to get to know him as an individual – he was honest, authentic and funny – I loved it,” Finnerty said.

With recently revived Israeli-Palestinian peace talks at risk of languishing due to ongoing Jewish settlement building in the West Bank, student groups at Georgetown have joined the contentious debate, calling for strong ties between the United States and Israel.
In a document released this fall, the Georgetown-Israel Alliance, College Democrats and College Republicans affirmed their agreement on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict despite their varying political affiliations.
“The statement covers three broad topics: recognition of Israel, support for a two-state solution, and opposition to Iran’s nuclear program,” Sam Blank (COL ’12), vice president of Political Affairs of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, said.
The document addresses issues that have been a source of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians since the establishment of Israel as a Jewish State in 1948, and advocates for a two-state solution under which “a democratic, viable Palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the Jewish state of Israel, mutual respect and diplomatic relations between the two states, and protection of and respect for human rights of all peoples,” exists.
Despite the bipartisan nature of the document which was drafted last spring, not all campus groups are pleased with the statement.
“Any statement on the conflict that doesn’t address at all the crucial points of the status of Jerusalem, the settlements, or Palestinian refugees does not merit praise or attention,” said Jackson Perry (COL’ 12), treasurer of Students for Justice in Palestine, a student advocacy group that educates about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“They are vaguely restating boilerplate U.S. foreign policy,” Perry added. “Nothing more.”
The Georgetown Israel Alliance is a student-run organization that handles both political and cultural issues relating to Israel. As the only pro-Israel group on campus, the organization views its mission as two-fold – for education and advocacy.
“We seek to educate the Georgetown community on Israel’s culture and society, as well as promote dialogue and discussion on the various dimensions of the Middle East conflict,” Blank said. “We advocate for the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish, democratic state that grants human and civil rights to all her citizens, regardless of race, class, religion or upbringing.”
Blank said that the GIA, like Israel itself, has a diverse range of political opinions among its constituency.
“We have members who are right, left and center, as well as Jewish and non-Jewish. Our members hold a wide range of views on the conflict and how best to solve it,” Blank said. “However, we all equally yearn to see the day when Israelis and Palestinians can live together in peace and security.”
College Democrats President Bryan Woll (COL ’12) and Communications Director William Vogt (SFS ’12) issued a statement to THE HOYA regarding their organization’s involvement in the collaboration.
“Our membership represents the diverse body of opinions that makes up Georgetown’s community,” Woll and Vogt said in the statement.
“Our leadership had the privilege to work with GIA last semester on this statement, which reflects the sentiment of most of our members, but certainly not all of them. We pride ourselves in having and embracing a diversity of opinions within our organization, and this issue is no different.”
Kevin Preskenis (COL ’12), chief of staff for the College Republicans, was extensively involved in the preparation of this statement. He said that he looks forward to working with the GIA on what he believes to be a significant foreign policy issue.
“By signing on to the Georgetown Israel Alliance’s joint statement, we are expressing our broader foreign policy position on Israel, namely, its right to exist as a democratic, Jewish state, and our support of a strong alliance with the United States,” Preskenis said. “We also are hopeful of a two-state solution, in which the Palestinian authority recognizes Israel’s right to exist peacefully, which is a proposal the GIA statement addresses.”

The Student Health Center, in conjunction with the Office of Faculty and Staff Benefits, is continuing to offer flu vaccine shots at no charge to all students, faculty and staff through several flu vaccine clinics taking place in Yates Field House in October and November.
This year’s vaccine is a single shot designed to protect against both the seasonal flu and the H1N1 virus that was the source of attention last year.
About 3,500 to 4,000 vaccines have typically been administered annually since the university began offering this service back in 2001, and over 4,000 have been ordered for this season, according to James Welsh, assistant vice president for Student Health Services.
That figure has greatly decreased from last year when about 8,000 doses were administered to the Georgetown community. Welsh states that number was due mainly to the H1N1 pandemic and the fact that the seasonal and H1N1 vaccinations required separate injections.
any people have already taken advantage of the clinics. “I went because it was free and close,” said Christine Pfeil (COL ’10), a university employee and assistant director of the Georgetown Scholarship Program. “The whole thing took four minutes.”
Several dozen people were lined up at one of the clinics in Yates on Thursday, Oct. 7. Kerry Ryan (COL ’13) and Rebecca Packwood (NHS ’13), both paramedics with Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services, said they decided to get the vaccine because of their jobs.
Other students, like Katherine Tarzian-Britt (COL ’14), said that they were motivated by the risks of a cramped dorm lifestyle.
“If one person gets sick, everyone can get sick,” Tarzian-Britt said.
This service is funded for students through general university budgets and for faculty and staff through the Faculty and Staff Benefits Office. The university declined to report the costs associated with providing this free service.

Georgetown’s research and development spending increased more than the national average over the last fiscal year, but the university spent significantly less than both public and private universities in the D.C. region.
The university’s federally funded R&D expenditures grew 6.9 percent between fiscal years 2008 and 2009, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, as opposed to the 4 percent national average. Georgetown’s spending was only $120 million, rising from $111.6 million the previous year.
In contrast, Johns Hopkins University spent over $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2009, according to The Washington Post. The majority of that funding, almost $921 million, went to Johns Hopkins’ Applied Physics Laboratory. Georgetown’s science program is not nearly as large, which in turn reduces the university’s spending.
“When comparing across institutions . one needs to recognize that the potential for federal research support depends on many factors,” Joseph Neale, a Paduano distinguished professor and director of the Georgetown-Hughes Undergraduate Research Scholars Program, wrote in an email.
The University of Maryland, Baltimore, which has an engineering school, spent $169 million in federal funds, while Virginia Tech University, a polytechnic university, spent $148 million. Neil said that Georgetown’s programs did not lend themselves to enormous spending.
“Contrast for example universities with engineering schools versus schools of foreign service,” Neale said.
Neale also noted that the size of the university affects the amount of federal funds received.
“Most of the other institutions are very large relative to [Georgetown], often state universities with huge science departments,” Neale said. “The per faculty member element would be the critical variable in that comparison.”
Neale also commented that the sizes of both Georgetown’s endowment and its research faculty are small compared to those of other universities.
“[An important factor is] the size of the research programs and the number of faculty that are engaged in research that will draw large grants,” he said.
These numbers do not reflect investments from private organizations, such as corporations. Statistics for expenditures from private sources are not currently available for fiscal year 2009, but in 2008 Georgetown received over $32 million from private sources.
The university’s R&D awards in 2010 totaled almost $203 million. Of that, $159.4 million went to the Medical Center, while the main campus received about $32.5 million, according to Rachel Pugh, associate director of communications.

The U.S. State Department issued a terrorism warning for travelers in Europe on Oct. 4, but so far the notification has not significantly affected the 200 Georgetown students studying across the pond this semester.
The Office of International Programs has security measures in place in case of emergency, but does not believe that students’ plans abroad will be compromised.
“Hopefully, the alert won’t affect them at all,” Kathy Bellows, executive director of international programs, said. “But we’re fairly confident that we can handle emergencies if they arise.”
Before going abroad, all students must register with the nearest U.S. Embassy and attend an orientation to learn about safety. The university also uses International SOS, a company that provides emergency assistance to students overseas in case of a medical or security crisis.
Many students found the warning unexpected, though parents showed concern.
“When the warning reached the front page of our local newspaper the day before I was due to leave the states, the first commentary from my dad was `Just stay out of public places, OK?'” said Jessica Schieder (SFS ’12), who is studying abroad in Munich for the year. “I found such a request unrealistic and I spent my first night at Oktoberfest, singing on top of a table protesting with several thousand Germans, as well as a fellow study abroad student.”
Other students noted the danger behind the warning, but have not changed their lifestyle or travel plans.
“I’d say the general feeling is unease at being reminded of this reality, but most people feel just about as endangered in New York as they do in any European city,” Roseann Day (COL ’12, who is studying abroad in Rome,] said. “No one has changed any travel plans as far as I know.”
Maria Edmundson (COL ’12) provided THE HOYA with a copy of the email her program, Sweet Briar College Junior Year in France, sent to students. “Students should carry their cell phone with them at all times, stay away from tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower and temporarily avoid wearing their college T-shirts in public,” the email read.
In response to the recent travel alert, the OIP has also sent out a message to students abroad and their parents to make them aware of the situation.
“I did receive the study abroad advisory email that warned us of the increased terrorism concerns,” Gabriella Hook (COL ’12), who is spending the year at Oxford University, said. “I probably will tend to be more cautious and avoid traveling for the next few weeks. It’s definitely not what I wanted to hear as soon as I arrived in Europe.”
Still, most students said the warning does not weigh heavily on their minds. Bellows said that this was a reasonable stance.
“Basically, [the alert] just says be smart and know your environment,” Bellows said. “Behaviors don’t need to change. But if something were to go wrong, we would address the incident
immediately.”

Updated 4:58 p.m. Oct. 13
D.C. was awarded a dubious honor last week: While the District boasts the greatest number of college degree-holding residents, it also has the country’s highest illiteracy rate.
The U.S. Census Bureau released data last week reporting that 47.3 percent of D.C. residents age 25 and over hold bachelor’s, master’s, professional school or doctoral degrees. Washington ranks first nationally in this category. The national average is 25 percent. The other highest ranked cities are San Francisco, San Jose, Raleigh, N.C., and Boston. The lowest are Louisville, New Orleans, Detroit, Orlando and Cleveland.
D.C.’s high rates come from the jobs available to residents. The main field of employment for these residents is the government, but there is also a large number of doctors, lawyers and businesspeople working in D.C.
D.C.’s college students also reflect this trend, according to Phil Seden (COL ’02), a federal prosecutor and U.S. attorney for Washington.
“[Students coming to Georgetown are] applying to become a resident not only of D.C., but the capital of the free world. They are committed to being leaders,” Selden said.
Many students elect to stay in D.C. after finishing college due to finding jobs in the government sector.
But while D.C.’s college halls are filled with ambitious students, the streets reveal a different story. The District has the highest illiteracy rate in the country at 36 percent, according to a 2007 study by The State Education Agency. The national average for functional illiteracy lies at 21 percent, according to the study

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Association reported a dramatic loss of passengers on both buses and trains during the months of June and July. Though WMATA significantly increased fares during the summer, Metro officials denied a correlation.
etrobuses had 11.66 million passengers in July, compared to almost 12.96 million passengers in July 2009. At the same time, Metrorail usage also decreased, from 20.5 million passengers to 20.2 million passengers, according to The Washington Examiner.
etro officials had expected a decline because of the recession and the high unemployment rate of D.C. WMATA had estimated a drop-off of about 200,000 riders, rather than 1.3 million.
Officials stated that they did not think the 18
percent fare increase, which was approved at the end of May and enacted on July 1, had any effect on the ridership.
Georgetown students agreed with WMATA’s
opinion.
“I had no idea [about the fare change], but I don’t use the Metro as often during the summer,” Nick Parrott (COL ’12) said.
Students also said that they increasingly used other methods of transportation in the summer months.
Yaffet Menna (COL ’13) said that he used a car in the summer, whereas during the year he rides the Metro every week. Menna said that no other factors such as fare increases affected his choice not to use public transport.
WMATA is taking multiple steps to increase its ridership such as staying open late for sports events and backing events such as “International Car Free Day.”

As food trucks become a common sight on D.C. streets, several established restaurants have lobbied the D.C. Council to create laws regulating when and where the trucks can operate. The laws, which the D.C. Council will vote on in a few weeks, would be the first of their kind in the District.
One crucial point of disagreement between restaurants and food truck owners is that food trucks must park at least 60 feet away from restaurants that sell the same type of food. These parking limitations negatively affect the business food trucks are able to generate, according to food truck operators.
“If we normally stay two hours, and we are only allowed to stay half that time, it has an effect on business,” said Greg Fromel, a driver for the food truck Sweetflow, the mobile extension of Sweetgreen. According to Fromel, police and restaurants ask the food truck to move from its parked position around once every two weeks.
Yet parked food trucks also pose a threat to small restaurant businesses.
“To place a vendor directly in front of or on the sidewalk next to a restaurant is extremely detrimental to the visibility and viability of businesses,” the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington wrote in a letter to Helder Gil, legislative affairs specialist to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs.
Both sides are rallying support in light of the impending legislation. Sweetflow has a flyer on the side of its trucks urging customers to sign a petition on behalf of food trucks. Meanwhile, the RAMW’s website urges local business owners to submit their comments to the D.C. Council. The DCRA has received over 3,000 comments regarding the legislation, said Mike Rupert, DCRA spokesman.
“We are listening to all sides and ultimately going to put up the best idea of what we think is the balance between all the concerns,” Rupert said.
Other regulations would prohibit food trucks from parking unless they are serving a line of customers and would prohibit vending within 40 feet of an intersection. In a neighborhood such as Georgetown where the blocks are small, trucks may find it difficult to locate places to sell.
Mike Arthur, assistant manager at Wingo’s, sees competition from food trucks as an opportunity to improve services and pricing.
“Some other restaurants might complain, but I’m all for them,” he said. “[But I would probably] call [the Department of] Public Works if a food truck was parked in front of my store.”
Georgetown is largely immune to these problems, however. Existing laws prohibit vending on M Street and Wisconsin Avenue, which are snow emergency routes, so food trucks rarely frequent the area. Arthur said that he believes food trucks would face local opposition if they were to become more widespread.”

Philly Pizza & Grill, the popular late-night eatery that was forced to shut its doors last spring, will return, albeit in a different form.
On Sept. 22, the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs granted a new certificate of occupancy to Philly Pizza, according to Kathleen Beeton, DCRA’s deputy zoning administrator.
The DCRA revoked Philly Pizza’s previous certificate of occupancy last October amid a flurry of residents’ complaints of excessive late-night noise and trash. Philly Pizza was operating as a fast food restaurant on a residential street, which is against District zoning laws.
After months of court battles, the Board of Zoning Adjustment finally forced Philly Pizza to end operations on March 9. Mehmet Kocak, the owner of Philly Pizza, then applied for a new certificate of occupancy over the summer for a prepared food and sandwich shop.
According to Beeton, Kocak met with the DCRA, the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E and neighbors in June to discuss the option of opening a prepared food shop. The DCRA decided to grant a new certificate of occupancy after reviewing the proposal and the steps Kocak had taken to meet zoning regulations.
“Since [June], the owners have had ongoing discussions with DCRA officials in an attempt to comply with the zoning regulations regarding prepared food shops,” Beeton wrote in an email. “Specifically, the owners have altered the interior of the property and replaced the cooking oven with a ventless oven to be used to warm sandwiches and other food. The owners have also removed the rooftop vent.”
Kocak said that while a new certificate had been granted, Philly Pizza was not yet reopened and he did not have further details.
Georgetown residents near the Potomac Street location are not pleased to see the return of the establishment. Last fall, residents complained that Philly Pizza’s late-night crowds were composed mostly of inebriated students and that excessive noise and trash violations disrupted life on a residential street. Several residents testified before the BZA during the court hearings in the spring.
“We’re not happy. Nobody understands this ruling. The timing of it … it’s strange. It makes no sense,” ANC2E Vice Chairman Bill Starrels told The Georgetown Dish.
Students were excited for Philly Pizza’s return, but expressed skepticism at the notion of a prepared food establishment, not a pizza joint.
“I’m a fan of Philly P’s, though not pre-prepared food,” Peter Roth (MSB ’13) said. “I want the pizza to be crispy in my hands. I also liked that it felt like a real pizza place.”

Every semester, Georgetown language students dish out $70 in lab fees, but many have never seen the inside of the lab room.
In an era of continuously emerging technologies, the language lab could seem antiquated, a last vestige of teaching strategies from the 1970s – and students are increasingly dismissive of the idea.
“There isn’t anything in the language lab that I can’t do on Blackboard,” said Declan Cummings (COL ’12) when asked if he had ever visited the actual location in room 224 of the Intercultural Center.
Blackboard has become a tool for language students, bringing listening exercises from tape cassettes to laptops. The language lab is in charge of managing these recordings, renewing copyrights every year and organizing the lessons so that students can listen to them at home.
The lab, which is managed by Georgetown’s Center for New Design in Learning and Scholarship, is also expanding its technologies to include Teletandem Brasil, a Skype foreign language exchange program with Brazilian students.
Peter Janssens, associate director of Instructional Resources for CNDLS, has made adapting the language lab to newer technologies a priority since he started his post in 2001.
“When I first arrived, the language classroom was very old-fashioned,” Janssens said. “Only a few departments used it.”
In 2003, the lab classroom was renovated and equipped with computers that have since been regularly replaced and maintained. The lab is now fitted with Apple desktop computers complete with cameras to facilitate video chat exchange programs. Janssens said that over 40 foreign language classes use the room weekly or bi-weekly.
Still, the adjacent media lab, which is meant for personal study, is technologically behind. Georgetown has not updated the lab’s tape-based setup, though Janssens hopes that will change in the next few years.
“We have a proposal to renovate the lab to change it from a place where students walk in and sit at a computer and absorb information to a place where students can collaborate and work together,” Jannsens said.
For students, such a change could make the physical language lab relevant for personal study. After being told of the lab’s future renovation, Cummings said that he would likely pay a visit to the room.
“If the lab offered something unique, truly unique, like a group environment that facilitated learning languages, then I would go,” he said.
According to professors in the linguistics department, language labs can be useful tools in supplementing language education, but should not be considered the first choice for teaching.
“[Labs] do have a place, but they don’t replace classes because you need interaction,” said professor Patrick Rebuschat, a visiting assistant professor of linguistics.
Professors in the French department encourage their students to use the program as a supplement, and do not consider the private study room outdated.
“I will recommend that students use some of the video that’s there,” said professor Alissa Webel, a visiting professor in the French department. “It’s still a resource that we like to have with us.”
