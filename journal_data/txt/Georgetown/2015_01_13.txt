The McDonough School of Business and the School of Foreign Service have launched a pilot version of the Global Business Fellows program and a global business major, which both begin this semester.
The programs were announced Dec. 3 in an email sent to all SFS and MSB sophomores.
The joint venture between the two schools includes the recently announced global business major offered to only SFS students. The second component of the partnership, the fellows program, is open to members of the Class of 2017 in both the MSB and the SFS, and will provide participants with a certificate in Global Business.
The joint application for both the fellowship and the major was released Jan. 5. After writing a 250-word interest essay and providing academic records in an application due last Friday, applicants were notified of their acceptances Jan. 9 midway into the class add/drop period that ends Jan. 17. While the pilot fellowship program admitted 12 students from each of the two schools, the program is expected to admit 15 from each school beginning next year. The SFS Dean’s office did not indicate how many students were accepted to the major program, but some students were accepted to both the major and the fellowship.
Both the program and the major were designed to combine political and economic coursework from the SFS with a foundation in business education from the MSB.
The major program requires 10 courses, which include statistics classes, a business core, an international business core and supporting courses from both the SFS and MSB. Once accepted, students received one of four major advisers to help them select courses.
The fellowship, which requires a GPA of at least a 3.3 and six semesters of a language, includes an economics core, an international business core and an additional capstone Global Residency Course. Students in the fellowship are also provided with a fellowship adviser through the Landegger Program in International Business Diplomacy.
MSB professor Ricardo Ernst, who helped to develop the fellows program, noted that the program marks the first collaborative effort between the two schools.
“For the first time in the history of Georgetown, you’re bridging and getting two schools to join forces to come up with a common program,” Ernst said. “The [fellows] are going to be trained to deal with problems that are common in global business.”
According to Ernst, the fellows program will offer its participants access to courses in both schools, so as to promote interdisciplinary learning.
“To make Georgetown a university where one of our core competencies is to understand the global reality, what a better thing to do than to join forces with the school that deals with trade and the elements of business, with the school that understands the elements of geopolitical tensions, negotiation and diplomacy?” Ernst said.
Ernst said that the combination of courses from the two schools would benefit the fellows.
“I am a deep believer that the mindset of an SFS student is different than the mindset of a MSB student,” Ernst said. “So there’s a lot to be learned when you put that subset of the SFS in a class in the MSB. There’s a lot of learning by combining that kind of experience.”
Likewise, SFS Associate Dean and Director of the Undergraduate Program Mitch Kaneda stressed the importance of studying global, political and economic contexts in learning about business operations.
“We would like to nurture the next generation of global business leaders who are conscious about not just the business side, but also the social implications of business — business leaders who understand cultural and religious differences across global societies,” Kaneda said.
Sophia Yang (SFS ’17) was accepted into both the major and the fellowship and said that she is excited to fuse her interests under one program.
“I’m really just excited because I’d always wanted to get some more hard skills for my future just in general because I feel like what my goal in life is to figure out where and how to invest money to enact the most positive and impactful social change,” Yang said. “So I think to even start to be able to understand that to enact positive social change, I have to be able to understand how money works and how businesses work.”
Despite her excitement, Yang said that the late acceptance notification, which fell midway into the add-drop period, made class selections difficult and stressful.
“[Before I was notified], I wouldn’t have known if I would have been able to take certain classes I had been going to,” Yang said. “For example, Accounting 101 — I wasn’t even sure if I would get the major, but at the info session they told us they only were selecting 15 students.”
Chris Hedley (SFS ’17) was accepted into the global business major, and said that it provided an excellent synthesis of his interests.
“I was deciding between the MSB and the SFS for which to apply to, and I ultimately chose the SFS because I thought that the curriculum was broader, and I figured that I had the rest of my life to study business, so why not study the international community while I could,” Hedley said. “I always wanted to take these classes my friends in the MSB were taking — accounting courses, finance courses — and when I realized that there was a way to do that through the global business major, which I found out about like a month ago, I was incredibly excited.”
In addition to the academic requirements, the program will also offer opportunities for professional development to its fellows.
“We are planning to have visits to multilateral organizations as a group — World Bank, IMF, embassies, Congress,” Ernst said. “We will work directly with companies and sell them as the fellows. … Hopefully companies and the rest of the world will start recognizing what’s going on there.”
However, SFS professor Ted Moran, who helped to develop the program, said that fellows will be prepared for careers outside of the private sector.
“A lot of our graduates, even now, don’t necessarily go into business. They may go into NGOs, like Transparency International, or various kinds of development organizations,” Moran said. “It’s not just a narrow business path. There’s a broader context in terms of the social, political, economic in which business takes place.”
MSB Senior Associate Dean Norean Sharpe said that while the development stage of the program began two years ago, there had been much talk to create a joint program between the schools for many years.
“The development of this program has taken years of effort on the parts of multiple faculty and administrators at both McDonough and the SFS. It is a groundbreaking and ambitious project,” Sharpe wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Moran, the program has received funding of approximately $10 million, from private donors. They plan to continue to raise funds from donations over the course of the year.
“We are hoping and planning that this is going to make a big contribution to Georgetown. It’s going to be a vehicle for us to raise funding,” Moran said. “Ten million dollars is the minimum. We’re actually shooting closer to $20 million. The whole campus will benefit.”
Era Qian (MSB ’17), who was accepted into the fellows program, said that she was attracted to the program’s emphasis on integrating international affairs with business.
“I think business and international affairs can be complementary,” Qian said. “Many students like me might have found difficulty in deciding which direction to go. Now, this integrated curriculum provides us a great opportunity to embrace both disciplines and thrive in them.”

The destruction of the SFS in the single-minded pursuit of money over tradition continues. They might as well disband the IBD program, as there clearly is no more use for it

University President John J. DeGioia received a salary bonus of $400,000 from the Board of Directors in 2012, making him the 15th highest-paid private university executive in the United States that year. However, DeGioia donated the entirety of the one-time bonus to the 1789 Scholarship Imperative.
According to the most recent rankings released by The Chronicle of Higher Education, this salary hike, which came a little over 10 years after DeGioia took office in July 2001, took him from the 60th rank in 2011 to the 15th spot. DeGioia’s total compensation was calculated at $1,292,786, while his compensation in 2011 fell at $875,317.
“President DeGioia’s compensation in 2012 reflected a one-time increase from a $400,000 bonus awarded him by the university’s board, in recognition of his performance over his first 10 years in office,” university spokesperson Stacy Kerr said in a statement to The Hoya.
Because DeGioia voluntarily froze his salary during the 2008 financial crisis, Kerr predicted that his place in future rankings would be similar to his 60th place in 2011. DeGioia’s rankings over the past eight years have peaked at 38th in 2008 and reached their low at 66th in 2005.
“We expect that when the rankings for the 2013 year are released, President DeGioia will return to the place he has historically occupied,” Kerr wrote.
After DeGioia, who graduated from the College in 1979, received the bonus, he and his wife Theresa (CAS ’89) established an endowed 1789 Scholarship fund in honor of their 35th and 25th graduation anniversaries, respectively, in fall 2013. DeGioia had not previously made public his donation to the fund, and a scholarship in his name does not appear on the 1789 Scholarship website.
“While grateful for it, President DeGioia had not asked for the bonus and donated it to Georgetown’s 1789 Scholarship Imperative, which supports undergraduate financial aid at the university,” Kerr said.
The fund was used to support financial aid for students in need for the first time in the 2014-2015 school year. Other donors to the 1789 fund include Fr. Otto Hentz, S.J., board of directors Chair Paul Tagliabue, PNC Bank and Goldman Sachs.
“The [DeGioia] fund was active this year for the first time, and its income supported three scholarships as part of Georgetown’s meet-full-need financial aid program,” Vice President for Advancement R. Bartley Moore (SFS ’87) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Chronicle ranks university presidents based on total compensation, not just base pay. This value includes salary in addition to benefits, housing, insurance and retirement payments. As a result, DeGioia’s 2012 base pay — which rested at $534,803 — accounted for only 41.4 percent of his total compensation, added to $153,241 of nontaxable benefits and $204,742 of other pay.
Though DeGioia, the first layperson to serve as president of Georgetown, is the highest-paid president of a Roman Catholic university, presidents of peer institutions generally have higher levels of total compensation. While Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania each compensate their presidents over $2 million, Northwestern University and Duke University, along with most of the other schools in the Ivy League, provide compensation north of $1 million. The outlier in the current rankings was Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute President Shirley Ann Jackson, who was compensated over $7.4 million.

I recently visited the campus and asked approximately a dozen students where the chapel was. Not one person knew. It seems to me that there is an immediate need to promote Christian values rather than walllow in guilt for something that no one living is responsible. Save your apologies for those living alumni who are heartbroken over the decline of a once great university now following the progressive pc issue de jour.

As a graduate of the medical school, I am so very disappointed how Georgetown has caved to the godless elitism that has taken over the academic, business, financial, entertainment and political aspects in our country. What a disgrace! Our universities are producing ( at great costs ) progressive robots that are paralyzed by moral and intellectual relativism and political correctness.

Transgender teen Leelah Alcorn’s suicide sparked the support of trans activists and community members, who gathered at the Justice for Leelah Alcorn Rally and March, organized by students from area colleges in Mount Vernon Square on Saturday.
Seventeen-year-old Alcorn committed suicide by walking into oncoming traffic on an interstate freeway outside of Cincinnati on Dec. 28. She left behind a suicide note on her Tumblr page, calling upon individuals to fix the society that drove her to end her life.
“My death needs to mean something,” Alcorn’s message read.
The rally was organized by approximately 20 activists, including Caolan Eder (COL ’17), who heard about the event from a friend and became involved with the group, which consisted of students from the various universities around D.C. but also included non-student activists.
“We didn’t have to decide that it was something we needed to do. We had already seen the horrible effects of not doing so,” Eder said.
The event drew over 300 participants. After gathering on the steps of Carnegie Library in Mt. Vernon Square, the demonstrators marched to the steps of the Justice Department and read a list of demands, including a federal ban on the provision of conversion therapy to minors and insurance coverage for transitioning, and a formal statement from Alcorn’s church. Along the way, the march paused to construct a memorial in front of the headquarters of the Family Research Council, a conservative group that advocates in favor of conversion therapy.
“Her note was more than just a description of a girl who was driven to feel like life was so helpless that she couldn’t live on. Her suicide note was a plea. It was a call to action, begging us to come out here and to fix society, to make her death mean something. And that’s why we are out here,” American University master’s student Jes Grobman, who helped organize the rally, said in introductory remarks.
Eder was impressed by the rally’s passion but did not expect the government to meet the demands with specific attention.
“It was amazing for me to see all of that support, and people were being so loud and dedicated. There was a lot of energy,” Eder said. “I think it was as much of a success as we could have hoped. I don’t know that we really will get any of our demands because society still doesn’t seem to think that trans people are very important. Eventually, maybe, but I think that we helped.”
GUSA Undersecretary of LGBTQ Affairs Lexi Dever attended the march as well and called for attention to the issue beyond the particular suicide of Alcorn.
“The death of trans people is an epidemic, essentially … which is a result of systematic oppression in society. This is simply another situation, and for some reason, this one suicide has gotten more attention than the other hundreds that happen every year,” Dever said. “We want to show that this is an important issue that people should care about and that we don’t want anymore trans suicides or homicides to happen.”
Other speakers included Reverend Wendy Moen of First Trinity Lutheran Church and Lourdes Ashley Hunter, a transgender woman and the co-founder of the Trans Women of Color Collective.
Hunter drew attention to the 12 transgender women of color murdered in the United States in 2014 and asked the crowd to question the country’s indifference to the rights of gender non-conforming people.
“The same thing that killed Leelah is killing all of us. My liberation depends on your liberation. In 2014, in Ohio, the epicenter of violence against transgender women of color face, we are dying and what are you doing?” Hunter said.
As they discussed issues including parenting a trans child, the speakers drew cries and support from the crowd, often stopping to chant “Not one more” and “It is our duty to fight, it is our duty to win.”
“I think it is really time that our society came together and realize that this is not just an issue for some of us but for all of us and that we need to band together and make sure that this bigotry is eliminated,” rally attendee Heather Benno, an LGBTQ activist and coalition organizer for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism, said.
GU Pride Media Manager and Historian Campbell James (SFS ’17) explained that Georgetown students have a role to play in improving the environment for transgender students on campus.
“What we as Georgetown students can do to help counter the high rates of trans suicide is to make sure that we are supportive of our friends, family and fellow students who may identify as trans by making sure we use appropriate language choices and by allowing these individuals to feel comfortable being themselves,” James said.
D.C. Trans Power will organize advocates again in a Community Building Evening at Lamont Street Collective on Friday at 7 p.m. to discuss further ways to achieve transgender justice.

Several students reported icy conditions around campus, causing accidents on the sidewalks late Sunday night and early Monday morning. The university announced a delayed opening and the option for liberal leave on Monday.
Andrew Walker (SFS ’16) said the area outside of Lauinger Library was especially treacherous around 1 a.m. Monday morning. Other students and security guards were worried about the walkway and a Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service ambulance was nearby attending to a case.
“Someone had just come in after giving up [on] getting out of Lau because the brick patch in front of it was just covered in a sheet of ice that you could barely see. If he hadn’t stopped us, [my friend and I] would have had no idea that it was there and we both would have slipped and it was brutal,” Walker said. “I was really lucky that someone explained to us how bad this was.”
Sydney Brooks (COL ’18) described similar conditions near the front gates as she walked off campus on her way to Saxbys Coffee Monday morning.
“It looked like it was just slush, but it turns out there was ice underneath,” she said. “The path there could have been salted or something so the ice would melt quicker.”
The D.C. Council passed a bill in November to issue fines of $25 to people and $150 to businesses that did not clear snow from their property within eight hours. Additionally, if injuries occur on private property, defendants may be able to recover the cost of their medical bills from the owners of the property.
While GERMS responses remain confidential, Captain Brian Monahan (COL ’15) said they received several weather-related calls in the past days, adding that the roads or sidewalks that have not been shovelled or salted within GERMS boundaries are mainly off-campus in West Georgetown or Burleith.
“This is a normal occurrence that happens whenever sidewalks are wet or icy,” Monahan wrote in an email. “If we start to see trends in the data with regards to ice-related incidents I will follow up with the university to attempt to alleviate the problem.”
On Sunday, specifically, Associate Vice President for Risk Management Joseph Yohe said the university was only officially notified of two incidents of students slipping on ice, both of which took place off campus. With regard to student accidents and liability concerns, the Planning and Facilities Management Office has protocol for evaluating the responsibility of the university.
“Each incident resulting in injury has a unique set of facts and circumstances, and the University evaluates each incident individually,” Yohe wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Yohe further explained in such cases of inclement weather, campus leaders review conditions, looking at reports from the National Weather Service, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and the federal government’s Office of Personnel Management, among others, and then act accordingly.
“The decision to have a 10 a.m. delayed arrival and the option of liberal leave was based on the best weather predictions and the safety interests of the Georgetown community,” Yohe wrote. “We wanted to provide our students, faculty, staff and visitors with as much advance notice as possible that the weather conditions could adversely impact the campus and the rush hour commute.”
Moving forward, Yohe did not anticipate any changes in university protocol for closings or delayed openings.
Despite the accidents near campus and the continued icy conditions, Monahan praised the university’s response to inclement weather.
“As someone who has lived in the Northeast my entire life, I would say the university has done a very good job especially this past week dealing with the ice and snow. All university roads and sidewalks that I have seen on campus have been plowed and salted,” he wrote.
During times of inclement weather, GERMS takes extra steps to remain open and attentive to calls.
“We often consolidate the entire crew to remain in our office which helps cut down on response times when the ambulance needs to drive slowly when responding to calls,” Monahan wrote. “If there is significant snow on the ground we have the ability to put tire chains on the ambulances to help with driving. We also make sure there is an experienced driver who has had multiple hours of experience driving the ambulance during these times.”

An anthology featuring an essay by Lydia Brown (COL ’15), a student activist for disability rights, will be used as coursework in a new anthropology course called “Disability and Culture,” taught by Professor Sylvia Onder. The anthology, titled “Criptiques,” is a collection of works by disabled writers, “exploring the provocative sides of disability,” according to the publication’s website.
“This is one of relatively few collective pieces of literature exploring a variety of issues in madness and disability in very radical ways that have not frequently been brought together in conversation,” Brown said.
Brown’s essay, “Disability in an Ablelist World,” the first essay Onder assigned her class from the anthology, aims to move beyond the dichotomy between the models of disability as both a medical condition and as a social construct, arguing instead that disability is both biologically embodied and cultural constructed.
“As much as disability is a lived reality in people’s bodies, it is also equally, or just as much, social and cultural,” Brown said.
Caitlin Wood, the anthology’s editor, said that she knew she wanted to include Brown’s work when she was planning “Criptiques.”
“She’s just so brilliant and very much on my wavelength politically,” Wood wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I have tremendous respect for her and her work. I love her chapter in ‘Criptiques,’ ‘Disability in an Ableist World’ because it lays out the basics of ableism and gives historical context to what that really means. It was imperative to me to include discussions of ableism in ‘Criptiques’ and Lydia just nailed it. I was honored to have her in the book.”
Onder also praised Lydia’s essay as being well-suited for a university audience.
“Lydia writes in the way that a reader in a university reads. She knows who the audience is,” Onder said.
Additionally, Brown’s position as both an activist for and a member of the disabled community allows her to offer a unique voice to the discussion, according to Onder.
“Because she’s such an advocate from an insider position, that’s a voice that anthropologists are very interested in hearing, someone that’s from the group speaking about the group,” Onder said.
Wood also emphasized the need for including voices from the disabled community when writing about topics related to disability.
“Often when we hear or read something about disability it’s from a non-disabled person’s perspective, not from someone actually experiencing it. That’s a big problem,” Wood wrote in an email. “The slogan of the disability rights movement is ‘nothing about us without us,’ and I saw an anthology of all-disabled writers as a huge opportunity to exemplify that. Also I wanted to include people who aren’t necessarily involved in academia but deserve to be published because they have something to say.”
Brown explained that the anthology aims to delve into topics that are less discussed, such as disability, in conjunction with sexuality and what it means to experience racism while disabled, citing the higher rates of police violence against individuals who are disabled and black.
“And that’s not a conversation that really is had either in black communities or in disability communities, and black disabled activists have pointed this out repeatedly,” Brown said.
Brown stressed the importance of asking these kinds of questions in order to fully address and combat ableism, or prejudice or discrimination against people with disabilities.
“What are these other more probing questions that make people uncomfortable, even within the disability community, but that we have to talk about and we have to address if we truly want to undo ableism,” Brown said.
Wood praised the anthology for its relevance to Georgetown students and for its authenticity.
“I think everyone should read it but there are themes that would certainly appeal to college students: sexuality, body image, identity, self worth, challenging the status quo and mainstream culture. There’s just so much in there. It’s not the treacly “inspirational” disability representation that you see on TV. It’s the real deal,” Wood wrote.
“Criptiques” can be purchased at the Georgetown University Campus Bookstore as well as on criptiques.com.

Washington, D.C., lost its bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics, with the U.S. Olympic Committee’s announcement last Thursday that it had instead selected Boston to represent the country.
Despite D.C.’s unsuccessful bid, Washington 2024 Vice Chairman Ted Leonsis, majority owner of the Wizards, Capitals, Mystics and Verizon Center, argued that the movement was a positive force in the city.
“Through this endeavor, we saw once again that Washington is home to proud sports fans of all ages and from all walks of life,” Leonsis said in a statement. “I have no doubt that the shared enthusiasm and passion for sports will continue to drive economic growth and opportunities for our community.”
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser echoed Leonsis’ sentiments about the city’s efforts in organizing the Olympic bid.
“I am proud of how the District and the region presented,” Bowser said in a statement. “I want to thank the talented and hardworking Washingtonians whose efforts got us to the short list of American cities.”
Despite the lost bid, Bowser also acknowledged that the city needs to continue to address issues that were brought up during the bid process.
“We must build on the tremendous regional and federal cooperation embodied in the D.C. 2024 Olympic bid, in focusing on the big issues facing our region — transportation, affordable housing and expanding job opportunities for residents in the District of Columbia,” Bowser said.
Although disappointed, Washington 2024 Chairman and CEO Russ Ramsey said he does not regret the D.C. campaign.
“It was an honor to work with dozens of leaders from across the Capitol Region to envision how the Olympic Games would advance the goals of this community,” Ramsey said in a statement posted to the D.C. 2024 Twitter page.
In addition to Boston and D.C., San Francisco and Los Angeles were finalists for the U.S. bid.
The district’s proposal highlighted the city’s role in the international community, as well as its many train and airport hubs.
“We are at the crossroads of the world,” reads D.C. 2024’s website. “Home to international institutions, established destinations, transportation hubs and world-class accommodations.”
Because the 2012 London Games were credited with revitalizing the economy in the city’s poorer areas, D.C. Olympic supporters had hoped the games would benefit poorer areas in the District, including Wards 7 and 8. For example, they aimed to build the Olympic Village at Hill East, the current site of a homeless shelter.
Additionally, the committee looked to construct new venues for the games, considering an aquatics center in Arlington, the main Olympic Stadium on the site of RFK Stadium and a tennis facility east of the Anacostia River. Events such as badminton, gymnastics and weightlifting would have taken place at the pre-existing Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Prince George’s County, Md.
As the majority of new venues that were being considered existed in or near the Capital Beltway, with a special focus on proximity to D.C. Metro stations, no particular plans were specified near the Georgetown area.
Organizers envisioned a total operations budget between $4 billion and $5 billion. In 2012, London had set itself a budget of $4.4 billion but went on to spend nearly $20 billion.
Because of the high expected cost of hosting the games, the proposal drew trepidation from prominent city officials, including D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson. Brian Flahaven, commissioner to the Advisory Neighborhood Commission in Capitol Hill, also criticized the proposal for insufficiently engaging the community.
“We need an opportunity to learn more about your plans and to ask you questions,” Flahaven wrote in a letter to Ramsey in November. “Washington 2024’s Vice Chairman Ted Leonsis said that D.C. would host the ‘most transparent’ games in history. It is in this spirit that we send this invitation.”
Though organizations in Boston similarly protested the potentially prohibitive cost of the Olympics, the ultimately successful bid stressed the strength of the city’s public transit system, which could handle the massive influx of tourists. In contrast to the D.C. proposal, Boston emphasized the area’s universities, envisioning turning college campuses into areas for athlete housing and events, since the games would take place when the city’s thousands of college students are away.
Suffolk Construction Company CEO John Fish, head of the group behind the city’s bid, said college facilities would account for three-quarters of the venues for the Olympics.
Boston will compete against Rome, a yet-to-be-named city in Germany and possibly Paris or a city in South Africa. The IOC is expected to determine the 2024 finalists in the spring of 2016 and elect a host city in September 2017. The U.S. has not hosted a Summer Olympics since 1996 in Atlanta.

Sixteen new buses will be added to the Georgetown University Transportation System fleet this year, the first major upgrade to the bus service in nearly a decade, according to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey.
Six of the new buses are scheduled to go into service Jan. 20 while the remaining 10 buses will be deployed throughout the next few months. As the new buses go into service, the current buses will gradually be retired.
“The existing GUTS fleet is 10 plus years old, so it’s just time,” Morey said. “When you have a fleet that’s that old, you want to modernize it. And that was the driving impetus because from an economical perspective we were spending a lot of resources repairing the buses.”
As of 2009, the GUTS fleet included 29 buses. Although Morey said that the old buses will be sold for their residual value, the university did not yet announce which vehicles would compose the remainder of the GUTS fleet.
The new buses will feature multiple improvements including front, back and on-board cameras; easier to read signage identifying the bus route; bike racks; and fuel efficiency that is nearly twice that of the current buses.
The updated buses will also incorporate exterior artwork from graphic design student Olivia Duff (COL ’16). The artwork will distinctly brand the vehicles as being a part of Georgetown’s fleet, allowing commuters to more easily identify the GUTS buses.
The artwork was produced as part of a competition in professor L. Collier Hyams’ Intro to Graphic Design class, in which more than 100 designs were submitted by students. Those in top management at facilities voted on their favorite designs from the 100 and a short list of 10 options was sent to the student body for a campus-wide vote last spring, according to Meredith Cheney (COL ’16) who oversaw the voting process.
“It kind of happened organically,” Meredith said of the design collaboration. “I was in professor Hyams’ design class last spring. He normally has an art car project, and he works with a local BMW dealer, but this year that fell through. So the GUTS Buses were a prime opportunity to do what he did with art cars, but he just did it with buses instead.”
Duff’s winning design features a silhouette of the Georgetown campus skyline connected by the Key Bridge to a silhouette of the Capitol and Washington Monument.
“I wanted my design to instantly be recognizable as a Georgetown bus, so I used the university’s official colors and font,” Duff wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I liked the idea of Georgetown being a part of D.C., so I incorporated recognizable silhouettes of Healy, the Key Bridge, the Washington Monument. … We are so lucky to be in this amazing city, and the GUTS bus gives us the opportunity to more fully explore it.”
Cheney said that she hopes to see more collaboration between the university and students for art projects.
“To be quite honest, I believe this is how it should be because students have the ideas and the administration, faculty and staff are the institutional bodies on campus,” Cheney said. “And so bridging those is great. … I would love to see this collaboration happen more often.”
Georgetown faculty, staff and students take more than 2 million passenger trips annually with the GUTS fleet, according to Vice President Morey. To put that number in perspective, the two Circulator routes that service Georgetown average about 2.7 million rides a year. The Circulator is run by the District Department of Transportation.
Faculty and staff are the main users of the GUTS Bus, followed by MedStar employees, graduate students and then undergraduate students.
“From an overall sustainability perspective, running an effective transportation system is critical to our operations,” Morey said.
Scott Syroka (COL ’16), who commutes to Dupont Circle every day using the GUTS Bus, said that he approves of the updates to the fleet.
“I certainly think anything more fuel efficient and better for the environment is a win,” Syroka said. “[The new buses] look more modern than what they were before and having increased fuel efficiency is good. Especially being a university where we have Jesuit values, [we should] take care of the earth that God’s provided us, so I think lessening emissions is one way to do that.”
The new buses are only the first of a number of updates to the GUTS Bus service that will occur in the near future. In October a new GUTS Bus turnaround in front of McDonough Arena will open, allowing for a centralized location for loading and unloading GUTS Buses on campus. Currently buses pick up and drop off at multiple locations.
Construction on the turnaround will begin in March and will include a renovation to the campus’ Canal Road entrance.
Once the new GUTS Bus fleet is completely phased in, a blessing of the new buses will take place in Healy Circle at an undetermined date in the future, according to Cheney.

University Information Services opened its third service desk on the third floor of Lauinger Library last Wednesday after a three-month pilot program. The walk-up desk will be the third of its kind, joining a walk up desk in St. Mary’s Hall and a 24-hour call-in desk.
The desk will be open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends.
“The added walk-up service option that we’re putting in Lauinger for students, faculty and staff will be helpful in providing them the service they need,” Lisa Davis, chief information officer, said. “Our UIS service desk re[solves] technical support for all issues.”
The service desk will be able to address most student needs regarding university technology issues. However, students will have to call the 24-hour help desk for password reset due to privacy concerns.
According to Jennifer Smith, Coordinator of Communications, Outreach and Programming at Lauinger, library staff and Information Services had been working together during the implementation of h.print last year. Because various issues with the software arose during the implementation of that program, library staff requested an increased UIS presence.
“Because it was such a big transition, we decided together that it would be helpful to have UIS on the ground here,” Smith said. “That’s when they set up the pilot.”
In addition, Davis explained that multiple technological issues were being reported to the Lauinger circulation desk, which is unequipped to deal with them.
“A lot of these issues were being escalated to the Lauinger reference desk,” Davis said. “We had continual service issues with printer support to restock the paper, paper jams [and] assisting students with basic printing questions.”
The pilot system, which lasted three months, allowed UIS to determine if a new location would prove useful for the university community. According to Davis, the program tested the demand for the desk as well as the student response.
“Within two days the Lauinger staff reported to us that they had already seen a significant reduction in the number of technology questions,” Davis said of the pilot. “That was already a positive outcome.”
Davis said that the desk received about 688 requests for help during that three-month span, which was a larger number than UIS expected. Due to the high volume, the need for the desk was confirmed.
“We felt that number justified a need to put in a walk-up service desk,” Davis said.
Other than the addition of a few outlets next to the service desk, there are no extra costs that will be incurred by the university, Davis said. One student working at the St. Mary’s location was reassigned to the Lauinger desk but Davis did not indicate how many other students are currently employed at the desk alongside the transferred student.
According to Smith, the partnership between UIS and Lauinger has gone well for the past three months.
“We’re very happy to have them here,” Smith said. “We’re all about providing the best service possible, and having them here makes it easier to provide service, particularly for printing.”
Davis said she is eager to work more frequently and closely with Lauinger staff in the future.
“What we always strive to do is improve our customer service,” Davis said. “[At Lauinger] we are meeting [students’ and faculties’] needs and providing the best service that we can.”
Aditya Pande (SFS ’18) was supportive of the decision to add the new desk to the library.
“This makes it really convenient now when I’m in the library to have some place to go to fix my computer problems,” Pande said. “There hasn’t been a technology help center that has been as convenient as this one.”

Georgetown University Medical Center researchers Anatoly Dritschilo and Richard Schlegel were named 2014 Fellows of the National Academy of Inventors, recognizing their respective work with cancer treatment and the vaccine for the human papillomavirus.
The NAI recognizes distinguished inventors from over 150 prestigious research universities, as well as governmental and non-profit research organizations, highlighting inventions “that have made a tangible impact on quality of life, economic development, and the welfare of society,” according to a press release from the organization.
GUMC Executive Vice President of Health Science and School of Medicine Executive Dean Howard Federoff commended the two Georgetown researchers for their accomplishment.
“The academy’s recognition of these two fine scientists is an excellent choice,” he said. “Dr. Schlegel and Dr. Dritschilo represent the forward-thinking scientists that Georgetown has been so successful at recruiting and retaining. Their vision is inspiring.”
Dritschilo, chair of radiation medicine at the GUMC and the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, was recognized for his discoveries of molecular targets and drugs for cancer radiation sensitization, for which he has acquired several patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
“It’s always exciting to have recognition for the value of the work that you’ve been doing, and recognition by others. This fellowship award certainly provides that,” Dritschilo said. “I will continue working on the research I’m doing. This doesn’t change our motivation or goals.”
Dritschilo’s most recent research focuses on a new category of drugs that are being investigated for various applications of treating cancers. His newest work involves taking these drugs and developing them to effectively improve cancer patients’ outcomes after therapy.
“For the past 10 years, I’ve been working on drugs that sensitize cancer cells to radiation. There are several patents that the university owns that I was a co-inventor on,” he said.
Dritschilo, who has worked at the Georgetown University Medical Center since 1979, has focused his research on prostate cancer treatment and overcoming cancer cell resistance to radiation therapy. Dritschilo spearheaded the radiation biology research program at GUMC that has received over $30 million in funding in the last 30 years from the National Institutes of Health and Industry.
Schlegel, the Oscar B. Hunter Chair of Pathology at GUMC and fellow member of the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, was commended for his expertise in human papillomavirus.
As HPV causes nearly all cervical cancers, Schlegel co-developed technology for the Gardasil vaccine, a vaccine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006 to protect against cervical cancer. Since the inception of the Gardasil vaccine, cervical cancer in the United States. has dropped by 56 percent. The Presidents’ Cancer Panel pointed to these HPV vaccinations as some of the “most profound opportunities in cancer prevention today.”
Following his research with the Gardasil vaccine, Schlegel remained hopeful that future developments would have a pivotal impact on medicine.
“It is an honor to receive this award for our HPV vaccine work and recognition for the positive impact that the vaccine will have on global health, for both women and men,” Schlegel said in a GUMC press release.
The NAI will host the 2014 induction ceremony at the California Institution of Technology in Pasadena on March 20, 2015. Fellows will receive trophies, medals and rosette pins to recognize their exceptional achievements.

Cups for Campus, a new program initiated by School of Nursing and Health Studies students, is a program that, if initiated, would provide free cups and health education to students in order to prevent the spread of diseases at campus parties.
The group is currently fundraising and looking for partners, working with the university’s Health Education Services which has provided them with guidance and advice. According to co-founder Rachel Skonecki (NHS ’17), the group must raise $6,000 to begin its services, which will allow it to provide marketing, educational health pamphlets and 6,000 cups a month for an entire school year.
Cups for Campus tested its service in November with a pilot program. The group handed out cups at the Hoya Health Hut in Red Square with monetary support from Health Education Services.
“It was very successful,” Graduate Assistant and Health Educator at HES Victoria Somerville wrote in an email. “We loved the idea of illness prevention, but we are unable to take the project on under our department until the group finds additional co-sponsors.”
The idea for Cups for Campus originated as an assignment in the class Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, which had inspired ideas for other campus initiatives, such as SafeRides, the Georgetown University Farmers Market and Grab ‘n’ Go, according to Cups for Campus co-founder Greg Jarvis (NHS ’17).
The concept for Cups for Campus arose in part because of the death of Andrea Jaime (NHS ’17) due to bacterial meningitis in September, according to co-founder Chantal Durgana (NHS ’17).
“When [Jaime] passed away, I think it affected a lot of us,” Durgana said. “Things like meningitis are so easily preventable and it just sucks that these things are so fatal.”
According to Skonecki, students became more careful with their cup sharing practices for only a short time after Jaime’s death.
“After Andrea died, [students] were really aware,” Skonecki said. “They were trying to do Sharpies on cups and not share but after a week or two people just moved on. That served as a really unfortunate and powerful teaching moment but students still think that they are invincible.”
If Cups for Campus receives sufficient funding, they intend to set up a walk-in service where, at designated hours, students can pick up cups and informational pamphlets about the dangers of sharing cups.
“We’re trying to create this system that has the least amount of barriers possible,” Durgana said. “So the way that we’ve been working on it is that these students can literally just walk through the door, ask for a set of cups, take them home, and they can do with them what they please.”
The cups will come with an informational packet that explains the dangers of sharing cups, which include putting sharers at risk of contracting diseases and viruses such as mononucleosis, strep throat and influenza.
“When you do get a stack of cups, we’ll provide you with an information packet,” Skonecki said, “We’ll get you in the door [by] promising free cups, but then we’ll give you information to try to change your habits.”
Although their service is to provide free cups, the leaders are also trying to confront the larger issue of awareness by focusing on education.
“We’re trying to make college students aware that they are susceptible to this disease and then empower them and give them the tools to have this effect on their health status stop,” co-founder Devin Holmes (NHS ’17) said.
Cups for Campus members said that many drinking activities students participate in, particularly beer pong, cause the spread of germs and disease. Holmes was convinced to help found the group after seeing a simulation game of beer pong set up by George Washington University students.
“They had eight players play for an hour and played six rounds and they swabbed the cups after,” Holmes said. “There was E. coli and strep. It was disgusting.”
According to Holmes, students often forego healthy practices to avoid purchasing more plastic cups, which cost 14.3 cents per 18 oz cup at Vital Vittles and 15.9 cents per 18 oz cup at Wisemiller’s Grocery and Deli on 36th Street. Because of their relatively high cost, Holmes said that students believe that lightly washing the cups and sharing them will be most efficient.
“They’re expensive,” Holmes said.“A pack of 50 is seven or eight bucks without tax. And [students say], ‘Alright, I’ll buy one pack and we’ll just reuse them and rinse them out.”
Rachel Smith (COL ’18) said that she thinks that the program could prevent students from getting sick.
“I think it’s a good idea,” Smith said. “I got mono this September. It was not fun at all, and I think it was from sharing cups. I think it’s probably a problem that happens at all schools. I think it’s something that’s bound to happen.”
Jessica Uy (SFS ’16) said that increasing the number of cups at events may not stop students from sharing, which has become a habit at parties.
“At parties, obviously people aren’t paying attention to that kind of stuff, especially when that’s probably your [lowest] priority at that point,” Uy said. “Obviously, I think it would improve a little awareness or education on the issue, but I’m just not sure of how much would change in actuality.”

Following December’s trial run of the meal exchange program at Hoya Court, Aramark is evaluating the business implications of implementing a full-scale program in the future.
After months of planning by Auxiliary Services and Aramark, a trial run was held in early December, allowing students to use their meal swipes at Elevation Burger, Subway and Salad Creations at Hoya Court from Dec. 8 to Dec. 13.
Aramark Marketing Manager Adam Solloway said that the pilot program was well received by students.
“Overall, the meal exchange pilot was positively received. There were some ups and downs for us and for students, but most students who participated in the pilot seemed to be happy,” Solloway wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Solloway, Aramark observed that the staff at Hoya Court were quick to adapt to the sudden influx of customers.
“There was a significant increase in business that was unusual for the team at that time of the day,” Solloway wrote. “The Hoya Court team was very dedicated and executed the pilot program successfully in what was unchartered territory.”
Solloway said he could not provide specific details about the cost of the program or the revenue made from the pilot program.
“We are analyzing the business impact from the pilot,” Solloway wrote. “There are many financial and operational logistics that need to be factored into implementing any meal exchange program.”
In particular, he cited various problems from the pilot program that need to be rectified such as accounting for service speed.
“There is a significant financial impact that needs to be mitigated in order to successfully implement the program. It is also important to keep in mind that there are thousands of non-meal plan customers on campus, making the speed of service and operational capacity aspects challenging to resolve,” Solloway wrote.
GUSA Secretary for Dining and Auxiliary Services Nicolette Brownstein (SFS ’17) has worked with Auxiliary Services to create a permanent program, agreed that while a full-scale meal exchange program is desirable, there are several issues that must first be resolved.
“It’s something that we all want to happen. It’s something that I think the auxiliary and dining people really want to happen,” Brownstein said. “They are very receptive to and interested in [the program] personally.”
Although students can currently exchange meals at the on-campus Einstein Bros., after a student initiative spearheaded by GUSA in 2013 approved the meal exchange at the bagel stores, students are excited by the potential for more options. Ken Nunnenkamp (MSB ’16) echoed Brownstein’s interest in implementing the program in the future.
“I think that’d be awesome. I don’t have a meal plan as a junior, but I would buy a meal plan for that,” Nunnenkamp said.
However, Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18) said that Aramark should make certain adjustments for the full-scale program.
“I think they would definitely need to restructure certain things, but it’s definitely manageable,” Shinbrot said. “I also think they should expand the options. It shouldn’t be just a six-inch sub. That was absurd.”

Georgetown’s Women in Leadership Initiative and the Georgetown chapter of the Financial Management Association hosted a panel and networking event Thursday in the Rafik B. Hariri Building about women and their roles in the financial sector, specifically on Wall Street.
The panel, which was moderated by professor Lynn Doran from the McDonough School of Business, has been planned and moderated by Doran for the past five years. Many of the panelists were Georgetown alumni, with representatives from various investment banks including Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Blackrock, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and UBS.
Doran said that she placed a high importance on featuring Georgetown alumni among the panelists.
“I think our students can better relate to the panelists since they were once students at Georgetown themselves,” Doran wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is also important for our students to see how accomplished and successful these women have been. It allows students to imagine their own similar success in the financial world.”
The first section of the panel, which was split into two parts, focused on internship and job applications. Four panelists spoke, and each was introduced by a female Georgetown student who had either participated in an internship for the firm the panelist represented and had accepted a job after graduation, or had an internship lined up with the firm for the coming year.
Many of the women spoke about their personal experiences applying for their jobs and internships, as well as their experiences sifting through resumes and cover letters when hiring for their firms now.
The panelists spoke about the importance of researching the company for which one is applying, memorizing and polishing one’s resume, and taking advantage of the vast number of networking and recruiting opportunities available on campus.
The second panel, titled “Tips for Success in Your Internship or Job,” featured six panelists who gave insight into achieving success in their fields.
The panelists emphasized the importance of confidence, proactive networking and asking questions at one’s job.
Though the event was entitled “Women on Wall Street,” speakers emphasized that a woman’s experience working in the financial sector is not much different from that of a man.
In one exchange, Doran asked the panel what specific skill sets women need in order to be successful on Wall Street.
“They are exactly the same as men,” Meghan O’Connor (MSB ‘07) of Citibank said.
Karin Ross (MSB ’04) of JP Morgan Chase followed up to argue that women are more skilled than men in some aspects of their jobs in the financial sector.
“One of the questions for this panel we have gotten to think about was, ‘Are there any challenges you think women face being on Wall Street?’ My response to that question was going to be I actually think it’s a huge advantage,” Ross said.
Ross added that as women typically connect better on a personal level with people, they also build better relationships with clients. She called on the women in the audience to use this skill to succeed in their financial jobs in the future.
After the panel, the audience moved to the Fisher Colloquium in the McDonough School of Business for a networking reception with the panelists.
According to Doran, the reception was a way for interested firms to meet with current Georgetown students.
“The firms heavily recruit our students and, in most cases, Georgetown is one of only a handful of core schools targeted by the firms,” Doran said.
Doran attributed Georgetown students’ academic and extracurricular involvement to their success in finding jobs in investment banking.
“There are several characteristics our business students tend to have that are valued by the firms,” Doran said. “In addition to the required academic excellence, Georgetown’s business students tend to be well-rounded, active in campus activities, have leadership experience and possess an ethical underpinning that is valued on Wall Street.”
Misty Li (MSB ’17) attended the panel and said she appreciated that the panelists were Georgetown alumni.
“The fact that the majority of the panelists were Georgetown alum made them that much more relatable,” Li said. “Hearing them speak about how their experiences at Georgetown prepared them for the professional world was reassuring.”
Li also said that she was inspired by the women in the panel who excelled in their careers.
“You always hear about how Wall Street and finance in general is a male-dominated industry,” Li said. “However, as a woman who is interested in finance, I attended this event to see the path that women who were once in my shoes have taken to end up at their current positions.”

Timothy Shriver, chairman of the board of directors of the Special Olympics, shared reflections on his new book, “Fully Alive: Discovering What Matters Most,” and his love of community service for others Thursday evening in Riggs Library.
Shriver is a social leader, educator, activist, film producer and business entrepreneur. After a long career as an educator, Shriver became president and CEO of Special Olympics in 1996, leading a national movement that promotes the inclusion and respect for people with intellectual disabilities. Special Olympics organizes more than 70,000 competitions per year, serving more than 4.4 million families in over 170 countries.
Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs Senior Fellow at the Paul Elie moderated the event, and University President John J. DeGioia introduced Shriver.
“Tonight’s conversation will gain unique insight into Tim’s book, as our two guests explore how our spiritual and religious lives sustain and enrich our imaginations, our sense of purpose and how faith shapes and is even shaped by the work we do in our daily lives,” DeGioia said.
Shriver first interacted with mentally disabled children his own age at Camp Shriver, the summer camp founded by Shriver’s mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, at their Maryland home. Shriver’s mother was passionate about combatting the stigma surrounding intellectual disability due to the trauma of seeing her own sister Rosemary, who suffered from intellectual disabilities, continuously rejected by society.
In part Shriver wanted to tell his story because he said he felt like people misunderstood his work.
“People would say, ‘Oh you’re involved in Special Olympics, that’s so nice, that’s so sweet what you do for those people … you must be a Catholic,’” Shriver said. “In some ways it was humiliating to hear all that. It was well-intentioned, those ideas, but it was so disparaging of the athletes and the experience I was having. The experience I was having was cracking my heart open, my mind open. It was challenging me to rethink everything.”
Shriver said that he believes the world is now shifting to become more understanding of those with disabilities.
“I do feel like we are at a point in time as a culture where we are trying to get out of the old models of social justice that emphasize moral imperatives, ethical responsibility, guilt, duty, transactional relationships and into ones that are much more rooted in human equality,” Shriver said.
After college, Shriver was consumed by questions about the source of pain in the world and what his role was in combating that pain. During this time Shriver found comfort in his faith, focusing on self-emptying silent prayer. Through reflection Shriver came to a realization that he had to discover God living within himself.
“I really thought my job was to become like other people,” Shriver said. “It never occurred to me until then that my mission was to be me.”
Shriver started to ask if he was educating his heart as much as his mind and found that his heart was being educated through Special Olympics.
“It occurred to me, I’m getting schooled in the heart,” Shriver said. “I’m finding different ways in which power and joy emerge, different ways of identifying suffering, different ways of feeling solidarity with people. This is amazing.”
Shriver said he experienced that gift of joy in gyms across the country where Special Olympics events took place.
“It’s as though you have crossed a fear barrier, the judgment is removed,” Shriver said. “It’s all of a sudden like someone has pulled back the veil and said, ‘This is the place where we play without judgment; we keep score, but not to evaluate; we win and lose without any degradation of the opponent; no one is knocked down.’”
Shriver also spoke about the darker side of intellectual disability. He told stories about health screenings among the athletes, which revealed that up to 50 percent of the athletes screened randomly have the wrong glasses or no glasses because they are not thought of as mattering enough to see well.
“The athletes of Special Olympics come from a place of enormous vulnerability, dependence, trust, openness and discrimination,” Shriver said. “They have experienced the most vicious forms of cultural and social discrimination that exist in the world today, most of it unnoticed. They know something of the pain of exclusion. And yet once invited into an environment in which the context is not judgmental they are almost invariably, passionately welcoming, which is an extraordinary irony.”
Shriver said “Fully Alive” is not a book about Special Olympics; it is a book about what the athletes taught him. He said he hopes silence and service are the two lessons that will be taken away from the discussion, adding that the only way to find yourself is to give yourself away.
Hannah Collins (COL ’18) attended the event and said she was touched by the talk.
“People have been telling me a lot lately, similar to what [Shriver] said — that you have to learn to love yourself in order to love everyone and everything unconditionally — so I feel like that’s being reinforced here,” Collins said.
Georgetown Student Athlete Advisory Committee Special Olympics Co-Coordinator Sophia Gargicevich Martins de Almeida (COL ’15) said she wished for more involvement from the Georgetown community.
“Right now it’s a small group of people that [are involved in the Special Olympics] here, but I hope that Georgetown can utilize everything they have a little bit more efficiently in the future … it’s exciting to see there are other people interested,” Gargicevich Martins de Almeida said.

More than 300 Georgetown University students, faculty and staff have signed up for car-sharing service Car2Go through the university’s new partnership, which was launched in early December, according to Car2Go Communications Manager Adrianne Andang.
Car2Go is a car-sharing service that allows members to rent Smart cars by the hour in locations across Washington. As part of the partnership, four permanent Car2Go parking spaces were established on campus near Village C and in Lot G behind North Kehoe Field.
So far, the Car2Go spaces on campus have seen heavy usage with about 125 trips a day occurring to and from campus, according to Andang.
Georgetown is already partnered with Zipcar, a by-the-hour car rental company that has eight cars permanently located on campus as well as hundreds of vehicles throughout the district. But unlike Zipcar, Car2Go does not require users to return cars to the same location they originated.
Associate Vice President of Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese wrote in an email to the hoya that the new Car2Go partnership will not affect on the university’s offering of Zipcars.
“[W]e are proud to offer both options for the community,” Wiese wrote. “Both companies are great groups to partner with and offer different programs for members.”
Car2Go was originally introduced to the district in 2012 with a fleet of 200 cars but has since grown to 500 cars.
“D.C. has been hugely successful since launch with over 44,000 members, who have shared access to 500 vehicles within a 53 square mile Home Area,” Andang wrote in an email to The Hoya. “D.C. has the third highest Car2Go membership base and the third largest Home Area in the U.S.”
Though Car2Go offers the ease of renting without a reservation, the service is limited by the size of its Smart cars. For students who rely on carrying more than two occupants or large baggage, Zipcar may remain the only feasible by-the-hour car rental option on campus.
Wiese wrote that Car2Go would do its best to ensure that cars are always on campus since trips do not need to be round-trip but did not indicate how the company would do so.
As part of the partnership, the regular $35 sign up fee is waived for students. Cars can be rented for 31 cents per minute or $14.99 an hour not including tax. Gas and insurance are included in the rental price.
Car2Go will also be providing scholarship funds to Georgetown through the partnership. Wiese did not disclose the exact amount of the funding, but in a campus-wide email sent Dec. 2, Wiese wrote that the money would be distributed by Auxiliary Services and the GU Office of Sustainability.
“This transportation option not only offers simplicity and flexibility for our students, but sustainability as well,” Wiese wrote in the campus-wide email.
Kristin Green (SFS ’18), who is already a Zipcar member, said that she plans to sign up for Car2Go because of its flexibility.
“I think it’s great. I think the problem with ZipCar is the fact that you have to return the car to the same place you found it,” Green said. “That’s really frustrating. There have been a lot of times where I’ve wanted to use a Zipcar for a road trip or some kind of journey where I might take the train back or an alternate form of transportation.”
Ryan Wolfe (COL ’18), another Zipcar member, said that he does not plan on utilizing the new Car2Go program because of its costs and limitations.
“What I like about Zipcar is that it’s flexible with what kind of vehicle you can get,” Wolfe said. “And if you need the car for a couple of hours, it’s still not that expensive, whereas with this car, if you’re going to use it for more than a half-hour, it’s going to start being kind of expensive. And because it’s only a Smart car it’s not very flexible as far as where you can go.”
