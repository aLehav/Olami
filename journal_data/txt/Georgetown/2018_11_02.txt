Georgetown’s Jewish community and its allies are calling for action against antisemitism in the wake of Saturday’s mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.
Robert Bowers entered the Tree of Life synagogue with an assault rifle and three handguns, killing 11 and injuring nine on the morning of Oct. 27. Bowers has since pleaded not guilty to the 44 counts a grand jury indicted him of on Wednesday.
The shooting marks the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the United States, according to The Washington Post.
Georgetown University Jewish Life, along with Jewish student groups Alpha Epsilon Pi, Jewish Student Association and J Street U, hosted a vigil Saturday night in Makóm, Georgetown University’s Jewish community’s gathering space, in order to mourn those killed in Pittsburgh.
The Georgetown University Office of Campus Ministry held an interfaith service of mourning and solidarity in Dahlgren Quad on Monday afternoon. Community members grieved those who died on Saturday but also encouraged renewed activism against antisemitism.
Paige Harouse (COL ’19), who works for the Office of Campus Ministry, said that while solidarity is important, it is not enough.
“Every day of the year, we, as Jews or as allies, must act,” Harouse said. “Call out the antisemitism of your family, your friends, your ‘groups.’ Don’t talk about the ‘globalists’ or the ‘Zionists’ or the ‘urbanites.’”
Avis Lis (COL ’19), the president of Georgetown’s Jewish Student Association, said he similarly appreciates the support from the Georgetown community, but hopes Hoyas take further action to combat antisemitism.
“We name this shooting for what it was: not an isolated act by an insane individual, but rather an anti-Semitic hate crime,” Lis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We call on all students to take action. Learn about antisemitism. Speak out against those who vilify capitalists, communists, globalists, or Zionists, when they really mean Jews. Raise your voice to eradicate anti-Semitic language in your community. For if not now, when?”
Both Jewish Life at Georgetown and the Georgetown Israel Alliance wrote that despite the immense loss the global Jewish community has suffered, it will find strength in its unity in the face of hate crimes and efforts to tear it apart.
“The Jewish community at Georgetown and Jewish communities across the globe are all overcome, and yet we will continue to stand firm and to stand proudly together,” Jewish Life at Georgetown University wrote in a statement published on their website.
GIA President Ben Goodman (SFS ’20) expressed solidarity with those affected by the shooting and said that action must be taken to combat antisemitism. (Full Disclosure: Goodman is a deputy editor for the Sports section of The Hoya.)
“We are devastated by last weekend’s senseless massacre, but we resolve to move forward and continue to confront antisemitism and stand by the Jewish people worldwide,” Goodman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We were comforted to see an outpouring of support in Israel, where vigils were held in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Whatever country we reside in, the jewish people are one, which we are reminded of now more than ever.”
The directors of Orthodox Christian Life,  Protestant Ministry and Catholic Life at Georgetown V. Rev. David Pratt, Rev. Bryant Oskvig and Dr. Jim Wickman jointly wrote an open letter to the Georgetown community condemning antisemitism and growing social fragmentation. The directors warned against letting such divisions erode senses of community at Georgetown and around the world.
“We must affirm the truth that persons of different religions and different races can live together in authentic community with the blessings of peace and mutual affirmation,” the directors wrote.  “We need to embrace this benevolent version of community, a version in which we recognize and care for the needs and wounds of one another, no matter our differences. By this, we can offer light against the current shadow being cast upon our world.”
Professors also have a responsibility to stand up to antisemitism and to radical biases in their classrooms, Director of the Center for Jewish Civilization Jacques Berlinerblau said.
“Now is not the time for platitudes or euphemism,” Berlinerblau said in an interview with The Hoya. “I really think professors need to put themselves out there.”
The United States has failed to properly to acknowledge the extent to which antisemitism is present and alive today and needs now more than recognize the threat it poses, according to Berlinerblau.
“Enough with prayers. We need analysis,” Berlinerblau said. “The issue of antisemitism and bigotry in the United States is bigger than we care to imagine. It’s not a small phenomenon.”
In the face of such a tragedy, however, the Jewish community at Georgetown has expressed its resolve and belief in the possibility of change. Though bigotry persists, so, too, will the jewish faith and its followers, Harouse said.
“This past Shabbat was a grim reminder that the tensions aren’t going anywhere,” Harouse said. “That we’re gathered here today, tears still fresh, is a testament to our strength and perseverance. The tensions may still be here, but we are too, with a hope that’s been burning for some 2000 years. Am Yisrael Chai.”

Hailing from Brownsville, Texas, Gilbert Saldaña’s (COL ’19) political views transformed upon his arrival at Georgetown University, a diverse community compared to his hometown.
“I came from a very homogenous community where it was 90 percent Hispanic,” Saldaña said. “Before I came to college, personally I considered myself fiscally conservative and socially liberal. I tell people now I don’t think that can work. I don’t think those two things can work out.”
Forming friendships with people he did not encounter at home also changed Saldaña’s perspective on social issues.
“One thing that I did change my mind on was LGBTQ+ issues for sure, just because, it wasn’t a big thing where I came from,” Saldaña said. “One of my roommates was part of that community, and I learned a lot from him.”
Now a senior, Saldaña is still unsure about all the specifics of his political creed, but he remains open to learning about different perspectives. As president of the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition, Saldaña is exposed to a range of opinions — libertarian, socialist, even apolitical — and aims to foster substantive conversations like those that changed his own mind.
This willingness to engage with diverse opinions characterizes most Georgetown students, according to Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), director of the Georgetown Institute for Politics and Public Service. Elleithee noted the stark contrast between his job at Georgetown and his “side gig,” as one of the few Democratic contributors on Fox News.
“I come off the air and I look at my Twitter feed; it’s full of people saying, ‘I don’t know what Fox has you on; why don’t you go back to CNN or MSNBC where you belong,’” Elleithee said. “What gives me hope, and what I see differently here, and why we get so many political practitioners applying to be fellows in our program, is because I think the students here are more willing to listen, and they’re more willing to engage, and they’re less willing to feel comfortable isolated from one another.”
Partisanship has intensified as the United States approaches the midterm elections on Nov. 6. Members of each  party see the other as more ideological and extreme than their own, according to a Pew Research report. Although often characterized as imperfect by students, political discourse at Georgetown still contrasts with national attitudes, perhaps because of the inherent connections within the university’s ideologically diverse student body.
Campus Political Diversity
Like Saldaña, Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22) and Monique Wilson (COL ’22) encountered new perspectives at Georgetown. The pair come from predictably blue regions — Southern California and New York City, respectively.
“Everyone is pretty much either Democrat or won’t talk about it,” Sanchez said.
Arriving at GU Politics’ pre-orientation program “Campaign Bootcamp,” which aims to give students a behind-the-scene view of campaigning, altered their views. Exposure to more political perspectives from her future classmates forced Sanchez to re-evaluate her beliefs.
“We were talking about racial injustice and at the same time the opioid crisis and how those two are intertwining. But then someone from Missouri actually said, ‘Well, the opioid crisis is a very big deal among white people as well; it’s not just a racial issue,’” Sanchez said. “That was really eye-opening, to see the different perspectives on the same issue.”
The U.S. opioid epidemic plays a significant role in the nation’s addiction crisis, which has led to a record 72,000 drug overdose deaths in 2017. Of those deaths, opioids were responsible for 49,000, according to AFP.
Before coming to Georgetown, Wilson’s main impressions of Republicans revolved around “the mess that’s going on with this administration.”
“I never had Republican friends. Then I came here,” Wilson said. “I just kind of assumed that Republicans are always very far right and I would never have anything in common with them.”
For many, personal relationships facilitate meaningful engagement with different perspectives.
Georgetown University College Democrats Chair Maria Cornell (SFS ’20) and Georgetown University College Republicans President Jake Lyons (COL ’20) describe themselves as good friends who frequently discuss their ideological differences. Despite the friendship, neither has converted the other. When Lyons suggested their conversation may have moderated Cornell, she laughed out a resolute “no.”
Cornell said growing up liberal ideas in conservative Idaho solidified her core beliefs; coming to Georgetown clarified her reasoning.
“I came in already with a very good understanding of conservative beliefs and why conservatives tend to believe what they believe,” Cornell said. “If anything, I’ve probably gone more left, but in a much more educated way. I’ve been able to gain more nuance in my beliefs and arguments.”
Lyons agreed, explaining how he and Cornell rely on each other’s perspective.
“I will see very pressing topical liberal issues or things that Democrats as a whole are typically going off on, and I’m not hearing the reasoned side of it,” Lyons said. “I’ll go to Maria and I’ll be like, ‘Give me some nuance; give me the actual reason behind this.’”
Limited Club Cooperation
Cornell’s and Lyon’s organizations have also embraced bipartisan cooperation: GUCD and GUCR have hosted several events together this year, including a homecoming barbeque, annual debates and a commemoration of Sept. 11 on Healy Lawn. They also work with GBC to host consensus-focused roundtables, most recently a conversation about the opioid epidemic Oct. 25.
Even if the roundtable has no clear resolution, finding common ground is productive, according to Lyons.
“Polarization feeds into the deterioration of civil discourse in our nation,” Lyons said. “By coming more to the middle, it would inherently improve civil discourse more because there would be more middle grounds on which to agree upon.”
GUCR Vice President Peter Hamilton (COL ’20) questioned the effectiveness of roundtables, which he characterized as full of qualifiers and fear of stepping on toes. Hamilton instead called for more debates.
“A great debate is going to inform you so much more about two different positions than a roundtable. A roundtable is built around building consensus,” Hamilton said. “But that’s not really going to give you an in-depth understanding of an issue.”
Hamilton expressed concern that private conversations and stereotypes undermine public efforts for productive dialogue, recounting public insults from upperclassmen and corrupted first impressions because of his conservative views.
Joseph Murgida (COL ’21), a centrist member of GBC, agreed Republicans are less likely to speak up. The fear of being wrong — among all students, not just conservatives — can allow for homogeneous discussions, according to Murgida.
“Because we are Georgetown students, we always want to be right, and thus avoid difficult conversations in which we can be proven wrong,” Murgida said. “That’s what’s created a culture of polarization. We talk to only the people we agree with because they’ll tell us we’re right.”
Understand, NOT Convert
Having a space for conversation and understanding others’ motivations is more important than changing minds, Cornell said.
“Personally, I don’t see people going to the extremes of each side as being the problem in our national discourse right now,” Cornell said. “It’s more how those fringes interact with each other, and the impact they have on communities.”
Elleithee argued the tone of the national discussion has distorted partisanship.
“I don’t think changing one’s mind should always be the goal. I don’t hate partisanship. I think parties are important,” Elleithee said. “I think having two competing visions as to how to get to a shared world, a shared goal, is a healthy thing. The competition for ideas should make for better policy, should make for better government. The problem is the competition itself is no longer healthy.”
Founded under the McCourt School for Public Policy in 2015, GU Politics has a slogan that responds to such tension: “Public service is a good thing. Politics can be, too.” In one of their signature political discourse programs, GU Politics recruits five political practitioners as fellows each semester to host weekly discussions with students. Anyone can show up, and partisan fellows often attract attendees from the opposite side of the political spectrum, according to Elleithee. Elleithee referred to an example of a progressive student who never missed Grover Norquist’s discussion section.
Last semester, GU Politics expanded its political discourse initiatives with a pilot version of Dialogue and Dine, which has hosted meals for approximately 45 students in total. The dinner strives to facilitate conversation in an ideologically diverse setting. The program has plans to expand the number of dinners hosted, according to Student Coordinator Katie Rogers (MSB ’19).
“The reason we came up with Dialogue and Dine was because we felt while we had discussion groups and did try to foster that sense of discourse, we felt that there was an element missing,” Roger said.
Politics — Minus Parties
Not all political organizations are tethered to current events, and some distance from national partisanship can stimulate productive conversation, according to Georgetown’s main politically neutral clubs.
The Tocqueville Forum for Political Understanding, a political philosophy club, hosts a weekly Friday reading group. Its theory- and principle-based discussions foster understanding among attendees, who range from libertarians to staunch socialists, according to Tocqueville Forum President Micah Musser (COL ’19).
Issues-based political discourse can be counterproductive to fostering mutual understanding, Musser said.
“We generally talk about principles, not issues. I think a lot of political conversation is very issues-based. If abortion comes up, people are on one side or another, it’s a very issue-centered topic,” Musser said. “We talk about more abstract principles, which impacts how you think about issues, but it’s a way usually people have more ability to enter into a very understanding space.”
The Philodemic Society, Georgetown’s nonpartisan campus debating society, also operates its debates independently of the two-party framework; participants choose to speak in favor or against a given resolution. While not all topics are explicitly political — a Nov. 1 debate centered on the resolution “ignorance is bliss” — others address politically salient issues like gender-based quotas.
Choosing a broad range of debate topics, moving away from a competitive structure and building a community contributes to substantive discussion, according to Philodemic Society President Kathryn Li (COL ’19).
“You have to be able to find value in other people’s opinions if you’re going to come and have a good time,” Li said. “It’s a place where it’s encouraged to change your mind. There’s no party line; there’s no dogma that you need to show loyalty to.”
Navigating National Politics 
On Nov. 6, GU Politics will host a Bipartisan Breakfast, several speaker events and an election watch party in conjunction with student groups like GBC, GUCD and GUCR. The celebratory events are a very visible sign of bipartisan cooperation that may not reflect the whole nation.
“Any college campus is oftentimes divorced to some extent from the real world,” Elleithee said.
However, he also expressed hope that Georgetown students will bring bipartisanship to their future leadership.
“This is true to your generation more broadly, that is, a much more collaborative and cooperative approach,” Elleithee said. “People are more willing to listen and engage and understand than my generation is.”

An Office of Mission and Ministry fundraising email sent Oct. 25 that linked the importance of financial donations to Georgetown University with the Catholic Church’s ongoing sexual abuse crisis has come under criticism from alumni and students.
The Office of Mission and Ministry’s email blended the office’s intentions of communicating its programming on the sexual abuse crisis and its requests for financial donations to support that programming, a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The spokesperson described the request for funds in the context of sexual abuse as “inappropriate” and apologized.
“As a Catholic and Jesuit university, we are committed to using our intellectual, spiritual, and communal life together to promote dialogue on the political and religious issues of our time and ensure that these cover-ups never happen again,” the spokesperson wrote. “Accompanying and empowering our students, particularly through this difficult time in the Church, remains our primary focus.”
“Your gift is more important today as we grapple with the sexual abuse crisis in the Church, work to heal it and those suffering while guiding young Catholics,” the Oct. 25 email read in bold at the start of the second paragraph of the email.
“As we have settled into the new school year, the chaplains and staff of Mission and Ministry acknowledge the heaviness of heart that so many members of the Georgetown community are feeling due to the ongoing crises surrounding sexual abuse, abuses of power and failure of those in authority to protect the vulnerable,” the email continued.
Director of Campus Ministry Rev. Gregory Schenden, S.J., who signed the letter, and Vice President for Mission and Ministry Rev. Mark Bosco, S.J., have not responded to multiple requests for comment as of 1 a.m. Friday.
The email, sent with the subject line “Update from the Catholic Chaplaincy,” asked for donations to the Office of Mission and Ministry to support “the formation and training of our future Catholic lay leaders with a gift of any size today.”
The email comes after allegations of sexual misconduct against former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. McCarrick, who served as archbishop of Washington, D.C., from 2001 to 2006, resigned from the College of Cardinals in July after allegations of sexual abuse, some of which he has denied and others he has not responded to.
Cardinal Donald Wuerl was implicated in the misconduct after a Pennsylvania grand jury report released in August raised questions over his handling of sexual abuse while he was bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. Wuerl resigned as archbishop of Washington on Oct. 12, but has defended his record on protecting survivors of sexual abuse.
Alumni took to social media to express their disapproval of the email, with many connecting their outrage to the honorary degrees currently held by McCarrick and Wuerl. Irene Koo (COL ’16) criticized the university on Twitter for its “use [of] the sexual abuse crisis as a fundraising opportunity, especially when Georgetown has yet to rescind its honorary degrees to Cardinals Wuerl and McCarrick.”
“Not only is this in shamefully poor taste, but it is also a slap in the face to survivors of sexual assault and to the entire faith community struggling with the ongoing revelations of abuse,” Koo wrote in a letter addressed to Schenden that she posted on Twitter. “This email speaks of ‘betrayal of trust’ and ‘emotional trauma,’ even as Georgetown University has yet to rescind its Honorary Degrees to a known sexual abuser and those who were complicit in shielding abusers.”
Barbara Anne Kozee (SFS ’17) said she was disappointed by the email and, in a letter to Bosco and Schenden, similarly invoked honorary degrees in criticizing the university.
“In light of the sexual abuse crisis which you mention in this email, I cannot in good faith donate to an institution that upholds its Honorary Degrees to abusers and to those who were complicit in covering up abuse,” she wrote in her letter to Bosco and Schenden.
While Kozee praised the university for addressing sexual abuse through supporting community dialogue, she said the university needs to go farther.
“Our Jesuit values call us to contemplation in action,” Kozee wrote in the letter. “This means not just talking about an issue, but taking real action when we see injustice in the world.”
While the email from the Office of Mission and Ministry was addressed to alumni and parents, some students on campus similarly condemned the email.
Grace Laria (SFS ’19), who has led a petition to rescind McCarrick’s and Wuerl’s honorary degrees, called any efforts by the Office of Mission Ministry to address sexual abuse without calling for the revocation of former Cardinals McCarrick and Wuerl’s honorary degrees “hollow.”
“I understand that this email describes donations as going to programming generally ‘supporting the formation and training of our future Catholic lay leaders,’ which is crucial given the crisis of leadership in the Catholic Church, but I, as a member of the Catholic community at Georgetown, cannot feel empowered in my faith by the university until Georgetown rescinds the Honorary Degrees awarded to Cardinals Wuerl and McCarrick,” Laria wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The university has put together an “ad hoc working group” composed of members of the board of directors that is set to examine issues related to the honorary degrees, as well as a review of those given to McCarrick and Wuerl, according to a university spokesperson.

Based upon the headline, I expected more substance. How widespread was the criticism? Three people criticize me every day about something I do. (Maybe this reply will fall into that category.)
Having said that, when I received the email, it seemed like a bit of a miss to me.  But then life is full of good intentions that miss the mark a bit. And I know Father Schenden and the Office of Campus Ministry so made positive assumptions about their intentions (how Ignatian).  It’s good to see from the Campus Ministry spokesman’s comments that my presumption was correct. Thanks for giving them a chance to further clarify their communication. 
I also knew from previous Hoya articles that the University was addressing the Honorary degree issue through an ad hoc working group, so I am looking forward to that outcome.

Every Hoya could most likely recite some version of the following: Without the traditional social structure of recognized Greek life, clubs become the hub for your social life.
Yet Georgetown’s club culture is a double-edged sword. Fueled by a desire to meet the right people and find lifelong friends, students swarm to sign up for countless clubs, only to be faced with an application process where acceptance rates for some clubs are rumored to be lower than the university’s.
Unfortunately, the pace of college life and sheer volume of applicants makes feedback a rarity in these processes, leaving students wondering what they did wrong to be deemed unsuitable for a club.
Confronting Club Culture 
In recent years, the Georgetown community has recognized the negative implications of club culture and has taken steps to alleviate the pressure. This semester, the Council of Advisory Boards followed its standard fall fair with a second fair, which solely hosted clubs without applications.
To further combat the perceptions of exclusivity and superiority, many of the largest organizations on campus, such as Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly referred to as The Corp, stopped releasing acceptance rates two years ago. Prior to this freeze, The Corp had an acceptance rate of 18 percent in the fall of 2015.
The Corp CEO Alex Gong (SFS ’20) hopes the change will counter the perception that club exclusivity is linked to social capital.
“A consensus among the club leadership community in recent years is that by releasing acceptance numbers or interview numbers, you perpetuate the idea that exclusive clubs are the ones you want to get into and that it is some kind of accomplishment if you get an interview or got in,” Gong said. “The reason The Corp hasn’t released its application numbers in recent years is we don’t want to be categorized by that metric in any way, shape or form.”
This fall, The Corp took more steps to help applicants better understand what they are looking for, releasing a handbook to explain the hiring process and how applicants are evaluated.
“We tried to be a little more forthcoming about what to expect because it is kind of an enigma to a lot of incoming freshman especially,” Gong said.
Like The Corp, the Blue & Gray Tour Guide Society has adapted its application process in recent years. Two years ago, Blue & Gray began offering first round interviews to all applicants, in an effort to account for applicants who may fare better in person than in writing, according to Blue & Gray recruitment coordinator Aidan Fallon (SFS ’19).
The latest update to Blue & Gray’s hiring policy, enacted for the fall 2018 cycle, excludes first-semester freshmen from the applicant pool. This new policy aims to improve the readiness of incoming tour guides, according to Fallon.
“These considerations include ensuring the ability of applicants to speak from personal experience on tours, allowing freshmen students a full semester to transition to college before diving into the application process, and the comfortability of applicants in navigating the campus prior to leading tours,” Fallon wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While these changes aim to have an immediate effect on club culture at Georgetown, other organizations have taken more long-term initiatives.
The Lecture Fund plans to review their applicant pool in the future by compiling data to address trends and maximize outreach to underrepresented groups, according to Chair of Lecture Fund Nicole Heitsenrether (SFS ’19).
To be more inclusive in the short term, Lecture Fund announced last fall that it would start dialogues with the community through general member forums.
“Several times a semester, we will host these open general body meetings for students to come and voice their opinions and ideas because central to Lecture Fund’s mission is making sure that we are engaging students from all across campus,” Heitsenrether said.
Necessary Selectivity?
Low acceptance rates for student organizations at Georgetown result in part from clubs’ limited resources, making applications necessary for clubs to operate.
For Georgetown University Eating Society, the club’s operational budget determines the number of students accepted each semester, according to GUES co-founder Brittany Arnett (COL ’19). As an unrecognized club,  GUES receives no funding from the university, according to Arnett.
“GUES has applications, which I know may sound a bit weird because we are an eating society,” Arnett said. “The reason we have applications is we aren’t recognized by the university, so we can’t use the university’s name and we can’t get any university funding.”
Blue & Gray bases its hiring numbers on the number of guides needed to give tours. Historically, their hiring classes have averaged between 20 and 30 new guides per semester, and approximately 15 new guides for the summer cycle. The capacity to train new guides is another factor that impacts hiring rates, according to Fallon.
“Specifically, we seek to ensure that we have sufficient mentors, with corresponding availability, to act as liaisons in the training process and the availability of tours throughout the semester to train during,” Fallon wrote.
For Hilltop Consultants, the size of each hiring class, typically ranging from eight to 15 students, is based on the number of active projects and clients, usually around six or seven, according to Director of Operations Clyde Shepherd (SFS ’19). This semester, Hilltop Consultants hired 12 new student consultants, Shepherd said.
“We don’t have a strict limit on how many people we are going to hire in any given semester,” Shepherd said.
For the Lecture Fund, membership is capped to enhance productivity. However, Lecture Fund does reserve spots for the spring, to ensure there is a continual cycle of new people.
“On the associate board, we are capped constitutionally at 30 students,” Heitsenrether said. “Once you get beyond that point, discussions tend to be less productive because there are so many voices in the room.”
A Method to the Madness
Whether you want to make coffee, consult on social issues, bring prominent speakers to campus or simply eat food with friends, the core of the application process is essentially the same. All six of the clubs consulted for this article require a written application component followed by a possible interview — an unsurprising revelation, as the steps to join a club on campus mirror the professional hiring process, alluding to Georgetown’s pre-professional culture.
In response to concerns about the structure of students selecting other students, many clubs on campus, including Blue & Gray, The Corp and Hilltop Consultants, have taken steps to combat subconscious biases.
At The Corp, all applicants must answer the same core questions, with supplemental questions specific to their service of choice, Gong said. For example, applicants to Corp Marketing must submit a portfolio or answer marketing-strategy related questions.
“We try to get a sense right off the bat about who you are and what you’re interested in,” Gong said. “Then, every service has their own set of questions that attempt to gauge the specific skills or capacities that an individual would have coming into the service.”
Blue & Gray has also taken several measures to minimize the risk of bias, Fallon said.
“In the written application, all applications are assigned a number. Before any member reads the application, all identifying information is removed, and all that is provided are the question responses and the application number,” Fallon wrote.
For the Lecture Fund, each candidate is interviewed individually by a small panel of associate board members, then in a group, with the goal of shaping a diverse hiring class to limit bias in the event planning the organization does, according to Heitsenrether.
“What we are really looking for is sourcing a diversity and uniqueness of viewpoints that will enhance our discussion as an associate board, making sure we don’t have blinders on in terms of types of events,” Heitsenrether said.
For the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, the most important aspects of the hiring process are getting to know each applicant and making sure each applicant has a clear sense of why they want to join the organization, according to Graham Ritter (MSB ’19), GUASFCU’s Chief Communications Officer.
“We try to give everybody that applies a first-round interview. When they apply, we want to meet them and get to know them,” Ritter said. “The second-round interviews are evaluated by the full board as well as one representative from our HR department and one representative from our diversity and inclusion department.”
Receiving over 100 applications, Hilltop Consultants select several board members to read all applications, with the entire board interviewing those who advance. Hilltop Consultants’ interviews include two parts, one technical and one behavioral, to ensure the interviewers spend sufficient time with each applicant, according to Grace Vogelzang (NHS ’19), president of Hilltop Consultants.
“It is really important to us that we spend more than 15 minutes with each person we are giving an interview because there really is a lot to learn about people,” Vogelzang said.
While the club application process may seem daunting, organizations hope that regardless of the outcome, candidates walk away having learned something or made a new connection.
“This year we have done group interviews of six people because we want to mimic a dinner event and see how people interact,” Arnett said. “Our hope with the group interview is regardless of if you get into the club or not, hopefully at least you’ve made a friend through the application process. At the end of the day, that’s our goal, that everyone meets new people.”
Gong said he hopes increasing transparency about hiring processes and the limits on club resources will create a shift in the overall culture.
“It is not an issue of them personally excluding people, it’s an issue of the community as a whole ascribing too much social capital to a given number of organizations,” Gong said. “Even before students get on campus, they have a sense of what the major organizations are, which I think is really damaging.”
Correction: This article previously stated Hilltop Consultants typically have a hiring class of six or seven consultants each semester to reflect the number of active projects; Hilltop Consultants usually hire around eight to 15 student consultants per semester for six to seven active projects.

Hate crimes increased by 275 percent on Georgetown University’s campus, according to the university’s 2018 Annual Security Report.
U.S. Department of Education’s Clery Act defines a hate crime as “a criminal offense that manifests evidence that the victim was intentionally selected because of the perpetrator’s bias against the victim.” The categories of bias under the law include race, gender identity, gender, religion sexual orientation, national origin, ethnicity or disability.
The report, released by Georgetown’s Department of Public Safety, is based on data from the previous calendar year. Of the 15 incidents of hate crime reported, six were defined as destruction of property characterized by gender bias, four as on-campus acts of intimidation or destruction of property characterized by religious bias, and five as characterized by ethnic, racial or sexual orientation bias.
The attacks range from “simple assault” and “aggravated assault” to destruction of property. Last year during Rosh Hashanah, vandals defaced LXR Hall with multiple swastikas and language threatening violence toward women.
The increase in hate crimes mirrors a broader trend across college campuses, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
“An analysis of last year’s data reported under the Clery Act showed a 25 percent increase in hate crimes nationwide on college campuses between 2015 and 2016,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Metropolitan Police Department also reported a 170 percent increase in bias-related crimes citywide from 2015 to 2017, spiking from 66 incidents to 178.
From 2016 to 2017, there was a 66 percent increase in hate crime citywide, going from 107 incidents to 178. In the first half of 2018, there were 84 hate bias crimes.
GUPD encourages any university community member to report crimes or suspicious behavior, according to Hill.
“The University responds promptly and thoroughly investigates all reported hate crimes,” Hill wrote. “In addition, GUPD and the Offices of Residential Living and Campus Ministry have led critical initiatives and dialogue sessions to foster inclusive communities on campus, raise awareness, and prevent future incidents.”
Lieutenant of the Special Liaison Branch Brett Parson said the increase in crimes reflects an increase in reporting, coming from the trust community members hold in MPD officers. The Special Liaison Branch of MPD focuses on serving communities that are sometimes underserved, according to MPD’s website.
“We have re-trained every member of our police department on how to respond and investigate bias-related crimes,” Parson said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’ve also done a significant amount of work in many of our most likely targeted communities for bias-related crimes, and because we are building trust and a relationship with those members of the community, they are probably more likely to report their victimization now than they were before.”
Parson believes the path to prevention starts from the ground up, focusing on community and its role in educating its members.
“The prevention of bias-related crimes starts long before the crime actually is committed,” he said. “That is the responsibility of our community — of parents, teachers, clergy people, neighbors, friends — to make sure that we are raising individuals who do not act out upon their prejudices or their hatred.”
Only bias-related incidents that meet the U.S. Department of Education’s Clery Act definition of hate crimes are reported in the Annual Security Report. However, Georgetown University tracks and responds as needed to all bias-related incidents reported to campus officials through GUPD, the Georgetown University Bias Reporting System and relevant campus administrators.

Seventy-three percent of graduates of the class of 2017 are employed part-time or full-time and 16 percent are enrolled or plan to enroll in graduate school, according to the first destination report for the class of 2017.
The survey received responses from 66.2 percent of the class of 2017, a six percent increase from the 2005 report.
Graduates of the class of 2017 in the School of Foreign Service have a full-time employment rate of 68 percent, the College has a rate of 65 percent and the School of Nursing and Health Studies has a full-time employment rate of 53 percent, according to the report.
The Cawley Career Education Center releases a first destination report approximately 17 months after a class graduates. The results are obtained through surveys sent to alumni that collect data about their locations, positions and average income, reports from top employers and alumni’s LinkedIn profiles.
Graduates of the MSB have the highest average starting salary at $70,606 while the average starting salaries for graduates of the College, the NHS and the SFS are $55,920, $54,556 and $61,655 respectively, according to the report. The average salary for the class of 2017 overall is $61,681.
Consulting and financial services are the top two industries for graduates for the class of 2017, with almost a quarter of the class of 2017 currently working in financial services. Following financial services and consulting, 9.2 percent of graduates work in information technology and 7.6 percent in the non-profit or public service.
While many students go into finance and consulting, many Georgetown graduates are branching out to other industries, said director of the Cawley Career Education Center Susan Campbell. 59 percent of graduates went into industries other than finance and consulting, according to the report.
“When you look at the list of industries graduates work in first after graduation, finance and consulting appear as number one and number two on the list,” Campbell said. “But that only accounts for about 40 percent of graduates — 41 percent for the class of 2017. Most are going into other industries.”
The top employers of the class of 2017 include Deloitte, Oracle, Citi, PwC and Georgetown University, according to the report.
The U.S. federal government would be the top employer of the class of 2017, if the survey did not distinguish agencies and programs as individual employers, according to Campbell.
The majority of the class of 2017 that enrolled in graduate programs study at Georgetown; most of those attending graduate school are studying law or medicine, according to the report.
“Georgetown has been the most popular graduate school destination for those going directly to grad school for as long as we’ve been collecting post-graduation data,” according to the report. “Since 2007, Columbia University has been the second most popular school of those going directly to graduate school after completing their undergraduate degrees.”
The report’s focus on the first steps graduates take after graduation does not provide a complete picture of Georgetown alumni’s careers, according to Campbell.
“Our findings, of course, are limited to the first things that alums are doing after graduation. The first thing you do after college is an important part of your career story, but it’s not the whole story,” Campbell said. “It’s only the beginning. We’re very aware of the fact that this report reflects only a small part of what Georgetown graduates do after they finish school.”

The Georgetown University Police Department referred 84 drug-related offenses for disciplinary proceedings in 2017, an increase of 180 percent, from 30 cases in 2016, according to this year’s Annual Security Report released Sept. 28.
Georgetown, along with other colleges and universities who participate in federal financial aid programs, is required to publish crime statistics annually under the 1990 Clery Act. The surge in referrals for drug-related violations was not the result of a shift in university enforcement of drug prohibitions, but rather an increase in student drug use, according to Grant Olson (COL ’19), director of Georgetown’s Student Advocacy Office, which provides resources to Georgetown students facing disciplinary proceedings.
“We’re seeing more marijuana cases, but there hasn’t been an application shift,” Olson said. “The numbers might be increasing, but the actual punishments are not hugely different, depending on the nature of the case.”
University officials maintain that there has been no change in GUPD’s application of Georgetown’s current drug policies, instead connecting the rise in drug case referrals to an increase in student drug use following the 2015 decriminalization of marijuana possession in Washinton, D.C., Georgetown University spokesperson Matt Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“[The District’s 2015 decriminalization of marijuana possession] has likely increased access to marijuana throughout the area,” Hill wrote. “As access to marijuana has increased in the District of Columbia and Georgetown polices have remained consistent, there has been an increase in student conduct referrals for drug-related violations.”
While marijuana possession remains prohibited by the university’s Code of Student Conduct, its decriminalization means the U.S. Department of Education no longer requires Georgetown to report disciplinary referrals for such cases under the Clery Act. As a result, the statistics in Georgetown’s Annual Security Reports since 2015 do not include disciplinary cases for marijuana possession involving students over 21. Hill did not provide the figures on referrals for these cases.
This rise in student drug use, however, has not been followed by a similar increase in disciplinary referrals for drug offenses at other local universities. According to the 2018 Annual Security Report from The George Washington University, disciplinary referrals for drug law violations on the Foggy Bottom campus increased by only 23 percent from 2016 to 2017. Main campus judicial referrals for drug law violations decreased by 4 percent in the same time period at American University.
Georgetown’s past Annual Security Reports show that the number of disciplinary referrals for on-campus drug offenses has been rising from 2013, when only 20 drug cases were referred. This year’s 84 referrals mark a 320 percent surge since 2013. Only once since 2013 did the number of disciplinary referrals for drug violations decrease, from 2015 to 2016.
The District’s 2015 decriminalization of marijuana possession follows a broader national trend in recent years of drug law liberalization. Since 2012, nine states have fully legalized recreational marijuana. Olson believes this growing national tolerance has manifested itself at Georgetown and is partially responsible for the increase in drug case referrals.
“In my view, a lot of the increase in the number of drug cases being referred could be linked to the increased nationwide acceptance of marijuana in both recreational and medicinal contexts,” Olson said.
Marijuana use among college students does appear to be increasing: The percentage of college students who have smoked marijuana in the past year reached a 30-year peak in 2016 at 39 percent, according to the University of Michigan’s annual “Monitoring the Future” study.
For comparison, the number of alcohol-related offenses on Georgetown’s main campus that GUPD referred for disciplinary proceedings was 333 in 2017, which marked only a 15 percent increase from the previous year, according to the 2018 Annual Security Report. Hill attributed this to the fact that, while local marijuana laws have recently changed, local alcohol laws have not.
“While the District of Columbia has changed marijuana laws in recent years, making the substance more accessible, Georgetown’s policies and enforcement for both alcohol and drug violations have remained consistent,” Hill said.

More than 90 students at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts have been cleared of enrollment fraud, Ellington CEO Tia Powell Harris said in an interview with The Washington Post.
An investigation launched in May by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education accused 164 Ellington students of attending a Washington, D.C. public high school while maintaining residency outside the District. Fifty-six of the accused Ellington students remain under investigation, according to a May OSSE report.
The alleged cases of enrollment fraud come after an April 17 report by the D.C. Office of the Inspector General that found D.C. Public Schools had lost over $500,000 in tuition collection by failing to accurately verify the residency of enrolled students from 2014 to 2016.
Many of the accused Ellington families have provided additional information to prove their innocence, prompting a need to review the District’s residency verification process, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said.
“There was always an expectation that some people will have come forward to supply information to prove residency,” Bowser said in an interview with The Washington Post. “If there is a big number, we would want to know why it did not come forward earlier in the process.”
OSSE has been supporting Ellington families throughout the residency verification process, according to OSSE Community Relations Specialist Fred Lewis.
“OSSE has been working with families to provide them as many due-process pathways as possible related to residency verification, including offering multiple ways of connecting with us, robust outreach, and technical assistance,” Lewis wrote in an email to The Hoya.“We are confident that we are providing families as much support and information as possible.”
Ellington, while a part of the DCPS system, costs around $12,800 for non-residents, according to the Ellington website.  If a student fails to pay the correct tuition fees, the student is required to pay the tuition plus additional fees.
Since the release of the April report, D.C. Superior Court Judge Joan Zeldon has thrown out Ellington’s case alleging enrollment fraud twice, according to WTOP. Zeldon said the District was following incorrect procedure and first had to investigate and verify the false addresses of accused students before having them pay the tuition through the legal system.
OSSE listed new guidelines for reviewing residency verification in the 2018-2019 enrollment season, launching an online forum for verification using tax returns in partnership with the Office of Tax and Revenue. The D.C. agency also announced it would hire new staff and update the technological system responsible for tracking and responding to reports of enrollment fraud.
The District is working to make its residency verification process as straightforward as possible, Lewis said.
“OSSE’s goal is to ensure that every child who is a resident of the District has access to the highest quality public education possible, and that our process of verifying residency is clear and fair for families,” Lewis wrote.

The District Department of Transportation announced five new pickup and drop-off pilot locations for ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft at locations across Washington, D.C., on Oct. 26.
The designated pickup and drop-off locations will be implemented at centrally located, high-traffic areas where there is high demand for ride-hailing services. The locations are the nightlife hub of 14th and U Streets, NW; the Smithsonian National Zoo; the Wharf on Maine Avenue, SW; Georgetown at the 1200 block of Wisconsin Avenue, and NoMa/Union Market, NE, according to an Oct. 26 news release.
DDOT hopes that by ensuring that loading and unloading is done curbside rather than in bike lanes, crosswalks, or travel lanes, these zones will improve pedestrian safety as well as traffic flow, DDOT Public Affairs Specialist Lauren Stephens wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“With the growing popularity of ridesharing, the lack of designated curbside pickup drop off spaces has led to unsafe driver and passenger behavior as well as increased congestion,” Stephens wrote. “With the creation of these zones, DDOT will reduce potential conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles, address traffic congestion, and improve safety in the District’s most popular neighborhoods.”
These locations will be exclusively used for passenger and commercial loading 24 hours a day. Following a 30-day notice and comment period, drivers who block the zones by parking may be issued a citation or have their vehicles towed, according to the news release.
The new designated loading zones are a part of Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) Vision Zero commitment, Stephens said. The Vision Zero initiative aims to reach zero fatalities and serious injuries among travelers of D.C.’s transportation system by 2024.
Lyft supports the creation of designated loading zones to increase pedestrian safety, Lyft Communications Manager Darcy Yee wrote in an email toThe Hoya.
“We believe this is an innovative and creative solution to make D.C. a more multimodal city and to redesign our streets to prioritize people rather than cars,” Yee wrote. “Efforts like this make D.C. a national leader in Safe Curb Access.”
These 24-hour zones come as an extension of the successful nightlife zone pilot program launched near the Dupont Circle area Oct. 2017. The pilot involved restricting parking on the busy street of restaurants and bars during peak hours on Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., according to the DDOT website.
Although the creation of this zone eliminated public parking spaces and came with parking restrictions carefully enforced by the Department of Public Works, the Dupont Circle pilot program began per the request of the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District, which includes the business district from the front of the White House to Dupont Circle, itself, according to DDOT Communications Director Terry Owens.
“This was something that was driven by the community,” Owens said in an interview with DCist.
Other cities are following D.C’s lead. San Francisco and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., unveiled test programs for designated Uber and Lyft pickup spots last year, according to CNN.
The prevalence of these pick-up zones emerges from a growing nationwide effort to improve safety and address issues caused by the rising popularity of ride-sharing services, Emily Castor, senior director of transportation policy at Lyft, said in an interview with CNN.
“I’ve noticed this conversation starting to emerge rapidly in most of the large cities where we operate,” Castor said.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced a partnership with Ford Motor Company to begin testing “driverless” autonomous vehicles in Washington, D.C., early next year.
The testing will begin in D.C.’s Ward 5 and will gradually expand to encompass the entire city, according to an Oct. 22 news release. Ford plans to introduce commercial services in 2021.
The test drives will use cameras, lasers and other sensors to map roads and identify obstacles. Every test will have two human backup drivers in the car, although Ford plans to eventually remove the drivers as the AV technology develops.
The partnership is part of the Bowser administration’s long-term strategic vision for the emerging technology to improve traffic conditions, alleviate the environmental cost of transportation and promote urban equality across the District.
According to Ford’s calculations, the cost per driven mile in an autonomous vehicle is about $1. This price is compared to $2.50 for an Uber, $0.70 to $1.50 for a private car and $0.30 for public transport.
By lowering costs for ride-hailing and delivery services and reducing the need for residents to own their own cars, city officials believe driverless cars hold the potential for equitable economic development.
“If it can make it cheaper for someone in Ward 8 to order fresh food — food access is a major issue in some of our neighborhoods — that’s a big win,” Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Chief of Staff Andrew Trueblood said in an interview with The Washington Post.
Bowser’s office chose to partner with Ford among the many players in the self-driving car industry because of the company’s willingness to commit to a longer timeline, Ford Autonomous Vehicles President and CEO Sherif Marakby said.
“We realized very quickly that we can launch a small number of cars in an area right away — but then not create a healthy business that helps the city,” Marakby said in an interview with The Washington Post.
In addition to its longer rollout plan, Ford has also committed to running a training program for workers in the transportation industry that would be displaced by driverless vehicles, according to the news release.
In partnership with the D.C. Infrastructure Academy, an initiative run by the District’s Department of Employment Services, Ford will train workers for future careers around self-driving technology.
“The partnership between Ford and the DC Infrastructure Academy is another pipeline the Bowser Administration has created to connect Washingtonians to sustainable careers, giving them a fair shot at economic prosperity,” a DOES official wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are also exploring and encouraging innovative approaches that will enhance mobility and delivery services for residents in all eight wards.”
The DCIA initiative targets D.C. residents facing barriers to finding and retaining employment, according to a DOES official. Available job opportunities are expected to include maintenance, troubleshooting and development of autonomous vehicles, according to the news release.
Ford plans to expand its program to run fleets of hundreds or even thousands, of driverless cars in major cities, according to The Washington Post.

Washington, D.C.’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency announced on Oct. 29 nearly $1 million in grants to improve security at D.C. religious institutions.
The grants come as security concerns for local synagogues increase in the wake of the Oct. 27 mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
HSEMA selected nine D.C. faith institutions to receive the funding to improve security measures. Six of the nine institutions are Jewish organizations, three of which are synagogues: Adas Israel Congregation, the Georgetown Synagogue-Kesher Israel Congregation and Sixth & I Synagogue, Inc.
Though security grants for nonprofit organizations in the District are not new, and the recipient organizations applied in the summer of 2017, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) referenced the shooting in Pittsburgh in HSEMA’s announcement.
“On the heels of tragedy, we continue the work of building a more peaceful world — a world in which hatred and evil are erased and our country has common-sense gun control,” Bowser said in the news release. “Through grants like these, we can do more to ensure residents and visitors feel safe throughout the District — especially in our places of worship.”
HSEMA is also offering new emergency preparednessworkshops for local organizations in the face of increased threats to certain faith-based organizations, according to HSEMA Director Chris Rodriguez.
“We will empower and educate nonprofits about the importance of conducting physical threat assessments, encouraging personal preparedness to their communities, and developing robust applications to secure future funding,” Rodriguez said.
Bowser directed the Metropolitan Police Department to provide officers and increase security measures for synagogues following the shooting in Pittsburgh.
“As we learn more about this attack, we reiterate: ignorance and hate have no place in our society. An attack on one community is an attack on all of us and on the ideals we stand for and fight for every day,” Bowser said in an Oct. 27 news release.
Local Jewish organizations have also committed to ensuring synagogues have sufficient funding for appropriate security precautions. The Jewish Federation, a nonprofit organization, committed to donating at least $100,000 to a fund to improve security at local synagogues and Jewish organizations.
“Together, we can continue to ensure that our community is strong, vibrant, resilient, and safe, even and especially in the face of those who seek to tear us apart,” the Jewish Federation wrote on its website.
Local synagogues have said that, though shaken, they feel prepared to deal with the tragedy and ensure the safety of their congregants. Sixth & I Communications Senior Associate Michelle Eider said the synagogue is responding in kind to the recent tragedy.
“For many years, Sixth & I has taken extra security precautions at all of our programs and events,” Eidler wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will continue to do so and are working with the Metropolitan Police Department and other local law enforcement to ensure that our security measures are appropriate.”
Executive Director of Temple Rodef Shalom Beth Silver said the temple has grown accustomed to a certain level of security threats.
“We’re just continuing what we’re doing and always reviewing our security,” Silver said in an interview with The Hoya.“We have a very close relationship with local law enforcement and they’ve been great to work with all along and especially helpful in the last week.”
Georgetown Jewish Student Association President Aviv Lis (COL ’19) said that, disappointing as it is to see synagogues taking such security precautions, such measures are important to ensure individuals can worship in safety.
“We are deeply saddened that the need for heightened security is a conversation each synagogue must have,” Lis said. “Every community should do what it feels I best to ensure the safety, security and comfort of its congregants.”

Washington, D.C. lawmakers are neglecting the city’s problems with food insecurity, said Lauren Shweder Biel, executive director and co-founder of a healthy food advocacy nonprofit, at an event at the Georgetown Alumni House Oct. 25.
Biel directs D.C. Greens, a nonprofit organization based in D.C. that aims to bring healthy food to poorer communities in the District through various programs. The programs include agricultural education in schools; Produce Plus, which offers additional financial assistance to people already using federal benefits like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; and Produce RX, which helps subsidize medical and nutrition services. D.C. Greens also advocates for urban agriculture.
Biel currently serves on D.C.’s Healthy Youth and Schools Commission and the D.C. Department of Health’s Diabesity Committee. She began advocating for better food access in 2009, when she co-founded D.C. Greens.
Food insecurity is a term developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that describes a situation in which people struggle to access food that allows them to lead healthy lives, according to The Washington Post.
The Capital Area Food Bank found that 14.5 percent of D.C. residents are food insecure. A 2016 Georgetown University Student Association survey found that 54 percent of the 351 students surveyed experienced food insecurity often at least once a week.
Food insecurity goes hand in hand with poverty: Black people living in D.C. experience poverty and food insecurity at a disproportionately higher rate than white people living in D.C, according to The Washington Post.
The problem of food insecurity in D.C. often gets overlooked, Biel said.
“Our politicians here, our society here, you know, spend a lot of time talking about housing, education, workforce development, and food has not been something that is seen as a key issue for the city,” Biel said. “A lot of what we are doing is working across all these different sectors to really elevate food so that it is a key issue in the city.”
D.C. Greens leads advocacy efforts by encouraging people from marginalized communities in the District to speak up about the issue of food insecurity; however, according to Biel, the complaints of people experiencing food insecurity are often ignored.
“What we saw a lot of times is, you know, people come who have a little experience with food insecurity, and when they speak, you know, if they say anything wrong, if they get any little thing wrong, the people in power are just like, ‘Well, they don’t really understand the conditions that we’re working [with],’” Biel said.
D.C. Greens works with D.C. Public Schools to encourage community-based change in school food systems and to make D.C. residents aware of the connection between food and a healthier life, according to Biel.
“We are partnering with D.C. Public Schools to build out their school food advisory board, to really create channels for parents, and teachers, and students to really be able to give feedback in a safe way to the school systems, so that they can start making changes to the school food based on community interest,” Biel said.
Biel attributed Produce Plus’ success to its inclusion of members of the communities that the program aims to assist in its advocacy work.
“I believe that one of the reasons why Produce Plus has been as successful as it is is because we have very intentionally created community ownership model inside of the program design,” Biel said. “We work with close to 300 volunteers every season. We call them our farmers market brigade.”
Nonprofits must go beyond simply assisting a community by establishing self-sufficiency in those communities, Biel said.
“Nonprofits need to shift the system; if the thing can’t operate without you, you didn’t shift the system,” Biel said.
There are still many challenges to overcome before the problem of food insecurity will be fully resolved, according to Biel. However, community efforts can bring the change needed to expand access to healthy food for all District residents.
“Everything we are trying to do here at D.C. Greens is to bring folks together and say, ‘Enough. We can do better. We need to do better. We have to do better,’” Biel said. “How are we going to do better from where we stand?”

The current federal government’s policies threaten the rights of transgender people, Del. Danica Roem (D-District 13) of the Virginia House of Delegates said at an event in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room on Oct. 30.
Roem ran for the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, after working as a journalist for almost 11 years. She defeated 13-term incumbent Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-District 13), the sponsor of a bill that garnered controversy, which would require students to use the bathroom of their biological sex.
With her 2017 victory, Roem became the first openly transgender person to be elected to and hold office in any U.S. state legislature. Stacie Laughton, who is also a transgender woman, was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 2012 but did not take office because she had not disclosed that she had been convicted of a felony.
Roem voiced her concerns about transgender rights under the current government at the event Tuesday. Grassroots mobilization and participation in local government are ways to combat such concerns, according to Roem.
“Our civil rights should never be up for a referendum. They should never be subject to political whims. They should never be subject to majority view. They are our rights. They are simply our rights,” Roem said. “We shouldn’t keep fighting for them to exist in the first place. But now we’re at a point where the federal government is questioning our very existence as trans folks. So what do we do? We win elections. We will organize, we will mobilize, and we will win.”
Roem attributes some of her success to this type of grassroots mobilization, including canvassing by volunteers and small donations.
“I’m transgender. I’m wearing a black hoodie. I played in a metal band. I’m a reporter, a stepmom, vegetarian,” Roem said. “My story is not typical for how you get into office, but if there was anything that I hope that people do realize from my story, that in the same way that it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to raise a candidate.”
Roem is hopeful students will contribute to their local and national dialogues by holding their representatives accountable and running for office themselves.
“If you can’t find someone who shares your values, well, guess what?” Roem said. “This is America. Go grab a clipboard. Go collect some ballot signatures. Get yourself on the ballot and go be that person that you think that you don’t have. Because maybe you don’t. Or maybe some people do inspire you, but the people who represent you don’t.”
Roem decided to run, despite her unemployment and lack of health insurance, to demonstrate that the government is not solely the domain of the rich and powerful, she said. Voters appreciate authenticity from a candidate, according to Roem.
“If 2016 taught us anything, it is that the perception of authenticity, whether or not it is grounded in reality, is extremely important, and it is what people in our voting populus want from their elected officeholders and want from their candidates,” Roem said. “So the way that I decided to launch the campaign was to start being myself.”
Roem sought to run a campaign based on policy issues like transportation, education and Medicaid expansion, rather than focusing solely on her identity, she said.
“I am transgender and — not but,” Roem said. “I’m transgender, and I campaigned on transportation. I’m transgender, and I can talk to you until you are blue in the face about Route 28 and how to go about fixing it.”
Her background as a journalist prepared her to enter politics by teaching her to ask questions and to listen, Roem said.
“I love reporting the news, that’s why I did it for 10 1/2 years,” Roem said. “I love speaking truth to power; I love being the person who holds politicians’ feet to the fire. I love that idea that no one in elected office can look at me as a pushover, and that they have to answer my questions.”
She is hopeful her own experience will inspire college students to share their ideas and participate in democracy, Roem said.
“I’m here to tell you today that this is your America too. And no matter what you look like, where you come for, how you worship if you do, or who you love, that if you’ve got good ideas, if you’re well-qualified, then bring your ideas to the table,” Roem said. “Because this is your Georgetown too. This is your Washington, D.C., too. This is your country too. And it’s time for you to run it. And don’t think that it’s not just because you’re in college.”

The race for Washington, D.C. Ward 1 representative for the State Board of Education includes Georgetown University education, inquiry and justice professor Emily Gasoi and alumnus Jason Andrean (MSB ’05).
The Nov. 6 election also includes candidate Callie Kozlak, a former public school teacher.
The elected candidate will sit on the nine-member Board of Education to advocate for educational policies affecting constituents living in Ward 1, which includes Columbia Heights, Mount Pleasant and Park View. The board member is responsible for working with other members to approve District-level policies and advise the State Superintendent of Education.
Andrean, a banker active in education reform who has raised over $65,000 for the race, graduated from Georgetown with a degree in business administration and a focus on organizational leadership and change.
Gasoi began to think about running for the Board of Education in 2017 after publishing her book, “These Schools Belong to You and Me: Why We Can’t Afford to Abandon Our Public Schools,” which analyzes past efforts of educational reform and offers suggestions for reform.  Following the book’s release, some education advocates approached her, recommending she consider a bid for the seat, Gasoi said in an interview with The Hoya.
“The seed got planted and when I saw that someone who doesn’t have education experience jumped in, it made me feel like there’s a lot of that these days even at the national level and that’s a problem,” Gasoi said. “Even when I looked at the board, there are only two board members who are parents of the system and only two board members who have classroom experience. I just thought that I have expertise and experiences that I could bring that aren’t really represented.”
Gasoi’s platform is focused on decreasing the educational achievement gap between different areas of the city and improving D.C.’s quality of education by developing a system that is more engaging and responsive to parents, teachers and students, Gasoi said.
To improve the quality of education, Gasoi wants to decrease the emphasis on standardizing testing in the public school system, she said.
“I want to make sure that we don’t over focus on standardized testing because I think that actually makes our schools weaker by narrowing the curriculum, and it doesn’t incentive really meeting students’ needs since we are so focused on getting test scores up,” Gasoi said.
Gasoi’s prior educational experience helping found the Mission Hill School, a democratically governed public school in Boston and she received a doctorate in educational leadership from the University of Pennsylvania.
Angelica Castoñon, a commissioner representing District 6 on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 1A on issues such as neighborhood safety, construction and traffic, endorsed Gasoi because of her experience in education and her connection to the D.C. education system.
“When I heard that Emily was running, I was so thrilled because I know Emily is a lifelong educator, she started up her own school, she’s advised other educators in a mentor capacity, and she continues to teach to this day,” Castañon said in an interview with The Hoya. “All of this made me be just so in awe of Emily.”
More voices with experience in education and a record of fighting for these values will help move D.C. schools forward, Ward 8 Board of Education representative Markus Batchelor said in an interview with The Hoya.
“Her experience within itself I think is important, but Emily has also demonstrated a willingness to talk honestly about where we are as a school system and where we need to go, even when it goes against the grain of special interests who have had an increasingly heavy hand in State Board of Education races and political races,” Batchelor said. “To really … be willing to speak honestly about where we are and really present common sense solutions in spite of all that will make her tremendously valuable and would make her a very good advocate for students and families.”
Her time as a Georgetown professor has helped to further develop her interests in education advocacy and equity through her interactions with students, Gasoi said.
“Georgetown itself values ethos, which is all about social justice and working for a better world,” Gasoi said. “I think that’s very much part of my platform, as it’s a social justice platform.”

Georgetown rolled out a new master’s program to teach students to measure levels of potentially harmful substances in the atmosphere and develop relevant environmental policy. 
The environmental metrology and policy program, announced Oct. 25, is housed in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. The two-year program, set to hold classes on nights and weekends to accommodate professional schedules, is accepting applications for fall 2019.
The degree is aimed at scientists and engineers who wish to better understand current environmental hazards and strong environmental policy-making. YuYe Tong, the director of EMAP and a chemistry professor, said the program intends for students to become proficient in quantitative analysis and explore the subsequent policy decisions driven by scientific evidence. The master’s program is a collaboration between Georgetown University, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
“Broadly speaking, the program is geared toward students who have proper undergraduate education (BS/BA) in STEM with prerequisites of certain chemistry courses as the program focuses on scientific and policy issues related to chemical pollutants in environment,” Tong wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The program is a result of Tong’s work exploring the possibility of combining the quantitative knowledge of chemistry with the qualitative work of other university departments such as the science, technology and international affairs program.
The program has been in development since 2013, when a team from the chemistry and the science, technology and international affairs departments applied to a training grant together, Tong said. Although the initiative was not successful, the experience encouraged Tong to keep working toward a collaborative program.
“Developing the Master of Science in Environmental Metrology and Policy (MS-EMAP) at Georgetown is really a product of several iterations of different ideas and attempts over a period of several years, driven by a deep aspiration of elevating Georgetown’s physical sciences to a level that is commensurate with its national ranking,” Tong wrote.
Students in the program will be taught not only by Georgetown faculty, but also by experts from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
“There’s a gap in terms of education in chemical and biochemical metrology and even at NIST it can take several years to train people in terms of mastering the principles and methodologies in metrology,” Tong said in the Oct. 25 news release. “The new program will help address that issue and be convenient to full-time workers.”
The creation of the program comes at a time where there is a need for relevant research and policy to understand the environmental risk and impact of chemical pollutants. Tong said the education for students about quantitative analysis and policymaking makes the MS-EMAP an interdisciplinary program that is relevant to the current needs of the world.
“To ensure a secure and sustainable human society in which having a healthy environment is a key ingredient, the increasingly prevailing environmental chemical pollutants need urgently to be meticulously and constantly identified, characterized, quantified, assessed, regulated and managed,” Tong wrote. “It therefore also needs to involve a broad spectrum of policymakers and stakeholders that include representatives from industry, academia, governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the general public.”
The program’s organizers expect it to provide opportunities for students to develop their careers and research skills through a funded summer internship and capstone research project. Tong said there are a multitude of career opportunities within the environmental sphere for students to explore both through the internship and after completion of the degree.
“EMAP graduates will have one of the broadest professional spaces in which to develop a rewarding career of great and lasting societal impacts for the betterment of the world,” Tong wrote. “There are many career opportunities for them in every sector of human society, be it government agencies, NGOs, research and academic institutions, or corporate entities.”

The seventh annual TEDx Georgetown conference presented fourteen speakers, including Muslim chaplain Imam Yahya Hendi and Robert Bies, professor of management and director of the Executive Master’s in Leadership program at the McDonough School of Business, who spoke around the theme “Ignite.”
The Oct. 27 conference in Gaston Hall included 10 student speakers and four external speakers. There were three sessions throughout the day and each speaker gave 20-minute-long speeches. The speeches were organized around a time when a speaker “felt a point of ignition in their lives,” according to Kevin Durham (MSB ’19), TEDx Georgetown co-chair.
TEDx came to Georgetown seven years ago as a part of the efforts of TED, a nonprofit organization that hosts conferences relating a range of topics, which include technology, engineering and design, to support locally organized conferences.
To achieve success, students should take proactive steps in the direction of their vision, Bies said.
“To embrace your greatness, you’ve got to dream big,” Bies said. “Don’t just dream, though, do. It’s about taking action. You want to be in the approach of taking opportunities for small wins.”
Speaking about her own challenges with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a long-lasting disorder that causes a person to experience uncontrollable thoughts and urges to repeat specific behaviors, as a part of TEDx Georgetown offered Courtney Ryman (COL ’19) a way to fight the stigmas surrounding her mental illness, she said. OCD, which Ryan said causes her to have obsessions based on falsities, damaged her friendships.
“The social casualties of my OCD are vast,” Ryman said. “I began to think that I didn’t have OCD, but that I was OCD. … If OCD hadn’t been a good friend to me, why would it be friends to anyone else? I dissolved my friendships and I didn’t try to create new ones. I abandoned the people who did not abandon me.”
Good leaders engage with diversity, embrace challenges and strive to learn about the world, Daniela Terminel, CEO of Global Health Corps, a non-profit to support global health leaders, said.
“Our brain is wired to look for certainty, places where we feel safe,” Terminel said. “You can always seek discomfort. You can always look for diversity. You can always stay curious, and by doing so, you can become a stronger leader and come to ignite change in the world.”
Emilio Joubert (COL ’19) attributed part of his success despite hardship in his childhood to mentorship. During his youth, his mother was diagnosed with cancer and his father suffered declining mental health in the midst of financial hardship.
“The most important piece of growing up for me was education. And I feel like a younger version of myself would attribute the success that I’ve had today with my own skill, with the things I’ve put together, with how hard I’ve worked,” Joubert said. “But I realize now that if it wasn’t for those people who came together and believed in me when I thought I had nothing left, that I wouldn’t be half the man that I am. And so it is because of mentorship that I’ve become the man I am and have been able to succeed beyond all measures.”
Teachers who successfully relate to their students do so through authenticity and the ability to overlook stereotypes, Smalls said.
“Teachers have to balance vulnerability and love, they need to leave their preconceived images of students by the door,” Smalls said. “Curious teachers learn about their students.”
Everyone should consider what impact they will have on the world around them as they pursue their goals, Bies said.
“It’s about legacy. What are you leaving behind? What are you doing that’s powerful? I don’t care if you’re 13 or 18 or 88, you should be thinking about legacy.”
