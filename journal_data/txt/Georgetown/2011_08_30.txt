A group of students and Georgetown neighbors are working to redraw district lines that will determine Georgetown’s representation on Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E for the next 10 years.
The proposal put forth by the working group on Aug. 17 has been met with mixed reviews from members of the university community and its neighbors. While the co-chairs of the group describe the plan as “fair and appropriate,” students accused the plan of gerrymandering districts to ensure minimal student representation.
The plan, which divides the ANC into eight single-member districts, was designed by the committee’s co-chairs, Citizens Association of Georgetown President Jennifer Altemus (COL ’88), ANC2E Chairman Ron Lewis and Burleith Citizens Association President Lenore Rubino.
Two of these districts are comprised almost entirely of Georgetown students, meaning that students are likely to win two seats on the ANC while the remaining six districts will likely go to non-students.
“I think students should be very concerned about the co-chairs’ proposal,” said Jake Sticka (COL ’13), the current student representative on ANC2E.
According to Sticka, the plan packs Georgetown students into as few SMDs as possible. The two districts that would encompass the Georgetown campus, SMDs 2E04 and 2E08, contain 2,581 individuals, while D.C. law requires redistricting working groups to attempt to draw districts so they contain 2,000 people each. Most other SMDs in the proposal would contain fewer than 2,000 individuals.
A fairer plan, Sticka said, would resemble the one proposed by John Flanagan (SFS ’14), another student member of the working group. Flanagan’s proposal divided Georgetown’s campus into three SMDs, one of which would be composed of roughly 50 percent students and 50 percent non-students.
“I looked at what seemed to be natural divisions in the area and I tried to keep [the SDMs] equal [in] population, which is actually quite difficult,” Flanagan said.
“[The ANC is] supposed to be a cross section of the neighborhood, so one man, one vote is super important.”
Flanagan said he believes that the distribution of SMDs in the co-chair’s plan does not achieve that, as he finds it to be unequal.
The co-chairs counter that their plan is in better accordance with other aspects of the redistricting law.
“The law doesn’t require the districts just to be equal, there are several criteria,” Lewis said. “The cohesiveness of neighborhoods can override that.”
According to Lewis, the co-chair’s proposal does a better job of preserving neighborhoods within one SMD.
“Burleith is a very unified neighborhood, [but] the Flanagan plan divides it into three separate single-member districts. We don’t think that’s appropriate,” Lewis said.
Rubino also defended the need for her neighborhood to remain in one district.
“Burleith needs community cohesiveness, that’s a big point, and we don’t want to see it split apart,” she said.
In addition to their critique of the working group’s final proposal, Sticka and Flanagan found the process by which the districts were redrawn problematic.
The working group’s co-chairs were appointed by Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans without community input, and no students were made co-chairs even though students make up 45 percent of the population represented by ANC2E.
“We don’t really feel like we got a fair shot at the meetings,” Flanagan said. “I did get to state my case, but there really was very little acknowledgement of my arguments.”
But Lewis said that the composition of the working group was entirely self-selecting.
“[Councilman Evans] said that anybody that wanted to serve on a working group in an ANC district could do that. So anyone who was on the group was someone who volunteered their time,” he said.
He added that it was standard for the presidents of the local citizens association and the chair of the local ANC to be appointed co-chairs of the working group.
Rubino agreed that the meetings went smoothly.
“They were very cordial. Everyone expressed their opinion on the redistricting plan. We took everything into account and came up with a proposal,” she said.
Lewis said that he thought most of the working group was in accordance regarding the co-chair’s proposal and was disappointed when no students voted for it.
All five students and one non-student member of the working group, Charles Eason, backed Flanagan’s proposal. Eason represents SMD 2E07, which encompasses the area of East Georgetown north of Q Street.
“If you just look at the maps and the sizes of the different districts [in the co-chair’s proposal], that would suggest to some people that it was gerrymandered, whereas Mr. Flanagan’s proposal just looked cleaner. I just felt more comfortable with that,” Eason said.
The working group presented its proposal before the community Monday at the ANC’s monthly meeting. Though approximately 100 community members attended the meeting to give input about the plan, Lewis chose to limit the number of people able to speak for and against the proposal allowing five to speak for each side.
Mike Meaney (SFS ’12), Georgetown University Student Association president, spoke at the meeting for the students who opposed the co-chair’s proposal.
“We’re asking the ANC to reconsider their plan because the majority of the students feel that this plan dilutes their voting power,” he said. “Students merit an ability to be represented in things that affect student life.”
Rob Biemesderfer (COL ’12) also addressed the ANC group.
“I am not a second class citizen of this community. I don’t want my vote watered down. I want full representation,” he said.
Laurel Radley, who lives in the neighborhood, voiced her qualms with the Flanagan proposal.
“To me the bigger picture is that we are much bigger community than just the university,” she said. “I don’t believe [that students] are second class citizens. I don’t feel that way about you. I do believe you are transitional residents,” she said to the student representatives.”
“We did the best we could,” Lewis said of the working group’s efforts, adding that the group’s recommendation to the D.C. Council could be made by the end of the month.
After the hearing, any member of the working group can call for the group to reconvene to discuss the community’s input and make changes to the proposal. Students on the working group hope that input from members of the university community will persuade the working group to reconsider the current distribution of districts.
If no changes are made, Flanagan and Sticka said they plan to petition the D.C. Council, which has the final say on the matter.
“I’m hoping it can get heard before them with the idea that the council will see that our concerns have merit and will either send the task force back to the drawing board or redraw the districts themselves,” Flanagan said.
They also called upon students to participate more in local politics in order to protect their interests.
“Students live in D.C. for a majority of the year. The laws that take place in Washington D.C. really have a significant impact on their lives and how they enjoy Georgetown University,” Sticka said.
“I understand wanting to vote at home and stay involved in local politics, but what happens in D.C. affects us and what happens on the ANC affects us,” he said. “If students have a stronger voice saying that these are things that matter to them then, they can make things happen.”

The first phase of the construction of an interfaith center in the Leavey Center came to a close last weekend when a new Jewish prayer space, along with a revamped Bulldog Alley which can now be used for Muslim prayers, opened.
The renovations will serve as a temporary space for both the Jewish and Muslim communities until an interfaith center – slated to contain new Jewish and Muslim prayer spaces, along with a Kosher/Halal kitchen and an interfaith chapel – is built in Leavey.
“This is just … phase one,” said Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., vice president for mission and ministry, of the recent renovations.
According to O’Brien, no timeline has yet been set for the project, and the dates will depend on the university’s ability to finance the project.
The Jewish prayer space, Makóm, moves Jewish gathering space onto campus for the first time. In previous years, Jewish services have been held in a 36th Street townhouse rented by the chaplaincy.
“As a matter of equity, we wanted to give them on-campus space,” O’Brien said.
Samantha Sisskind (SFS ’12), co-president of the Jewish Students Association, thinks that the new space will allow the JSA to establish and strengthen relationships with new students and returning ones who felt distanced from the center of the community.
“I’m sure we are all pleased that we won’t have to trek outside the campus walls every Friday night!” she wrote in an email.
Bulldog Alley, a space that is used by many student groups, was also refurbished over the summer. The newly redone space will now be used for Friday prayers by the Muslim community, while its smaller prayer space in Copley Hall will remain in use for other occasions.
Wardah Athar (COL ’13), vice president of the Muslim Student Association, said the use of Bulldog Alley would better accommodate the large number of undergraduate, graduate and medical center students who attend Friday prayers.
“For Friday prayers, there are so many people who come – we couldn’t fit them all,” she said.
Sisskind said that their new space has also made the JSA and Jewish chaplaincy more ambitious.
“We hope to invite more student groups to join us for Shabbat, or lead our services, as we will have the space to accommodate more guests,” she wrote.
O’Brien said that the new space can accommodate a much larger number of people than the townhouse living room where services were previously held.
“I was delighted at how large it was compared to their old space,” he said.
Correction: Wardah Athar’s name was mistakenly spelled “Afthar” in a previous version of this article.

Despite Hurricane Irene’s disruption of the New Student Orientation schedule, incoming students to the Hilltop adjusted well to the new timetables during their hectic first days on the Hilltop.
While university officials canceled or postponed events early in the weekend as precautionary measures in preparation for Hurricane Irene, students understood that changes to the schedule were necessary to secure students’ safety.
“I think they were just worried. When something you can’t control happens, and you have a bunch of new students coming from across the country and the world, it’s a little nerve-wracking,” Colleen Roberts (COL ’15) said.
Some students were frustrated that they had to miss certain events, like the walking tours of the campus and neighborhood. The largest scheduling change, the shifting of New Student Convocation to today, forced many students’ families to miss the traditional event.
“Having it be two days [later] and then on Tuesday evening is way far apart from when my parents planned on leaving,” Noreen Sajwani (NHS ’15) said.
New students also stressed that the cancelation of some events known as an opportunity for bonding, like Destination: Georgetown, in which orientation advisers take their freshmen for dinner somewhere outside the university’s front gates did not undermine their ability to meet their classmates. They instead suggested that the more open schedule may have facilitated more interaction with students in their orientation groups and on their residence hall floors.
“Today the weather was nice and we didn’t have to do anything at all,” Sajwani said about the cancelation of events on Sunday. “It’s really easy to get to know people … My issue is getting to know people’s names.”
“Everyone’s really open. Everyone’s in the same position at a new school, so it’s really easy to meet people,” Roberts echoed.
New this year was the blog NSO maintained for parents beginning in June. The website provided information to families interested in learning more about school resources and academic and extracurricular opportunities. The blog, which received over 6,500 views, also posted updates throughout the weekend about NSO events and hurricane preparations.
Georgetown University Students Association also contributed to the week’s events for the first time. As part of their involvement, GUSA helped set up Project Move-In, an initiative designed with the Georgetown Scholars Program and the Financial Affairs Office to help incoming students who arrived in Washington, D.C., without move-in assistance. Alumni, students and faculty picked up eligible students from Reagan and Dulles airports, transported them to campus and helped them move into dorms.
“It was really exciting to be a part of NSO and a part of the freshman move-in experience,” GregLaverriere (COL ’12), GUSA vice president, said. He added that he hopes future executives continue and expand the practice.
“I think this was a first great step. In the past, GUSA has been noticeably absent, and that’s a shame,” he said.
President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) also addressed the freshman class at the NSO closing ceremony Sunday evening.
In his speech, Meaney called on students to translate what they learn at Georgetown into action.
“We are called to determine for ourselves what it is we are meant to do with our knowledge and ourgifts.”

After the university hunkered down in preparation for Hurricane Irene’s wrath, minimal damage was apparent on Sunday morning.
The Category 1 hurricane dumped four inches of rain on the campus throughout Saturday afternoon and evening. Forty to fifty miles per hour winds, which qualify as tropical storm force, slammed the campus area.
Large roof shingles on the New Science Center construction site came loose Saturday night as the hurricane winds buffeted the city. Students were informed of the damage and were warned at 11:55 p.m. throughHOYAlert — the university’s text messaging system used to notify students of emergencies — that the shingles could possibly become projectiles.
D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services responded to the scene, as they originally believed that the building was collapsing, according to D.C. Fire and EMS spokesman Pete Piringer.
The fire department secured the area and established a safety zone from which pedestrians were excluded.
The shingles on the New Science center were repaired Sunday morning after the weather relented. The university also addressed minor repairs across campus, particularly leaks resulting from the heavy rain.
An additional HOYAlert message at 1:15 a.m. warned students to remain indoors, citing downed trees and flying debris as possible hazards. The danger of encountering debris carried by the violent winds was a threat through the city on Saturday night. Some minor injuries were sustained throughout D.C., according to Piringer.
“We always had the potential danger of people being struck,” he said. “Neither [at Georgetown] nor anywhere else around the city were there serious injuries.”
Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service received no hurricane-related emergency calls this weekend, according to Emily Malavenda (COL ’13), GERMS’ director of public relations.
President Obama declared a state of emergency for the District Sunday morning, according to a Federal Emergency Management Agency press release the same day. This measure enables the agency to organize disaster relief efforts using federal funding. Seventy-five percent of the aid needed to address the city’s emergency measures will be provided by the federal government.
The university experienced 28 leaks across campus and two downed off-campus trees and one student reported the smell of gas in the aftermath of the hurricane, according to Vice President for Facilities and Student Housing Karen Frank. There was no structural damage to any university building, however. The university had removed the three crosses affixed to the top of Healy Hall in preparation for the hurricane. It was determined that the crosses should be better secured in an inspection of the campus after Tuesday’s earthquake.
The university had also prepared for power outages by encouraging students to store emergency supplies and bringing in four additional industrial grade generators to sustain O’Donovan Dining Hall and the Leavey Center as well as other designated gathering spaces. However, no area of the campus lost power throughout Saturday night.
While campus reactions to the hurricane varied, some students took heed of the university’s warnings and stocked up on dry goods, batteries and flashlights. In doing so, many encountered the widespread panic in the greater D.C. area.
“There was a single loaf of bread. This lady fought me for a Lunchable,” said Julie Negussie (COL ’14), who went to Wal-Mart to find supplies. “At 1 a.m. there were lines.”
With such apprehension apparent, New Student Orientation made serious changes to its schedule. New Student Convocation, planned for Sunday morning, has been moved to Tuesday, Aug. 30 at 7p.m. and will be broadcast online for families who cannot attend. While the NSO staff published the original amendments to the schedule on Friday evening, changes to individual events have been made throughout the weekend, with Orientation Advisers passing the news on to their freshmen.
“It’s more difficult to keep [the freshmen] updated and make sure they’re all there,” OA Franklin Sylvester (COL ’14) said regarding the rather sudden changes to the schedule. “The next few days should be back to normal, which are technically the most important … in becoming part of thecommunity.”
Sylvester believes that being confronted with a hurricane has not weakened the bonds that are traditionally formed during NSO.
“The rain’s not really affecting [the freshmen’s excitement] and that’s why I’m trying to not let it bother me either,” he said.
Freshmen said that the changes to the schedule have changed the pace of their first few days on campus. Matt Sarge (NHS ’15) felt that, because the university was worried about the storm, his move-in day was too rushed and his first full day on campus was too slow. Still, he felt that he has still had ample time to get to know his orientation group despite the erratic schedule.
“I think when we’re meeting we get to know people better, but we haven’t had as much time,” he said.
The university has allowed returning students to move in early and all students to delay their arrivals as necessary to accommodate storm-related travel difficulty. Students who have yet to arrive on campus will receive move-in assistance and be granted academic flexibility.
In the end, some students felt the event did not live up to the hype.
“I was really hoping for more drama. Trees crashing, power going out, chaos,” Thomas Brooke (NHS ‘14) said.

As Hurricane Irene slammed campus early Sunday, three male students’ efforts to evade Department of Public Safety officers ended in $1,500 worth of damages to offices on the fourth floor of the Leavey Center and the university pressing criminal charges.
On Sunday morning around 1:13 a.m., the suspects were checking out the university report regarding the dangerous conditions of the loosened shingles on the New Science Center. While on the Leavey Esplanade, the students were told by DPS officers to leave the area, as university officials were worried the heavy metal shingles could become dangerous projectiles, according to DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith.
Instead of following the officers’ orders, the three students — two of whom are current staffers of the student media outlet The Voice — fled to The Voice’s office on the fourth floor of Leavey with the officers in pursuit, according to Smith. The three locked the door of the office and then decided to avoid capture by breaking through the drop ceiling panels and crawling into the adjacent offices, Smith said.
The suspects, while fleeing through the ceilings of the offices of The Hoya, the Debate Team and Director of Residential Ministry Michelle Siemietkowski, destroyed several ceiling panels and damaged the structural support system in the ceilings.
Smith said that the students could be heard climbing through the ceiling as one of the officers went to retrieve keys to the office. It ultimately became only a matter of time before they surrendered, according to Smith.
“There really was no way to get out,” he said.
“The students refused to comply with repeated, reasonable requests from uniformed Department of Public Safety officers,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said. “This required critical resources be diverted during the university’s emergency response to Hurricane Irene.”
Two of the students turned themselves in after the destruction, but one of the suspects exited through a fourth-floor window and was found on the outcropping overhang connected to the second floor. That suspect sustained serious injuries after dropping two stories and is currently recovering at the Georgetown University Hospital.
The remaining suspects were taken into police custody, and the Metropolitan Police Department has charged all three suspects with destruction of property. This offense can carry fines of up to $5,000 and/or jail time of up to 10 years.
The Student Code of Conduct categorizes such an offense as a Class B violation, which can result in moderate to serious level violations.
First-time violations of the code include sanctions ranging from housing relocation, housing probation, apartment living suspension or housing suspension to possible disciplinary probation or disciplinary suspension for up to two years.
“Category B violations may result in the most severe sanctions when warranted by the nature of the violation or the student’s prior record,” the code states.
Smith expressed his regret that the students did not initially heed the DPS officers’ warnings, stating that the entire event could have been avoided.
“Our interest is to protect university safety,” he said. “We want to be here to protect them. We are here to help.”

A surge in burglaries on and off the Georgetown campus, including a number targeting the Southwest Quad, marked a 141 percent increase in burglaries in the neighborhood from the same period last year.
Since May 1, fourteen Georgetown residences and one faculty office were burglarized, according to the Department of Public Safety. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police Department records show that the Georgetown neighborhood at large has seen 41 burglaries in the same period.
Nine of the burglaries at residences occurred in Reynolds Hall, two in New South, one in Kennedy and one in McCarthy. Multiple burglaries often occurred at a residence in a single day. On June 24 alone, five Reynolds residents reported to DPS that their rooms had been burglarized. Missing items included a camera, two cell phones, two iPods and a purse.
There were no signs that force was used in breaking into any of the rooms, though most victims said that they had locked their doors. According to Joseph Smith, the associate director of DPS, there are a number of possible reasons for this.
“It depends on who has access to the room, and sometimes people will believe they remember closing the door when maybe perhaps they didn’t. Or it could be that somebody else has key access. It could be university staff.”
According to Smith, the fact that several rooms in one residence were often burglarized at once indicates that the perpetrator was well aware of the residents’ comings and goings.
“You may have one perpetrator who’s going to several different residences, or it could be multiple perpetrators. I think whoever it is timed it well that there wasn’t anybody at home at the time of each of those, which would indicate some kind of inside knowledge, whether they’re a resident themselves or something else, to know that kind of detail,” he said.
Smith could not comment on the progress of the investigations into these and other burglaries, which he says are still ongoing.
Meanwhile, students who lived on campus over the summer were disturbed by the high levels of crime.
“I think it’s pretty awful,” said Mary Grace Reich, who lived in Village A over the summer. “Over the summer I just feel less safe, because there are fewer people around and fewer eyes out.”
The summer also saw a large number of thefts, with 51 thefts reported to DPS in a three month period. Property crime is the most common type of crime in the Georgetown area, representing 71 percent of incidents on campus and 93 percent of incidents in the neighborhood at large.
Spencer Daum (SFS ’13), a former cartoonist for The Hoya, was one of this summer’s many Southwest Quad burglary victims. On May 24, he was in the process of moving his things to his new apartment when he found that his old room in Kennedy Hall had been ransacked. His two computers, iPod and other possessions were missing.
“It’s made me trust the university a lot less, because when I left there were [university employees] on that floor of Kennedy, and those people were still there when I got back. None of them claimed to see anything. And I was pretty sure I locked my door,” he said.
Daum said that he found DPS unhelpful when he went to them to report the incident.
“They took my information down and they put descriptions down and they told me if you have any questions you can call. They never responded and never followed up with any investigations.”
But Smith said that the best thing students can do to protect their belongings is to be more cautious about where they leave things.
“Have your door locked, have your laptop secured,” he said. “The more you can do to slow down a bad guy, the more it’s going to make it more difficult for him or her to take a laptop.”
Reich said that the increase in burglaries has made her and her friends more careful.
“From the people that I’ve talked to, there’s definitely been an increase in awareness just from the number of public safety alerts we get,” she said.

The administration’s brewing dissent for the Healy Pub proposal came to a head Wednesday when University President John J. DeGioia indicated that approval is unlikely for the student effort.
“[The Healy Pub] is not part of the vision for addressing the needs of student space at Georgetown,” he said.
In a meeting with student press, DeGioia and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson clearly expressed that a student space in Healy Hall will not be a piece of the planned expansion of gathering space on campus.
Pub proponents said they were unfazed by the comments and vowed to press forward with their campaign.
“We’ve known his position for months, this in no way deters our efforts … We’re looking forward to be able to argue it in person,” said Chris Pigott (COL ’12), one of the founders of the effort. “We have arguments that have not been heard by anyone.”
Olson told reporters that a New South student space was a priority and that conversations about serving alcohol in the venue will “But clearly what’s in there is not going to be the same as the Healy Pub was. But I think it can be and very much wants to be an equally appealing place for students to gather and have fun together,” Olsen said.
According to Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee chairman, there are set plans for the pub proposal working group to present a revised plan to DeGioia and the administration.
“Until that meeting takes place, it would be hard for President DeGioia to give a completely educated response to the proposal,” he said.
DeGioia backed his position with a number of concerns about the viability of a pub space on the Hilltop. He referenced the failed pub attempt in the Leavey Center and the issues that it presented from a legal and financial perspective. The Leavey Pub, the successor of the Healey Pub, was closed in 1994.
“I recognize from our alumni community the nostalgia that they have for this extraordinary experience that they had. But what I don’t think that they appreciate is that they were the last ones to have that experience,” DeGioia said.
He also raised concerns about the effects that the proposal might have on the community.
“We have not demonstrated in this changed environment that we can manage a pub on campus and the way in which the Healy Pub characterized this campus from 1974 to 1988,” he said. “I certainly can attest to the enjoyment that facility gave to my generation; [however], the alumni who have been enthusiastic about this project have forgotten that beginning in 1986, the laws changed.”
Pigott said he felt that the movement still carries weight.
“Until we are allowed to voice the full merits of the proposal …and the guarantee that it can be done well, until he hears that, I’m not going to take any [statement] at face value,” he said.
DeGioia and Olsen emphasized the administration’s continued focus on the development of space in New South and working with students to include their input in the design. .
“We take seriously the need to improve student gathering space and we want our students to feel welcome on campus,” Olsen said.
“But it’s a bridge too far, I think, to get to the Healy Pub,” DeGioia added.

Sam Buckley (COL ’14) and Eric Pilch (COL ’12) — suspects in the damaging of several fourth-floor Leavey Center offices early Sunday morning — have been charged with two misdemeanors of destruction of property under $1,000 and unlawful entry, according to court records. John Flanagan (SFS ’14), the third suspect, was also charged with the destruction of property under $1,000.
Flanagan is recovering from a broken leg, an injury sustained when he exited a window on the fourth floor of Leavey and dropped two stories to the outcropping overhang below.
All three pled not guilty to the charges and asserted their rights to a trial. They will appear in court on Sept. 21.
At around 1 a.m. on Sunday, Buckley, Flanagan and Pilch were on the Leavey Esplanade to report on the loosened shingles of the science center when DPS officers asked them to leave the area. Flanagan and Buckley serve as two of the three co-editors of The Voice’s blog, Vox Populi. Pilch is listed as a staff member of The Voice on The Voice’s website’s masthead.
At the time on Sunday morning, university officials were worried that the loosened metal shingles could become dangerous projectiles as Hurricane Irene raged and had ordered DPS to secure the perimeter.
After the officers asked the students to leave the area, the suspects fled to the fourth floor of Leavey and into The Voice office. According to DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith, despite repeated requests for them to surrender, the students attempted to escape by climbing into the adjacent offices. The Metropolitan Police Department was called as one DPS officer went to recover keys to the office.
According to Smith, it ultimately became a matter of time before the group surrendered, as the officers could hear the suspects climbing through the ceiling.
“There really was no way to get out,” he said.
Pilch and Buckley surrendered to the police, but Flanagan was found on the outcropping after exiting through a fourth-floor window.
The misdemeanor offense of destruction of property valued over $200 can carry fines of up to $5,000 and/or jail time of up to 10 years. The charge of unlawful entry carries a fine under $1,000 and/or imprisonment for no more than 180 days.
The Student Code of Conduct categorizes such an offense as a Class B violation, which can result in moderate to serious level violations.
First-time violations of the code include sanctions ranging from housing relocation, housing probation, apartment living suspension or housing suspension to possible disciplinary probation or disciplinary suspension for up to two years.
“Category B violations may result in the most severe sanctions when warranted by the nature of the violation or the student’s prior record,” the code states.
Tim Shine (MSB ’12), the editor-in-chief of The Voice, released a statement on the matter today.
“This case is an ongoing legal and disciplinary matter, and rest assured that The Voice board is in the process of considering its full extent of internal disciplinary options for those involved, including removal from the paper,” he wrote on Vox Populi. “We regret that the independent actions of two Voice staffers have adversely affected our fellow organizations on the fourth floor of the Leavey Center.”
Shine went on to say that The Voice would not publish as usual this week.
“In addition to the serious repairs that will be required to our office space, the Voice will also not be able to publish an issue this week as a result of the incident.”
On Thursday, Shine confirmed that The Voice would be publishing an issue next week, however.
“We’ve yet to receive notification of any official disciplinary action,” he added.
Director of Student Programs Erika Cohen-Derr stated that there has been no official suspension of The Voice.
“There have been no disciplinary complaints filed at this moment,” Cohen-Derr said at 1:30 p.m. today.
As for the repairs to the offices affected, Cohen-Derr stated that it was the Center for Student Programs’ priority to get the spaces back to working condition.
Original maintenance estimates by workmen visiting The Hoya’s office stated that the entire ceiling would cost less to replace rather than fixing the area affected.
