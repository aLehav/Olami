Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte joined Georgetown University students for a conversation on Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine and the importance of strengthening transatlantic partnerships.
The Atlantic Council, a think tank focused on international relations and economic development, organized the Jan. 17 event in partnership with the School of Foreign Service (SFS). Rutte spoke on a few ongoing Dutch foreign policy initiatives in a discussion that explored the extent of the Netherlands’ support of Ukraine during the war, his collaboration with NATO, the legitimacy of government tribunals and hybrid warfare tactics. Jörn Fleck, a senior director with the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, introduced Rutte at the event, which was moderated by Amy Mackinnon, a national security and intelligence reporter for Foreign Policy magazine. 
Rutte said the Ukrainian cause is a top priority for the Netherlands because democracies should help protect other democracies across the world.
“What Putin is doing is running directly against our values of not colonizing another country, not force grabbing land of a country, not threatening freedom of speech and freedom of journalism. These are all sacrosanct in the Western world,” Rutte said at the event. 
Much of the Netherlands’ current focus has been centered around directing financial and military resources toward assisting the Ukrainian fight for independence, according to Rutte. 
Since the start of the war, the Netherlands has invested millions of euros into food, water, shelter and medical care for Ukrainians. The Dutch government recently doubled down on its financial support by committing another 2.5 billion euros in aid. Ukraine is also set to receive advanced military technology in the form of Patriot defense systems, surface-to-air missile defense systems, from the Netherlands.
Fleck said Putin underestimated the strength of Ukraine and its allies when he began his invasion of the country in February 2022.
“When Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine in February of last year, he made two bad bets,” Fleck said at the event. “First, that Ukraine would quickly falter and second, that a fractured and weak West would stand idly by.”
Fleck said that over the past year, Putin’s idealized ambitions have largely fallen flat as Ukrainians have stood their ground.
“He lost badly. For nearly a year, the Ukrainian people have shown incredible courage and tenacity in fighting back against Russian attacks on their lives, their homes and hospitals. Ukraine stepped up and so has the West,” Fleck said at the event.
While Putin initially targeted population centers like the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, counteroffensive efforts have shifted Russian objectives toward the Donbas, a largely Russian-speaking region in eastern Ukraine, and the southern part of Ukraine along the Black Sea. Violent separatist movements in the region, many backed by Russia, have been occurring for the better part of the last decade.
Mackinnon said the conflict in Ukraine is not over, as new threats are on the horizon every day. 
“Officials in Kyiv have been sounding the alarm that Moscow may be on the brink of announcing another mobilization ahead of a renewed offensive operation in the spring,” Mackinnon said.
In addition to warnings of increased Russian manpower, former President of Russia and fervent Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev recently warned of a nuclear attack in the event of a Ukrainian victory. 
Rutte said international cooperation is critical for securing desirable results, as can be seen in Ukraine’s case. 
The Netherlands promised NATO that it would spend 2% of its GDP on defense in 2014, according to Rutte.
“We followed with a commitment of five more billion,” Rutte said at the event. “We all have to do more, and the same goes for us.”
Rutte said Putin needs to be held accountable for the bloodshed he and his government continues to cause in Ukraine. 
“At this stage when the Russian aggression is killing people, and again this week, over 40 people died and still 20 are missing, it’s so difficult for me to think about what to give to Vladimir so he is a bit less offended,” Rutte said. “No, he needs to stop this and his government needs to be brought to accountability.”
The Netherlands will fight until Ukraine is free, according to Rutte.
“It can take years and years until we get to full recognition, but we will not let go, the Netherlands,” Rutte said. “We will not let go.”

Kim Daniels, an advisor to the Vatican and Catholic church officials, will be the new director of Georgetown University’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life. 
Daniels, who previously served as the initiative’s co-director, replaced John Carr, the initiative’s founding director, on Jan. 1. The initiative aims to promote dialogue at the intersection of faith and politics and to encourage students to see their faith and Catholic social teaching as important parts of their lives. 
Since its founding in 2013, the initiative has hosted 145 speaker events featuring religious and political leaders, journalists and academics.
As director, Daniels said she hopes to focus on Washington, D.C. youth and their exploration of faith while connecting the values of the institute to greater world developments such as the conflict in Ukraine, racial justice and Pope Francis’ focus on solidarity with vulnerable populations. 
“I’m excited to strengthen and broaden the Initiative’s efforts to bring principles of Catholic social teaching, such as our commitment to seeking justice and advancing the common good, to national and global conversations,” Daniels wrote to The Hoya. 
In particular, Daniels said she intends to uplift the voices of young Latinx Catholics and women on Georgetown’s campus. 
“As director I also hope to expand our efforts to bring together young Catholics in Washington to explore links between their faith, Catholic social thought, and their lives and work, and to help raise up the voices of young Latino Catholics as well,” Daniels wrote. “One of my central goals as Director is to raise up the leadership of women and to reflect the diversity of Georgetown, our country, and our global Church in all that the Initiative does.”
Daniels has worked with the initiative since its 2013 foundation, serving as its associate director from 2018 to 2020 and co-director from 2021 to 2022. Additionally, Daniels served as a lead adviser to the Vatican, U.S. bishops and Catholic organizations on issues intersecting with Church teachings and public life and as an adjunct professor in Georgetown’s department of theology and religious studies.
Daniels said she aims to attract more students to the initiative’s events. 
“In the coming years our team will focus on more fully engaging Georgetown students and the broader Georgetown community in our efforts to bring Catholic social thought and the Jesuit tradition to current questions at the intersection of faith and public life,” Daniels wrote.
Kimberly Mazyck (SFS ’90), the initiative’s newly hired associate director, emphasized Daniels’ commitment to hearing from diverse voices as a leader.
“I know that she is committed to building bridges across political, religious and ideological lines which is critical to civil dialogue. I also know that she will lead by lifting up the voices of other women and lay leaders,” Mazyck wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I know that with her leadership, the Initiative will continue to promote the common good especially in critical conversations impacting our country and our world.”
Carr founded the initiative in 2013 after university President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’86, GRD ’03) reached out to him about the opportunity, and said that despite initial doubts, the initiative has seen remarkable success over the past decade, with thousands of students showing up for dialogues.
“There is a hunger on campus and beyond for the moral vocabulary of Catholic social teaching,” Carr told The Hoya. “In a divided time, in the church, in Washington, there is a real desire for civil dialogue that is principled around fundamental ideas.”
DeGioia said the initiative’s work plays an important role in promoting Georgetown’s values in a Jan. 12 email to students announcing Daniels’s appointment.
“The Initiative has become a preeminent place of dialogue and leadership at the intersection of faith and public life and a powerful example of Georgetown’s Catholic and Jesuit mission in action,” DeGioia wrote in a press release from the university. “The Initiative’s mission and progress are more important than ever here at Georgetown, in Washington, and for our Church and nation.”
Carr said he looks forward to the initiative continuing to serve as a facilitator of peaceful discussions on social issues in the church and public life under Daniels.
“Georgetown is the right place and it is the right time to promote civil dialogue and to lift up basic principles of human dignity and solidarity,” Carr said.

A group of McDonough School of Business (MSB) students visited New York City on Nov. 11 to learn from executives in the Estée Lauder Companies (ELC), an American cosmetics manufacturer.
The trip was organized by the Gen Z Network Initiative, a partnership between the MSB, ELC and the Global Business Initiative (GBI), an MSB program that aims to introduce Georgetown University students to corporate executives. The Gen Z Network Initiative provides training and opportunities for young entrepreneurs by connecting them with ELC executives to consult on a specific brand from ELC’s portfolio, including MAC Cosmetics and Clinique. Through this partnership, 10 Georgetown students had the opportunity to speak with company executives.
This year, the Gen Z Network Initiative collaborated with Origins, a skincare brand under ELC which focuses on using plant-based ingredients. Students met every Friday to communicate with executives, understand consumer preferences and explore ways that brands can change according to their feedback, according to a press release on the MSB website. 
Students had the opportunity to engage with the problems that Origins executives face and how they approach solving them, while the company received valuable consumer feedback from a savvy student population, according to GBI Director Ricardo Ernst.
Ernst said the event succeeded at providing students with experience that cannot be found in the classroom.
“It gives the students the opportunity of working firsthand with real problems and real companies, and that is the beauty of the whole thing,” Ernst told The Hoya.
Nikita Thummala (MSB ’24), a student who participated in the event, said she gained invaluable corporate lessons from working with the Gen Z Network Initiative and seeing business principles applied to a real-world product.
“We were able to understand and experience the thought process that goes behind every part of the brand, from the Origins website all the way to its product packaging,” Thummala wrote to The Hoya. “The initiative showed me that business, especially within the cosmetic industry, is very collaborative and truly analyzes the current culture in order to best serve future consumers.
The program offered benefits to both students and ELC executives, according to a university spokesperson.
“Through this initiative, students provide the ELC with consumer-centered feedback,” the spokesperson said. “The ELC, in exchange, provides the group with development, education and mentorship opportunities, as well as the chance to gain industry insights and work with and learn from executives in different areas of the company.”
Thummala said she got to speak one-on-one with CEO of the Global Reverse Mentor Program at ELC, Lea Nesdale, about possible career paths.
“She was very hands on and was kind enough to have a one-on-one discussion about her journey through ELC and some future roles I could possibly get into,” Thummala wrote. “All of these individuals were incredibly respectful and truly listened to everything we had to say. They also helped our experience by asking us questions that pushed our thinking process and really narrowed our suggestions into concrete ideas.”
Although ELC is the first company that GBI has partnered with, Ernst said he is hopeful that more companies, including the jeweler Cartier, will want to participate in the initiative after seeing the benefits of learning from youthful perspectives. 
“Now we are looking to expand into other companies,” Ernst said. “It was so successful, and Estée Lauder was so happy with it, that now we would like to leverage that in bringing other companies to do the same thing. The more the better in the sense of engaging students by offering first hand experience in how they can start working with companies while they are still at Georgetown.”
Thummala said she is excited to bond further with other students involved in the program at future Gen Z Network Initiative events. 
“I truly loved working with the Gen Z Initiative and not only meeting executives from ELC but also collaborating with a group of incredibly talented Georgetown students,” Thummala wrote. “Everyone highlighted different strengths, and it was wonderful to learn from not only people at the company but from my own peers as well.”

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) announced D.C.’s economic goals for the next five years on Jan. 9. 
The economic development plan, known as the “Comeback Plan,” highlights six major areas in which to achieve economic growth by 2028. This includes the creation of new jobs in specific sectors and increasing the size of the downtown population.
Bowser said the new plan emphasizes investment in all of the District’s communities to eliminate resource gaps across neighborhoods, such as in food, housing and internet access.
“This is a comeback that is focused on equity,” Bowser said in a Jan. 9 press release. “This is about making sure we have the revenues to support our world-class city services, our robust network of social programs, and the resources — like our schools and rec centers — that keep people in DC.”
D.C. revealed on Dec. 30, 2022, that estimates for the District’s annual revenue had increased by $172.1 million. 
Bowser said economic indicators like the revised revenue, recent GDP growth and population increases inspire optimism for the area’s prosperity over the next five years, according to a press release.
“Our priority remains on ensuring every Washingtonian has a fair shot and that we have the resources necessary to address our most pressing challenges, take care of our most vulnerable neighbors, deliver world-class city services, and create new opportunities for residents and businesses,” Bowser said in the Dec. 30 press release.
In the third quarter of 2022, professional, scientific and technical services, sectors which the economic plan will focus on supporting, increased in D.C. and contributed most to the District’s GDP growth.
The Comeback Plan also strives to improve the economic prosperity of Black and minority residents by aiming to have minority-owned employer businesses make up one-third of all businesses, eliminating opportunity gaps and lifting Black residents’ median household income by $25,000.
Black residents make up 45 percent of the D.C. population, however Black-owned businesses make up less than 14 percent of total businesses in D.C., according to the 2017 Annual Business Survey. 
Additionally, Black and white Washingtonians face a median household income disparity of over $100k, respectively earning $53,629 and $160,194 annually, as of March 2022.
Black residents of the District experience a poverty rate of 21.6%, over four times as much as D.C.’s white residents, who experience a poverty rate of 5.1%, the 2019 American Community Survey estimates. 
D.C. has turned to the Vitality Fund, a new multiyear program that incentivizes companies to remain, expand or relocate to the District by supplying funds for basic business costs to local entrepreneurs, to reach its economic goals.
“It will encourage employers to locate in DC and create jobs, bringing the city closer to our job creation goals in high-growth sectors, including technology,” the Jan. 9 press release reads. “Expenses such as rent, tenant improvements, down payment assistance, workforce training, and recruitment can be covered with the program funds.”
Joe Massaua (SFS ’25), a representative of Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) 2E, which oversees the Georgetown, Burleith and Hillandale neighborhoods, said that he looks forward to seeing the plan implemented.
“Mayor Bowser’s ‘comeback plan’ provides great opportunities for investment in our local communities,” Massaua wrote to The Hoya. “I’m excited to work with the Georgetown Community Partnership (GCP) and Georgetown Main Streets (GMS) to craft solutions for the Georgetown neighborhood.”
Bowser said the Comeback Plan aims to provide people from all backgrounds with greater access to the economic opportunities of D.C.
“People stay in and come to Washington, DC because they want to change the world — because they recognize DC as a place where you can bring big ideas to life,” Bowser said in the Jan. 9 press release. “Our comeback is about unlocking the full potential of our people, our neighborhoods, and our businesses.”

A Johns Hopkins professor presented her new book on the logistical and communicational behavior of insurgent forces during the Lebanon Civil War at a Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS) event.
Georgetown’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies (CCAS), the only academic center in the United States exclusively dedicated to studying the Arab world, hosted the Jan. 17 discussion with professor Sarah Parkinson. During the talk, Parkinson explored the inspiration behind her book, “Beyond the Lines: Social Networks and Palestinian Militant Organizations in Wartime Lebanon,” and described how guerilla militant groups combated the operational and resource disadvantages of asymmetrical warfare.
Parkinson said the book aims to capture the human element of warfare that is often ignored in traditional military analysis. 
“In Beyond the Lines, I’m interested in deemphasizing battlefield scorecards, which emphasize the actions of fighters, in favor of analyzing how both combatant and non-combatant labor shape organizational and political trajectories,” Parkinson said at the event. “So the argument here is that understanding people’s lived experiences of conflict is not simply a humanitarian necessity, it’s a political imperative.”
Parkinson began by describing the stories of several young women in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), highlighting their multifaceted duties. 
Alongside their expertise in firearms and combat, these PLO soldiers serve as battlefield medics, ambulance drivers, nurses, logisticians and social workers, according to Parkinson. 
“Every armed conflict involves backstage labor, logistical intelligence, medicine, finance and human resources that may not involve using a weapon,” Parkinson said at the event. “Indeed, most experienced militants with whom I’ve spoken do not consider the physical labor of killing the most important aspect of armed conflict.”
Parkinson then discussed the ways military networks structure themselves, and said insurgent groups are often organized as a complex web that involves intimate personal connections and social roles as opposed to a regimented, linear ladder.
“If you think about what a military organization looks like, it’s a hierarchy, top to bottom,” Parkinson said. “However, think about how all of the people in that are in multiple networks at the same time. Someone who is a soldier is also a spouse, is also a member of a sports team.”
Parkinson also explored how militias utilize stereotypes at the intersection of gender and age, such as underestimating the capabilities of older women, to their benefit for communication purposes. 
“One of the people I knew who had been in a guerrilla organization talked about this little old lady who would stand next to a collaborator and drop a bag of groceries. That’s how we knew we had to target that person,” Parkinson said.
While discussing the common presentation of non-combat roles like document forgery, which are often done by women, as merely indirect support, Parkinson said these roles are highly specialized and require far more skill than ground soldiers. 
“I can give an 18-year-old guy a gun and train him to shoot at the broadside of a barn,” Parkinson said.“And then I can think about what it takes to forge a passport, which is what a lot of these support roles are. Are you confident smuggling $10,000 in cash tomorrow? These are high-skilled roles requiring incredible people skills that most 16 to 18-year-olds do not have.”
Looking forward, Parkinson said she expects U.S. activism strategy to parallel the tactics rebel forces in the Middle East have used to achieve their political goals. 
“Regarding American reproductive rights issues that have returned, you will get old people mobilizing because they have old networks from when they were protesting in the 70s,” Parkinson said. “They’re back out there in a very particular way because of how they understand a particular mode of repression.”

The National Academy of Inventors (NAI) elected a Georgetown physics professor as a member of its 2022 class of Fellows for his achievements in physics research.
Professor Kai Liu, whose research focuses on improving the environmental sustainability of digital storage and magnet production, joined 168 other new Fellows who collectively hold over 5,000 U.S. patents. The honor is one of the highest professional distinctions for academic inventors and connects NAI members with other top researchers in their field of study. 
Liu said he is researching how to realign magnetic materials to reduce energy consumption. 
“We have demonstrated how to make them twist and turn into certain exotic winding configurations,” Liu wrote to The Hoya. “These findings may someday lead to devices that only use a tiny fraction of the energy compared to the current technology.”
Liu said that his experimentation with various materials, including metallic foams and metal and oxide interfaces, can creatively improve information storage and better the efficiency of hydrogen storage and air filtration systems.
“Our research in this area has led to a number of inventions to introduce topology into nanoscale magnets, which are relevant to the sustainability challenge we face in nanoelectronics – energy consumption in information and communications technology already accounts for over 10 percent of world’s total energy usage today, and continues to rise rapidly,” Liu said.
Amy Liu, the chair of the physics department, said that Kai Liu’s award is fitting for all the academic accomplishments that he has contributed to the field of physics.
“Professor Liu is an outstanding researcher who not only makes important contributions to understanding the fundamental science of materials at the nanoscale, but also thinks creatively about potential applications of these materials, particularly in terms of sustainability,” Amy Liu wrote to The Hoya. 
Amy Liu said Kai Liu is devoted to student mentorship in addition to academic excellence. 
“Through his teaching and research mentoring, he is helping students develop a spirit of innovation in the way they do science,” Amy Liu said.
Over the past two years, Kai Liu has led a group of Georgetown student researchers through their participation in the Mask Innovation Challenge, a materials design competition sponsored by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to improve the protection of masks. His team won the first phase of the competition in 2021 and was selected as a finalist for the second phase in June 2022.
Makarand Paranjape, an associate professor in the physics department, said Kai Liu’s focus on real-world impact not only attracts students but also adds to the interdisciplinary nature of his work.
“Kai generates a lot of interest from students to undertake both undergraduate and graduate projects under his mentorship,” Paranjape said. “He also does not hesitate in exploring completely new avenues of research.”
Kai Liu said he plans to continue exploring new mask technologies, most recently through using his expertise in nanomagnetism to improve the reusability of masks.
“One of the projects my group is currently working on is a novel type of nanoporous metallic foams built by nanowires,” Kai Liu said. “The foams are ‘light as a feather,’ yet robust and efficient for capturing ultrasmall particulates – a critical need that we know all too well in the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Liu said he is grateful to be joining his peers in the NAI, and he hopes to use the honor to expand his collaborations with other top scholars in physics.
“It’s a rather humbling experience to be named a NAI Fellow,” Liu said. “I’m most excited that the NAI recognizes our innovations as impactful and relevant to society. Getting this pat on the back is tremendous encouragement that we are doing something right. Our work is really just starting.”
Liu said he is grateful for all the support the Georgetown community has given him in his career leading up to the fellowship. 
“The work done together with my students, postdocs and collaborators over the years made this award possible,” Liu said. “To get recognized for doing things we love just brings a grin to everyone’s face.”

A Georgetown graduate won $45,000 on the quiz show “Jeopardy!” on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6.
Patrick Curran (CAS ’14, GRD ’19) competed in three games of “Jeopardy!” during the show’s 39th season. Curran, a double Hoya and lifelong Jeopardy fan, qualified to appear on the game show after completing the show’s preliminary test. After a two-game winning streak, Curran lost by $11,399 despite correctly answering the final jeopardy question that asked about Jack Daniels, the largest employer in the dry county of Moore, Tennessee. 
Curran said it was sentimental to appear on a show he loved watching as a child. 
“I’ve been watching the show my whole life, just something that was always on growing up,” Curran told The Hoya. “My parents both love it, and my dad loved it. He died a few years ago. My mom still watches every single night.”
Curran said he prepared to compete on the show after practicing with an unusual tool — kids’ reference books.
“This was a tip my mom gave me,” Curran said. “So I went down to the Georgetown branch of the D.C. Public Library and got out a bunch of simple books either explicitly directed to kids or just simple, basic reference books.”
Beyond these books, Curran trained using online trivia games and board games.
Curran also said his experience as a journalism minor in college and his family’s history working in journalism — Curran’s father and grandfather were journalists, and Curran himself was a sports editor for The Hoya — helped him pick up some trivia.
“When you read a lot of journalism, especially if you practice it in any way, you get exposed to things that you wouldn’t necessarily be seeking out as part of your day to day,” Curran said.
Curran said the “Jeopardy!” staff provided support during production, makeup and wardrobe, and he felt even more prepared because he had created his own buzzer at home.
“I made a little fake one with one of those spring wood and plastic toilet paper holders,” Curran said. “So I was very prepared, I felt like, and the staff does a really good job of making everybody feel comfortable.”
Jacob Callahan (SFS ’26) said he enjoyed watching a Georgetown graduate compete on the show. 
“It was cool to see someone on the show who I have something in common with, even with it just being something small like having gone to the same school,” Callahan wrote to The Hoya. “He did really well and won two games in a row, which was pretty impressive.”
Curran said he was surprised by how much attention the press have given to his “Jeopardy!” appearance. 
“I’ve done TV appearances, like multiple local TV appearances,” Curran said. “I was shocked that it caught on as much because if you ever watched ‘Jeopardy!’ there’s somebody from the D.C. area on every other night.”
Curran said he attributes part of the attention to Christian Hunt, the creator of the Capital City Showcase. Hunt hosts Monday Night Trivia at Breadsoda, a Washington, D.C. bar Curran regularly attends.
Hunt said many people from the bar gathered to support Curran at energetic watch parties.  
“He’s been a regular at our trivia at Breadsoda for years, and it was so awesome to see everyone there rally around him,” Hunt wrote to The Hoya. “The watch parties were absolutely electric. I couldn’t be happier for Pat, because he’s not only a world-class trivia player, but a world-class human being as well.”
Curran said he would like to use the money he won to make a down payment on a house, purchase a gift for his mom and go on a trip with his wife.
Curran said the show is challenging but not impossible and that he encourages anyone with an interest in the show to apply. 
“I love to hammer home that anybody can take this test,” Curran said. “It’s free, it’s online. There’s zero barrier to entry. If you don’t have a computer, you can go to the library. D.C. public libraries are great. You can go to the library and take it there. You never know when you’re going to get the call.”

Thousands of flights were delayed or canceled Jan. 11 following technical difficulties at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), disrupting students’ return to campus. 
The FAA’s Notice to Air Missions system (NOTAM) experienced an outage for about three hours, which prevented flight takeoffs. The delays and cancellations, which were most severe in East Coast airports, coincided with Georgetown University’s first day of classes for the Spring 2023 semester, interrupting the travel of students and professors who were flying back to campus.
The NOTAM is an essential communication system that sends alerts to pilots regarding flight safety conditions. The FAA alerted the public of the outage at 6:30 a.m. via Twitter, requiring all national flights to be grounded.
All domestic departures were asked to delay takeoffs until 9 a.m., at which point NOTAM would be restored, according to a Jan. 11 tweet. 
“The FAA has ordered airlines to pause all domestic departures until 9 a.m. Eastern Time to allow the agency to validate the integrity of flight and safety information,” the tweet reads. 
By Wednesday evening, the administration ensured that there was no evidence of a cyberattack on the system. The FAA confirmed on Twitter that a damaged database file caused the outage.
By that point, however, there had been enough delays to push back more flight departures for the rest of Wednesday.
The Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA) canceled 49 flights (10%) and delayed 128 flights (28%) as of Wednesday at 11 a.m., according to Flight Aware. Dulles International Airport (IAD) had to cancel eight flights (2%) and delay 62 flights (17%). 
Paul Albergo (CAS ’82), an adjunct journalism lecturer at Georgetown, said he had multiple students in his class whose arrival to campus was delayed because of the FAA outages.
“My first class was scheduled on Wednesday, and some of my students were impacted by the meltdown,” Albergo wrote to The Hoya. “To help them, I opened up a Zoom link and allowed them to listen in on the class.”
Albergo said that during difficult situations like the FAA outage, the top priority for professors is clear communication from students. 
“Missing a single session, especially for something out of your control, is not likely to impact the whole semester,” Albergo wrote. “If you missed the first day of class, then talk to your instructor, find out what you missed and explain what happened. Make sure you stay on track, and if you find yourself falling behind, then ask for help.”
Albergo also said a course’s learning environment is determined by continued effort throughout the semester, not just the first day. 
“Showing up is more than just attending scheduled sessions. It involves doing the work. It involves engaging with your professor and your peers,” Albergo wrote. “Students succeed in a class when they invest in that class. Part of that investment involves showing up.”
Blanca Faine San Agapito (CAS ’25), an international student at Georgetown, was flying from Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat​ Airport to the Newark Liberty International Airport when the outages were reported.
“A family member sent me a copy of the news,” San Agapito wrote to The Hoya. “I wasn’t sure if we were going to be able to land, but quickly after they released that planes would be able to land. However, no planes would take off.”
Although none of San Agapito’s flights were canceled, she said the outages significantly disrupted her return to campus. 
“When I landed in Newark, my flight had been delayed 3 hours. Due to the large number of planes that had to take off, I was also delayed during taxi procedures for almost an hour,” wrote San Agapito. “I did not make it to Georgetown until 10 p.m. I was not able to attend my Wednesday classes. Nonetheless, the professors were very understanding of my situation.”
