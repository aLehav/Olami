A video appearing to show missing freelance journalist Austin Tice (SFS ’02, LAW ’13) alive and in the custody of masked gunmen has surfaced on YouTube, though experts have cast doubt on the video’s authenticity.
Tice had been reporting in Syria for several news outlets, including The Washington Post, when he disappeared in mid-August. Although Marcus Brauchli, executive editor of The Post, said that the paper was conducting an investigation into Tice’s whereabouts, there had been no news of his condition or location for seven weeks prior to the video’s release.
The 47-second video was uploaded to a newly created YouTube account on Sept. 26, but the footage itself is undated. The clip, entitled “Austin Tice still alive,” shows a long-haired man with a scruffy beard who resembles Tice being led into the desert blindfolded and accompanied by armed men. The masked men chant “Allahu al-Akbar” — Arabic for “God is great” — and the man resembling Ticerecites a phrase in broken Arabic. At the end of the video, the blindfolded man cries out, “Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus,” in English.

Tice’s parents released a statement confirming their belief that the man in the clip is their son.
“Knowing Austin is alive and well is comforting to our family,” the statement began. “Though it is difficult to see our eldest son in such a setting and situation as that depicted in the video, it is reassuring that he appears to be unharmed.”
Although the video indicates that Tice is alive and being held by Islamic extremists, experts have expressed skepticism about the legitimacy of the footage. Joseph Holliday, a senior research analyst at the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War who specializes in the study of the ongoing crisis in Syria, told The Washington Post that the video appears to have been staged.
“It’s like a caricature of a jihadi group,” he told The Post. “My gut instinct is that regime security guys dressed up like a bunch of wahoos and dragged him around and released the video to scare the [United States] and others about the danger of al-Qaeda extremists in Syria. It would fit their narrativeperfectly.”
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told The Post that she could not affirm the video’s validity, though she did say that the State Department believes Tice is in the custody of the Syrian government. Meanwhile, the Syrian government has denied any knowledge of Tice’swhereabouts.
The Syrian civil war is among the most violent of the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and presents a particular danger for members of the media. Twenty-one journalists have been killed in the country since November 2011, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

Georgetown University Medical Center researchers have identified a therapy for a rare type of lung tumor using a new cell technology that allows scientists to test different treatments on individual patients’ cell cultures stored in labs.
The finding, which was published in the Sept. 27 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, marks the first viable treatment for human papillomavirus-positive recurrent respiratory papillomatosisthat has spread to the lung.
According to the study’s official press release, RRP is the most commonly found tumor in the larynx and is passed from mother to child at birth through an HPV-infected birth canal. Under normal circumstances, tumors would be surgically removed to clear the airway, but this treatment is not always effective, and the disease can become fatal if it spreads to the lungs.
Researchers at GUMC established live cultures of a case patient’s tumor and normal cells utilizing a new cell technology, called conditional reprogramming, that uses the Rho kinase inhibitor and fibroblast feeder cells. They were then able to study and screen various procedures in the lab before administering the treatments to the patient.
According to Richard Schlegel, chair of the Department of Pathology at Georgetown’s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and senior investigator for the project, one of the drugs tested,vorinostat, was able to treat tumor cells without harming normal ones. After three months, the tumor cells treated with vorinostat shrank and no new tumors formed. The patient then took the drug for a year, during which time the tumors stabilized.
According to Schlegel, the ability to test out the drug on a sample cell using conditional reprogramming was critical to their research.
“Normal cells usually die in the lab after dividing only a few times, and many common cancers will not grow, unaltered, outside the body,” Schlegel said. “But now, from a small biopsy of someone, we can rapidly grow cells out of that biopsy and expand it within a week so that we can do … testing as well as look at different drugs that preferentially kill tumor cells rather than normal cells.”
Schlegel added that the personalization of cancer treatment is a significant outcome of the research findings.
“Because every tumor is unique, this advance could make it possible for an oncologist to find the right [therapy] that both kills a patient’s cancer and spares normal cells from the treatment’s toxic side effects,” Schlegel said. “We have shown for a specific lung tumor that our approach was successful in identifying an appropriate therapy for a single patient. We now need to do this for hundreds of other cancer patients who have different types of cancers.”
Despite the advances heralded in the study, the press release cautioned that the treatment must undergo much further scrutiny before it can become widespread.
“It could be years before validation studies [for this new technology] are completed and regulatory approval [is] received for its broader use,” it said.

According to the Department of Public Safety’s 2012 annual crime report, overall crime has dipped at Georgetown’s main campus but tripled at the Law Center campus in downtown D.C.
The report, which was released Saturday, highlights crime trends between Jan. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2011, at the two D.C. locations and three overseas campuses: the McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies in Alanya, Turkey, Villa Le Balze in Florence, Italy and the School of Foreign Service in Doha, Qatar. The annual crime report is published annually in accordance with the JeanneClery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, which mandates that all colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs make public information about crimes committed on their campuses.
According to the 2012 report, overall crime at the university’s main campus, which does not include theft or citations for possession of alcohol, drugs or weapons, has dropped by 16 percent between 2009 and 2011. In 2009, there were 54 reported crimes; that number fell to 51 in 2010 and then 43 in 2011.
In particular, instances of hate crime dropped dramatically between the 13 reported in 2009 and the two reported in 2011. However, burglary surged almost 30 percent between the 27 cases in 2009 and the 35 in 2011, peaking at 38 incidents in 2010.
Non-arrests for drugs, alcohol and possession of weapons, which are handled by the university’s Office of Student Conduct, peaked at 483 in 2010 before dropping over 32 percent to 365 in 2011. Alcohol violations composed the majority of these incidents in all three years. Meanwhile, cases in which students were arrested for drugs, alcohol and possession of weapons doubled from three to six incidents between 2010 and 2011; all incidents in both years were drug-related.
In addition, reported crimes spiked substantially at the Law Center, more than tripling between 2010, when there were three reported cases, and 2011, when there were 11.
Theft, which is not included in the overall crime statistic because reporting thefts is not mandated by the Clery Act, increased at both D.C. campuses in 2011, jumping from 170 to 219 cases on the main campus and from 17 to 22 incidents at the Law Center.
The report cites no crimes at the university’s McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies inAlanya, Turkey, at Villa Le Balze in Florence, Italy or at the Doha, Qatar, campus of the School of Foreign Service in any of the three years.

The seventh session of the GUSA senate, inaugurated Sunday afternoon, includes a record number of female members.
Nine female senators were elected, an increase from the five women who held seats last year.
“It’s an important change we’ve been fighting for,” said Sheila Walsh (COL ’14), Georgetown University Student Association senator for the townhouses district. The voter turnout rate also increased this year, with approximately 34 percent of the student body — 2,631 undergraduates — casting ballots, an overall increase from last year’s 25 percent rate.
Election Commissioner Ethan Chess (COL ’14) attributed part of the high turnout to the evidentiary standard referendum that was held concurrent with the senate election but commended the new senators for winning their seats in a record-setting year.
“[They] were elected [in] the most democratic and competitive senate session,” Chess said.
Overall, 66 students competed for 27 spots in the senate. Ten senators of the seventh session also held seats last year. Though some of the races were highly competitive — 18 freshmen vied for one of three positions to represent Darnall and Harbin Halls — four were uncontested.
Only one candidate ran for the two Henle Village spots, and a special election for the vacant position will be held in the future, according to GUSA Senate Transition Chair Nate Tisa (SFS ’14).
The GUSA senate redefined its districts last fall, creating three additional off-campus seats — increasing off-campus representation from two seats to five — and reducing the number of at-large seats from six to four.
The modification aimed to address the underrepresentation of off-campus students. In previous years, only three senators represented more than 500 off-campus students each, which is almost twice the number of constituents compared to the average on-campus representative.
However, the election results showed that the at-large race was more hotly contested than the off-campus race, with 2,028 votes cast in the at-large race and only 157 votes cast in the off-campus race.
Tisa explained that off-campus students were less aware of the deadlines for candidacy declaration. Only three candidates ran for five open spots in this race.
Tisa acknowledged this low turnout and emphasized that it is a challenge GUSA still needs to address.
“The proportion [of votes] makes sense. It’s just the challenge we have to deal with,” Tisa said. “How do we challenge these people and bring them in?”
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Sheila Walsh (COL ’14) represented the Copley District. She is actually is the senator for the townhouses. The corrected version was posted at 2:51 p.m. on Oct. 2.

As recently named interdisciplinary chair in science, physics professor Jeff Urbach said he hopes to build bridges between academic disciplines, scientific and beyond.
The honorary position recognizes interdisciplinary research and excellence in teaching and advising.
“Professor Urbach’s work is a wonderful example of interdisciplinary research that crosses the boundaries of physics and biology in particular,” said Allison Whitmer, senior associate dean for strategic planning and faculty development.
Urbach has worked in Georgetown’s physics department since 1996. He helped found the Program on Science in the Public Interest, which focuses on the intersection of science and society.
“I like the interdisciplinarity of it, the fact that in brings in a lot of different types of science,” Urbach said.
In addition, Urbach currently serves as director of the Institute for Soft Matter Synthesis and Metrology.
Chemistry professor Paul Roepe, who has collaborated with Urbach for several years studying malaria, lauded Urbach’s research skills.
“It can be a uniquely productive experience because his perspective is different than mine,” Roepe said. “It’s eye opening.”
Urbach said that the recent opening of Regents Hall has been especially exciting because the building is designed to facilitate student collaboration across scientific disciplines.
“A big part of the design was putting the disciplines in close proximity so we could interact more,” he said. “I think that’s going to be very important in the long run.”
Urbach added that the undergraduate research opportunities promoted by the new building will teach students skills they cannot learn in lecture alone.
“I want them to develop this independence and work out their own solutions to a problem,” he said.
Brian Rost (COL ’13), a teaching assistant for Urbach’s intermediate mechanics class, praised the energy Urbach puts into developing his students’ abilities.
“I worked for him all summer and am now doing my thesis this semester with him. He really knows his stuff and is … a great resource for me in my project,” he said.
Helen Decelles-Zwerneman (COL ’14) also conducted research with Urbach.
“Doing summer research with professor Urbach was one of the very best experiences I’ve had at Georgetown,” she said. “He was very eager to help me in the application process and clearly has an interest in seeing young scientists get the valuable research experience they need.”
Urbach said that his favorite part of working at the university is having the opportunity to interact with students.
“I really like the diversity of things we get to be involved in,” he said. “It’s a privilege to come to work every day and help students advance their knowledge and understanding.”

James Pettifer presented his new book on the Kosovo Liberation Army Monday.KAYLA NOGUCHI FOR THE HOYAOxford University professor James Pettifer spoke about his experience covering the Balkan War for The London Times during a lecture on his book “The Kosovo Liberation Army: Underground War to Balkan Insurgency, 1948-2001” Monday.
The event, titled “Book Talk: Kosovo — Towards Contemporary History,” was sponsored by the School of Foreign Service’s Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies.
In his speech, Pettifer discussed the challenging aspect of writing contemporary history.
“The issue of the KLA and its heritage is not going to go away … not because of what happened in 1999 but also because of what [has] happened since — or what hasn’t happened since.”
Pettifer explained that Kosovo lacks a strong enough standing military force to prevent crises, which contributed to the severity of the war in the late 1990s.
As a foreigner in the region, Pettifer said he had a unique perspective during the years of conflict.
“I remember being told by a [Serbian] hunting club in Kosovo, ‘We’re not hunting bear or fox anymore; we’re going to hunt Albanians now,’” Pettifer said.
While in Kosovo, Pettifer combined his academic interests with reporting.
“There is nothing wrong with bearing witness to historical events,” he said.
Students said the combination of Pettifer’s experience in Kosovo and his career as a contemporary historian made the lecture interesting.
“I’m doing a research project on youth initiatives in Kosovo, so for me it was really cool to talk about contemporary issues even though he is also historian,” Jaime Cordes, a graduate student in CERES, said.
According to Pettifer, the conflict in Kosovo is as relevant today as it was during the ’90s.
“I hope people will read the book … as living history because the issue is in the history,” he said. “I hope my book will help the understanding of [the issues], and I hope it won’t be put in a ghetto of obscure Balkan studies.”

For students who are unsatisfied with their final grades, Georgetown offers a more productive alternative to writing an angry post on RateMyProfessors.com.
The university’s grade appeal system allows students to dispute a questionable grade within 30 calendar days of the first semester after the grade was assigned.
To appeal a grade, a student must first reach out to his professor to check for miscalculations. If the issue is not resolved after this initial conversation, a student can make a formal appeal by sending a letter to the chair of the professor’s department explaining the discrepancy. If the department chair is unable to resolve the issue informally between the professor and the student, the chair, at the request of the student, can create an appeals committee of three faculty members who make a final decision.
“Normally, [the chair] appoints a committee of professors competent in the field who may have taught the same course [and] certainly know how to make an adjudication as to whether this was a fair grade,” Dean of the College Chester Gillis said.
The dean only becomes a part of the process if the department chair does not report the committee’s decision within 74 days after the start of the following semester.
Chair of the department of philosophy Wayne Davis said the committee step ensures the appeal process remains unbiased.
“When you have a committee, it is a group of faculty members that review the students’ work,” Davis said. “Committee review is a generally accepted way of resolving issues because they have general impartiality.”
But Michael Nemirovsky (COL ’15), who attempted to appeal a theology grade last year, said that the design of the appeals process makes it difficult for students to prove their case.
“Throughout the process I felt like I was being continuously discouraged,” he said. “It would most likely be impossible [to win the appeal] just because of the way the appeal process was structured.”
Although Gillis declined to comment on the number of grades that are appealed every year, he said that most grades ultimately remain unchanged.
“In the cases I had, they upheld the professor’s judgment every time,” he said.
According to Georgetown’s Undergraduate Bulletin for the 2012-2013 academic year, which addresses the grading policies for all undergraduate students regardless of the school, grading errors can serve as the basis for an appeal, but most claims focus on syllabus content.
“The [university] gives a fairly strict definition of the process for a grade appeal,” Steven Singer, chair of the biology department, said. “The grounds for an appeal [are] that the professor is not following the terms of the syllabus as opposed to the professor [marking] a question wrong that [the student] knows is right.”
Nancy Hinojos (SFS ’15), a student who is currently appealing a grade in the department of theology, based her appeal on a syllabus’ failure to describe the grading policy thoroughly.
“There was a lot of ambiguity in the syllabus in terms of how we were going to be graded,” Hinojos said. “It was very unclear as to how our grades would be distributed in terms of assignments, what we did in class, the weight, the type of distribution and the point system we were going to be graded on.”
Students who appeal grades must prove that a professor did not grade according to the syllabus, but this can be a difficult feat when a professor’s syllabus is sparse or unclear.
Nemirovsky had similar problems.
“The only basis you can appeal a grade on is when [you can say], ‘My teacher said I will be graded this way, and yet my grade was calculated a different way,’” Nemirovsky said. “[Those are] the only grounds you can appeal it on. If that’s not your problem, then you’re out of luck.”
According to Davis, the process is designed to compel students and professors to hash out their disagreements in person.
“It requires the student and faculty member to talk and get a resolution, which is good, since that interaction is really where the conflict should be resolved,” Davis said.
But Hinojos expressed frustration with the fact that formal appeals are emailed to department chairs, not presented in person.
“It’s so impersonal, and the whole discussion is really done virtually through the [appeal] letter,” Hinojos said. “I think it would be a lot more effective if all of us sat down and talked about it.”
Despite their criticisms, both Hinojos and Nemirovsky said they are glad the university offers the appeal process as an option.
“The process was very clearly sketched out,” Nemirovsky said. “There really are no surprises if you read the handbook and look at the process. It’s exactly what it says it’s going to be.”
Hinojos echoed Nemirovsky.
“I like how you get another shot for other people to look at it,” Hinojos said. “When you have more people thinking about it and looking at it with different perspectives, there’s a little more fairness.”

Although it only started as a simple assignment for a business class, Lance Strahl’s (MSB ’13) plan to raise money for injured servicemen and -women has escalated into a $10,000 fundraiser carnival.
Strahl’s fundraiser, which is set to be held on Copley Lawn on Nov. 17, will feature live bands, rides and opportunities to donate to Wounded Warrior Project, a nonprofit that provides resources and aid to injured servicemen and -women,
Plans for the fundraiser began as part of a project for “Leadership,” a class taught by professor Brooks Holtom. Though the guidelines for the assignment were basic — create an impactful project for a nonprofit — Strahl said his project took on a life of its own.
“My idea with this was to do the biggest thing possible,” he said. “The scale of the project got a little bit bigger than I thought it would.”
The event was also inspired by Strahl’s personal connections to the issue.
“Every generation of my family going back to the Civil War has fought for our country, and some of them have come back great, [but] others have had problems,” he said. “I thought the best thing to do would be to help soldiers who had given their all.”
Strahl is in the process of recruiting Hoyas for Veterans, Zeta Psi Fraternity, the Georgetown Lecture Fund and student performers from professor Joseph McCarthy’s “Guild of Bands” class to contribute to the event.
“Right now we’re giving them logistical and managing support,” Vice Chair of External Affairs for GULF Anika Patel (SFS ’13) said. “Co-sponsoring depends on what financial assistance we give. … It’s early for us to say what our involvement will be.”
Though still in its planning stages, Strahl said that the project is going well.
“I thought I’d find some small way to help Wounded Warrior, and over the last three weeks it’s evolved,” Strahl said. “I’ve been very blessed that so many people have a heart for this.”

Craig Cassey (COL ’15) spoke about town-gown cooperationMonday.EUGENE ANG FOR THE HOYAThe Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E introduced student commissioner hopeful Craig Cassey (COL ’15) at its monthly meeting Monday.
Cassey, who is running uncontested as a write-in candidate for single-member district 2E04 in the Nov. 6 election, addressed the importance of improving communication between students and neighbors and stressed the construction of the New South Student Center at Georgetown as a tool for improving the relationship between the university and surrounding community.
“There are issues that both the university and the community share, and there is no better time to address them than now,” he said.
Commissioner Tom Birch echoed the idea that Georgetown community members have the ability to work together and find common ground, citing the recent agreement on the 2010 Campus Plan as evidence of this potential for compromise.
“The community is often criticized for not being able to come together and agree on anything. I would like to say that our progress this year shows that we actually can,” Birch said.
Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14), who is running uncontested to represent SMD 2E08 in the same election, will attend the next meeting on Oct. 29 for a formal introduction.
Later at Monday’s meeting, Commissioners Ron Lewis and Jake Sticka (SFS ’13) commended the early completion of the rehabilitation of O and P Streets on Sept. 18, three months before the intended date in December. According to Lewis, neighborhood reviews have been positive thus far.
John Hedgecock, lieutenant for the Metropolitan Police Department’s police service area 206, which includes Georgetown, said that assault and property crimes have declined in the past year. Robbery and aggravated assaults dropped 37 percent, and incidents involving firearms declined by 40 percent. Traffic incidents remain the most common form of crime in the area.
Nonetheless, Hedgecock said that there is an increase in theft around the university and business districts, as pickpockets have begun to target restaurants, bars, hotels and public transportation.
“There is still a lot of suspicious activity in the District,” Hedgecock said.

Campus crime increased 57 percent between August and September this year, with theft, which more than doubled between the two months, accounting for over half the incidents.
Theft shot up from 14 cases in August of this year to 29 cases in September. The frequency of theft also increased 26 percent from September 2011, when 23 incidents were reported.
However, overall crime declined when compared with the same month last year — 44 total incidents were reported this September, compared with 47 incidents reported in September 2011.
According to Jay Gruber, the university’s chief of police and director of the Department of Public Safety, theft continues to be a pressing problem for the Georgetown community.
“This is an area [where] the Department of Public Safety needs that assistance [from] our … community,” he said. “Many … enjoy being in ‘The Georgetown Bubble’ but they fail to realize that this bubble exists in the middle of a major metropolitan area. Areas all around us experience crime and we here at Georgetown are not immune.”
Gruber urged students to take steps to prevent theft, including locking doors, not leaving personal property unattended and being aware of surroundings at all times.
After theft, the most commonly reported incidents were alcohol violations and assaults. Four cases of each type of incident were reported in September, while three assaults and no alcohol violations occurred in August.
Gruber also urged students to take precautions against assault and robbery when walking at night.
“Walking alone at night with earbuds in your ears is a recipe for being a victim of crime,” Gruber said.
The only crime rate that decreased last month was unlawful entry, of which five incidents occurred in August and one in September.
