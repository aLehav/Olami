President Joe Biden has nominated Georgetown University professor Alvaro Bedoya to be a Democratic commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 
Bedoya is a visiting professor at the Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) with expertise in data security and privacy law. He is also the founding director of the Center on Privacy and Technology, a think tank focused on privacy and surveillance law. The White House announced its plan to nominate Bedoya on Sept. 13. Once Bedoya is officially nominated, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation will schedule confirmation hearings and hold a vote to confirm him. 
Bedoya’s work has emphasized his deep belief that privacy is not a luxury, but a fundamental right, according to Georgetown Law Dean William Treanor. 
“We are extremely proud of the groundbreaking work Professor Bedoya has led as the founding director of our Center on Privacy and Technology,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will miss seeing him daily, but I know that in his new role, consumers across the country will benefit from his foresight, integrity and deep understanding of how the government can work to protect and serve the public interest.” 
Bedoya did not respond to a request for comment from The Hoya. 
The FTC is composed of five commissioners nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate; no more than three commissioners can be from the same political party. The commission enforces consumer protection laws and federal antitrust laws with the goal of advocating for consumers and encouraging competition. 
At the Center on Privacy and Technology, Bedoya’s work focused on the disparate effect of tracking software on marginalized groups and included an emphasis on civil rights in privacy questions, according to David Vladeck, the former director of the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection and a professor at the Law Center. 
“Along with civil rights coalitions, Professor Bedoya was able to persuade some of the major platforms to revise their rules on the advertising of payday loans, and other predatory lending practices,” Vladeck wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He will continue to work on these issues once he is confirmed as a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.”
Bedoya also previously served on the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law as chief counsel, which was led by former Senator Al Franken (D-MN). On the subcommittee, Bedoya oversaw work that dealt with mobile location privacy and helped draft parts of National Security Agency reform law. 
As chief counsel, Bedoya worked to safeguard consumer privacy and worked closely with commissioners of the FTC, according to Vladeck.
“Under Professor Bedoya’s leadership, the Subcommittee focused on geolocation technology and biometrics, and Professor Bedoya developed a reputation at the Commission for rigor, fairness, and candor,” Vladeck wrote.
Bedoya is one of many Georgetown faculty members to be put forward for positions in the Biden administration, including McCourt School of Public Policy professor Adriana Kugler, who was recently nominated as the U.S. executive director of the World Bank.
Bedoya graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College. He also holds a JD from Yale Law School, where he served on the Yale Law Journal. His article “Privacy as Civil Right” was recently added to the latest edition of privacy casebook “Information Privacy Law.” He has also authored works published in The New York Times and The Washington Post. 
Bedoya’s experience as a leading thinker at the intersection of technology and civil rights makes him extremely qualified for the position, according to Treanor. 
“I know he will do everything he can in his new capacity to make sure that everybody, regardless of their background, is afforded protections from increasing government and corporate surveillance,” Treanor wrote. “I have no doubt that in every area of work he touches at the FTC, he will be extremely mindful of the disparate impact policies can have on marginalized communities.”

CW: This article references violence in Afghanistan. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Georgetown University students launched community fundraisers to support activists in Afghanistan and Afghan refugees amid the Taliban takeover of the country.
Afghan activist and poet Zahra Wakilzada (SFS ’23) created a fundraising campaign to raise money for her own family members still in Afghanistan, many of whom are activists for women’s rights, so that they can evacuate the country (Full disclosure: Wakilzada formerly served as a member of The Hoya editorial board.) A group of organizations also formed a donation drive Sept. 3 to support local Afghan refugees, assisted by Georgetown’s chapter of No Lost Generation (NLG), an organization that fundraises and provides resources for refugees.
Tens of thousands of Afghans attempted to flee the country after Taliban forces took control of the government Aug. 15, following the withdrawal of U.S. troops. More than 20,000 Afghan refugees have arrived in the United States, with an estimated 2,500 refugees entering through Fort Lee in Virginia. 
Tara Nouri (SFS ’22), one of the Afghan American students that helped organize the drive alongside NLG, says she feels a personal responsibility to help those endangered by the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.
“For Afghan Americans, we are so invested because we, at one point in our lives, would like to return there one day,” Nouri said in an interview with The Hoya. “We don’t want to speak from a place of privilege and say, ‘I’m out of the country, I don’t have to live under the Taliban so I won’t think about it until I choose to go back.’ If you ever want to have a future in a country you have to stay actively invested in it.”
NLG board member Carrie McDonald (COL ’24) reported that, while donations were initially slow, the rate picked up throughout September; however, McDonald reported items had been stolen from one donation box (Full disclosure: McDonald is a Sports staff writer for The Hoya). 
“We had an instance where two blankets went missing, which is very concerning to me, but they were returned,” McDonald said in an interview with The Hoya. 
No Lost Generation is a part of a broader initiative by Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area (LSSNCA), a large refugee resettlement agency operating in Washington, D.C. NLG Georgetown plans to send all collected items to LSSNCA’s own donation drive, which is currently taking place.
Activists in Afghanistan are particularly vulnerable to violence amid the Taliban conflict; Wakilzada expressed concerns about her relatives’ safety in light of the crisis. 
Wakilzada aims to raise $15,000 to help her family navigate U.S. visa applications and lawyer fees; as of Sept. 22, the fundraiser has reached $3,151. Wakilzada hopes that the Georgetown community will support her and her family as they confront danger from the Taliban.
“I do not want to tell my children about how my loved ones were massacred by the Taliban & how I was not able to help,” Wakilzada wrote on her fundraising page. “I want the cycle to end with me. I’m burnout & so exhausted from knocking on every door & being turned away. So, I’m turning to you.⁣ As a first-generation low-income student, I cannot sponsor my family nor can I pay for their visas/app.” 
Wakilzada was herself a refugee to the United States as a teenager in 2015, and she said her experience as a refugee has given her a deep understanding of the situations of thousands of Afghans trying to flee the country.
“Seeing what’s happening in Afghanistan has personally impacted me, not only because I have family in Afghanistan but also because I see myself in every person in Afghanistan, and I can see how I could be one of those individuals if I didn’t become a refugee,” Wakilzada said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council, a nonpartisan partnership based out of Georgetown University, has partnered with several fundraisers for women and children in Afghanistan. Many Georgetown students also attended the March for Afghan Women on Aug. 29, a protest held by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security along with other advocacy groups, to demand the evacuation of vulnerable women in Afghanistan.
As media attention dies down, Georgetown cannot look away from the continuing needs of Afghans and Afghan refugees, according to Wakilzada.
“When it comes to activism and advocacy and creating safe spaces there will never be a point where we can say we have done enough and our work is done,” Wakilzada said.

Former Georgetown University tennis Head Coach Gordon Ernst agreed to plead guilty for his involvement in the national college admissions scandal Sept. 15.
Ernst, who served as a tennis coach at Georgetown from 2006 to 2017, faced charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, federal programs bribery, filing a false tax return and aiding and abetting money laundering. Ernst reportedly accepted over $3 million in bribes to falsely classify at least 12 students, including some who did not play tennis competitively or at all, as tennis recruits to the Georgetown team between 2012 and 2018.
As part of the plea deal, federal prosecutors will recommend Ernst be sentenced to at least one year and up to four years in prison and two years of supervised release, in addition to being required to forfeit over $3.4 million, which includes his home and other assets at a value that authorities say is equal to the sum acquired from his crimes.
Prosecutors initially charged Ernst in March 2019 after he reportedly received over $2.7 million in bribes through William Rick Singer, the ringleader of the national college admissions scandal. In September 2020, prosecutors handed Ernst additional charges for bribes that reportedly did not go through Singer.
Ernst initially pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and was set to stand trial with athletic coaches from other universities who received similar charges in November. A plea hearing has not been scheduled for Ernst after his agreement with prosecutors.
Ernst’s defense attorney, Tracy Miner, declined The Hoya’s request for comment. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts also declined The Hoya’s request for comment. 
Georgetown first became aware of Ernst’s actions in 2017 when the Office of Undergraduate Admissions noticed irregularities in the applications of two students who were being recruited to play tennis. Neither student was admitted, and Ernst was placed on leave while the university conducted an internal investigation, according to a university spokesperson.
In 2018, the university was made further aware of Ernst’s actions when the U.S. Attorney’s Office contacted university administrators disclosing the full slate of Ernst’s criminal activities and his acceptance of bribes, according to a university spokesperson.
Ernst left Georgetown in 2018 once the university’s initial investigation disclosed he had violated the school’s admissions policies, according to a university spokesperson.
“Georgetown immediately put former coach Gordon Ernst on leave, initiated an internal investigation, established a new policy concerning the recruitment of student athletes, implemented audits to check whether recruited student athletes are on team rosters, and asked Mr. Ernst to resign,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In response to the internal investigation, Georgetown implemented the Office of Admissions and Departments of Athletics Policy on Recruitment of Student-Athletes. Under the policy, both athletics and admissions must perform periodic audits to determine if any recruited student-athletes are no longer on the roster of the sport for which they were recruited. If a student is no longer on the roster, the head coach must provide a written explanation to both departments, according to the policy.
The university expressed gratitude for the work of the U.S. Attorney’s Office following the announcement of Ernst’s plea deal, according to a university spokesperson.
“We are aware that former Georgetown Tennis Coach Gordon Ernst has entered into a plea deal with the U.S. Attorney’s Office,” the university spokesperson wrote. “Georgetown University fully cooperated with the U.S. Attorney’s Office throughout its investigation and appreciates its work and dedication over the last two and a half years.”
Ernst’s guilty plea comes after Elizabeth Kimmel became the ninth former Georgetown parent to plead guilty in the scandal Aug. 16. Kimmel agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, having reportedly paid $275,000 to Ernst through Singer to get her daughter admitted to Georgetown as a false tennis recruit. In addition to Kimmel, nine other former Georgetown parents have been charged in the national college admissions scandal: Amin Khoury, Peter Dameris, Robert Repella, Manuel and Elizabeth Henriquez, Michelle Janavs, Douglas Hodge, Karen Littlefair and Stephen Semprevivo. Of the 10 parents, eight have been charged and sentenced. Repella is awaiting a sentencing hearing scheduled to take place Sept. 21, and Khoury is scheduled to stand trial in April 2022, according to the Department of Justice.

Georgetown University Law Center students who are parents and guardians of young children are calling on administrators to mandate virtual class attendance options to prevent spreading COVID-19 to their families. 
Many law students taking care of young children or immunocompromised family members have reported concerns about COVID-19 exposure because Georgetown Law does not require social distancing in J.D. classes, causing them to fear for their young, unvaccinated children. Students are calling on the Law Center to implement flexible policies, such as virtual options for classes, to support community health. 
Law students with young children or immunocompromised family members are primarily asking for a virtual or hybrid option for their classes, according to Benjamin Welna (LAW ’22), who has a 6-month-old son.
“It’s very hard to engage in class and be focused when I’m concerned about people potentially being sick,” Welna said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It’s a horrible prospect, really, coming home after a day of school and thinking I could be transmitting something to my son.” 
Children under 12 have not been approved to receive COVID-19 vaccines; while Pfizer recently announced it will seek authorization to vaccinate individuals ages 5 to 11, without the vaccine, young children are at a higher risk of severe infection than vaccinated adults. Further, the Food and Drug Administration is prioritizing clearance for children above 5; children 4 years old and younger are not currently being tested for the COVID-19 vaccine. 
According to Welna, the Law Center should mandate all professors to offer alternative class attendance until young children can be safely vaccinated. 
“My issue with sort of mandating that every single person returned to the classroom is that not all students at Georgetown are young, single and healthy,” Welna said. “The way that the schools will proceed, particularly with the in-person mandate, puts the risk on the most vulnerable. It puts the risk on our children and puts the risk on families who are living with illnesses.”
The Law Center has policies in place to protect against COVID-19 transmission in the classroom, including requiring that students wear masks indoors and fill out a COVID-19 daily check-in to obtain a green GOCard badge for entrance to campus buildings. 
While most students have been cooperative with university mask requirements, students expressed discomfort after an individual entered a Student Bar Association (SBA) meeting Sept. 15 without a mask and spoke out against mask mandates, according to tweets from Law Center students and SBA delegates.
Jade Baker (LAW ’22), president of the SBA, declined to comment on the incident when contacted by The Hoya. 
While administrators committed to enforcing COVID-19 masking and testing policies in an Aug. 30 email to Law Center students, Welna said officials have placed too heavy a burden on students and faculty to enforce rules themselves. 
“Unfortunately, what really happens in these situations is the onus it puts on students like myself, who are particularly vulnerable, to have to speak up and say something if we see students who are not wearing masks,” Welna said. 
According to Karl Hudspith (LAW ’23), who cares for a 21-month-old child, the university has not adequately enforced COVID-19 safety policies. 
“We’ve had three weeks of classes and I’ve had yet to show my green badge once, and I’ve entered all three of the law campus buildings multiple times,” Hudspith said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “So that is a 100% failure rate on that specific policy.”
The university has instructed faculty members to make course materials available to students who miss classes because of COVID-19 infection or exposure, but the Law Center has not mandated a virtual attendance option, according to William Treanor, dean of Georgetown Law.
“Faculty members are prepared to make course materials available to students missing classes due ot COVID-19 related isolation or quarantine, or other symptoms and illnesses, based upon course content and pedagogy,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Law Center has worked with public health experts to follow COVID-19 safety guidelines, such as changing the ventilation system, mandating masks and vaccines and implementing a system for testing, contact tracing and quarantine, according to Treanor. 
The most important priority for all law students who are parents is the health of their families, and that health should not be compromised for in-person learning, according to Hudspith.
“The real concern is not so much myself, it’s actually the unvaccinated kid I have and the university is not allowing that to be taken into consideration at all,” Hudspith said.

Fear mongering. Children are not at risk of covid. Vaccinated individuals are not at risk of covid. Stop being a busybody and trying to regulate lives. Live in reality.

An intruder followed students into New South in the early morning of Sept. 19, prompting a Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD) investigation and safety concerns among students.
At approximately 1 a.m. on Sept. 19, the perpetrator reportedly tailed behind students and gained entry into first-year dormitory New South. A New South resident assistant reported to GUPD that an unknown individual had entered the dormitory, according to a Sept. 20 email from Jay Gruber, GUPD chief and associate vice president of public safety, to New South residents obtained by The Hoya.
While GUPD searched the dormitory for the intruder, an unknown person pulled the fire alarm, prompting an evacuation by all residents. Officers located a suspect and confiscated a pocket knife from him; however, he fled before he could be apprehended, according to the Sept. 20 email.
The next day, GUPD officers detained the suspect and are now working with the Metropolitan Police Department, according to the Sept. 20 email.
According to a New South resident who wished to stay anonymous because of safety concerns, the perpetrator entered a women’s bathroom while she was using it. The intruder whispered to her, asking what her name was, and ignored her requests to leave the bathroom before following her back to her room. 
That same night, at approximately 3 a.m., residents of Copley Hall were evacuated from the building after the fire alarm went off. According to a university spokesperson, the incident was unrelated to the break-in at New South and was instead caused by a smoke detector going off. GUPD also stated that there is no evidence the New South intruder entered any other buildings on campus.
There is no ongoing safety threat to students, according to the Sept. 20 email. Additionally, in response to the events, GUPD has increased its presence in campus residence halls and urged students to take caution while entering and exiting dormitories to prevent tailgating, according to the same email.
Some students, however, have expressed frustration that neither GUPD nor university administration alerted students of the situation through an email or text message alert. GUPD first addressed the incident at 9 p.m. on Sept. 19 in an email to New South residents, nearly 20 hours after the incident took place.
After news of the break-in spread around campus and social media, Caleb Richmond (SFS ’25) began circulating an open letter demanding improved university communication during emergency situations. As of Sept. 22, 328 students have signed on to the petition.
When contacted for comment, a university spokesperson referred The Hoya to the two emails sent from Gruber to New South residents Sept. 19 and Sept. 20. Gruber did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Hoya.
The Georgetown University Student Association Senate also passed a resolution Sept. 19 calling on the university to provide more communication and security measures for students during emergency situations.
The university should have done more to alert students about the situation, according to the anonymous New South resident.
“I know that they sent an email to all New South residents, but I feel like they should have done that for the other residence halls and for every student on campus, because this was somewhat of a security threat, and all students should be aware to be vigilant and know that this happened on campus and that they should watch out.”
The lack of immediate communication from the university or GUPD worsened the situation for students, according to Richmond, who was visiting friends in New South when the fire alarm went off.
“While transparency is a more long-term goal, I wish the university had told us anything during the events last night (i.e. shelter in place or something of the sort) as opposed to letting confusion spread through their silence,” Richmond wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Student Aiden Gillies (SFS ’25), who said he interacted with the intruder in New South, felt differently. Gillies said that despite confusion among students over what was happening, GUPD was able to do its job effectively.
“All of the GUPD officers were very prompt with the information that they were given at the time,” Gillies said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “They were very good about interviewing myself and all of the others who were present during the situation, so I would say on that side they handled things very well, very professionally.”
Knowing the suspect was detained has been a relief, according to Gillies.
“I’m just glad that he’s been in custody now and that he was arrested — I’m just happy about that,” Gillies said.

Unfortunately, our world is full of such things as crime and insecurity, but it is so important to fight with it, trying to show people that they don’t need to always be in fear. I think that this story is the direct example of it because students were disappointed by the fact that neither GUPD nor university administration alerted them of the developed situation. I think that such organisations immediately have to report about such cases because it is a significant factor which shouldn’t be neglected and which should be taken as seriously as possible. But it is truly respectful that GUPD expanded its presence in campus dormitories because, to tell the truth, such situations can appear at any moment and no one is immune from this. Because of this fact it is so important to feel safe and be really cautious.

After 13 months of operations, the Georgetown University Mutual Aid Network has struggled to keep its request form available as campus opened fully for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Megan Huynh (NHS ’22) and Binqi Chen (NHS ’22) created the GU Mutual Aid Network in August 2020 to provide grassroots financial assistance for members of the Georgetown community amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Since its founding, the program has redistributed over $130,000 to community members. Yet as the organization fundraises for the first time in a fully in-person campus environment, its request form has closed repeatedly because of a lack of community donations.  
A decrease in donations is typical for the start of a new semester, according to Huynh. 
“As we’ve typically seen with the start of a new semester, this fall, we have seen increased demand for requests and have seen less and less donations from students, which has caused us to have to close our request form several times because we do not have enough funds to fulfill everyone’s needs,” Huynh wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Closing the form is concerning for the community’s well being, since GU Mutual Aid provides students with necessities, according to Huynh.
“Many students rely on Georgetown Mutual Aid’s funds to support their basic needs like groceries, textbook costs, and transportation. The longer the form stays closed, the more students do not have their needs met,” Huynh wrote.
During the pandemic, the presence of mutual aid networks has increased throughout the country. However, these grassroots newsworks have existed for centuries, originating from communities of color seeking to pool resources for community support. 
Huynh said the $130,000 milestone shows how community collaboration can help alleviate wealth inequality at Georgetown. 
“Being able to serve as a source of support for Georgetown students throughout these difficult times has been such an impactful experience, and reaching such a large amount raised has shown that community care can and does work as we continue practicing wealth and resource redistribution in a student body with so much wealth inequality,” Huynh wrote. 
In 2017, Georgetown ranked 12th out of 38 schools in a study detailing wealth inequality, with more students coming from the top 1% of the income scale than the bottom 60%. The median household income from Georgetown’s class of 2013 was $229,100, while the national median income for a household in 2013 was $51,939.
Students with the means to do so should donate to the fund, according to Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senator Brett Guessford (COL ’23), who organized a social media fundraiser for GU Mutual Aid in April. 
“I will continue to support Mutual Aid whenever I can, as I know that, despite my own hardships, I am in a better position than some of my peers, but I would still like to see more participation in Mutual Aid among the more elite sections of the Georgetown community,” Guessford wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There is a lot of untapped potential and good work that could be done if (even marginally) more wealth from upper class students were shared in solidarity with their less fortunate peers.”
Last spring, GU Mutual Aid collaborated with The Corp to help provide students with greater food options on campus by reallocating student Flex dollars, which can be used at many Georgetown dining services, to students in need. 
While The Corp is not currently accepting Flex dollar donations, it periodically opens the donation form when Mutual Aid funds dip below $1,000 and during the final week of the semester before Flex dollars expire, according to Rose Dallimore (SFS ’22), community engagement chair and board member at The Corp. Dallimore said that as of Sept. 20, The Corp had redistributed $2,362.99 Flex dollars and had $4,160.34 left to redistribute.
The Corp supports GU Mutual Aid’s commitment to the Georgetown community and values the opportunity to help the organization achieve its goals, according to Dallimore. 
“We love GU Mutual Aid’s infrastructure and the support they provide to the community, and this was a way for us to use our services and flex collection abilities to help students support each-other,” Dallimore wrote.
Huynh said she is grateful for the support of students over the last year. 
“We could not exist without the support of the student body, so we are so grateful to everyone who has ever donated or shared our posts in helping us raise $130,000 in a little over a year,” Huynh wrote.

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate unanimously passed a resolution Sept. 19 demanding more information from the university about a break-in early Sunday morning in the New South dormitory.
The resolution alleges the university did not provide enough communication to students when an unknown individual entered New South, armed with a knife and following students, around 1 a.m. Sept. 19. An unknown person pulled a fire alarm, prompting students to evacuate the building. Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD) searched the crowd and eventually found the perpetrator; the suspect fled the area, however, before GUPD could detain the perpetrator.
GUPD Chief and Associate Vice President of Public Safety Jay Gruber announced Sept. 20 that GUPD officers had detained the suspected intruder, according to a Sept. 20 email to New South residents obtained by The Hoya.
GUPD first contacted New South residents about the break-in at 9 p.m. Sept. 19, around 20 hours after the incident was first reported. The lack of immediate communication from GUPD or the university left students in the dark about the situation, according to the resolution.
“Little information about the incident is publicly known beyond rumors,” the resolution reads. “The University has not sufficiently communicated with students, both those living in New South and not, about the incident.”
The break-in should have warranted a HOYAlert, a message sent to all Georgetown students and faculty during emergency situations, to provide immediate information and instruction to Georgetown students, according to GUSA Senator Zev Burton (COL ’22), who introduced the legislation.
“For the amount of HOYAlerts that we get, I feel like an intruder into a dorm would be at the top of the list,” Burton said during the GUSA meeting. “I’ve been at Georgetown for three years now, and I’ve never heard of an intruder entering into a dorm before. That is more of a reason to get a HOYAlert, not less.”
In addition to better communication, the university needs to provide more robust safety measures for students going forward, according to GUSA Senator Sam Li (SFS ’24).
“I believe that the university definitely has work to do in terms of keeping students safe,” Li wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While I am not sure additional security measures uniformly applied across campus is the best idea, I do believe heightened security in targeted areas/potential security training sessions for students could be helpful.”
When contacted for comment, a university spokesperson referred The Hoya to the two emails sent from Gruber to New South residents Sept. 19 and Sept. 20. GUPD Chief Gruber did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Hoya.
As part of the resolution, the GUSA Senate signed on to an open letter urging the university to improve communication with students during emergency situations. As of Sept. 21, 325 students have signed on to the letter.
During the Sept. 22 Student Safety Advisory Board meeting, a biweekly forum between GUPD officials and student leaders to provide feedback on GUPD policies and practices, members of GUSA joined other attendees and Gruber to discuss strengthening university safety protocols in light of the New South incident.
The university aims to create quicker and more frequent communication from GUPD to students during emergency situations, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Leo Rassieur (COL ’22). 
“From meeting with GUPD Chief Gruber, we know that the University is working to improve their threat response system by putting out communication faster moving forward,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya. “My hope is that the University focuses on improving GUPD’s procedures.”
Above all, students should be informed of campus security issues in a timely and direct fashion, according to Burton.
“All we need is recognition and the assurance from the university that a freshman dorm will not be broken into,” Burton said.

Before he arrived in Georgetown last weekend for his Sept. 18 wedding in Dahlgren Chapel, Tim Huether (COL ’10, LAW ’17) already knew about the eggings that had been taking place in the neighborhood.
So when Huether, two of his groomsmen and his sister, were egged repeatedly on the eve of his wedding while they were having a drink outside Martin’s Tavern on Wisconsin Avenue, he was shocked it happened to him. 
Huether said that around 10:15 p.m. that night, someone in a black car threw an egg at the group, the shell landing in between his feet. 
“A little piece of eggshell ended up on my lap,” Huether said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
The same car returned about 15 minutes later, throwing another egg at the group. By the time the car returned for a third time, Huether had left, but his friends told him the perpetrator again threw an egg at them. In one of those incidents, an egg splattered all over one of his groomsmen’s jackets, Huether said.
Martin’s Tavern was unable to provide The Hoya with security footage by the time of publication.
This incident is not the only one that has occurred since The Hoya last reported on six separate eggings in the neighborhood. Since Sept. 10, The Hoya has confirmed at least nine more egging incidents in and around the Georgetown neighborhood, including one that took place before Sept. 10. Georgetown University students and other community members have been the targets of these attacks. 
At around 9:15 p.m. on Sept. 13, Galen Vandergriff and his wife, residents of the nearby McLean Gardens neighborhood, were walking on Reno Road when someone in a black car threw an egg at them. The egger missed, according to Vandergriff.
“It’s a little upsetting. You’re just out for an evening stroll, and somebody is trying to ruin your evening,” Vandergriff said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It’s cowardly.”
About 45 minutes later, someone threw an egg at Ravi Mistry (MBA ’23), narrowly missing his face. Mistry was walking by the Russian Embassy on Wisconsin Avenue. The perpetrator threw the egg from a black car, Mistry told The Hoya in a phone interview.
Mistry called the nonemergency police line to notify authorities of what happened.
On Sept. 14, Julie Chung, a first-year law student at American University, was walking with her boyfriend Katin Perez (GRD ’23) across Key Bridge at around 10 p.m. when she said she was egged by someone in a red car.
“I was very confused,” Chung said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I was like, ‘What? What’s happening? What did I just get hit with?’ And I was looking at it, and I could see the egg shell on the floor. I was like, ‘Oh my god. I got hit by an egg.’” 
The egg hit Chung’s arm with enough force that, when it cracked on her, the shell drew blood, she said. 
A moment later, the unidentified perpetrator threw an egg at another couple on the bridge, according to Chung, who then decided to call the nonemergency police line to notify authorities of what happened.
Later that night, a group of Georgetown undergraduates were egged outside the CVS on Wisconsin Avenue, according to Alexander Gough (COL ’23), who got hit in the chest with a raw egg. 
Gough also reported seeing a red car. This matches the vehicle description provided by the egging victims of early September.
Anyone who is a victim of an egging should report the incident to the Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD) or the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), according to a university spokesperson, who added that GUPD is not actively investigating the eggings. 
“The university constantly monitors the safety of its campuses and surrounding neighborhoods,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We do take these reports very seriously.”
MPD is not currently investigating any eggings as no victims have filed reports, according to Sean Hickman, MPD officer.
“There have been no reports located in reference to egging offenses,” Hickman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Unfortunately, if there has not been a report filed then there is no victim or offense to investigate.” 
Going up and down the same street is an intentionally brazen choice, according to Huether.
“It’s the Joker mindset of just sowing chaos,” Huether said.

 Washington, D.C. officials are shutting down three encampments across the District, forcing over 100 people experiencing homelessness to evacuate.
Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) launched the encampment pilot program in August to permanently close encampments in Ward 2 and Ward 6 by the end of September. The proposal aims to permanently close encampments at the M and L Street underpasses, New Jersey Avenue and O Street NW, and E and 20th and 21st Streets NW. Displaced residents will have the opportunity to register for a housing assistance program.
According to Yannik Omictin, advisory neighborhood commissioner for 2A01, the details of the encampment pilot program are unclear, leaving questions about the temporary housing in which the District plans to place residents who enroll in housing assistance. 
“It is certainly a good thing that the city appears to have ready-to-move-in units that encampment residents can move into while they wait for permanent housing,” Omictin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Questions still remain about where those units are, what restrictions might be placed on residents in those units, what condition they are in, what services will be provided in conjunction with this housing, and more.” 
Officials plan to clean the encampment sites after all the residents vacate the properties, after which the District will provide rehousing assistance, according to the encampment pilot press statement. 
“Residents who agree to participate will be engaged in intensive case management services which will help them obtain vital documents, complete housing voucher applications, provide housing navigation, and connect them to other vital services,” the statement reads. 
Neither the Executive Office of the Mayor nor the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services responded to request for comment from The Hoya. 
This program is part of a wider range of efforts to permanently close encampments for people experiencing homelessness throughout the District. In January 2020, the District permanently removed people living in an encampment under the K Street overpass. However, the District did not offer a housing assistance program for displaced residents and instead directed them to shelters throughout the area, according to DCist.
Many unhoused people have expressed distrust in government initiatives or officials, according to Omictin, and are wary participation in the program may put them in a worse position than before they were evicted from their encampments.
“The more important question for me is whether the residents trust this initiative — this remains to be seen,” Omictin wrote. “As of Friday, many had not heard about the program’s housing component, and are naturally wary of new government programs given how often they have been slighted by them in the past.”
In 2021, officials recorded 5,111 unhoused individuals and 405 unhoused families living in the District, most of whom are not eligible for the housing opportunities included in the encampment pilot program because they do not reside in one of the three targeted sites. Of the unhoused population in the District, 47% experienced homelessness that lasted for more than one year, and the number of unhoused adults with mental health conditions rose by 17% between 2020 and 2021.
According to Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto (LAW ’17), the encampment pilot program is positively contributing to rehousing efforts in Ward 2.
“I am enthusiastic that the launch of this program will include sites in Ward 2. The focus of the pilot is working to achieve the goal we have shared all along: housing,” Pinto wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
If the District can assist some unhoused people, they should expand the program to everyone, according to Omictin.“If the city truly can buy out leases, place people in temporary housing throughout the city, keep up their access to city services, and shepherd them through the permanent process, as it appears they are proposing to do with this pilot program, then they should be able to do it for every single unhoused person in DC,” Omictin wrote.

Julianne Bruggemann (NHS ’23) was eating at the Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall when she got an email about a cluster of COVID-19 cases in Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Hall, where she lives. The statement said she needed to get tested within two days. 
The Sept. 15 email from Dr. Ranit Mishori (MED ’02), Georgetown University’s chief public health officer, notified residents that three students who live together in Arrupe tested positive for COVID-19 within 36 hours. In an abundance of caution, Mishori informed residents they must get tested by Sept. 17; however, students were not required to quarantine unless they received an additional notice from the COVID-19 Care Navigation Team, according to a copy of the email obtained by The Hoya.
Bruggemann said that although the email was alarming, she was not overly concerned about it. 
“I don’t really go into the Arrupe common spaces with people other than my roommates so I figured it was unlikely that I came into contact with positive cases,” Bruggemann wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
Hunter Mellon (COL ’23) was one of the students who tested positive for COVID-19. Mellon tested positive Sept. 15 and officials relocated him to the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center that same evening, around the same time Mishori’s email was sent to Arrupe Hall residents. 
While it was safer to test everyone in the residence hall, Mellon said it may not have been completely necessary given that not everyone in the building had a high exposure to the virus. 
“I think it’s a bunch of people who are very well intentioned probably who are trying to do the right thing, and who probably are doing the right thing, but it probably is a little bit of overkill because clearly not everybody in the building had had a high exposure risk,” Mellon said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
Mellon himself had not been in contact with anyone in Arrupe Hall after testing positive, he said. 
The university tested residents of Arrupe to ensure their safety, according to a university spokesperson.
“Out of an abundance of caution and pursuant to CDC guidelines, we asked all residents to get tested for COVID-19 starting the next day, and expedited their results,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
According to Kenneth Boggess (SFS ’24), an Arrupe resident, some residents have shown a disregard for public health safety measures. 
“I don’t blame the people who tested positive, but there are a lot of people in Arrupe who really don’t wear masks in a lot of common spaces, in the halls. And of course, it’s not just COVID, also the flu,” Boggess said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “There’s a very pervasive sense of almost entitlement, I’d say — of people saying that I don’t really care about public health, in the sense that I’m young, I’m fine.”
Bruggemann, however, appreciated the university’s proactive approach to the situation.
“Testing is an important part of ‘catching’ cases and while it is unlikely that everyone in the building interacted with these positive cases, I don’t think there was any harm in making everyone in the building test,” Bruggemann wrote.
The university has not recorded similar outbreaks in on-campus residence halls since the three Arrupe residents, according to a university spokesperson. 
“We have not observed any further positive test results from Arrupe Hall residents, nor have we seen similar scenarios in other residence halls during this academic year,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The week of Sept. 12, the university reported 34 positive COVID-19 tests on the main and Georgetown University Medical Center campuses, with a .52% positivity rate. These numbers reflect a .19% decrease from the previous week. 
Boggess, who has previously lived with both immunocompromised and elderly family members, expressed overall frustration with the outbreak. 
“Coming as someone who has an immunocompromised mother, lives with multiple elderly family members, we’ve always been careful about health. Because you know, the flu puts my mother in the hospital, the common cold puts my mother in the hospital,” Boggess said. “To come here and to be met with this kind of indifference from other people is really just frustrating.”
According to Bruggemann, the university took appropriate action to address the outbreak.
“The university has no way of knowing how we interact with one another, so they are trying to do what makes the most sense,” Bruggemann said.

Georgetown University hired its first vice president of sustainability in August, furthering the university’s efforts to promote environmental initiatives on campus.
In her new role, Meghan Chapple, former sustainability director and senior adviser on sustainability at The George Washington University, will oversee the Office of Sustainability and lead initiatives focusing on the intersection of sustainability and social justice, according to a Sept. 15 university announcement. 
One of the priorities of the Office of Sustainability will be to approach environmental issues on Georgetown’s campus from diverse perspectives, according to Chapple.
“I am personally committed to applying a lens of justice and equity, and will strive to include a diversity of voices in the conversation and the implementation of sustainability at Georgetown,” Chapple wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In order for Georgetown to be effective, our sustainability vision and strategy going forward will be inclusive of a diversity of voices on campus and from the communities that the university impacts.”
The new position demonstrates Georgetown’s continued commitment to environmentalism and sustainability, according to Peter Marra, director of the Georgetown Environment Initiative (GEI).
“We knew that we needed to move the sustainability piece into a piece that was not just on the operation side, but also on the academic side, because students are so engaged and so excited, and so motivated by aspects of sustainability,” Marra said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “They want to be part of an institution that really prioritizes these things.”
Established in 2013, the Office of Sustainability oversees university environmental efforts, including initiatives focused on renewable energy, recycling, sustainable transportation and water conservation.
Chapple’s appointment will help the university double down on its commitment to sustainability, according to Marra.
“I think that it was clear that the office needed to be elevated, because we needed much more rigorous and dedicated approaches to thinking about what we were doing on our land here,” Marra said. “That might mean making sure we’re just communicating with students that if you need a pen, you don’t order it from Amazon — you go to the bookstore; you figure out some other way to be more efficient.” 
In response to news of Chapple’s hiring, some students like Victoria Boatwright (COL ’22), former president of the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN), have expressed hope that Chapple will improve transparency and work with student organizations like GREEN.
“I am really hopeful that she will help on student involvement fronts and make the university more transparent on environmental initiatives,” Boatwright said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Because that is one thing that throughout my career I’ve been frustrated with: Georgetown’s lack of transparency.”
Chapple’s hiring follows other university steps to improve sustainability. Georgetown’s board of directors approved a policy to divest from fossil fuel investments in February 2020 following advocacy from student organizations. In November 2020, the university announced it would source two-thirds of its energy needs through off-site solar panels.
Chapple’s experience in writing environmental policy will allow her to continue to advance small- and large-scale projects at Georgetown, according to Boatwright. 
“I guess the main three areas I’m hoping to see her apply her skills are negotiations for overall campus sustainability, involvement with students and finally on accountability for divestment and other at-large Georgetown university administration-driven initiatives,” Boatwright said. 
To reach its sustainability goals, the university must be as open as possible, according to Chapple. 
“Transparency on our progress to meet our sustainability commitments is critical,” Chapple wrote. “We will work across the university to collect baseline data on our sustainability impact, to set goals and targets to meet our commitments, and then publicly report on our progress regularly.”
Chapple’s goals for the Office of Sustainability will ensure as many students as possible get involved with sustainability at Georgetown, according to Boatwright.
“Central to her image of sustainability would be to make sure everybody at the university is included and everybody is a stakeholder.”

Georgetown University’s School of Nursing & Health Studies (NHS) will have a new interim dean by the end of the month.
John Monahan (CAS ’83, LAW ’87), who currently serves as a Georgetown University School of Medicine professor, Georgetown University Law Center senior lecturer, McCourt School of Public Policy senior fellow and the global health senior adviser to the university president, will begin his role as the NHS’ interim dean Sept. 26, according to a Sept. 21 university wide email from the Office of the President.
Since 2007, Monahan has taught courses at the NHS, the School of Foreign Service and the Law Center. He also served as the founding director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, a research institute for health policy analysis housed within the Law Center.
Monahan is confident his experience in government, philanthropy and academia has prepared him to guide the NHS to success this year as it begins the process of transitioning to two stand-alone schools, he wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“I will be focused on partnering with faculty, staff, and students to continue the great work at NHS during this academic year,” Monahan wrote. “As an alumnus, I want to pay special attention to the experience for all our students.”
In December 2020, the university announced the NHS will split into two separate schools, the Georgetown School of Nursing (GSN) and the Georgetown School of Health (GSH), by July 2022. Monahan will serve as dean until the two schools are established.
Selecting Monahan as interim dean reflects the university’s commitment to an efficient transition to the two new schools, according to Edward Healton, Georgetown School of Medicine’s dean.
“He embodies the ideals and qualities that NHS faculty and staff shared with me, through meetings and messages, that they felt would be helpful in an interim dean, and I am grateful for their important input,” Healton wrote in an email to the Georgetown University Medical Center community.
Carole Roan Gresenz, a professor in the NHS’ department of health systems administration, has served as the NHS’ interim dean since September 2019 and originally planned to serve as dean for only one year. Gresenz will step down from her role as dean Sept. 26 and return to her work as a professor, focusing on mentoring and health economics research, as well as serving as a special adviser for Georgetown’s health and health strategies work.
“I stayed on and served an additional year because of all the disruption that COVID caused,” Gresenz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to lead the school during this unusual and challenging time and I am thankful for the grace and resiliency exhibited in our NHS community.”
Gresenz’s strong sense of determination and service to the NHS was necessary to overcome the past year’s challenges, according to Healton.
“When she agreed to pause her research to lead NHS, none of us had any idea how remarkably challenging higher education — or life — would become,” Healton wrote. “Throughout the pandemic, Carole led NHS with clarity and confidence when the unknowns often felt so overwhelming. Simply put, she is one of the most impressive leaders I’ve worked with.”
The university is currently in the process of searching for a new dean for the GSN and will begin the search for a new dean for the GSH in the near future, according to Gresenz.
“Planning for both schools is now well underway and the new interim dean, John Monahan, has been deeply engaged in planning since January of this year,” Gresenz wrote. “John brings not only a deep familiarity with NHS, but also decades of experience in public service, and tremendous skill in managing and navigating complex organizations.”

A new Planned Parenthood initative will allow residents of Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia to access abortion medication and services without leaving their homes.
The plan, announced by Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C. (PPMW) on Sept. 10, allows patients to receive abortion medication through the mail. PPMW is the second Planned Parenthood branch in the country to provide patients with entirely at-home care and services. The Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts was the first affiliate to join the nationwide TelAbortion study, which provides patients with access to telehealth appointments to receive abortion medication within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.
The initiative prioritizes safety and accessibility to expand abortion services for all patients, according to Dr. Serina Floyd, medical director of PPMW. 
“PPMW is committed to providing safe, accessible, and culturally sensitive care to all of our patients,” Floyd said in the press release. “With this expansion in medication abortion services, patients are able to connect with a provider in ways that are comfortable and convenient. Medication abortion at home provides the same excellent level of care that Planned Parenthood is known for.”
According to Chloe Kekedjian (COL ’22), president of H*yas For Choice, a pro-abortion rights student group, this new method will improve access to abortions for Georgetown University community members. 
“Planned Parenthood’s program to offer at-home abortion medication will make accessing abortion much easier for residents of DC, including Georgetown students,” Kekedjian wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Patients will begin the process by participating in a phone screening and an online meeting with a PPMW patient care provider before either picking up the medication in person or receiving the medication via mail in a discreet package. Afterward, patients must attend another virtual appointment the following week after they have taken the medication. The procedure, meant for early-term abortions, must be completed within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. Four weeks after the procedure, patients must take an at-home pregnancy test or receive an ultrasound with a blood test to ensure the procedure was successful. 
According to Betsy Harned, the vice president of public affairs for PPMW, an at-home abortion option increases access to reproductive healthcare for all individuals. 
“COVID has made accessing healthcare, including abortion, more urgent and our providers are primed to deliver this service,” Harned wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The flexibility of at-home abortion is particularly helpful to those who might encounter difficulty coming in-person to an appointment at one of our health centers due to obstacles such as difficulties getting time off of work, child care, or reliable transportation.” 
Low-income individuals, young people and marginalized communities face significantly larger barriers to accessing abortion services because of cost, inability to travel and COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, especially in regions where states are limiting abortion rights. Currently, individuals on D.C. Medicaid cannot use their insurance to cover abortions because of congressional legislation that prevents the District from using local funds to pay for abortion services. According to Harned, this Medicaid ban further contributes to unequal access to abortion services among low-income communities. 
At-home abortion options are also beneficial to increasing access for the Georgetown community, according to Kekedjian. 
“College students are a demographic that may have difficulty accessing abortion due to busy schedules or lack of knowledge,” Kekedjian wrote. 
Abortion access has made national headlines in the last month. On Sept. 1, the state of Texas banned abortions past six weeks of pregnancy, sparking backlash across the country. The law also allows citizens to sue abortion providers or any individual who assists with providing an abortion. If not overturned by the Supreme Court, this law could potentially threaten the precedent for legal access to abortion set by Roe v. Wade.
According to Harned, at-home abortions will allow people to continue to access reproductive healthcare amid legal battles regarding abortion. 
“Now more than ever before, access to critical, time-sensitive care like abortion depends on where you live. So while abortion is currently more protected in the DMV than in other areas of the country, there is still more work needed to protect and maintain care in our region for all,” Harned wrote.

CW: This article discusses human trafficking. Please refer to the end of the article for on and off-campus resources.
Human trafficking is fundamentally modern slavery and deserves greater public awareness, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates the crisis, panelists said at a Sept. 20 virtual event. 
At the event, titled “Human Trafficking: The Deafening Silence over Modern Slavery,” human trafficking experts and activists shed light on the current state of human trafficking worldwide. The event was co-hosted by the Free Speech Project, a Georgetown University research initiative that documents threats to free speech, and the Future of the Humanities Project at Georgetown, which gathers scholars to discuss current interdisciplinary issues.
The United Nations defines human trafficking as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of people through force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them for profit. In public discourse, human trafficking is widely referred to as “modern slavery.” 
While some may disagree with this nomenclature, the title of modern slavery is fitting for human trafficking because of the common principle of forced labor, according to panelist EleSondra DeRomano. DeRomano is a sex trafficking survivor and the founder of Standing Together Against Real Slavery (STARS), an organization dedicated to supporting young women who have experienced or are at high risk for sex trafficking. 
“To me, it is slavery,” DeRomano said at the event. “It’s slavery. And slavery is supposed to be abolished.”
As another parallel, human trafficking patterns are reminiscent of historic slave trade routes, according to panelist Lisa Hsin, an Oxford University researcher.
“There’s certainly trade routes for trafficking victims,” Hsin said at the event. “I would say southeast Asia to places like the more affluent Taiwan or China. You can locate how they’re trafficked over there, and you can essentially follow the footsteps of trafficking victims.”
In 2020, nearly 25 million people worldwide were estimated to be the victims of human trafficking, according to the U.S. Department of State. However, human trafficking is vastly underreported, and the majority of cases go undetected, according to the National Institute of Justice.
Human trafficking is onerous to prosecute because of its international network and underground nature, according to Pippa Hockton, founder of Street Talk, an organization that provides counseling to female victims of human trafficking.
“It’s organized crime. It’s all very international. It’s highly organized. It’s very, very difficult to catch,” Hockton said at the event. “They are very well-informed and know the loopholes in the law.”
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number of individuals at risk for human trafficking, according to Christina Bain, the former director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Program on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery.
“And especially now with the pandemic,” Bain said at the event. “I think there is the fear that this crime has also been exacerbated by certain circumstances around the pandemic including economic vulnerabilities. So, I think we still have a long road ahead.”
Reduced wages and job loss during the pandemic have made people more vulnerable to exploitation by human traffickers, according to a 2021 report by the U.S. Department of State. Additionally, COVID-19 stay-at-home orders increased rates of gender-based violence, substance abuse, and mental health issues, all of which put people at greater risk of exploitation, according to the report. 
Current anti-trafficking programs fall short in ensuring long-term wellbeing for survivors, according to Hockton.
“I feel as though there’s a willful neglect on the part of services,” Hockton said. “These people don’t have services. They don’t matter. And services are not for the purpose of looking after these people from childhood on up.”
Despite mounting challenges, increased awareness around the issue of human trafficking can help prevent more people from falling victim to human traffickers, according to DeRomano.
“I believe that there are changes being made, and I’m very optimistic and happy about that,” DeRomano said. “Even if it’s two lives we save, that’s two lives that we’ve saved.”

Nine animals at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo have tested positive for COVID-19 after displaying symptoms of the virus. 
Doctors conducted COVID-19 tests on the animals after National Zoo staff members noticed that six African lions, two Amur tigers and a Sumatran tiger were displaying decreased appetites, coughing and lethargy. All nine tests came back positive.
While a second test is necessary to confirm that the initial results were not false positives, the animals are still being cared for and treated for COVID-19 symptoms, according to a Sept. 17 press statement from the National Zoo.
“Final results are expected in the next few days,” the statement reads. “All lions and tigers are being treated with anti-inflammatories and anti-nausea medication to address discomfort and decreased appetite.”
While uncommon, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that animals can get COVID-19 if they come in close contact with a human who has the virus. There is no evidence, however, that animals play a significant role in the spread of COVID-19 to humans, according to the CDC.
While the National Zoo has not identified the staff member who transmitted the virus to the animals, the carrier was likely asymptomatic, as National Zoo staff members are required to take COVID-19 safety precautions while around guests and animals, according to Annalisa Meyer, deputy director of communications at the National Zoo.
“Our team has conducted a thorough investigation of all the staff that were in close proximity with the lions and the tigers, and at the moment there is no evidence to pinpoint the exact source,” Meyer said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “So it’s possible that it got transmitted by an asymptomatic carrier, and it’s been standard practice for all of our animal care staff and all of our essential staff to mask indoors and in public and nonpublic areas.”
The nine animals were the first to test positive for COVID-19 at the National Zoo. No other animals have displayed symptoms for the virus, and the outbreak is contained to the Great Cats Exhibit, which includes the lions and tigers, according to Meyer.
“Our vets and our keeper staff have been watching and looking for symptoms, but no other animals at the zoo have had any signs of infection,” Meyer said. “I’m not aware of any other tests that have happened, but these are the first positive tests, so I would say that you can safely say no other animals at the zoo have shown any signs of infection.” 
Since COVID-19 first began spreading in the United States in 2020, several zoos have reported outbreaks of the virus among animals. In January, the San Diego Zoo reported eight gorillas had tested positive for the virus. Eighteen gorillas from Zoo Atlanta separately tested positive for the virus Sept. 14.
Veterinarians in both outbreaks were able to treat some of the infected gorillas with an experimental COVID-19 vaccine for animals developed by Zoetis, an animal health company. The vaccine has only received experimental approval on a case-by-case basis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It is not clear when the USDA will grant official approval for full-scale use.
In an effort to work closely with zoos on behalf of the animals, Zoetis announced July 2 that it was donating over 11,000 doses of its vaccine to nearly 70 zoos in 27 states following the successful vaccination of great apes at the San Diego Zoo in January of this year, according to Christina Lood, senior director of sustainability and innovation communications at Zoetis. 
“Zoetis has a long history of supporting zoo veterinarians, and we are proud to continue to help them provide a high standard of care for the animals living in their zoo communities,” Lood wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Despite this, the National Zoo does not yet have access to the vaccine, but the zoo staff plans to vaccinate eligible animals as soon as it becomes available, according to Meyer.
“It’s based on availability, so we are ready and are going to jump in and move ahead,” Meyer said. “We’re hoping it’ll be available probably in the coming months.”
While the lions and tigers continue to be treated for their symptoms, the animals are in good hands with the National Zoo staff, according to Meyer.
“Our team is incredible at what they do,” Meyer said. “They are experts in animal care and experts in veterinary medicine, and they are doing the absolute best to take care of our great cats.”

This is a fantastic article!

Victoria Veh says

That anyone working in proximity to these precious animals would decline to protect them by simply getting vaccinated is an appalling display of selfishness.
Full vaccination must be made a condition of continued employment at the National Zoo if it hasn’t already been established as such. No exceptions.

A Georgetown University Medical Center professor is planning to develop a global health treaty to combat future pandemics after being awarded an international peace and security research grant. 
Alexandra Phelan, assistant professor in the Microbiology and Immunology Department at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, received a $196,000 award from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, a philanthropic organization supporting educational programs around the world. Phelan also serves as an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and a member of the Center for Global Health Science and Security. 
The prize, announced on Sept. 8, was awarded to 10 other winners, with the corporation distributing a total of $3.6 million with the purpose of exploring more equitable solutions to international security issues, including the management of pandemics. 
In conjunction with the Georgetown University Center for Global Health Science and Security, the project will aim to create a global pandemic treaty, a detailed set of guidelines and preparedness measures for countries across the world to follow in order for a more effective pandemic response in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Phelan.
“Now we’ve got lots of these political leaders at the highest levels of government interested in pandemics and international law and we wanted to push this treaty,” Phelan said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Countries across the world have called for codified international cooperation through a global pandemic treaty, which would ensure countries are held accountable to sharing information and technology with one another. One of the biggest challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic was the lack of sharing across borders, according to NPR, making these treaties an important next step in combating future pandemics. 
For proposal submissions, the Carnegie Corporation of New York’s International Peace and Security program asked for unique management suggestions for future pandemics and their threats to global security after witnessing the difficulties that international relations experts faced with COVID-19. 
“At the time, the international community was struggling to form a collective response to COVID-19, and the United States was wrestling to balance its role on the international stage with pressing domestic concerns,” the Carnegie Corporation of New York wrote in a Sept. 8 press release.
Out of more than 300 submissions, Phelan’s plan was selected. A central focus of the treaty is preparedness for future pandemics so that a global response can be coordinated quickly and effectively, according to Phelan.
“It’s about making sure that whatever pandemic treaty or whatever forms of international law do happen are not just informed by what the law currently is and what the science is, but are also going to make us more prepared for the next pandemic,” Phelan said.
According to Phelan, the Center for Global Health Science and Security is focused on building its knowledge with a broad network of experts in areas such as law, international relations, global health security and disease.
This project will improve international cooperation towards global health equity, according to Edward B. Healton, executive vice president for health sciences at the Medical Center and executive dean of the School of Medicine. 
“The pandemic has underscored the interdependence of our nation’s health with the health of nations globally,” Healton wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Sustainable solutions will not come from any one discipline or any one approach, but from a variety of disciplines looking at solutions from all angles.”
With its capacity for research and location in the nation’s capital, Georgetown is the ideal institution for Phelan and her team to explore this project, according to Healton. 
“As history has demonstrated time and again, the academic setting, especially like ours at Georgetown, provides the ideal incubator where meaningful ideas emerge and change occurs,” Healton wrote. 
According to Phelan, a major achievement of the pandemic treaty would be creating a more equitable forum for countries to develop global health policy.
“One of the things we really wanted to make sure was part of this project is that we elevate voices from the Global South in these areas of expertise to bring their perspectives,” Phelan said. “International law has traditionally been very much driven by Western countries, high-income countries, and the pandemic has demonstrated not only the consequences of that but how there’s a lot more nuance to many of these issues, and this big risk that we engage in a form of neo-colonialism with the law-making that occurs out of this.”

A new report found that Washington, D.C. public schools have improved hiring practices over the last 12 years thanks to new, innovative hiring practices. 
According to the report released this month by FutureEd, a think tank at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy, the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) has improved its rate of hiring well-qualified teachers over the last 12 years with the help of the Teacher Education and Compensation Helps (TeachDC) hiring system. The “Right From the Start” report shows that TeachDC has allowed DCPS to improve its ability to identify the candidates best suited for its schools and hire them well before the beginning of the school year.
In 2009, DCPS launched the TeachDC system, a multi-stage, centralized screening process designed to help schools hire the best candidates. This pilot program replaced a hiring process that focused on teachers’ resume credentials and individual principals’ preferences. The new report from FutureEd suggests TeachDC has delivered on its goals to hire qualified teachers ahead of each new school year. 
With the TeachDC system, D.C. schools can fill teaching positions early, avoiding last-minute hires and helping acclimate teachers to schools’ environments earlier, according to FutureEd Associate Director Phyllis Jordan. 
“Teachers can be hired, and they can spend the summer getting to know their school where they are going to work,” Jordan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “There are still a lot of school districts out there who are scrambling to get teachers at the last minute. This is particularly a problem in high-need schools.”
TeachDC helps DCPS streamline the search for teachers, placing candidates with their “best match” schools through an extensive screening, application and selection process. All candidates are required to submit an online application with several essays, and those who pass the first stage then receive an interview and submit an audition video of their skills in the classroom, according to the FutureEd report. 
TeachDC also encourages earlier hiring, as DCPS pays up to $2,500 to teachers hired by July 1 in critical shortage areas, including English-as-a-second language, special education, world languages and math, according to the FutureEd report.
Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, D.C.’s third-largest high school, is currently focused on hiring teachers representative of the entire student body, especially by increasing the number of Latinx teachers, as half of Roosevelt’s student population identifies as Latinx, according to Roosevelt principal Justin Ralston (GRD ’17).
“I think from what we have heard from our students, our staff and even data outcomes with how our students are performing, it is absolutely critical that we work to be able to diversify our staff to be representative of our school community,” Ralston said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
While TeachDC gives D.C. schools a common starting point for hiring, principals have the flexibility to develop a system that highlights their schools’ priorities, which can range from increasing racial and ethnic diversity to decreasing turnover rates, according to the report. 
At Roosevelt High School, administrators have focused on staff retention amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Ralston. 
“What I have experienced throughout the pandemic is that we really need to make sure that we are being as supportive as possible to our teachers and staff,” Ralston said. “Retention is always something on top of my mind because I think it plays a huge role in school performance.”
Historically, DCPS teachers have faced a 25% turnover rate, compared to a 16% rate nationwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated factors that typically contribute to higher turnover rates, including heavy workloads and lack of professional support, according to the DC Policy Center.
The TeachDC model allows the school’s principal to work in conjunction with a hiring committee and other teachers in order to hire candidates that are a best fit for the school, according to Ralston. 
“I take great pride in the fact that every single hiring decision I’ve made as principal at Roosevelt has been 100 percent the recommendation of what came out of our personnel committee,” Ralson said.
In addition to focusing on representation, FutureEd indicates in its report that schools will receive more funding to make changes after the pandemic. This funding should be allocated to refine the teacher hiring system, according to Jordan.
“D.C. can continue to refine their process,” Jordan said. “What we are hoping is that other school districts take a look at this and see if they can adopt something similar.”
