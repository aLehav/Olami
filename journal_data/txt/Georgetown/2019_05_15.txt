Georgetown University’s admissions yield rate for the Class of 2023 decreased slightly to 49.4% from last year’s 51% after the school’s admissions rate fell to the lowest in university history this year.
The admissions yield rate refers to the proportion of individuals who have paid their May 1 enrollment deposit to confirm their enrollment at Georgetown. Of the 3,206 admitted students, 1,585 students have committed to Georgetown as of the May 1 deadline, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69). 
The university plans to increase the number of enrolled students in the Class of 2023 to 1,650 by admitting students from the waitlist between now and September, Deacon said in an interview with The Hoya.
“We’re in contact with probably 50 people right now, hopefully of whom maybe 30 or 40 will end up committing,” Deacon said. “Then we’ll put a third group, maybe 100 people or 75, on an extended list, from which we’ll take the remaining people as we need them.”
While the College is expected to admit between 40 and 50 students from the waitlist, the School of Foreign Service, the McDonough School of Business and the School of Nursing and Health Studies are each planning to admit five to 10 students from the waitlist in the upcoming months, according to Deacon.
The expected waitlist admissions mark a change from last year when the College, SFS and MSB all exceeded their target enrollment numbers after the university received a record number of applications. As a result of this overcommitment, students on the waitlist had a lower chance of admission.
It is better to keep the number of admitted students conservative in the first round and admit students from the waitlist to fill in the gap, rather than admit more students than the university has space for and decrease the number of transfer students admitted to remove the discrepancy, according to Deacon.
The university cannot exceed its admissions cap because of a 20-year agreement between the university and the local community that limits the total number of undergraduate students to 6,675, according to the 2017 University Campus Plan.
The yield rate and transfer acceptance rate influence each other every year, and the university prefers to admit a conservative number of students in the first round rather than admit more students than the university has space for and have to adjust, according to Deacon.
“These two numbers do work together,” Deacon said. “Last year, when we were over for the first time in maybe 50 years, we ended up having to cut back the number of transfer students to balance it out.”
The university has sent out approximately 140 offers of enrollment to potential transfer students, with the expectation that 100 of those students will commit to the university by the June 15 deadline. Spots will be available for 50 more transfer students to start in the spring semester, continuing a practice that began last year.
The class of 2023 is expected to maintain similar numbers of black and Hispanic students enrolled from the previous class, with 10% of students identifying as black and 14% identifying as Hispanic. The rate of Asian American students planning to enroll at Georgetown has significantly increased to 22% of the total incoming class over the last two years, compared to 15% of enrolled students who originally enrolled in the Class of 2021.
The Class of 2023 also features a degree of geographic diversity, with 49 states represented in the incoming cohort. All states had applicants to the university, but Wyoming was the only one that did not have any students accepted to Georgetown.
A total of 128 international students have submitted enrollment deposits to Georgetown, marking a slight decrease from last year’s 137 students.
The mean SAT math and verbal scores was between 725 and 740 and the average ACT score was 32.9 for the incoming class of 2023. Last year, the mean SAT score for incoming first-years was a 1440 combined math and verbal score.
Rising testing scores have led to a greater weight placed on students’ individual experiences in determining admission, according to Deacon.
“It’s actually a good thing, because it means we can stress the personal circumstances, whether it be personality qualities, which it the thing we look most at, or other things, such as geographic diversity or unusual talents,” Deacon said.
Still, Deacon acknowledged that in such an admissions pool, students still need to have high test scores to be competitive with their peers.
“As the overall scores continue to move up, there’s less to discriminate among them,” Deacon said. “You have to have pretty good scores to be in the running.”

D.C. Public Schools is currently investigating an incident of verbal harassment directed at the 6-year-old grandson of social activist and Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson, who was verbally threatened at his elementary school. The incident led the professor to initiate a larger discussion on race relations in the United States.
A first grade student initiated a verbal altercation and used racial slurs against Dyson’s grandson, Maxem Dyson, at Horace Mann Elementary School, according to Dyson. The student threatened to acquire a gun from home and shoot Maxem and another classmate, according to a Metropolitan Police Department incident report. 
“A young white student called my grandson a b—h and then he called him n—–r and then after delivering such vicious epithets, he threatened to go to his home, retrieve his father’s gun and come back to the school and shoot him,” Dyson said in an interview with The Hoya.  
Dyson’s son and Maxem’s father, Mwata Dyson, notified professor Dyson about the altercation at approximately 2 p.m after hearing about the incident. Dyson and his wife decided to meet their son at the school to address the incident with Horace Mann Principal Elizabeth Whisnant later that afternoon, according to Dyson. 
Whisnant told MPD Officer Cody Coleman that the altercation came after one of the three students involved cut the lunch line, according to the incident report. 
Dyson is a sociology and affiliate African American studies professor at Georgetown. Dyson has written 17 books, including multiple publications about racial politics in the United States such as “What Truth Sounds Like: Robert F. Kennedy, James Baldwin, and Our Unfinished Conversation About Race in America.” He is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, has appeared on television shows like the “Today” show and “Real Time With Bill Maher” and serves as a political analyst for MSNBC. 
In the meeting with Whisnant, Dyson expressed concerns that white privilege influenced the handling of the altercation by school officials, according to Dyson.
“I said, ‘The fact that this young man hasn’t been you know at least extracted from school and seen by an officer of the law is a reflection of some kind of white privilege, because if it had been a black kid, threatening to go home and get a gun to kill and to return to kill his classmates, I don’t think he’d be in school right now,” Dyson said.
During the 2017-18 school year, 66% of the Horace Mann student body was white, 12% was black, 12% was hispanic or latino,  7% was asian and 3% was of multiple races, according to the DCPS website. Dyson also communicated to Whisnant in an email that racial slurs were used in threats against his grandson, according to the professor.
Whisnant, however, said the incident did not include any racial or ethnic slurs, in an April 30 email to the Horace Mann community.
“It is true that harmful language was used today in school,” Whisnant wrote in an email obtained by The Hoya. “The incident did not include any language about race or ethnicity.”
While Whisnant did not respond to multiple requests for comment, a representative from DCPS confirmed she had received emails from The Hoya and directed us to DCPS for comment.
Dyson sent an email with the subject line: “unfortunate email” to Whisnant later that night disputing Wishant’s original message to the university, according to the email obtained by The Hoya. 
“We even said today in your office that the “N” word was used — my son, me and his mother all said so,” Dyson’s email to Whisnant’s email said. “Perhaps amidst the hullabaloo you missed that, but we calmly indicated it to you. To state in bold letters that no such incident took place is doubly injurious to Max, and re-victimizes him and us.”
After Whisnant’s original email to the community, Instructional Superintendent of Horace Mann Janice Harris sent a separate email to the Horace Mann community May 1. 
Harris specifically states in the email that it is unclear to Washington, D.C., whether racial language was used in the incident and the exact details are still under investigation by DCPS.
“At this time, we cannot affirm with confidence that no racial slur was used, and an investigation has been launched,” Harris wrote in her email to the community.
After hearing about the incident, one Horace Mann parent pulled her daughter, who is in Maxem’s class, from school for five days out of concern for her daughter’s safety after the incident. Whisnant indicated she would excuse the absences in a May 1 email obtained by The Hoya. 
An investigation into the investigation was opened by the D.C. Public Schools Comprehensive Alternative Resolution and Equity Team, an organization responsible for resolving discrimination claims in DCPS. DCPS will work with the Horace Mann community to address the incident and provide resources for affected students, according to DCPS officials.
“DCPS’ Office of Equity is in contact with the school to implement restorative and trauma-informed practices to support the school community in response to the incident,” DCPS officials wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Maxem has not been contacted by the school for meetings or counseling since April 30, though he has returned to school after taking a day off after the incident, according to Dyson. 
“My son says besides meeting the day of the incident with Max, the school has not had any follow up meeting or support or counseling with him,” Dyson said. “Disappointing in the extreme.”
After the incident, Dyson posted a series of tweets detailing his side of the interaction with the school in a series of written posts and videos. Dyson wrote that while the incident ended in favor of his grandson, many similar situations have had negative outcomes for families and welcomed stories and concerns from his Twitter followers who experienced similar problems.
On social media and in media interviews, Dyson has also argued that the incident speaks to the larger issue of racial oppression in the United States and offered advice to parents and families of students of color navigating problems in school administrations.
The young child’s alleged use of a racial slur speaks to a broader environment of bigotry, Dyson said in an interview with FOX 5 D.C.
“Unfortunately this represents for us the deep and abiding roots of white supremacy that are set loose in this country,” Dyson said. “How can a 6-year-old kid know to call his classmate the N-word?”
This article was updated May 15th with statistics on the racial demographics of Horace Mann Elementary School.

The university announced the creation of the Office of Student Equity and Inclusion as well as the appointment of its associate vice president for student equity and inclusion to improve resources for first-generation and minority students on campus. 
The OSEI will oversee the Georgetown Scholars Program, the Community Scholars Program and the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, each of which seeks to serve students of color and first-generation college students, according to an email sent by Provost Robert Groves to the campus community May 9. 
Dr. Adanna Johnson, currently the senior associate dean of students and director of diversity, equity and student success, will lead the OSEI as associate vice president for student equity and inclusion, as announced in Groves’ email. 
Although GSP, CSP and CMEA will retain their own identities under the OSEI, the new office will improve GSP students’ college experiences by allowing similar programs to share resources and expand the variety of their programming, according to GSP Program Director Missy Foy. 
“This is a really positive move for GSP, in my opinion,” Foy wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“We are already close partners with Community Scholars, for example, so it makes sense for us to sit under the same umbrella.  We can minimize redundancies and thereby maximize the resources we can put towards the work.” 
While many Georgetown University organizations already seek to promote inclusion and equity on campus, the OSEI will unite different sectors of the university to improve the efficiency of funding and increase collaboration across the organizations, according to Johnson. 
“The hope is that minority students, first generation students and others will have a more enriching college experience,” Johnson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “With stronger alignment across units and departments, there will be more of an opportunity to have awareness of and access to resources that facilitate thriving in college.”
Johnson, who joined the Georgetown community in the summer of 2018, supervised CMEA and convened universitywide councils addressing issues of diversity and student access and success. Johnson came to Georgetown after serving as an associate professor of psychology and the director of the African and African American studies program at Loyola University Maryland. 
After observing the work of various departments on campus, including Student Affairs, the Office of the Provost, Student Financial Services and the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service, Johnson has seen firsthand how the university is especially committed to the initiatives of the OSEI, she wrote.
“From the moment I stepped onto campus, I noticed a deep level of commitment to enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion at Georgetown–a level that I had not seen at other traditionally White institutions,” Johnson wrote. 
Georgetown has worked toward the creation of the OSEI for several years, according to Groves’ email. The university established an Advisory Board on Access and Affordability in 2017 led by the Executive Director of the Center of Social Justice Dr. Andria Wisler and GSP Assistant Director Jason Low, according to Groves’ email. 
The ABAA initiated a “whole-institution approach,” which emphasizes the Georgetown community’s dedication to equity across campus, according to Wisler and Low. 
“Equity is not a one person or one unit responsibility,” Wisler and Low wrote in an email to the Hoya. “As an institution committed to Jesuit higher education, each member of our community must engage issues of inclusion, access, and affordability across all facets of University life. The ultimate goal of a whole institution approach is for each person to recognize their implicated role in building a more equitable Georgetown.”
Minority and first-generation college students are frequently responsible for changing the university culture around equity and inclusion, but this task should fall to the entire Georgetown community, according to Wisler and Low. 
“So often, low-income and/or first generation college students (especially those of color) are faced with the burden of educating those around them about their experiences,” Wisler and Low wrote. “Change is not a burden for low-income and first generation students to bear, but a responsibility of each individual in our community.”
This article was updated on 05/16 to reflect the correct spelling of Dr. Andria Wisler’s name.

Wisemiller’s Deli removed the “Blackie’s Favorite” sandwich that has appeared on the menu for at least 20 years from the store’s physical menu as a result of backlash to the racist nature of its name.
The sandwich, which contains hot roast beef, grilled onions, muenster cheese and thousand island dressing, is not listed on the official menu inside of the deli but still appears on the store’s online menu. Blackie’s Favorite has historically been one of Wisey’s most popular sandwiches, according to a 1999 Washington Post article on the restaurant. 
Naming a sandwich Blackie’s Favorite is inappropriate because of the history of the term as a slur again the black community, according to Georgetown Black Student Association Historian Alexandra Mucher (COL ’22).
“Blackie is a derogatory term used towards black people that is condescending by nature,” Mucher wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is a dated term and I don’t hear it being used as much, but the frequency of its usage is irrelevant to the historical weight it carries.”
Wisey’s, a popular Georgetown student eatery, has been located on 36th St. NW, about two blocks from Georgetown University’s front gates, for over 60 years.
The university, which owns the land on which Wisey’s is located, contacted the restaurant about the name of the sandwich before its removal from the menu, according to university spokesperson Rachel Pugh.
“Concerns about the menu item were raised and communicated to Wisemiller’s,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Rolando Nauit, manager of Wisey’s sister deli on Wisconsin Avenue, has been working at the store for 13 years but was not involved in the decision to remove the sandwich from the menu. Both Wisey’s locations have experienced lags in updating their online menu, according to Nauit.
The sandwich’s name should be changed if it remains on the Wisey’s menu, according to Mucher. 
“Even if it isn’t meaning to come off negatively, they should change the name because I’m sure I’m not the only one who was puzzled by seeing that name,” Mucher wrote.
Blackie’s Favorite is not the only contentious sandwich name on the Wisey’s menu. Wisey’s in-store menu also offers the “Gangsta Club Sub,” a sandwich which could also reference racial stereotypes, according to Mucher.
Wisey’s official menu is hung in the 36th Street store and listed on the website for the Wisconsin Avenue location. The outdated menu, which includes Blackie’s Favorite, is listed on the original location’s website.
Wisey’s customer Elisabeth Oki (COL ’20) visits the restaurant at least three times a week and typically orders the “Hot Chick Sandwich.” Continuing to serve the sandwich under the Blackie’s Favorite name is unacceptable, according to Oki. 
“This name is inherently so racist and outlandish. I’ve never seen something of that nature on a menu before,” Oki wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It utilizes the derogatory term ‘blackie’ which makes me think its implying that it’s the favorite sandwich of an entire race.” 
Though sandwich names are not the most pressing problem facing the black community in Washington, D.C., the name is still offensive and upsetting, according to Mucher. 
“Between gentrification and criminalization, the D.C. black community is being faced with much greater issues than the name of a sandwich,” Mucher wrote. “That being said, seeing what is essentially a racial slur on the menu of a popular eatery near campus isn’t a welcoming sight as a black student at Georgetown.”
Wisey’s needs to be much more careful with their language, according to Mucher. 
“I would hope Wisey’s has enough common sense and racial awareness to recognize that this term should not be used as a marketing gimmick,” Mucher wrote. “Especially as a business, they need to think about how things are perceived in a greater context.”
The name “Blackie’s Favorite” is an homage to Ulysses “Blackie” Auger, the owner of “Blackie’s House of Beef,” a famous rib and steak restaurant in D.C., Wisemiller’s owner Gina Vogel wrote in a June 9 email to The Hoya. Vogel said she sought to explain the name to those who raised concerns, though the sandwich has been removed from the physical menu in the 36th Street location.
This article was updated on June 9 to include a response from Wisemiller’s owner Gina Vogel.

The majority of graduating seniors have utilized the career resources on campus to explore their employment options as the university works to diversify and expand job advising services across the undergraduate schools.
The Cawley Career Education Center, the primary career resource on campus, provides services like drop-in appointments, meetings to review resumes and cover letters, mock interviews, industry advising and other events such as employer presentations and educational seminars. Approximately 85% to 90% of graduating seniors have engaged with the center during their time at Georgetown University, according to Susan Campbell, Cawley’s director.
Cawley works with students to develop a career strategy by leveraging relationships with alumni, employers and graduate schools afforded by the university, according to Campbell.
“Cawley seeks to provide career services that are not only truly excellent, but distinctively Georgetown—drawing upon our Jesuit identity to understand career decisions in the context of a student’s innate capacities, developing interests, and purposeful ambitions,” Campbell wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
While Cawley provides helpful resources to students, individuals interested in specific industries might have to look for guidance outside of the center, according to Luke Butcher (COL ’19), who will go into development after graduation.
“I found the resume review helpful, and I ultimately found my job through the fall career fair,” Butcher wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In terms of very specific career advising though, I found my professors most helpful – which is fine! That’s not a critique of the career center – I think it’s just how development (my field of interest) works.”
In fall of 2017, students reported mixed experiences with Cawley, after which the center collaborated with the Georgetown University Student Association to address student concerns and increase availability of career resources to all students.
To supplement Cawley’s work, the university’s other undergraduate schools have taken steps to introduce students to a broader range of career options. The McDonough School of Business’s Office of Professional Development was opened September 2014 as an additional career resource for students in the MSB. 
The Office of Professional Development helps students explore opportunities across in both the business industry and other areas as well as aids them in connecting with students and alumni working in their fields of interest, according to Talia Schatz, director of the Office of Professional Development.
“The office works to foster principled, global leaders of the future, across all industries,” Schatz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our office offers programming in a multitude of sectors including: marketing, digital strategy, accounting, operations and information management and more.”
The office supplements Cawley by offering educational and mentorship programs catered to business students seeking summer internships as well as postgraduation jobs, Schatz said.
“It is our hope to interact with all of our students during the course of their time at Georgetown McDonough,” Schatz wrote.
While Cawley and the Office of Professional Development offer resources for Georgetown students looking for jobs in all industries, however, some have criticized the dominance of opportunities in finance and consulting as opposed to other industries. 
One year after graduating from Georgetown, 21.9% of the Class of 2017 was working in the financial services industry and 18.5% in consulting, according to data published in Cawley’s First Destination Report. Over the past seven years, the financial services and consulting industries have hired more than 40% of fully employed graduates.
Other undergraduate schools at Georgetown have also encouraged introducing students to a more diverse set of career options through programs that foster connections between students and professionals working in various industries.
School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman led efforts since spring of 2016 to introduce students to public sector and nonprofit opportunities through coffee chats with industry professionals. In the College, Dean Thomas Chiarolanzio worked to establish the Social Responsibility Network, a pilot program dedicated to connecting current students with alumni who work in nonprofit and education sectors.
The university is working to develop a campuswide system that supports holistic career development by going beyond career services through the campus centers to include advising in academic programs and co-curricular activities in all undergraduate schools, according to Campbell.
“We hope to transform career services from a place on campus to a campus-wide and global ecosystem that permeates both the institutional culture and the student experience,” Campbell wrote.

After criticism from environmental and indigenous rights activists over the university’s proposed solar panel initiative, the Maryland Department of the Environment held its second informational hearing about the project May 13.
Georgetown University announced its agreement with Origis Energy USA to build a solar panel system September 2017. The proposal entails cutting down 240 acres of forest in Nanjemoy, Md. The installed solar panels on the property would provide half of the university’s electricity needs. 
Monday marked the second public meeting in response to criticism about the environmental impact of the plan after an initial Feb. 27 hearing required an extension. In addition to written comments, which can be submitted until June 3, the Department of the Environment is holding the hearings as it determines whether or not to grant the project the permit needed to build on wetlands. 
Because of mounting criticism, Georgetown is employing an outside party to evaluate the proposed project, according to a university spokesperson.
“In our role as the project customer, Georgetown has spent the past several months engaged in a thorough internal review of the project,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have engaged an independent third party expert to review this offsite solar project. We are also engaging with faculty members with expertise in environmental issues and with our broader community.””
The area designed for deforestation is located on land that is spiritually significant to the Piscataway people, a group indigenous to southern Maryland and Washington, D.C., according to Valarie Proctor, a member of the Cedarville band of Piscataway who is involved in activism to stop Georgetown’s planned project and has tweeted extensively about the issue.
Proctor and others, including Georgetown student groups, are circulating a petition titled “Urge Georgetown University to #ProtectPiscatawayLand” on social media, requesting that the university halt any work on the project and consult with the Piscataway community on site alternatives for the project. As of May 16, the petition has 412 signatures, according to Proctor. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources prohibits projects such as this and other development in the area, according to the petition.
“I feel I have a deep obligation to protect the very thing that’s embraced me and my family for thousands of years,” Proctor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is our medicine and our home. This fight has been heartbreaking because I find it incredibly difficult to communicate just how important land and nature is to indigenous people.”
While the petitioners appreciate the university’s attempt to develop more sustainable energy sources, they ask that the university identify alternative sites for the project. 
“We want renewable energy development in Maryland, but not at the expense of indigenous ancestral forestland,” the petition reads. “We believe that there are many options to have both and this is what we are fighting for in this campaign.”
Multiple student groups posted the petition to Facebook, including The Georgetown University Native American Student Council, Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and the Asian-Pacific Islander Leadership Forum.
“It is our duty to hold Georgetown accountable for recognizing AND respecting the people whose ancestral lands are being impacted by this project!,” NASC’s Facebook post reads. 
The petition also notes the potential environmental impacts of the project, which have been the center of previous criticism of the initiative.
Although the solar panel proposal is part of Georgetown’s commitment to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2020, the site’s value to the environment outweighs the benefits of the location, according to Mary Pat Dougherty, a Nanjemoy resident.
“How does cutting down trees, destroying habitat, disturbing soil, traversing wetlands, traversing streams and potentially polluting them and driving up air temperatures add up as a way to reach local, state, regional and federal renewable energy and climate goals,” Dougherty said at the Feb. 27 hearing. 
The land is a targeted ecological area, a designation determined its high ecological value and priority for conservation, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.  The site has also been noted as an important bird area by the Audubon Society, a bird conservation group. 
Despite the criticism and Georgetown’s stated efforts to further evaluate the project, the university maintains that the solar panel project will ultimately have a net positive effect on the environment and greenhouse gas emissions, according to the spokesperson.
“While our review indicates that the project results in benefits to climate change associated with net reductions to carbon dioxide emissions, we are closely monitoring the regulatory process being conducted by the Maryland Department of the Environment,” a university spokesperson wrote. “Should MDE approve the project, Georgetown will work with Origis to explore additional voluntary environmental enhancements to make the project even more ecologically beneficial.”
This article has been updated May 19, 2019, to reflect the accurate spelling of Valarie Proctor’s name and to add comment from Proctor. A previous version named her as Valerie Proctor.

Jeanne Garrity says 
May 28, 2019 at 8:33 am
Is Georgetown and Origis looking at other potential sites or just waiting to pounce on this one should MDE approve?

SolarSME says 
January 12, 2022 at 3:52 pm
No doubt solar energy has potential, and it concerns to resolve related issues on priority basis . hopefully Georgetown will take its part to create renewable energy environment.

Student petitioners with the unrecognized group Medical Students for Choice have started a fundraiser to raise money for an off-campus medical workshop after meeting with Georgetown University School of Medicine administrators about an April 26 petition.
MSC, a group made up of GUSOM students, created a petition after GUSOM administrators stopped the group from hosting their annual “Papaya Workshop” on university grounds. After the creation of the petition, GUSOM administrators met with MSC members April 27. GUSOM agreed at the meeting to help the group arrange a location to host the “Papaya Workshop” at a medical training facility that is off-campus and not affiliated with Georgetown University, according to an update on the petition’s website.
The workshop, which the group put on to teach Georgetown medical students about first trimester abortion and miscarriage management using papayas, had been facilitated on campus premises the past two years. The location, agreed upon in the meeting because it is off-campus, will provide MSC with all equipment necessary for a full-spectrum abortion training. The group has also arranged for medical students to be granted access to the space for future trainings, according to the update.
MSC created the fundraiser after the meeting with administrators and hopes to collect money to cover student transportation to and from the workshop location which GUSOM will not cover for students. Since its creation, the fundraiser has collected $690 at the time of print, $190 more than its initial goal, and has been shared on Facebook 22 times.
For a medical student to receive abortion training currently, they must get placed at a separate hospital by a lottery system, according to fourth year candidate for a doctorate in medicine and philosophy and petition author Allison O’Connell.
The university’s initial choice to stop the event was unacceptable given that MSC had planned the workshop in accordance with university rules, O’Connell wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The administration’s initial response to this event was to force it off-campus, without providing any assistance, guidance or explanation to group leaders mere days before the event was set to happen despite it having been planned in accordance with institutional policy weeks in advance,” O’Connell wrote. “These actions went beyond not providing abortion training and entered a realm were the administration was actively preventing students self-organized medical education.”
Unofficial clubs which do not align with Jesuit values can still reserve space on campus, according to the university’s Access to Benefits policy and the GUSOM Student Handbook.
The lack of abortion and miscarriage education contradicts the GUSOM mission statement, which supports the education of students to become knowledgeable, ethical, skillful and compassionate physicians, according to the petition.
“Actively denying students the opportunity to learn about a legal and safe medical procedure while in training at Georgetown is a disservice to students’ education and career preparation and is in direct opposition with the GUSOM mission,” the petition reads.
The petition has garnered 1,730 signatures as of press time and has been shared with the GUSOM Office of Medical Education and the Office of Student Affairs. The petition argues that MSC followed all policies set forth by the administration, including not posting the event on the official school event calendars and not using school email listservs to advertise this event. 
Abortion is not permitted in Catholic hospitals, including the Georgetown University Medical Center, in accordance with the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services. The GUSOM curriculum currently does not offer abortion training. 
Medical professionals need to have abortion training, since abortion is an extremely commonplace medical procedure in the medical world, according to fourth year GUSOM student and petition signatory Emory Buck.
“Regardless of one’s thoughts on abortion, medical providers need to be trained in order to do their jobs,” Buck wrote. “If medical students prefer not to be trained on the basis of personal religious beliefs, that is acceptable. However, it is not excusable for the school administration to stand in the way of training because of the institution’s beliefs.”
In an effort for a more permanent solution, the students discussed in the meeting the possibility of creating an optional rotation for GUSOM students to learn about abortion at a religiously unaffiliated hospital, according to the petition update.
Since familiarity with basic medical care is required of Georgetown medical students, the Georgetown community should support the creation of both abortion and miscarriage training, according to O’Connell.
“It is important to understand that this medical procedure is used not only for abortions, but also miscarriages, which are as frequent as 25% of all known pregnancies,” O’Connell wrote. “It is my hope that MSFC will continue to be supported by Georgetown students and faculty as they try to provide opportunities to facilitate student learning.”

Fr. Richard J. Ryscavage, S.J., a scholar of migration issues and Georgetown University professor since 2017, died April 26 at the age of 74. 
A Jesuit priest for over 40 years, Ryscavage focused his work in higher education, politics and  nonprofits on the rights of migrants and refugees. His funeral was held in Wernersville, Pa. on May 1. 
Ryscavage was born in St. Clair, Pa., in 1945, and he attended Nativity High School in Pottsville, Pa. After high school, he received a bachelor’s degree in foreign affairs from Assumption College, which later gave him an honorary doctorate. He entered the Society of Jesus in Wernersville in 1967 and was ordained a priest in 1977. 
Superior of the Georgetown Jesuit Community Rev. Ron Anton, S.J., informed the campus community of Ryscavage’s passing in an April 29 email.
“He will be dearly missed at the university and throughout the Jesuit community,” Anton wrote. 
Returning to the District in 2016, Ryscavage spent a year teaching economics at The Catholic University of America before rejoining the faculty at Georgetown. Since 2017, he taught with Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of International Migration, directed the Jesuit Refugee Service and worked with the humanitarian relief coalition InterAction.
Susan Martin, who worked with Ryscavage at Fairfield University and Georgetown University, met Ryscavage while he was working with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
Ryscavage should be remembered for his immigration and refugee philanthropy throughout his time as a professor and leader in various organizations, according to Martin.
“He had great compassion for the refugees and administrative skills that ensured that the Catholic dioceses throughout the country were able to step up to the challenge and help refugees with their new lives,” Martin wrote in an email to The Hoya.
A lifelong student, Ryscavage earned a doctorate in law and diplomacy from Tufts University and earned master’s degrees in political philosophy from Boston College, in divinity from the Weston School of Theology and in international administration from the School for International Training.
Ryscavage came to Washington, D.C., in 1987 to work at the USCCB and began teaching at Georgetown in 2017 until his death. He worked as the Deputy Director of Migration and Refugee Services at the USCCB for two years and then as the Executive Director for four. He also served as the president of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network at the beginning of its history. 
Ryscavage left the United States in 1994 to teach at Oxford University for three years, heading the Pedro Arrupe Tutorship in Refugee Studies. After departing from Oxford, Ryscavage joined the faculty of Fairfield University, where he founded the Center for Faith and Public Life, which studies the intersection of religion and politics. 
During his 12 years at Fairfield, he worked closely with the Vatican and the U.S. government on immigration issues. Ryscavage was named official adviser to the delegation of the Holy See to the 61st United Nations General Assembly in 2006 and represented the Vatican with the United Nations Secretary General’s “High Level Dialogue on Migration.” 
Rev. James Martin, S.J., a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine America,  tweeted a link to an obituary for Ryscavage, calling him a “a wonderful Jesuit and friend.”
Ryscavage firmly believed Jesuit schools and their students could be leaders in immigration reform and justice, according to Martin.
“He brought this sensibility to every issue in which he engaged,” she wrote. “He saw his own Jesuit identity as fundamental to his work with migrants and refugees and pushed others involved in Jesuit institutions to be models that could embolden others to take a more humane approach to some of the most vulnerable and give them the tools that will allow them to live better lives.”

Georgetown University seniors were honored with Dean’s Medals, a Yenching Scholarship and Fulbright Awards this spring in recognition of their achievements at the university throughout the semester.
Two of the four undergraduate schools have released the names of the individuals who have earned the highest grade point averages in their class. Eileen Yee (NHS ’19), a human science major, will receive the Dean’s Medal for highest cumulative GPA. at the School of Nursing and Health Studies’ Tropaia ceremony on Friday, according to Senior Director of Communications and Strategic Initiatives Bill Cessato.
The College will have three valedictorians: Russell Wirth (COL ’19), Julie Bevilacqua (COL ’19) and Agnes Donnelly (COL ’19), according to Sue Lorenson, vice dean for undergraduate education for the College. 
The School of Foreign Service does not announce the name of the Dean’s Medal recipient until Friday’s Tropaia ceremony, and the McDonough School of Business has also not yet released the name of its valedictorian.
In addition to academic honors based on grade point average in each of the schools, both junior and senior students have received fellowships and awards throughout the semester in the form of scholarships and grants. 
Hundreds of students utilize one-on-one advising sessions each year through the Georgetown Office of Fellowships, Awards and Resources, with around 100 students receiving fellowships using the office’s support systems, according to GOFAR Senior Associate Director Lauren Tuckley. The majority of students receiving fellowships are undergraduates.
Fifty-one Georgetown students were offered Fulbright Awards to go abroad for the 2019-20 academic year, including 27 graduating seniors, but some students are still deciding whether they will accept the award, according to Tuckley. Fulbright scholars receive federal funding through grants that can be applied to study abroad after graduation, conduct individual research, pursue master’s degrees or teach English in foreign countries. 
Scholars are chosen based on an affiliation letter from the student’s university and a research project proposal alongside submitted recommendations, transcripts and a personal statement.
Mayeesha Galiba (COL ’19), one of this year’s Fulbright recipients who has chosen to accept the scholarship, will be studying in Serbia through the grant in the 2019-20 school year, she wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“I plan to learn Serbian and hopefully learn to read the Cyrillic alphabet,” Galiba wrote. “I also hope to take the time during my fellowship to shift my focus away from being a student within the structured academia of Georgetown and towards developing a sense of independence and innovation as I work within the parameters of my Fulbright.”
Gary Xie (SFS ’19) was selected as a Yenching Scholar in January following an internal nomination process through Georgetown. Xie will be among 125 individuals from 40 countries pursuing a master’s degree in China Studies at Yenching Academy of Peking University in Beijing, China, this fall through the scholarship. Xie began working on his application for the program in April 2018 and worked with the GOFAR office to create multiple drafts of his application, Xie said. 
Though he intends to major in economics and management, Xie also hopes to expand his studies into the natural sciences and rural China Studies through the fellowship while at the university, according to Xie.
“The Fellowship gives me a lot of flexibility to take almost any course Peking University has to offer. I want to expand my course selection to areas I haven’t really been taking at Georgetown,” Xie wrote in an email to the Hoya. “I think it’s the perfect program to explore China and its intellectual treasures.” 
Two students from this year’s junior class, Sinclair Blue (SFS ’20) and Mena Mohamed (SFS ’20), are recipients of the Truman Scholarship. Only 62 undergraduates were selected for the honor, which grants students $30,000 toward up to three years of graduate education leading to a public service career. 
Blue plans to pursue a dual master’s degree in public health and urban planning and hopes to work for a nonprofit that advance food justice in Washington, D.C., while Mohamed intends to earn a master’s in both international affairs and urban planning, according to the Georgetown website. Mohamed said the application process allowed her a lot of space for self-reflection to consider what the path of public service means to her.
Mohamed also looks forward to learning from other scholarship recipients in the program, she wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“I am most excited to meet the other Truman Scholars for this year and engage with what others are passionate about,” Mohamed wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is an honor to be able to share this award with so many interesting and engaged students.”
CORRECTION: This article was updated May 15th to reflect Galiba’s correct study abroad country.

Each year, the schools of Georgetown University set out to select individuals who embody the values of the institution to deliver the commencement addresses to the graduating class. Though they conclude graduates’ time at Georgetown, these addresses also mark the beginning of their futures as alumni and their entrance into the world beyond the front gates.
As graduates prepare to leave Georgetown, commencement addresses encourage the newly minted alumni to look beyond the Hilltop, according to Margaret Chappell (SFS ’19), president of the School of Foreign Service Academic Council.
“To me, commencement speakers are the first people to properly welcome you into the ‘real world’ and provide a bit of guidance to get you started,” Chappell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In a moment when so many things are uncertain, they represent stability in the future and provide comfort by sharing their own, often unexpected career paths.”
Ten speakers have been announced to address the commencement ceremonies at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
Best selling author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie will address Georgetown College; Joseph Baratta (GSB ’93), global head of private equity at the asset management company Blackstone, will address the McDonough School of Business; Joan Rosenhauer, executive director of Jesuit Refugee Service, will address the School of Nursing and Health Studies; and Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state and professor in the practice of diplomacy in the School of Foreign Service, will address the SFS.
Other notable speakers who will address the graduate schools of Georgetown university include celebrity chef José Andrés, who will address the McCourt School of Public Policy, and former Chief of Staff to First Lady Michelle Obama Tina Tchen, who will address the School of Continuing Studies.
These speakers ultimately decide what remarks and advice they will deliver to graduates. Even though Georgetown cannot write the final lesson its graduates will hear on its campus, it nevertheless takes great care to ensure this message will be consistent with the education and values it has instilled into its students over the course of their time on the Hilltop.
Selecting a Speaker
The process of deciding speakers for this week’s ceremonies begins much earlier than many may expect, even before the start of this academic year.
Each of Georgetown’s schools employs its own method of selecting the commencement speaker. Some seek student feedback, while others only involve members of the faculty.
The College uses a selection committee combined with both students and faculty for its nomination process. The College Executive Council, which includes representatives from the academic departments and programs, the Dean’s Office and the College Academic Council, makes initial nominations for commencement speakers for the College.
Nominations are then sent to the Georgetown board of directors for review and approval.
The McDonough School of Business, however, only solicits ideas for speakers from the academic leadership, who submit the list to the Office of the Provost. The Office of the President and the Georgetown board of directors must then approve the speaker before inviting them. The SFS similarly does not invite student input from the SFS academic council.
Beyond considering individuals who reflect Georgetown’s values, the university also identifies candidates whose actions make them deserving of the honorary degree granted to all commencement speakers, according to Sue Lorenson, vice dean for undergraduate education for the College.
“It’s not enough to be a great public speaker or an accomplished scholar; the speaker should possess a combination of professional achievements and admirable personal qualities,” Lorenson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The MSB seeks speakers who offer real world experience in a continually changing international market, according to Teresa Mannix, senior assistant dean for communications at the MSB.
“Each year, we seek global business leaders who represent our Georgetown values and who can address how our students can become leaders in a rapidly changing world,” Mannix wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The School of Nursing and Health Studies aims to find speakers who will encourage graduates to follow a path of equality and justice in the health fields — core values of the NHS, according to Patricia Cloonan, outgoing dean of the NHS.
“A message that I often share with graduating students involves carrying forth the mission, vision, and values of this great institution, including our own school, as they pursue careers throughout the health fields,” Cloonan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our community, regardless of major or program, is one that orients around the promotion of health equity, the common good, and social justice.”
An Evolution of Values
Commencement speakers have always sought to embody Georgetown’s core values in some form. As these values have evolved over time, however, the commencement speeches and ceremony have also evolved to reflect these changes.
Commencement speakers over time highlight the fluid nature of the university’s values throughout the years, according to Lorenson.
“Because universities are living, breathing entities, their values evolve and grow over time, and Commencement speakers can represent that change,” Lorenson wrote. “In 2016, our speaker was (alumna) Alexandra Cousteau, an environmental activist – a reflection of the university’s increased focus on environmental issues.”
Early university commencement ceremonies, which date back to the mid-1600s, tended to highlight students’ speeches, demonstrating the oratory skills of the speakers, often by displaying their proficiency in classical languages.
The 1894 Georgetown commencement ceremony included a class poem, bachelor’s oration, master’s oration and valedictory, all given by student speakers. The bachelor’s oration was delivered by Condé Nast, who would go on to found the self-named mass media company that counts Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker among its many prominent publications.
As universities deemphasized oratory skills in their curricula, student speeches were featured less centrally in ceremonies, which were instead built around the addresses of principal speakers.
Between 1930 and 1936, Georgetown commencement speakers vice president and a regent of the university, as well as a judge of the D.C. Supreme Court. Even as late as 1966, the president of Georgetown delivered the commencement address to graduates.
By the end of the millenium, however, universities regularly invited celebrities such as actors, filmmakers and writers, as well as business executives to their graduation ceremonies.
Humorist Art Buchwald addressed graduates of the college in 1979, and since then, filmmaker Ken Burns, basketball player Dikembe Mutombo (SLL ’91) and former moderator of NBC’s “Meet the Press” Tim Russert have all spoken at Georgetown graduation ceremonies. 
The shift in commencement speakers chosen also witnessed a shift in the style of the speeches. When speeches were were given by students, they more often featured arguments and posed questions. Speakers now often seek to offer insights or advice based on their own lived experiences.
A Multicultural Focus
In addition to the speakers invited for graduation exercises, commencement week also features specialized ceremonies for different minority communities on campus.
The LGBTQ Resource Center annually hosts Lavender Graduation, a ceremony that honors members and allies of the LGBTQ community for their accomplishments while at Georgetown.
Joshua Javier Guzmán (SFS ’10), assistant professor in the department of gender studies at UCLA, was the keynote speaker at this year’s graduation ceremony, held April 25.
The Center for Multicultural Equity and Access hosts multicultural graduation ceremonies like Despedida, Harambee and Asian Heritage that aim to celebrate students through their respective cultures. These ceremonies will all take place May 16.
The university first recognized these multicultural graduation ceremonies as official university ceremonies in 2013, when the Office of the Provost provided additional resources to the graduation ceremonies and named CMEA as responsible for offering administrative support.
Before the university recognition, however, these cultural celebrations were still happening on a smaller scale with fewer resources, according to CMEA Director Charlene Brown-McKenzie.
Unlike the main undergraduate commencement services, speakers for the multicultural graduation ceremonies are chosen directly by students and advisors, who make their selection from a list of prominent alumni that identify with their community, according to Brown-McKenzie.
These ceremonies not only seek student input in the selection of the speakers, but are also led by students, including speeches from many key student leaders identified on their personal journeys, Brown-McKenzie wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The multicultural graduation ceremonies seek to provide a more diverse celebration than the main commencement services. The alumni speakers are meant to be representatives to the crowd they are addressing, according to Brown-McKenzie.
“We hope each distinguished alumni speaker will inspire and engage the Senior Class of 2019 whose lived experiences emerge from the African Diaspora, Latinx and Asian American Pacific Islander backgrounds,” Brown-McKenzie wrote. “Speakers are invited to share their wisdom with the graduating class as they embark on becoming global citizens.”
