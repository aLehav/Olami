Due to inadequate funding, the administrations for the Latin American Studies and African Studies programs merged at the end of the fall semester, resulting in the dissolution of the African Studies department’s assistant director position and prompting outcries from the program’s director and students who see the merger as a slight against African studies at Georgetown.
Although the African Studies program was not the only program to fall prey to budget cuts, it is the only department left without any organic staff of its own.
“African Studies has no royal family, corporate sponsor or devoted government behind it. Nor does it currently have a graduate program that brings in revenue. It does, however, have great student interest and support, despite the lack of budgetary autonomy or a major benefactor,” African Studies Program Director Scott Taylor wrote in an email.
However, according to the School of Foreign Service Acting Dean James Reardon-Anderson, the merger will not have a detrimental impact on the students’ experiences in the two departments.
“I wouldn’t see this as having much of an effect on students. The delivery of the academic programs will remain unchanged, so it’s just an administrative efficiency move, it’s not really a programmatic move,” he said.
Although the changes will not affect the students in terms of the teaching or quality of the courses within the departments, it indirectly affects them by limiting the department’s ability to provide students with resources, such as internships and scheduling availability among other opportunities.
“Our administrators were always the first point of contact for students and thus played a critical introductory and advisory role as well,” Taylor wrote in an email.
Additionally, Taylor feels the administrative merger indicates the low position of his department within the SFS.
“Certainly, none of my colleagues and none of us who teach Africa and work on Africa want this program to be a stepchild of the School of Foreign Service, and right now, effectively it is,” Taylor said.
With the administrative merger in place, the staff for both departments consists of three members. The three positions, which are under the supervision of the SFS Associate Dean for Finance and Administration Jennifer Long, handle academic affairs, financial affairs and events.
“She is making sure that the staff fulfills all the responsibilities of the operation of the two programs,” Reardon-Anderson said.
Regardless of recent attempts and some success at expansion, the African Studies program will suffer setbacks due to the administrative merger.
“Combining the administrative staff with CLAS inevitably places a burden on both programs, since we have to share limited resources,” Taylor wrote.
Students also feel the merger symbolizes the administration’s lack of support for the African Studies department.
“It would have been nice to have more institutional support, and this merger was essentially a slap in the face, for lack of a better word, because at a time when we really needed the institutions of Georgetown to back us up and really just formerly declare that they support African Studies here on campus, they’re doing the exact opposite by not providing us with the ranging of staff to funding that we need to put on our events,” Jescinta Izevbigie (SFS ’14), a student assistant in the African Studies program, said.
The merger made other students feel as if the university does not support minority groups as much as it should.
“I feel like black and brown people are not usually as valued on this campus, and I think we’re expected to make strides without the support from the university,” Esiwahomi Ozemebhoya (COL ’15) said.
The administration’s failure to communicate or discuss the possibility of the merger left some students feeling shocked and slighted.
“What really hurt the most is the fact that … no one consulted the department in terms of these changes,” Izevbigie said.
Despite students’ negative opinions, since the administrative merger, students have not noted significant change.
“I haven’t seen any direct effect in the center. I mean everything seems to just continue as it has been for the past month, and for the past semester,” Latin American Studies master’s candidate Alma Caballero (SFS ’13, GRD ’15) said.
The content of the programs and the support the programs offer their students also remain unchanged.
“In terms of strength of the program, it’s still there, and I think what’s good is that a lot of students haven’t really noticed that there’s an issue,” Caballero said.
The Dean’s office cites the merger as a short-term solution and temporary situation.
“We take them at their word. Thus we fully expect that the program will be restored to its full budget and staff complement,” Taylor wrote.
An email to Center for Latin American Studies Director Marc Chernick remained unanswered as of press time.

Capitalizing on one of the region’s fastest growing business sectors, the McDonough School of Business will debut a new evening Masters in Business Administration graduate program at the Tysons Corner Center in Vienna, VA in partnership with the conference center network Convene.
Debuting this fall, Georgetown’s MBA Evening graduate program will open up its new location in Tysons Corner, Virgina, an up-and-coming area of greater Washington in close proximity to the Capitol. The program will be housed in a Convene conference center. Convene, a conference center network based in New York City, is hoping to expand and engage in the greater D.C. community.
“I think that we would really like to be an active participant in the community at large, in the professional community at large, and we see ourselves as being an intellectual anchor to the community…our primary service is to bring people together from the entire surrounding business community,” Co-Founder and Principle at Convene Chris Kelly said of his company’s collaboration with Georgetown.
According to Kelly, Convene’s location is the most technologically advanced venue in the Corner, which is the state’s largest, fully enclosed shopping center.
“The extent of the technology and services and comfort that we offer are far more extensive than what would has ever been associated with a typical classroom,” Kelly said of the brand new location.
McDonough School of Business Senior Associate Dean Romanelli agreed.
“It’s absolutely high-end and provides the kind of technology and other sort of support that we need to make it the quality of our educational offerings,” she said.
In preliminary surveys to decide the new campus’ location, administrators determined that Northern Virginia is one of the three fastest growing business regions in the country.
“It is attracting not only the kinds of people that will help us to continue to solidify our position in greater Washington as the premier business school, but it also attracts the type of young professional who’s perfect for our evening MBA program,” Romanelli said.
The Tysons Corner location is aided by its position on the new Metro Silver line, which will facilitate access to the suburb when it opens in spring 2014.
“I can’t even imagine going from work to school and having to commute an hour in between the two,” full-time MBA graduate student Cameron Anderson (GRD ’15) said.
Laura Beyer (GRD ’15), also a full-time MBA student, added that the lack of a metro stop in Georgetown makes it a less accessible option for a commuting student.
“I think it’s just a convenience thing. Georgetown is a really difficult place for people to get to,” Beyer said.
The new Silver Line will also ease a growing traffic congestion problem in the area.
“1800 Tyson’s Boulevard is one, if not the most proximate buildings to the Tysons Corner metro stop. At present, probably the largest single objection to doing things at Tysons is that there’s a lot of traffic there as kind of like a consequence of its boom, so I think the metro line will both relieve the congestion and also provide a much more convenient option for people who choose to use it,” Kelly said.
In accordance with its new location, curriculum at Tyson’s Corner will offer students opportunities unique to Convene’s business-oriented atmosphere and location.
“What I think we’re building is something that’s the same but different,” Romanelli said. “You don’t want to think about this as 45 students sitting out there in Tysons somewhere, but as the nucleus of a new presence for the business school.”
Additionally, the MBA students taking their courses at Convene will have the chance to immerse themselves in an environment more corporate than Georgetown’s undergraduate-centric main campus
“ Every single aspect of our service is much more geared around the corporate environment that your Evening MBA students might be interested in, as opposed to having them go back to a college campus, which is not always where Evening MBA students are coming from; they’re more likely to have already acclimated themselves to a corporate environment,” Kelly said.
Although Convene will serve as the host for the MBA program, providing it with resources and classroom space, the curriculum will be entirely created by Georgetown. “What happens inside of the classroom is 100% up to Georgetown,” Kelly said. 1800 Tysons Boulevard is Convene’s first location outside New York City, and while its New York City locations also host classes for Columbia Business School, New York University, and Villanova, Convene’s three-year commitment contract with Georgetown’s MBA program is the most extensive, Kelly said.
“For us this kind of marks a potential new chapter for us as a company, and we’re really excited to be working on that with Georgetown,” Kelly said.

As legislation to both legalize and decriminalize marijuana makes its way to the Council of the District of Columbia, reform of laws regarding the drug has become an important issue for candidates in the mayoral race, with many just stopping short of calling for the drug’s full legalization.
On Jan. 15, the D.C. Council’s Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety unanimously passed a bill that would eliminate jail time and reduce the fine for possessing up to an ounce of marijuana to $25 — less than most parking tickets in the District.
As the bill is set to move to the full council Feb. 4, several candidates vying to become D.C.’s next mayor have framed the issue as one of many measures meant to reduce inequalities along racial and socioeconomic lines in the District.
While Mayor Vincent Gray, who is running for re-election, indicated support for the bill, he has stopped short of endorsing legalization of the drug. He did, however, indicate that he would support the voters if they were to approve a November ballot referendum legalizing marijuana.
Candidate and Councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), who authored the bill, cited disproportionately high arrest rates among poor and minority communities as one factor in its necessity.
“Ninety-one percent of all arrests for marijuana are minorities — predominantly African-American. We know that marijuana use is far more widespread than just in that community. What this bill does is take a major step forward in eradicating a social injustice for a particular group of residents in D.C,” Wells said, citing a 2010 American Civil Liberties Union study that stated that African-Americans were eight times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession in the District than any other race.
Fellow Councilmember and mayoral candidate Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) has also signaled his support for the decriminalization bill.
“Serving a prison sentence for possessing a small amount of marijuana is something that’s been done in the past and just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense,” Evans said.
Dwight Kirk, communications director for Busboys and Poets restaurateur Andy Shallal’s mayoral campaign, framed the decriminalization question in terms of addressing the needs of the poor communities of D.C.
“This is just the first step, and for those people that would just simply want to celebrate decriminalization, Andy would just ask them to look a little bit deeper and realize that this doesn’t address providing these communities with the opportunities they need to succeed. This is just the first step in a long process,” Kirk said.
Candidate and former State Department official Reta Jo Lewis echoed Wells’ and Kirk’s sentiments, but cautioned that policies could go too far and send the wrong message to the District’s youth.
“I would not go so far as to outwardly legalize marijuana, primarily because I never want to send a message to any kid that using drugs is OK — we need to disavow that notion immediately — but I do think we need to institute common sense approaches that are fair. Right now, it does not seem to me that the punishment fits the crime,” Lewis told The Hoya.
So far, Colorado and Washington are the only states where marijuana is legal for recreational purposes, following ballot referendums passed by voters in November 2012.
While neither Wells nor Shallal have openly endorsed marijuana legalization, both cited the need for the District to have autonomy from Congress on the matter and agreed they would support voters in the event of a referendum.
But for all the desire to see the District’s marijuana laws change, most candidates acknowledged that Congress, per its oversight of D.C., has the final say on whether or not the law is changed.
Susan Lagon, a senior fellow with the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown, believed that although Congress grants the District a certain degree of home rule with respect to self-legislation, legislators may not be as lenient on this topic.
“It was pretty straightforward with medicinal marijuana, which we’ve only had here for the past year or two, but decriminalization and legalization are a little different since it’s either a criminal issue or a social issue, depending on how you look at it,” Lagon said.
Lagon cast doubts on Congress’s willingness to allow major policy changes in light of the institution’s dysfunction over the past year.
“Do they really want to go into a re-election year saying, ‘We can’t get the budget balanced, but we’ve just decriminalized pot?’” Lagon said. “I think this is a situation where we would discount it by its improbability.”
Thus far, Congress has remained silent as to whether or not they would block the law. Legalization supporters speculate that Congress will allow D.C. voters to have the final say.
Dan Riffle, director of federal policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, told Slate Magazine last week that he is optimistic about Congress allowing these kinds of laws to move forward.
“Even the old, reliable opponents have stopped talking about it. The more likely threat to the bill would be a rider, one of hundreds of lines slipped into a must-pass bill,” Riffle said to Slate.
Mayoral candidates and councilmembers Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) and Vincent Orange (D-At-Large) did not respond for comment for this article.

President Obama formed a task force Wednesday to lead federal efforts to prevent and respond to sexual assault on college campuses — a move applauded by activists at Georgetown.
The task force will be composed of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder as well as the secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Education and the Interior. The group has been given 90 days to propose solutions to help universities best react to reports of sexual assault.
“We’re going to work with colleges and universities and educational institutions of all kinds across America to help them come up with better ways to prevent and respond to sexual assault on their campuses. And then we’ll help them put those ideas into practice,” Obama said in his speech Wednesday.
“I think it’s a really wonderful step forward that sees the president and vice president make such a commitment toward this international crisis that’s been going on for years now,” Erin Riordan (COL ’15), co-founder of the blog Feminists-at-Large, said.
According to a White House report released Wednesday, while one in five American females are assaulted, only one in eight report the incident. A similar report issued in 2012 by the National College Health Assessment Survey found that one in four females and one in 33 males on average will experience sexual assault during their college careers.
“Sexual assault is an issue at Georgetown because people don’t think it is. In a lot of ways, I think people tend to like the idea of safety on or around our campus because there is such a strong and powerful sense of community. I would love to see that sense of community rise up to address this scary reality of something that does happen and shouldn’t be ignored,” former Take Back the Night Board Member Deanna Arthur (SFS ’14) wrote in an email.
As part of the task force, Obama said he hopes to put more social pressure on men to intervene in cases of witnessing sexual assault — a priority agreed upon by Georgetown students.
“I think it’s really important and necessary for men to be a part of this conversation. Bringing men into the conversation can be as simple as looking at the way [men] commend each other for hooking up with girls who were maybe a little too drunk or realizing that certain jokes just aren’t funny,” Arthur wrote.
Sexual Assault Peer Educator and Co-Chair of the Sexual Assault Working Group Mabel Rodriguez (COL ’14) stressed that sexual assault is an issue that affects men and women in equal measure.
“It’s not a women’s issue — it’s everyone issue,” Rodriguez said. “Men are survivors of rape, men rape, and men can definitely change the status quo.”
Sexual Assault Peer Educator and co-founder of Feminists-at-Large Kat Kelley (NHS ’14), agreed, stressing the need for an integration of bystander intervention in education and more information challenging prevalent myths about sexual assault.
“First and foremost, I’d like to see mandatory sexual assault and bystander intervention education at Georgetown. Everyone thinks sexual assault is atrocious in the abstract, but when it happens within their own communities, their social circles, they fail to adequately believe and support survivors and to hold perpetrators accountable,” Kelley wrote in an email.
Kelley also emphasized the need for awareness and education about sexual assault on college campuses.
“As a peer educator, I frequently hear ‘Asking for consent is awkward,’” Kelley said. “If you can’t talk about consent, you shouldn’t be engaged in any sexual acts with the person(s). … A few seconds of awkward is definitely preferable to sexual assault, to trauma.”
Riordan hoped the task force will start by providing support to preexisting campus groups, such as R U Ready and Take Back the Night.
“I think the best thing would be to empower [student advocacy groups] to take more action, to empower them within their school administrations,” Riordan said.
Although the national attention placed on sexual assault creates potential for improvement, it remains to be seen whether the initiative will enact real change, Kelley said.
“I’d like to think the task force will galvanize college campuses and mobilize the necessary resources to address sexual assault, but for now it is merely symbolic,” Kelley said.
Regardless, former Take Back the Night co-chair Lena Hermans (COL ’14) thought Obama’s effort would galvanize broader support for the cause.
“Any time that somebody as mainstream as the president is discussing the issue of sexual assault and just making a statement as simple as ‘this is a problem,’ it’s very powerful,” Hermans said.

ALEXANDER BROWN/THE HOYAFirst lady Michelle Obama speaks at the Jan. 16 College Opportunity Summit at the White House, where she highlighted the need for lower-income students to apply to college to secure international competitiveness.First lady Michelle Obama has shifted her focus from promoting healthy eating habits to reshaping the landscape of higher education by leveraging her position as first lady to change how lower-income students think about attaining a college degree.
Obama has replaced her former “Let’s Move” campaign, which encouraged kids to eat healthily and exercise, with a policy-driven platform to encourage students from lower-income backgrounds to apply to more colleges. Her goal is to raise the United States from 12th to first in the world in its percentage of college graduates by 2020.
“The role of the first lady is very much undefined. It’s difficult to put a finger on it — they’re not elected officials, but they have an enormous amount of private influence, and they have an enormous amount of public influence,” said Lauren Wright a doctoral candidate who is currently researching contemporary first ladies for her government dissertation.
Unlike her predecessor Hillary Clinton, who faced public backlash for supposedly overstepping the role of first lady after being appointed head of the healthcare taskforce in 1993, Mrs. Obama enjoys the legal backing of her husband, who is currently trying to pass legislation to improve the U.S. higher-education system.
“It seems like it’s going hand in hand in that getting more people to go college is a goal the Obama administration has shown, so getting people who wouldn’t know to apply to apply, getting them to be interested in college, goes hand-in-hand with trying to get them to be able to afford it when they do apply,” associate professor in the McCourt School of Public Policy and Department of Government Jonathan Ladd said.
Since whether or not the position of first lady ought to be utilized for policy making remains a hot topic among Americans, first ladies have traditionally focused on less divisive issues like the anti-drug initiative undertaken by Nancy Reagan and the highway beautification project undertaken by Lady Bird Johnson.
According to Director of the Women’s Center Laura Kovach, Mrs. Obama has managed to discover a happy medium.
“I think Michelle Obama is trying to strike a balance by focusing on a variety of issues that include children and wellness, military families and now higher education. These are issues that the majority of Americans can support no matter your politics,” Kovach wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Wright, the role of the first lady, especially in the last three administrations, has been to communicate on behalf of the White House.
“I would say that the first lady’s role is always changing, but I think we need to pay attention, especially to the way the White House communications operation deploys the first lady as a messaging device, and whether it’s effective or not,” Wright said.
Executive Director of Georgetown Women in Leadership Helen Brosnan (SFS ’16) disapproved of the idea that the White House would utilize the first lady’s image as a relatable wife and mother figure to communicate White House policy to the people.
“I don’t think it’s right to use her as someone who can connect with voters,” Brosnan said.
“Since the first lady is not an elected official, it is not within her job description to draft legislation and enact policy,” Brosnan said. “Rather, she should draw on her own personal experiences in her initiatives, as Mrs. Obama has done with her higher education initiative and as Mrs. Clinton failed to do in her healthcare initiative.”
Pledge Captain of the Delta Phi Epsilon Foreign Service sorority Bethan Saunders (SFS ’17) agreed that Michelle Obama’s experience with higher education adds legitimacy to her initiative.
“She is the first African American first lady, which is huge in and of itself, and then also she has had the true American Dream experience,” Saunders said, citing Mrs. Obama’s experience growing up in a lower-income household in Chicago before being accepted to Princeton University and then Harvard Law School.
“I think what makes her so incredibly unique is she had everything stacked against her; she was low-income, she was a minority and she was a woman, but she still ended up in one of the most powerful positions — indirectly powerful positions —in the country,” Saunders said.

Amid a two-week government shutdown and continued budget controversy, the 113th Congress is largely considered the least effective congress in recent history, but in the midst of the Capitol’s dysfunction, Georgetown’s student Democrats and Republicans have pledged greater cooperation in spite of their federal counterparts.
According to congressional data, the 113th Congress, which finishes its term Jan. 3, 2015 has passed only 72 bills in 2013. President Barack Obama saw moderate success with legislation in the Democrat-controlled Senate on issues such as immigration and the federal budget, though these initiatives often failed to gain traction in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives.
Representatives of both major political parties on campus agreed that the root of their discord stemmed from a decreased incentive for lawmakers to compromise on key issues.
According to College Democrats Chair Chandini Jha (COL ’16) much of this can be attributed to gerrymandering, or the redrawing of Congressional districts around demographic groups to form solidly Democratic or Republican regions.
“There’s been so much manipulation of the rules of Congress to protect incumbents as much as possible,” Jha said. “If you know that you’re safe, either on the left or the right side, why would you go to the center?”
This has been compounded by the influence of political action committees and other sources of outside money following the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission to outlaw campaign finance regulation.
“People aren’t just donating out of the altruism of their hearts,” Jha said. “There are definitely large corporate interests that use PACs to advance a certain corporate agenda.”
Georgetown professor of government Mark Rom concurred, expressing concern regarding the potential impact of unrestrained private campaign contributions on the future of American politics.
“The idea that rich people can spend unlimited amounts of money in ways without disclosure to influence the public eye, I think we ought to be nervous about that,” Rom said.
College Republicans Chair Patrick Musgrave (COL ’16) offered alternative reasoning for the congressional stagnation, citing instead the self-serving interests of politicians.
“The American governmental structure is based on winning. I think that people on both sides of the aisle do things to win that are less than tasteful. I don’t think that’s a huge issue,” Musgrave said. “You see more senators and representatives trying to score political points with sound bites,” Musgrave said.
Moreover, Musgrave blamed President Obama and Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) in particular for their inability to promote and facilitate necessary legislative cooperation.
“The president has been very uncooperative with Congress,” Musgrave said, “and I think that Speaker Boehner really did not have as good [a] control of his caucus in Congress as I would have liked.”
Congress did successfully pass several important laws with particular relevance for the District, including a bill that ensured budgetary autonomy for D.C. through 2014, allowing the D.C. government a measure of political independence as well as insulating it from another potential federal shutdown or debt crisis.
Unlike their Congressional counterparts, Jha noted that she and Musgrave plan to promote cooperation across the aisle and alleviate partisan animosity during their respective terms.
“There are definitely ways to reach across the aisle, and Patrick [Musgrave] and I have talked about having a friendly relationship between our clubs,” Jha said. “That kind of message is something that Congress should hopefully espouse, but hasn’t been.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the the 113th congress has concluded, when in fact, it ends on January 3rd, 2015.

In response to federal funding cuts to research across the biomedical field, Georgetown University Medical Center created Partners in Research, a project that helps Georgetown researchers effectively crowdsource to raise funds for projects.
Partners in Research, founded in 2011 as a supplementary method to finance biomedical research, raised a total of $70,000 from 59 partners in 2013.
The program engages non-scientists of the Georgetown community to help raise money for research. To raise money GUMC scientists give short pitches to local residents in order to win donations for their projects. The Partners in Research Program is an initial step in the overall funding process that helps garner preliminary funds for projects by allowing researchers to gather data with the early funds. In turn, the data allows researchers to flesh out their project and continue their fundraising efforts.
“Initial funding allows [us to begin] to collect necessary preliminary data for future submission to governmental or non-profit organizations,” professor of pharmacology Juan Saavedra said. “This ‘start-up’ funding is essential for future success in grant submission.”
In order to qualify to hear scientists’ pitches, potential donors for the program are required to make a donation of at least $1000 to the GUMC. The donor is then able to review proposals by Georgetown scientists and vote for a top choice. The top two projects will each win a grant of $35,000. Donors also receive progress reports on the studies and tours of the labs.
“The partners will participate in guided visits to our laboratories, for a first-hand, on-the-job presentation of our work, the challenges we encounter and the progress we make with their support,” Saavedra said. “This is an extremely well organized program, with excellent administrative support from the GUMC.”
Projects that are presented to local residents have demonstrated unequivocal impact on the community.
“We choose a project that is readily digestible by a lay audience and has clear significance,” associate professor of pharmacology and physiology Gerard Ahern said.
“For scientists having to explain the nuts and bolts to lay people actually helps to clarify the important parts of a project. The relationship clearly benefits GUMC in terms of developing a philanthropy base.”
For researchers, the greatest impact is not monetary, but emotional and personal.
“The money has allowed us to continue a pilot project,” Ahern said. “But the fact that a bunch of people are following our research certainly adds to the excitement.”
The 2013 winners, Ahern and the team of Saavedra and David Burns, researched osteoporosis prevention and whether drugs used for treating diabetes can alleviate traumatic brain injuries, respectively.
Partners in Research grew out of Georgetown’s 2009 promotional campaign Doctors Speak Out, a series of educative quarterly luncheons in which university scientists held medical discussions. While the Doctors Speak Out campaign did not require those in attendance to make donations, attendees would often make contributions for a particular type of research discussed that day.
In 2011, the program garnered $75,000 from 63 partners; in 2012, 62 partners donated a total of $70,000.

The 15th annual Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life, which focused primarily on “Morality and the Law,” is the largest student-run anti-abortion conference in the country and brought a broad spectrum of academics and activists to Healy Hall this past Monday.
Named to honor the advocacy of Georgetown alumnus and Cardinal of New York John O’Connor (GRD ’70), the conference began in 2000 as a non-exclusive intellectual forum regarding the dignity of life and has since secured its esteem throughout the anti-abortion community.
The conference is sponsored by Georgetown University Right to Life, Catholic Daughters of America, the Knights of Columbus and University Faculty for Life.
While the event focused on the sanctity of life, each yearly conference presents a distinct perspective on anti-abortion advocacy. This year’s focus emphasized manifesting advocacy through the theme of “Morality and the Law.”
Conference co-directors Evelyn Flashner (COL ’15) and Kelly Thomas (SFS ’15) thought of the theme during the panel selection, which featured a discussion on “Publicly Pro-Life: Why Abortion Is Not a Private Issue.”
“We like to say that the theme was half planned, half luck,” Flashner said. “We try to listen to the other side of the debate to articulate a choice on what we want the theme of our conference to be … and we landed on the question of ‘Can you be privately pro-life?’”
Flashner described the conference keynote speaker Robert P. George, the McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence at Princeton University, as the “king of morality and law” for his academic and advocacy accolades.
McCormick’s address marked the culmination of the conference, with an analysis of the philosophy and morality behind medical professionals’ abortion license.
“I urge young people to blow the whistle on an abortive license as a medical and health issue. … [The license] reflects a concept of medicine found, structured and shaped by philosophical judgments. … It is not morally neutral,” George said.
Additionally, students were attracted to the event for reasons outside of their faith or Georgetown’s Catholic identity.
“The event appealed to me because of its distinctly intellectual foray into the world of pro-life,” Flashner said.
Thomas found the openness for discussion in the conference at the core of her involvement.
“I was thrust into the pro-life movement at a very young age as a joyful, happy event … and Cardinal O’Connor had the ability for bringing humanity back into issues. … The conference doesn’t just say to go out and defend life, but here is why,” Thomas said.
A large amount of student involvement, including 50 student volunteers, also attracted participants.
“I was shocked that we had a huge core of student volunteers. It is a response from students that I would never have expected to be there, I think because the event is not directly activist based,” Flashner said.
To publicize the event, Flashner and Thomas reached out to various thematic institutions and publications to advertise, and found traction with jesuit.org, nationalrighttolifenews.org and others.
“My responsibilities consisted of communicating with potential sponsors,” sponsorship coordinator Danielle Olney (COL ’16) said. “These organizations had the options of placing their literature into our registration packets or setting up a table to represent their organization on the day of the conference.”
The conference is typically held the weekend before the national March for Life, which marks the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. However, due to scheduling changes, this year’s event was held two days prior to the march. The organizers initially expected lower numbers compared to last year’s record attendance of around 700. However, publicity efforts resulted in an attendance of 650, including 150 Georgetown students.
Other attendees included delegations from anti-abortion communities at other universities, including a group from Marquette University upon which the Fr. Thomas King, S.J. Award was bestowed. The $1,000 prize, named for the former professor who founded University Faculty for Life in 1989, recognizes anti-abortion strides made by undergraduate groups.

A professor at Georgetown for 34 years, Adhip Chaudhuri was, in many senses, a lifelong student.
Chaudhuri, who retired last year, died Jan. 13 after a three-year battle with lung cancer. He was 62 years old.
While his field was economics, Chaudhuri’s currency was knowledge. It was a trait he inherited from his parents, a chemist and housewife, and one he would pass on to his two children, Maya (SFS ’13) and Neal (COL ’16).
Throughout his Georgetown career, Chaudhuri inspired students, friends and colleagues alike with his zeal for international economics and natural aptitude for making learning fun.
“He would always come home and tell us which class he liked better that day, the morning or afternoon section, based on how they responded to his jokes,” Maya said.
As children, Neal and Maya were often forced to memorize maps, countries and flags as well as plants — an interest Chaudhuri developed while following around the gardener at his boarding school in Kolkata, India.
“He was always slightly disappointed that my sister and I weren’t as obsessed with plants as he was,” Neal said. “I think part of it was the Latin names and part of it was the natural beauty.”
A Man for Others
Born in 1951 in Ghazipur, in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Chaudhuri was the youngest of four siblings. After graduating at the top of his class from St. Stephen’s College at Delhi University and then the Delhi School of Economics, Chaudhuri immigrated to the United States in 1972.
Chaudhuri spent his days as a doctoral candidate at Columbia University, applying the social justice philosophy of John Rawls to economics in his thesis. He also took time to absorb American culture, frequenting Tom’s Diner, which would later be featured on the television show “Seinfeld” and adopting the New York Giants and New York Yankees as his own teams.
Georgetown, where he started teaching in 1979, gave Chaudhuri the opportunity to apply his economic theories of social justice in a tangible manner.
Chaudhuri was the first economics professor to incorporate community based learning, allowing students in his “International Trade” class to work with the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor as a fourth credit option.
“At a lot of schools you really can’t bring things like justice or social welfare in the department. Georgetown allowed him to do that,” Maya said.
Clearly, Chaudhuri led by example. Maya, who was heavily involved with the Center for Social Justice during her time at Georgetown, is now working with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, while Neal is a leader with the university’s ESCAPE retreat program.
One of Chaudhuri’s proudest moments was when he had the opportunity to bring Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen to campus to be honored for incorporating ethics into his work.
“He didn’t always give off his social justice. You could tell he was passionate about it, but he didn’t shove it down your throat,” Neal said of his father.
Community in Diversity
Chaudhuri’s love of economics was not bound by the front gates. Through Georgetown, Chaudhuri had the opportunity to conduct research and lecture in Austria, Vietnam and Qatar. It was this final post, at the School of Foreign Service campus in Doha, that would be the most formative for the professor.
The same examples and jokes he used at Georgetown came out in even stronger force in the smaller, more intimate Doha setting.
Kim Fernandes (SFS-Q ’11), a student of Chaudhuri’s in Qatar, relished the opportunity to engage with the professor, whom she cited as part of her inspiration for pursuing graduate studies in education policy.
“He made so many jokes in class, God bless him,” Fernandes recalled. “He’s honestly just an excellent professor. It mattered so much that we were able to talk to him not just about class but things like our research interests as well.”
Chaudhuri was well-loved at the university, twice receiving SFS-Q’s teacher of the year award.
Cura Personalis
From memorizing box scores and baseball statistics for his favorite teams to spending hours solving crossword puzzles in The Washington Post — always in pen — Chaudhuri pursued all facets of his life with the same intellectual fervor that he brought to the classroom.
When not debating the benefits of the Ricardian model with students, Chaudhuri was a key player in a long-standing bridge club consisting of professors across the history and economics departments.
Joining the club soon after his arrival at Georgetown in 1979, Chaudhuri spent many a day first in the seminar room of Nevils where the economics department was then housed and later in Intercultural Center classrooms with members of the club, among whom he was noted for his incredible wit.
“He was so inventive among the types of jokes he would say. He would make analogies to sports games and would use metaphors like ‘touchdown’ or ‘getting on the scoreboard’ to describe the bridge game,” said David Goldfrank, director of the Medieval Studies program and longtime bridge club member.
Known as the “Wise Man of the East” among members, it was in this group that Chaudhuri would confide updates of his illness and find solace, joining in for the occasional bridge game until this past summer.
Chaudhuri also developed strong ties within the Jesuit community, where he found men who shared his curiosity for learning and passion for interfaith dialogue.
“He loved talking about religion, though he didn’t necessarily consider himself a Christian,” Maya said. “Georgetown priests are so invested in interreligious dialogue. It was something he wouldn’t have gotten at any other university.”
Though raised in the Hindu tradition, Chaudhuri grew close with several Jesuits, including Fr. James Walsh, S.J., Fr. Leo Lefebure, S.J., and Fr. James Reddington, S.J., the last of whom presided over Chaudhuri’s wedding in Dahlgren Chapel and the baptisms of Maya and Neal, whose mother, Margaret McBride, is Catholic.
A constant theme throughout Chaudhuri’s life was the sanctity of knowledge, teaching his children that it was unacceptable to leave a book on the floor. At the same time, knowledge also represented a source of fun.
Maya and Neal recalled Safeway trips extended by their father’s histories of the products on nearly every aisle and carpool rides, during which an afternoon snack was awarded only after the siblings and their friends could identify, in both English and Latin, at least three plants the car passed on its way home.
Chaudhuri is survived by his wife, Joanne Kinney Smyth, his children, Maya and Neal, his former wives McBride and Una Chaudhuri, and two siblings.
According to one Chaudhuri’s closest friends, Amit Shah, his passion for teaching never waned, even when cancer began to consume his life.
“Right until the very end when he couldn’t stand up to teach, he would say to me, ‘I have to sit down and do this,’ but he did it because he loved doing it,” Shah said. “He could’ve quit a while ago, but he loved having people respond to the concepts and issues in such a real way.”

Members of H*yas for Choice arrived in Healy Circle at 7:30 a.m. Monday with the intent of tabling throughout the day in protest of the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life. Yet within 18 minutes, they found themselves removed and relocated outside the front gates by the Department of Public Safety.
Besides objecting to the pro-life stance of the conference, the group wished to test the Georgetown University Free Speech Policy after assertions by administrators that the policy did not disallow free speech in places other than Red Square during last Thursday’s free speech forum.
After DPS arrived on the scene, members of H*yas for Choice attempted to show officers copies of the free speech policy to avoid relocation. However, DPS maintained that H*yas for Choice could not table in Healy Circle and asked them either to relocate to Red Square or outside the front gates of the university. Group members felt that this request represented unequal treatment, especially in light of September’s “One Georgetown, One Campus” protest, which took place in Healy Circle.
“We feel that DPS enforces the free speech expression policy completely unequally across groups, that when the [One Georgetown, One Campus] group mostly made up of GUSA students was protesting, they were in Healy circle with no reservation, no trouble and when we tried to be there, they kicked us out within 18 minutes. We feel that we are targeted because of our views and our status to the university,” H*yas for Choice President Laura Narefsky (COL ’14) said.
Chief of Police Jay Gruber described the protestors as compliant, but deferred further questions to the Office of Communications.
“We were alerted via a phone call that a group had set up a table at Healy Circle,” he wrote in an email. “The group was very amenable and followed the directions of the officers.”Although H*yas for Choice tabled in Healy Circle and not the designated free speech zone of Red Square, the nature of their tabling remained the same.
“We very specifically decided to take an action of non-violence, non-engagement, because it says in the free speech policy that you have a right to free speech as long as other people’s right to free speech is also recognized. We recognize [the conference participants’] right to free speech — all we wish is that they do the same for us,” H*yas for Choice Vice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) said.
After H*yas for Choice moved to the front gates,GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) advised members of the club to file a complaint with the university’s Free Speech and Expression Committee.
Students hope the appeal will help clarify the status of free speech on campus, especially in tandem with the release of a new free speech and expression policy promised by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson at last week’s forum.
“I hope that it clears up where students can and can’t table so that it really sets a precedent for incoming classes that the entire campus is a place wheredialogue and expression are encouraged, regardless of viewpoint,” GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff and Free Speech and Expression Committee member TaneArana-Humphries (SFS ’15) said.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said that the university will review the actions taken Monday.
“I understand H*yas for Choice has filed a complaint and that will be taken seriously. We are looking into the details of this to ensure our processes and policies to investigate such matters are followed,” Kerr wrote in an email.
H*yas for Choice hopes that a clarified policy would make free speech a less salient issue on campus.
“I don’t want this to become a real sticking point between student groups and the administration, but they are not enforcing the policy as it is written, they are not allowing for free and open exchange of ideas,”Narefsky said. “If that is one of the core values of the university, then they need to change their actions and they need to start respecting the rights of their students.”
