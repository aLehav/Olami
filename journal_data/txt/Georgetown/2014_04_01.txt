Just as the university wrapped up its first GAAP Weekend for students through accepted early action Sunday, 2,277 high school seniors began receiving word of their regular decision admission to the Class of 2018.
Out of 19,501 total applicants, 2,277 were accepted through regular decision. The overall admission rate in the combined early and regular decision cycles was 16.6 percent, slightly lower than last year’s 17 percent for the Class of 2017.
The McDonough School of Business was once again the most selective school with an acceptance rate of 16 percent, slightly higher than last year’s rate of 15.7 percent.
“There has been more growth in the MSB than other schools, and partly that is because of job opportunities,” Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) said. “The yield is pushing up towards 60 percent in the MSB. Perhaps the MSB pool is a little more self-selective and less dependent on financial aid, so people have the ability to say yes more easily.”
Georgetown College admitted 16.4 percent of applicants, slightly higher than 2013’s 16.3 percent acceptance rate. Both the School of Nursing and Health Studies and the Walsh School of Foreign Service admitted 17.5 percent of applicants, slightly lower than last year’s rate of 17.7 percent for the NHS and 18.7 percent for the SFS .
The number of first-generation college students leveled at 12 percent, the same as last year, a number which, according to Deacon, is consistent with national trends.
“Colleges are recruiting harder in that population to bring more equity, and there is a lot more attention given to it. Kids in first-generation backgrounds are beginning to believe they have that chance,” Deacon said. “We have some pretty good partnerships with scholarships and that helps us get students in the pool that might not otherwise apply to Georgetown.”
Additionally, the accepted class is 56 percent female, two points lower than the national average of 58 percent female.
California and New York were again the two most represented states in the admitted class, with 391 and 382 students, respectively. New Jersey had the next largest representation with 259 admitted students.
Although Georgetown admitted students from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and 64 countries, the percent of international students, at 8.5 percent, saw a nearly three-point decrease from last year’s pool. The majority of international applicants came from South Korea, China and the United Kingdom, respectively.
Deacon attributed this decrease in admitted international students to the total decrease in international applicants, down 10 percent from last year.
“We may have hit a ceiling, or at least a pause, in this growth of international applicants. It could be the law of averages catching up to us,” Deacon said. “Our staff is going to India in the next couple of weeks, and that we see as an area to grow more in terms of applicants.”
The acceptance rate for minority students increased 0.6 percent from last year’s record number of 39 percent to 39.6 percent. Within individual minority groups, there was a 4-point bump from 2013 in the number of accepted students who self-identified as Asian-American, from 13 to 17.3 percent. Ten percent of admitted students identified as African-American, a slight increase from last year’s accepted class of 9 percent, while almost 12 percent of accepted students identified as Hispanic, up slightly from 11 percent. At 7 percent, the rate of students identifying with multiple ethnicities remained the same as last year.
Georgetown still distinguishes itself from peer universities by remaining separate from the Common Application and requiring an alumni interview. According to Deacon, the separate application process results in fewer applicants every year and consequently a higher acceptance rate compared to peer institutions such as University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College and Emory University, which had admit rates of 12.3, 10.4 and 26.5 percent, respectively, according to their websites.
Accepted Georgetown student Sian Rigby praised the university’s separate, unique application.
“I enjoyed the personal ‘Georgetown touch’ apparent in the application. Georgetown has been my dream school since middle school, and I felt I could demonstrate that sentiment more effectively with the Georgetown application than I would have been able to through the Common App,” Rigby wrote.
According to Deacon, Georgetown offered 2,123 students spots on the waitlist this year and expects to accept around 50 waitlisted students in May after deposits have been sent for a target class size of no more than 1,580 students, in accordance with the 2010 Campus Plan Agreement’s cap of 6,675 undergraduates.
Over the next few weeks, the university will push to woo accepted students through alumni-sponsored receptions across the country and the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program events running throughout the month of April leading up to the May 1 decision date. Last year, 47.4 percent of accepted students in the Class of 2017 enrolled in Georgetown.
With one GAAP weekend already held, some prospective students already find themselves attached to the Hilltop.
“GAAP weekend was incredible. I already loved Georgetown, but GAAP weekend convinced me that extra little bit I needed that it would be worth it to fly all the way across the country to come here. It was the most well-organized, well-planned open house I’ve been to, and I enjoyed it thoroughly,” said Aislinn McNiece, an accepted senior from Lafayette, Calif.

The admissions rate by year graph is misleading and the accepted students by region graph is too small to be useful…

Hello – Will you be able to specify what is the percentage of international students accepted and how that affects the per race numbers?

none says 
April 2, 2014 at 6:20 pm
does The Hoya have access to average accepted SAT scores for this year?

Gtown says

Lol Penn and Dartmouth are not peers of Georgetown.

Small Mistake says 
August 4, 2014 at 12:03 pm
Those are the acceptance rates for Penn and Dartmouth’s classes of 2017. This year Penn’s acceptance rate was 9.9% and Dartmouth’s acceptance rate was 11.5%.

The School of Foreign Service pioneered the major of science, technology and international affairs, with one man, Charles Weiss, instrumental in the program’s development.
After shepherding over 700 students through the STIA program, Weiss will retire at the end of this school year, after a 17-year tenure as a distinguished professor and former STIA director.
To celebrate Weiss’ work and career, the university hosted an all-day retirement symposium last Friday.
 
Pioneering A Program
Weiss graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University with a bachelor’s in physics and chemistry and a doctorate in biochemistry and chemical physics.
After his time at Harvard, Weiss served as a science and technology adviser to the World Bank from 1971 to 1986. He also worked at a variety of universities, including Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California at Berkeley and Johns Hopkins University.
Scholarly publications include a co-authored book about revolutionizing energy technology, in addition to numerous works in academic journals and conferences.
For the past 17 years, Weiss has shaped the STIA program at Georgetown. According to Weiss, crafting the program involved a lot of hard work, preparation, and most of all, education.
“The STIA program is unique. I found that I’m not aware of another undergraduate program with the international focus and the breadth of coverage of STIA,” Weiss said. “In order to put this together, I had to learn a great deal. My experience was broad with the World Bank and other courses I had been teaching, but still I had never undertaken anything quite that broad.”
During his time developing the program, Weiss created the STIA gateway course, “Science & Technology in the Global Arena,” which he has taught since.
He also provided a strong foundation for the program to grow, according to colleague Timothy Beach, the current STIA director.
“Great people retire, and we need to have appropriate symbolism for these events for the institutional history to carry on and solidify around their creations and accomplishments,” Beach wrote in an email. “Chuck Weiss will be missed by all, but we worked to put in place truly exceptional new people who will build from his strong foundation.  This was also part of his accomplishment, namely to help develop a sustainable program that would keep the SFS and [Georgetown] strong.”
Robyn Liska (SFS ’08), a former student of Weiss and a STIA major, said that the professor was intrinsic to the success and legacy of the program.
“I think that the School of Foreign Service really owes a debt to him because he was pivotal to the creation of the STIA program such as it is today. … Without him to start it, I think the program would have looked very different,” Liska said. “Whether it would be here at all, I’m not sure. So I think that Georgetown was really lucky to have him and all of the generations of students that took his classes and learned from him will take his lessons forward.”
 
Building Bonds
In addition to developing the STIA program, Weiss fostered relationships with his students and challenged them to improve and grow. Kevin Meurer (SFS ’16) helped Weiss with research projects this year, and said that Weiss is both brilliant and friendly in a classroom setting.
“When you’re working with professor Weiss, you’re immediately conscious of his unique presence,” Meurer said. “He carefully listens to everything you say and oftentimes will point out things you’d never have thought of. You’re always conscious of his extensive experience and knowledge, yet he’s easy to talk to and quick to share a humorous story. In that way, he’s a great teacher.”
According to Liska, Weiss’ classes were extremely well developed and also very challenging.
“He was a great professor, one of definitely the most challenging I had during my time in the SFS,” Liska said. “The classes he created were the most comprehensive and integrated courses I have ever taken because they covered the breadth of science and technology and innovation and discovery all the way through application in 10 or 15 different fields.”
Through Weiss’ breadth of knowledge, students connected to the themes of the STIA curriculum.
“He somehow — I’m still not sure how to this day he did it — gave us the theoretical foundation of science and technology, of discovery and innovation and somehow connected themes through all of the different, diverse subjects,” Liska said.
 
Retirement Retrospective
In a speech at his retirement symposium, Weiss said that he is proud of the students that he has taught over the years.
“Next year we ‘old bulls’ will be gone and a wonderful new generation of young faculty will take over the STIA program that we have built,” Weiss said. “I thank our marvelous undergraduate students for educating me, for keeping me up to date and for sharing with me their vision of the future.”
Weiss’ experience in the field made him a resource to his colleagues and students. Beach said that his years with Weiss have taught him to think broadly and comprehensively.
“I have learned to question, dig deep, never settle for superficial answers in anything, to appreciate a broader field of science and technology then I had ever imagined: the importance of innovation, the private sector, the depth of the adjunct communities around GU, reinforcement of ethics and community involvement and many Yiddish phrases both apt and hilarious that will always leave eddies in the rivers of my memory,” Beach wrote.
Other than his role as a teacher, director and colleague, Weiss served as a role model for many students.
“Professor Weiss has given me a model to work toward,” Meurer said.“He has demonstrated that a strong, kind character and undeniable success are not mutually exclusive.  Every day, Dr. Weiss proves himself to be a great man, not just for his accomplishments, but also for his character.”
Weiss’ retirement symposium, hosted by the university, featured four round-table discussions with experts, who covered Weiss’ achievements at Georgetown.
Topics included science, technology and international affairs, global innovation policy and economic development, innovation and technology policy and energy, and health and environmental policy.
The event ended with a keynote speech by Robert Socolow, a Princeton University professor and colleague and friend of Weiss. Socolow spoke about his long history and friendship with Weiss as well as the importance of environmentalism for the future of the Earth.
According to Weiss, the symposium will remain one of his favorite memories from his time at Georgetown.
“The whole afternoon and evening were very stimulating and very gratifying,” Weiss said. “What was especially gratifying was the alumni panel that brought back graduates of the STIA program because they had understood what we had tried to do.”
Weiss especially enjoyed STIA alumni’s expressions of gratitude.
“Any time a student comes back and says, ‘What I, as a student, learned in your class, in your classes and in your program has given me direction and has given me insights that have been valuable and have helped me find myself and orient my life,’ then that’s what a professor lives for,” Weiss said. “That’s why you go into the profession. That’s what you’re trying to help people. You’re trying to educate and orient them.”
Since the program’s inception, STIA has graduated 700 to 800 alumni, all of whom Weiss guided over nearly the past two decades.
Weiss looks forward to spending more time with his family and pursuing academic goals throughout his retirement. He is currently in the process of drafting a book on innovation in legacy sectors.
“I have a couple of books I’m trying to finish,” Weiss said.“And it’s nice to see my grandchildren some. … I’ve got some hobbies I’d like to pursue, and I have some languages I want to learn. When I learn some Arabic, that will be fun.”

In the wake of adjunct unionization at The George Washington University in 2006, American University in 2010, and Georgetown University in 2012, union organizers with the Service Employees International Union are working toward the creation of a District-wide contract for unionized adjuncts that would be the first of its kind.
“There’s no city in America, no city in the world … that has had this approach toward their part-time faculty. To be blunt, we are pioneers,” adjunct professor of music at GWU and Vice President for Higher Education at SEIU Kip Lornell said.
Based in Maryland and Washington, D.C., SEIU represents over 2,400 adjunct faculty at area universities.
“It is a vision that we are beginning to implement, or a vision that we are beginning to strategize how to implement,” SEIU Director of Research and Strategic Planning Anne McLeer said.
With 70 percent of D.C.’s adjuncts already unionized with SEIU, and Howard University and the University of the District of Columbia in the process of unionization, Lornell was optimistic about the contract’s chances.
“I really think there’s a sense of inevitability, and the trend is very clear, that this is going to happen,” Lornell said.
Under a city-wide contract, adjuncts who teach at multiple universities within the city-wide union would be able to receive benefits from funds pooled by all of the institutions.
“For example, it may be that if you teach at three places, each school can put in some money for a retirement fund. It could be that the universities pool some of their money instead of Georgetown, GWU, AU putting some money into retirement, they put it into a pool, and you’d be employed under this contract and you could work and have benefits,” Lornell said.
The idea of a city-wide union is not a new one. The Justice for Janitors union, also part of the SEIU, serves as a similar model for such a contract that allows employees to work for multiple employers within the same industry.
“Those workers are similarly situated in a way to the adjunct who sort of pieces together full-time work from a number of part-time positions with different employers, yet get benefits from none of those employers,” McLeer said.
Adjuncts from all over the country met to discuss the possibility of a city-wide contract, as well as the future of unionization of D.C., for the second time last Monday at Georgetown. Georgetown’s adjunct professors unionized in May 2013 following an overwhelming vote in favor of unionization.
Along with the potential behind a city-wide contract, the adjuncts also discussed the challenges adjuncts face in terms of lack of benefits and job security, as well as obstacles to the unionization movement posed by university administration and the debate over the instructional quality of adjuncts compared to full-time professors.
“The reality is that adjuncts have Ph.D.s, the same qualifications as other professors, so it’s a matter of framing the debate about the institutional exploitation and low pay that they’re providing for people that do the same work,” Georgetown adjunct professor of theology Kerry Danner-McDonald said.
The irregular working hours of adjunct faculty can also pose problems for unionization since the schedule can prevent adjunct faculty from connecting with one another, McLeer said.
“The word ‘union’ means community and a collective people. It’s a challenge to create a union and create a sustained union, when there’s no preexisting community or very little preexisting community,” McLeer said.
Lornell also addressed the administrative blocks and backlash adjuncts receive when they inform their institutions that they are trying to unionize.
“Administration will say something like, ‘You don’t want this obtrusive union to interfere with your ability to negotiate with us directly. We think it’s a bad idea.’ Pretty much if I sat down, I could compose almost exactly the same kind of several paragraph press release that any university approached to unionize part-time faculty would send out,” Lornell said.
Danner-McDonald noted the hypocrisy of university administration’s reluctance to allow their adjuncts to unionize.
“I think the really critical issue is there’s this kind of hypocrisy within the institutions themselves. The institution is saying that critical thinking, higher education, is an important value in, not only the personal growth, but the professional development of a student, but then not in turn valuing those people who have hit the highest level of achievement in their discipline by earning these advanced degrees and being committed to teaching. So that’s, I think, the key issue, is holding the institutions accountable for the values they say they proclaim,” Danner-McDonald said.
Lornell, however, praised the Georgetown’s administration’s cooperation with its adjunct union.
“Best I can tell from being there myself and from talking to part-time faculty at Georgetown and other organizers, the Georgetown administration was objective, hands off and stayed out of this whole issue entirely,” Lornell said.
Lornell predicted that adjuncts could see the enactment of a city-wide contract within the next several years.
“I think that this may well be the last individual contract that we negotiate with GWU,” Lornell said of the renegotiation of GWU’s unionization contract this July.
Adjuncts will meet to discuss the future of unionization for a third time at the end of April.

The Alternative Spring Break border awareness program aimed to generate discussion on immigration issues after two ASB groups returned from the 1,951-mile Mexican border over spring break by constructing an ad hoc border fence in Red Square Mar.ch 28.
The wood and plastic fence, manned by ASB members, was built primarily as a visual catalyst for a conversation on illegal immigrant deportation issues in the United States and was adorned with the sign “A House Divided Will Not Stand.”
“A key thing behind that [saying] was knowing our relationship with Mexicans and those who are trying to cross the border and migrants — and knowing that we’re really all together — and we look for ways to separate ourselves and think of ourselves as distinct, when in our history we are a nation of migrants,” ASB El Paso Trip Coordinator Phil Rogers (MSB ’14) said.
Rogers’ claims that the border fence’s presence strongly affects the cultural and economic links between border towns such as El Paso, TX and Ciudad Juarez in Mexico.
“[By building the fence in Red Square] we wanted to create a little annoyance for people so that they would engage with us and they would see how it kind of really tore apart border communities,” Rogers said. “Juarez and El Paso and other places are very much intertwined, and having that fence there has really impeded economic flow.”
Arizona ASB Trip Coordinator Kendra Layton (COL ’15) agreed.
“The border wall is not only a physical boundary, but emotional, spiritual and intellectual. It acts as a powerful symbol that divides communities, nations and people, rather than uniting them in their shared humanity,” Layton wrote in an email.
Trip coordinators hope that ASB attendees were left with a strong desire to encourage and participate in deportation advocacy.
“There’s a push to have post-trip activities, and ASB calls it ‘Bringing it Back Home.’ They look to not only have ASB be a one-week thing, but to make it a meaningful thing where you take what you’ve seen and learned and apply that to your life and bring that to other people as well,” Rogers said.
The ASB leaders who met with members of these migrant communities see the current national dialogue, which focuses on national security and protecting American jobs, as unrelated to the heart of the issue.
“The national dialogue is so irrelevant to what is actually going on, on the ground. The debate in Congress is ‘We won’t do anything until we secure our borders immediately,’” ASB El Paso Trip Coordinator Sophia Sepp (SFS ’14) said. “It’s already so militarized that El Paso is the safest city in the U.S. even though it borders Juarez, which was recently [recognized as] the murder capital of the world. So obviously there is a disconnect there.”
The ASB groups’ project ties into an upcoming march, “Two Million Too Many,” advocating a halt to deportations, which have reached their peak under the administration of President Barack Obama.
The April 5 march and rally, which begins in Lamont Park and culminates at Lafayette Park, is an attempt to pressure the U.S. government, as well as Obama, to overcome the stagnation of the immigration debate by addressing deportation with executive action.
“There are different executive actions that Obama can take that he doesn’t need Congress’ approval for that could remedy the situation,” Sepp said.
Another option is to stop the agreement between local law enforcement and Immigration Customs and Enforcement officials to identify and deport undocumented people.
The Georgetown University Immigration Coalition plans to play a role in the upcoming march as well and reaffirms the idea that stopping deportation is the first step, as announced in a press release.
Sepp hopes that addressing this highly politicized issue by experiencing it firsthand provided a valuable, fresh viewpoint.
“I think we try to really bring home the human dimension of it. We live in solidarity with the people down in El Paso and learn about their personal stories,” Sepp said.

As voters take to the polls today to choose the Democratic nominee for mayor, they will decide between an embattled incumbent fighting for his political career and an upstart Washington, D.C. councilmember determined to portray herself as the person to turn the page on the District’s longstanding tradition of political corruption.
According to a poll published March 21 by Washington City Paper, Mayor Vincent Gray and Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) are head-to-head — each with 27 percent of the vote.
Bowser, a close ally of Gray’s predecessor Adrian Fenty, has adopted the mantle of a youthful, energetic campaign to contrast Gray’s more veteran political style.
“We know that the residents of this city want a fresh start in the mayor’s office. We know that they’re impressed with our vision and energy in terms of getting the city onto the next level,” Bowser said during the televised mayoral debate March 26. “Nobody is gaining steam like we are. We’re very well positioned for a big win on April 1.”
Gray, who has been accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions during his 2010 mayoral campaign, has seen his numbers hold steady — around 30 percent of the Democratic vote in the most recent public polls.
Both candidates have strengthened their campaign finances in the week leading up to the election. According to reports from the D.C. Office of Campaign Finance, Bowser’s campaign has taken in $63,500 in new donations since Monday, including significant donations from local companies Blue Sky Development and McCullough Residential and local developer Chris Donatelli. Gray’s campaign, too, has taken in upwards of $5,000 in donations this past week, the majority of which came from members of Gray’s own cabinet.
Amid criticism of his 2010 finances, Gray has been quick to showcase his administration’s successes regarding fiscal stability and education reform. Since authoring a bill expanding access to public schools six years ago, Gray has seen Washington, D.C. take the lead in the proportion of preschoolers enrolled in public pre-kindergarten.
Meanwhile, Gray has depicted his challengers as people who simply want his job — nothing more.
“The two of them,” Gray said at the March 26 debate, referring to challengers Bowser and Councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6). “Have a vested interest in trying to present a case that what had been alleged is correct. Ms. Bowser wants my job; Mr. Wells wants my job. That’s it.”
Despite the mayor’s protests, the benefits of being “anybody but Gray” have paid dividends for Bowser, who, until mid-February, had been mired in a field of challengers that included three of her colleagues on the Washington, D.C. Council: Wells, Councilmember Vincent Orange (D-At Large) and Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2).
Wells and Evans are the only other candidates who have been able to maintain significant levels of support among the Democratic electorate. The same Washington City Paper poll put Wells’ support at 9 percent and Evans’ at 13 percent, which could have a critical effect on the vote.
For Gray, the thought of an intensely competitive Democratic primary in his re-election bid would have been laughable following his defeat of Fenty in the 2010 primary — 53 percent to 46 percent. However, the scandal surrounding Gray and businessman Jeffrey Thompson, who pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws, has put Gray on the defensive. He has therefore been unable to highlight his administration’s successes, including a decrease in unemployment and continued education reforms.
Gray is serious enough about his perceived challenger that he has enlisted the help of a controversial political figure: Councilmember Marion Barry (D-Ward 8), who was arrested in 1990 and spent six months in jail for cocaine possession.
Barry is still immensely popular among the District’s black population — especially in Ward 8, where Gray achieved huge margins over Fenty in the 2010 primary election.
When he endorsed Gray during a press conference, Barry was not shy about expressing his views on the voting habits of the District’s white population.
“I think it’s up to white people to be more open minded,” Barry said. “Blacks are more open-minded than they are. Simple as that.”
The victor, whoever it will be, will face a significant challenger come November — a rarity in a city where Democratic dominance has gone without a real challenge since the District was first able to elect its own mayor in 1974.
Councilmember David Catania (I-At Large) (SFS ’90, LAW ’94) — a white, gay, Republican-turned-independent candidate — announced his candidacy just two days after Thompson’s guilty plea. Catania is well known in a city that has seen significant demographic shifts in recent years; a younger population coupled with a shrinking black share of the vote could favor Catania, whose main focus has been education reform.
“I would be delighted to put my record against any of those who currently have Democrat by their name, as it relates to Democratic values,” Catania told reporters after filing his candidacy with the D.C. Board of Election March 14. “Labels are fine, but I think the people are looking for a leader who has actually delivered.”
The D.C. Board of Elections is offering various services aimed at increasing voter turnout, including a mobile app designed to help local voters find directions to polling places, register to vote and view the candidate list. Registration is also offered at all polling places, according to the BOE’s website.
For voters in Georgetown’s Precinct 6, including the Burleith-Hillandale neighborhood, voting will take place at Duke Ellington School of the Arts, 3500 R St. NW; polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Same-day registration will be accepted with appropriate identification.

In a packed courtroom Monday, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Chief Justice Richard Roberts ordered that Daniel Milzman (COL ’16), who was arrested after making ricin in his McCarthy Hall dorm room March 18, remain in D.C. jail pending trial.
Roberts’ ruling, that Milzman be detained and placed under “rigorous suicide watch,” overturned Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola’s ruling last week that Milzman be released into his parents’ care to pursue psychiatric treatment for two weeks at Sibley Memorial Hospital pending trial. Facciola’s ruling came before Roberts after an appeal by the U.S. government, which is prosecuting the case.
According to the judge, the nature and circumstances of the event suggested that Milzman, who is charged with possession of a biological toxin, be detained. The judge elucidated three possibilities for Milzman’s use of the ricin he produced: an act of suicide, use on another person or use on multiple targets.
Milzman’s attorney, Danny Onorato, had argued that Milzman produced the ricin for the sole purpose of committing suicide without his parents’ knowledge, as ricin mimics flu-like symptoms when it causes death. Onorato also cited Milzman’s lack of a prior criminal history and his record at Georgetown, as well as Milzman’s parents’ status as doctors, in his defense.
Roberts acknowledged that Milzman’s history and character did not weigh in favor of detention. However, he cited other factors in the case as shaping his decision to mandate detention.
One of these factors was threatening Facebook messages Milzman sent to another undergraduate in January, which Assistant U.S. Attorney Maia Miller read in court in front of both Facciola and Roberts. Onorato emphasized that the messages were part of a larger exchange between the two students that had since been settled.
Roberts also referenced the prosecution’s point that Milzman’s varied claims as to when he produced the ricin hurt his credibility, providing different time frames for the residential assistant and law enforcement officers, respectively.
Roberts also expressed concern about the quantity of ricin produced, which he said “could have killed someone ingesting it.” Law enforcement seized 123 milligrams of a white powdery substance March 18, within which the concentration of ricin was 7.7 micrograms per milligram.
Based on these factors, Roberts concluded there was probable cause that Milzman could pose a danger to others. Milzman’s defense rested on the argument that since he intended to commit suicide with the ricin, he was only a threat to himself and not to others, permitting his release to treatment and his parents’ care.
Abbe Smith, director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Program at the Georgetown University Law Center, disagreed with Roberts’ order.
“It seems to me to be motivated by punishment and not necessarily by the kind of criteria that are supposed to be considered for detention versus release. It’s punitive based on the nature of the charge,” Smith said. “He’s a sophomore in college, he’s a kid. We are too quick in this country to put people in jail. It shows a lack of imagination and compassion to think that jail is the only appropriate place for this particular young man.”
Joe Laposata (COL ’16), an acquaintance of Milzman, expressed continued shock at the way in which the events of the past few weeks have unfolded.
“For those of us who knew him here, the whole ordeal is so shocking that individual events just feel less shocking. I don’t know how to react to an appeal decision that’s changed. At this point, it’s still completely out of the blue,” Laposata said.
The hearing, which was attended by over 90 people, including several Georgetown students, staff and colleagues of Milzman’s father, Dave Milzman, who is research director in the Department of Emergency Medicine at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, lasted approximately 20 minutes.
Will Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office, said in an email that the office had no comment beyond what was stated in court and that the investigation will continue pending further court proceedings.
Milzman’s lawyer, Danny Onorato, did not respond to requests for comment.

As the mercurial weather continues to make fools of the greater Georgetown community, the designated fools of Georgetown — those groups dedicated to the art of humor and the science of the laugh — are intent on increasing levity’s on-campus presence.
During the Georgetown Improv Association’s first open practice last Saturday, a dozen students filled the Village C Practice Room to play a few warm-up games that focused on quick thinking rather than intentional humor. After these initial drills, the attendees broke off into groups for their first skit — a comical portrayal of an advertising team pitching marketing strategies during a boardroom meeting.
The Georgetown Improv Association plans to hold tryouts and open practices once a month in order to create more opportunities for students to take part in skits and comedy programs on campus.
“Part of the hope of starting to offer open practices … is that we’ll kind of get a bunch of funny people at Georgetown in the same room and maybe something else will take off,” Georgetown Improv Association Executive Producer Emlyn Crenshaw (COL ’15) said. “It’s sad that Georgetown doesn’t have more outlets for people who want to be funny or want to joke around because there’s certainly plenty of funny people.”
Few organized student groups at Georgetown focus on humor. Besides the nine-member Improv Association, an online comedy magazine called the Georgetown Heckler is the only comedy-based student group on campus. The Heckler publishes satirical articles about campus and national news; it has just five regular contributors.
Although student participation in comedy groups is limited, student interest is high. Last semester, over 50 students auditioned for four spots in the Improv Association.
“We had this wide array of really hilarious people, and we had to say no to most of them and it was kind of heartbreaking,” Crenshaw said.
According to Crenshaw, students have expressed interest in creating an offshoot comedy sketch group, in which students would pre-write skits that they would later perform, but such a group has yet to be developed.
The Heckler has expanded its outreach in order to attract new writers and increased readership. Since taking control of the magazine at the start of last year, current Editor-in-Chief Henry Thaler (COL ’14) has recruited new writers and begun to publish articles to the website more frequently.
“People have heard that The Heckler existed, they’ve wanted to send funny articles. So if they wanted to, I just said, ‘Sure, come aboard,’” Thaler said.
Joe Luther (COL ’16), a member of the Improv Association and a writer for The Heckler, plans to continue this expansion when he takes over as editor-in-chief next semester. Luther said that he hopes to continue to attract readers using The Heckler’s Twitter account. He also plans to recruit incoming freshmen to write online content.
“I think that there’s a really great, receptive audience here, and I think people really like comedy and laughter stuff and we just need to find ways to get it to them,” Luther said.
For many students involved with comedy on campus, Georgetown’s professional and politically oriented atmosphere serves as an inspiration for humor.
“Georgetown has tropes that you can poke at occasionally, like fun stereotypes, whether it’s that it’s politically oriented or preppy or student-run or career-focused,” Thaler said.
The Heckler used last month’s Georgetown University Student Association presidential campaign to fuel a revival of its Twitter feed. After satirically live-tweeting the presidential debate, The Heckler’s Twitter account gained nearly 300 followers. Currently, the account has over 440 followers.
“If you take everything from the right angle, you can make fun of anything,” Luther said. “Things like that are pretty right for satire, especially because people are so honed into them here and so into them. The more you are interested in something, the more you care about it, the easier it is to laugh at it.”
For student comedy groups, Georgetown’s reputation for professionalism has done more than serve as the butt of self-deprecating jokes.
Georgetown Teaching Faculty of Management Rebecca Heino invited members of the Improv Association to share tips and strategies about improvisation with a business class earlier this semester.
“She had us come into her class and teach some improv games to her class in order to get them more comfortable with being in front of people, public speaking, being aware of their surroundings — things that are really important when you’re in a career that is based on your interactions with people, like business,” Improv Association member Thomas Moakley (SFS ’17) said.
Despite the limited range of opportunities for students to participate in humor-related activities on campus, many Georgetown alumni have made their careers out of comedy. Nick Kroll (COL ’01), who stars in the FX sitcom “The League,” as well as in his own Comedy Central sketch show “The Kroll Show,” John Mulaney (COL ’04), who works as a standup comedian and a writer for “Saturday Night Live” and Mike Birbiglia (COL ’00), who performs standup comedy and has written and produced two humorous off-Broadway one-man shows, are some of the more well-known comedic performers to emerge from the on-campus humor scene.
“We have a weird number of really funny people, which is weird because Georgetown isn’t known as being a place where you go if you want to be a standup comedian,” Crenshaw said.

This fall New Student Orientation will include a new mandatory training on campus sexual assault called “I Am Ready.” The program is the first of its kind to engage freshmen on the issue and inform them about on-campus resources for sexual assault and misconduct.
Over the last year, students and administrators worked to implement new programming and policies regarding sexual assault. This year freshmen were offered the opportunity to attend “What’s A Hoya?” workshops in which sexual assault statistics and resources served as a primary focus. Other on-campus measures included the addition of an alcohol amnesty clause into the Code of Student Conduct. The clause ensures that students’ alcohol use, if underage, will not be used against them if sexually assaulted.
Outgoing Deputy Chief of Staff in GUSA and member of the Sexual Assault Working Group Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14) conducted a campus-wide survey this semester as part of her thesis research. She found that only 30 percent of students, in a survey of over 200, attended on-campus programming on sexual assault.
“The data shows that there is a very low level of knowledge about the Code of Conduct, visiting the new website and mandatory reporting procedure,” Peterson said. “People do know where to access services, which is a really good sign because [Sexual Assault and Health Issues Coordinator] Jen Schweer is more than qualified to point them in the right direction.”
The “I Am Ready” program at NSO aims to create a culture on Georgetown’s campus that focuses on the needs of survivors. In doing so, trained students can become facilitators who will be able to speak on the issue and empower students not to be bystanders in a situation involving sexual assault. The program will include educational theater, facilitated discussions and an interactive activity called “Recognize” to help raise awareness of the issue.
“We hope that students feel engaged with the issue beyond the requisite online training — that they feel empowered to access resources, that they feel engaged in the prevention work that is being done surrounding this issue and that they can draw on Georgetown values to be active bystanders throughout their college careers,” Health Communications Specialist Meera Seshadri wrote in an email.
Some students believe the addition to NSO will help to prepare incoming freshmen for situations such as sexual assault with which they previously have had no encounters.
“I think it’s a good way for students to start at Georgetown — it’s definitely a different culture for kids, and the transition is where you want to teach them some things that could happen at college they might not expect,” Drew DiPrinzio (MSB ’17) said. “I know during my first weekend, during the first month for homecoming, it was a problem, sexual assault was an issue. I think if kids had been better informed they would have had an idea of what to do in that situation.”
Many students see the addition of the sexual assault awareness and education workshop as a necessity.
“I think it’s absolutely a necessary addition. I would say for me it’s less about whether I felt it was personally lacking and about more if you look generally at the situations that college freshmen are encountering,” Cody Reid-Dodick (COL ’17) said. “Whether people believe it’s an issue at Georgetown or not — even if there’s that question of whether it’s an issue — it’s something that should be educated on, and especially because it’s such a high-stakes issue and it’s something of such importance.”
However, the effectiveness of the program ultimately depends on student reception.
“I think it’s very hard to make something like this effective if you don’t have an absolute itinerary. Things like educational theater: I’m not completely sure if that is effective with me. It depends on the person, but I think highlighting how serious this can be in college and specific actions we can take is a way of making it effective, and it could be very effective,” DiPrinzio said.
The program’s focus on the needs of victims and the education of bystanders provides education on preventing and reporting sexual assault.
“I think that [the possible role of alcohol] places a supreme importance on bystanders, whether they’re intoxicated or not, but that becomes a huge source of protection for people to see a situation that maybe the victim would have no say in, but some bystanders could actually prevent it or at least play a role in reporting it and following up on it,” Reid-Dodick said.
While the university improved sexual assault programming on campus, Peterson believes there is more to be done to make sure the message of “I Am Ready” expands beyond its first iteration.
“Research has found that if you do bystander intervention in the fall and you don’t repeat it in the spring, then the effects go away,” Peterson said. “There needs to be where you engage all the freshmen. … There needs to be a way to touch base, practice skills, address the resources again just to solidify that information.”

Prompted by wide student support, university officials are considering implementing a new Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle bus stop from Capitol Hill to the Georgetown University Law Center.
Anebi Adoga (COL ’16) submitted a proposal calling for the additional stop on IdeaScale, an online forum that facilitates campus-wide communication, in November. The proposal currently has 551 votes on the IdeaScale platform, Georgetown Roundtables, and is the third-highest ranked item on the site.
“Georgetown should expand GUTS to provide direct means of transportation for the university community to Capitol Hill and the National Mall. Such an expansion is feasible and will carry tremendous benefits for the entire university community,” Adoga wrote in the proposal.
The Georgetown University Student Association will distribute a survey gauging student interest and need for potentially adding or altering GUTS routes in the coming weeks.
“The survey’s results will be carefully reviewed with the understanding that it is a snapshot of when and where students intern, which clearly changes from semester to semester,” Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said.
University administrators have to collaborate with various stakeholders before making a decision about the GUTS stops.
“Without regard to the current status of the initiative that Adoga is working on, the factors we would consider to change a GUTS route are numerous,” Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said. “Other considerations would be in coordination with the Georgetown Community Partnership, and impacts to the overall effectiveness of the GUTS system.”
Cost factors may also affect the implementation of the new stop.
“Evaluations of the costs and logistical questions relating to adding stops to GUTS bus routes are made within the Facilities team and the Office of Transportation Management.  I can’t speak to everything that goes into that process, but there are definitely logistical questions as well as cost factors,” Fleming said.
If administrators decide in favor of the Capitol Hill stop, it would likely be implemented at the start of the 2014-2015 school year.
“If a decision were to be made in the positive I think this is reasonable and possible to do this by the fall,” Morey said.
The proposed congressional stop would take the House of Representatives exit from the freeway instead of the Senate, adding about two or three minutes to the trip time of the Law Center bus route, which currently takes about 15 minutes.
Adoga has met with Office of Transportation Management Director Diann Nock Smith and Fleming to discuss his proposal. Adoga’s initial idea, which called for GUTS stops at the National Mall and the Senate in addition to the stop at the House of Representatives, was met with disapproval by the administration.
Administrators have noted that due to the Senate’s proximity to the Law Center, a separate stop may be unnecessary.
“I personally park at the Law Center where there already is a stop and walk to the Senate office buildings regularly. Students interning on the Senate side need to think about the Law Center stop as very accessible to their internships,” Fleming said.
Adding multiple stops would also increase costs. The OTM spent $35,000 to implement a weekend late-night shuttle bus to Dupont Circle and Adams Morgan last year.
A GUTS stop at the House of Representatives would ensure lower costs, compared to a National Mall stop.
“Cost is always a factor and to the extent such a change would add little or no cost, I would certainly say that is a positive consideration,” Morey said.
After speaking with administrators, Adoga has shifted his focus to creating the stop at Capitol Hill, although he hopes that the other stops will be considered in the future.
“Right now the priority is a stop in front of the House. Also, the House stop is the cheapest part of the plan. … Hopefully a lot more people would ride the Law Center shuttle to their congressional and Senate internships,” Adoga said.

The Drone Awareness Project, a series of events held by Georgetown University Amnesty International and the Georgetown School of Foreign Service’s Asian Studies Program, which focused on the ethical issues surrounding drone usage, concluded with a lecture and discussion entitled “Drone Dialogues: A Conversation with Ambassador Mark Lagon” on Tuesday.
Lagon is the current Global Politics and Security Chair at Georgetown University’s Masters of Science in Foreign Service program, and had previously directed the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at the U.S. Department of State.
Lagon spoke in a small Intercultural Center conference room filled with Georgetown students, Asian Studies faculty and State Department officials interested in the ethical questions of U.S. drone use in Asia.
After offering an academic framework of war theory, Logan delved into the ethics of drone deployment. Main topics included the decision-making process behind U.S. drone strikes, the goal of strikes, the dehumanizing effects of drones on the battlefield, national and international legal implications of drone use, issues of transparency and the loss of civilian life.
Lagon repeatedly asked, “Is this a question of ethics, law or politics?” The answer to this question fluctuated as participants of different backgrounds entered the discussion.
A member of the State Department brought up the political question of drones’ possible violation of national sovereignty, especially in the case of American targeting of terrorists in Pakistan.
“Pakistanis want us to use these drones, and some of those who are being targeted are courtesy killings; they’re not people who are high priorities in the United States counterterrorism policy, but in fact, high priorities for Pakistanis. It’s probably unfair to flatly say the United States is willfully violating sovereignty,” Lagon said.
Georgetown Law student Naresh Lall (LAW ’15) focused on the legality of drones in international humanitarian law and the questionable compliance of U.S. signature strikes with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Lagon’s question of reality versus perception also became a focal point of discussion.
“If it’s different from the reality, [is] a perception of drones something that is harmful to a so-called winning of hearts and minds?” Lagon said. “In short, are you creating more terrorists than you’re eliminating? … Are we squandering soft power in the United States because of problems of perception?”
MSFS Assistant Director of External Outreach Hartwig Zakin (MSFS ’07) addressed domestic public perception of American drone use and apathy about the drone issue in the United States in the wake of the war in Iraq.
“We don’t seem to have this conversation at all on the homefront. You have perception externally on the use of drones buzzing overhead in foreign countries, but why are we not talking about drone usage [here]?” Zakin said.
As the Drone Awareness Project draws to a close, the conversation has broadened. Still, questions of public perception remain at the fore of this non-transparent policy.
“It is the responsibility of citizens to ask about how their country uses force. And if you don’t declare war and if you don’t put boots on the ground, then you don’t have troops in theater, then it is easier to avoid public condemnation and criticism,” Lagon said.

“Living Precariously: Stories from Our Community,” a panel discussion involving Georgetown University students, staff and faculty speaking about their experiences working in situations without financial stability or security in their jobs, took place Monday night in Copley Formal Lounge.
Tarshea Smith, a former cashier at Leo O’Donovan Hall, described the problems workers at O’Donovan Hall face, which led to her efforts to unionize the dining hall workers. Smith focused on a certain coworker named Miss Kathy who experienced workplace injustices.
“She [Miss Kathy] works on the salad bar, and she’s a black woman, a woman that had been working in the cafeteria probably for 32 years,” Smith said. “A manager called her a black b- – – -. And the workers, a couple of the workers heard him say it. But they were afraid to say anything, because they didn’t want to lose their jobs.”
Smith, who now works at Unite Here to support workers who face problems in the workplace, also reported how one day she had a seizure before a Leo’s shift. Because she failed to notify her manager two hours in advance, protocol dictated she be written up for the incident.
“I started explaining more and more, and [the manager] was like, ‘Tarshea, this is the policy. We don’t fire workers, they fire themselves,” Smith said.
Smith worked clandestinely with the help of Georgetown students to create a forum to address the workplace grievances of Georgetown staff. After Smith announced her plans to unionize the workers, in just two days’ time, over 95 percent of the 150 Leo’s workers unionized, and President John J. DeGioia wrote a letter to Aramark, their employer, to prevent the company from firing workers due to their new unionized status.
“My story is like so many other stories, so many other workers across the city are going through the same violations,” Smith said. “The only way workers can fight back is through organizing and unionizing.”
The crowd of about 30 students and faculty listened as Smith recounted these incidents and others at the event, organized by the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor as part of “Living in a Precarious World,” a Lannan Spring Literary Symposium and Festival focused on socioeconomic inequality, as explored through journalism, lectures and the arts.
“I knew Tarshea when I was a student here,” Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), a Kalmanovitz administrator, said. “I worked with her to organize the dining service workers at Leo’s. I think she’s such a wonderful storyteller.”
Nikki Lewis, a Washington native who has experienced similar precarious working conditions, talked about her experience growing up in the restaurant business.
“I, like many other young people, just started working in an environment where I didn’t know what my rights were,” Lewis said. “And I just kind of got acclimated to the poor working conditions, the $2.13 or $0.77 [hourly wage], with no benefits, the verbal abuse, the regular sexual harassment. I thought that’s just how things were.”
Lewis also described how working 60 to 70 hours per week in three jobs with no benefits led to her alcoholism and drug use for three years of her life.
“The stories were very powerful, very real. You could see, you can see the people, the individuals… you can see how real it was for them,” Sidney Wells (COL ’16) said. “I think I heard recently about the union movement, but I didn’t know how much was fought, how long it took … I’m also friends with a lot of the workers there. Hearing that stuff here at Georgetown, at Leo’s where I eat every day: it hits home.”
The panel’s final member was Ori Soltes, author of 15 books and an adjunct professor in Georgetown’s theology department. Soltes discussed his own precarious working experience as an adjunct, taking care to delineate between his struggles and those of the other panelists. Instead, Soltes focused on his disadvantages in the workplace when a full-time spot opened up in the theology department.
“The guy they ended up hiring was a:of course, much younger than I, b: [he had written] one book, that’s it and c: actually not properly speaking in the field [of theology], but the chairman knew that I would stick around. [They] knew that I wasn’t leaving.”
The event concluded with a look back to the beginnings of labor, and how the landscape has changed in recent years.
“What I seem to be seeing around me is the diminishing of, shall I call it, the values of democracy … where one of those values is: if you’re willing to work, you can make it,” Soltes said.

The second annual Georgetown University Undergraduate Research Symposium, which will feature a range of undergraduate research projects across all disciplines and stress the varied nature of research, will be held Friday and Saturday April 4 and 5 in Healy Hall, Riggs Library, Copley Formal and the Intercultural Center.
The GUURS steering committee aims to emphasize how research applies to a variety of fields.
“The main purpose for the symposium was to show a reflection of how varied research can be. We saw there was a common misconception that a lot of underclassmen have that research is limited to science students mostly, so we really wanted to showcase research in all four major areas,” Co-Chair Chandani Desai (COL ’15) said.
Due to these efforts, research areas include social sciences, creative arts and natural sciences.
“We picked them based on a lot of different things. We realized that because this is for a bigger audience, we wanted their work to be more accessible, not something very technical or scientific or very specific to a certain field, something that can be understood by a general audience and something that would be interesting to a general audience,” Desai said.
The students presenting also vary greatly, with one presentation group travelling all the way from the Georgetown School of Foreign Service in Qatar to present. Presenters additionally range across all years and schools.
Compared to last year’s 70 presentation submissions, GUURS doubled in size.
“Undergraduates are realizing this is a really great forum for their research. They are more interested in research just seeing the variety of panels,” Long-Term Development Director Trishla Jain (SFS ’15) said.
The symposium itself will be broken up into three different types of presentations. Poster presentations will give students an opportunity to receive criticism and explain their research, whereas panel presentations will require students to prepare a 10 to 15-minute presentation on their research and participate in an interdisciplinary discussion on a general theme with other presenters moderated by a faculty member with expertise in the area. Student keynotes will additionally allow students to present their topic.
“With the panels, we more delineated them by an academic frame that we picked,” Jain said. “But for the posters, that’s more just to get feedback on their research from different professors, for people to get exposed to it, for undergraduates to see what other undergraduates are undertaking at Georgetown,” Jain said.
Along with the physical expansion of the event, GUURS received support from multiple organizations, as the Georgetown University Student Association and the Office of the Provost will co-host the event. The Mortara Center, the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship and various academic departments will also provide event support.
This will be the second year GUSA co-hosts the event.
This year GUSA helped support through funding and marketing the event. CNDLS additionally helped market, as they printed all marketing material for the event. The Mortara Center provided the gift sets for all attendees and presenters, which will consist of a mug this year.
The interdisciplinary nature of the event as a whole emphasizes the ability of research to apply to all fields, as well as Georgetown’s liberal arts education.
“Interdisciplinary focus is crucial, it’s one of the unique things that Georgetown as a Jesuit school can really promote among students, and it really helps you, as a transition into the real world, because everything is interdisciplinary,” former GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said. “Having the interdisciplinary focus, I think, helps students stretch their interests and maybe think of doing things they haven’t done before, and in my mind that’s really what Jesuit education is about, making connections and taking the holistic approach.”
Along with the expansion of GUURS, event coordinators created a blog to further market the event and feature presenters.
“We tried to show both faculty spotlights and student spotlights through the blog so everyone can get an understanding of what the research culture is like at Georgetown because it’s not a very big part that’s highlighted and showcased,” Desai said.
Georgetown’s growth in the area of research overall proves to be a very positive trend as the field continues to grow globally.
“Undergraduate research at Georgetown could be a much more integral part of the student experience, and I think you’re going to see that continue to grow if students see different opportunities,” Tisa said. “It’s a very positive thing for Georgetown, it’s a very positive thing for Georgetown students.”
