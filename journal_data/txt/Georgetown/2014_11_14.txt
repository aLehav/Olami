The university is no longer considering a consolidation of the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, LGBTQ Resource Center and Women’s Center after overwhelmingly negative student feedback, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said during a town mall meeting Tuesday.
“I want to be clear, we will do this with great respect for the traditions, the history, the distinctive roles that each of those centers play,” Olson said. “I want to assure you up front as we engage with students, you have my commitment and our commitment that as we talk about the future, that future will include distinctive, named, identifiable CMEA, Women’s Center, LGBTQ Center. Those will not go away. We’ve also heard loudly and clearly the importance of physical safe space for those centers.”
Olson also said that the university does not intend to cut the budgets or other resources provided to those centers.
“You have my commitment that in this process we will not cut resources,” Olson said. “So I wanted to be clear about that. We want to enhance, to optimize, to be attentive to this balancing act of what are the treasures here that have been developed that we need to preserve and what are new directions and possibilities that we want to explore.”
An event coordinator passed out slips of paper and pens for students to anonymously submit questions to Olson, and the event also featured two sign language translators for hearing impaired students. Students were also able to ask questions into a microphone.
Some students asked questions about the potential creation of a disability cultural center, and Olson said that he had heard of this suggestion and created a Disability Justice Working Group in response.
“We are not ready to commit to a concrete timeline about any of the action steps there but we’re serious about all the possibilities,” Olson said.
Olson also said that he places a high priority on accessibility on campus during construction, and that he hopes to create a campus disability website to allow students and administrators to express concerns and find solutions.
“Let me just say — and some people may glare at me for this — before this academic year is over I think we can have a website presence that focuses on disability issues that’s more coherent and front-facing and broad and accessible than what we have now,” Olson said. “That’s an area that I think is ripe for some action.”
Another student asked about confusion over the differing narratives and shifting answers in regard to the school’s handling of the diversity centers.
“A lot of the other points, in terms of where offices are located, how they interact with each other are not decided,” Olson said. “We don’t have clarity on that. We’re in the process of
really listening to students and engaging with other colleagues around campus, means by nature, some moving back and forth some differing views. Some of which some may perceive as confusion, I think that’s a feature of a process that attempts to be inclusive.”
GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) spoke out in favor of restructuring student focus groups in order to better communicate with the university.
“In defense of focus groups — I was in one of the first ones — some of the questions weren’t all that, just sort of went in with proposals and presented in the not best context,” Lloyd said. “I think one thing that we’re not doing enough of is having the students identify what their needs are first. So the focus group was great at saying ‘we could do this, we could do this,’ but it’s not a lot in terms of what don’t you have.”
Lloyd said that students are able to keep up with social change within each diversity group.
“These groups change,” Lloyd said. “By the time this meeting is done, there will be a Tumblr post with a new definition of a new part of the LGBTQ acronym, so we need an active process of students who are more entrenched in this work to identify those needs.”
Olson said that he saw students as an integral part of cross-center communication, but raised questions about the creation of a student committee.
“I think there’s an important creative tension here,” Olson said. “Should the cultural groups have their own distinct advisory board separate from the Student Activities Commission? It’s a question raised by students that we’re talking a look at. That’s just an example of another way we’re trying to activate students.”
Another topic that students mentioned was the lack of office space for each diversity center. The LGBTQ Resource Center and the Women’s Center are located on the third floor of the Leavey Center and the CMEA is on the fifth floor of the Leavey Center.
“What I’d say to that is I think that in terms of this exercise, the Leavey Center floors three, four and five are part of the conversation,” Olson said. “Floor two, which is our pretty good size career center, and we probably don’t mess with floor number two.”
Sarah Rabon (COL ’16) said she came to the event due to her involvement with the Women’s Center.
“I think it was really great,” Rabon said. “I think there are a lot of different students from a lot of different groups here representing a lot of different, important interests.”
Despite this, Rabon said that she was unsure if any actual progress had been made at the meeting.
“What I feel was being discussed was the idea that more things are being taken into consideration, conversations are being had, focus groups are being had, working groups are being created, but that has not necessarily corresponded to real progress or real change, or any real programming or solutions,” Rabon said.

Restaurants have historically colored the history of the Georgetown neighborhood: John F. Kennedy proposed to Jackie in Martin’s Tavern, and Barack took Michelle out for a birthday dinner at Café Milano. However, the recent rise of retail stores over the last decade has forced Georgetown’s traditional restaurant scene to take a back seat to the neighborhood’s new retail presence.
At least that was the story told by Joe Sternlieb, chief executive officer of the Georgetown Business Improvement District, and Anthony Lanier, founder of real estate development company EastBanc, in a presentation to the Citizens Association of Georgetown at their monthly meeting Nov. 5.
Bars and restaurants, which used to populate the area, have increasingly been forced to sacrifice space for the newer storefronts. This year alone saw the closures of two bars: Modern on M Street and Chadwicks on K Street. Furthermore, Mr. Smith’s moved from M Street to K Street in September due to rising rent costs.
“My perception is that there’s more apparel and a lot more home furnishings over the last 10 years than there was in 2004. There’s been a fair amount of displacement for restaurants and pubs that have been around for a long time. Some have been replaced by newer restaurants and others have been replaced by apparel,” Sternlieb told The Hoya.
With the development of high-quality dining as a result of city-wide gentrification, Sternlieb noted that the demand for Georgetown restaurants from city residents had fallen, though the neighborhood still boasts comparatively more old restaurants than other regions of the District.
“With the emergence of more high-quality dining destinations in neighborhoods around the city … a larger percentage of the overall sales and business in Georgetown will be generated by folks from the suburbs and tourists and will be a little less dependent on city residents,” Sternlieb said. “We’ve got more old restaurants in Georgetown probably than in any other part of the city despite the fact that we’ve lost a few.”
Sternlieb also attributed the decline in restaurants in Georgetown to the relatively low quantity of alcohol licenses available in the neighborhood. While 14 percent of Georgetown restaurants possess liquor licenses, Adams Morgan, for example, boasts a rate of 60 percent.
This can primarily be attributed to the Georgetown’s alcohol moratorium, in place since 1989, which limits the number of alcohol licenses that are permitted in the Georgetown area. Restrictions within the Georgetown ABC License Moratorium Zone, which extends about 1,800 feet in all direction from the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and N Street, dictate that no tavern or nightclub in Georgetown may be issued a new retailer’s license class C or D, which permits establishments to sell and serve beer, wine, and/or spirits. No more than 68 of these licenses may be issued to restaurants within the moratorium.
As the bars have disappeared, so has open space, prompting Lanier to question the future of the neighborhood.
“We’ve seen a lot of the traditional bars in Georgetown get depleted and we’re going to work on replacing them with something that is more fitting to Georgetown going forward. Slowly but surely all remaining pieces of open land in Georgetown have vanished with the exception of two that are on their way out,” Lanier said.
Acknowledging this flight of restaurants from the neighborhood, Lanier emphasized the need to bring food back into the landscape to keep Georgetown vibrant, pointing to the rise of specialty restaurants in the region and the relative dearth of fast food options.
“Now we need to replace restaurants, which are an important component of a vibrant retail environment, with food outlets that fit the current demand better and it certainly has been demonstrated that it’s not fast food,” he said. “I think that the restaurant side has changed to more specialty restaurants. It’s not pastry shops anymore, it’s cupcakes.”
The push is complicated by the rising rents throughout the Georgetown neighborhood that have made it difficult for small businesses to afford space. As a result, even the retailers flooding the Georgetown area have primarily been national chains, including Forever 21, Rent the Runway, DSW and Alice + Olivia.
“The rents have gone up all over the city including in Georgetown and so the types of businesses that can afford those higher rents are driving the change in the retail landscape very visibly in Georgetown,” Sternlieb said. “The trend has been towards more expensive rents on M Street with more national brands and national credit tenants flocking to M Street. That’s been the most noticeable change in the last 10 to 15 years.”
With reduced space and increased rent, storefronts, previously clustered exclusively on M Street and Wisconsin Avenue, are now turning to the side streets in the neighborhood.
“I think you’re going to see a proliferation of retail into the side streets and alleys going forward, which is going to be really exciting for the look and feel of Georgetown,” Lanier said. “One of them is the development of the parking lots in front of Café Milano. That is an interesting development because it will bring retail off M Street onto Prospect Street.”
The state of flux of the storefronts and restaurants has not affected the vibrancy of the neighborhood. Lanier attributed the vitality to the nearby student population and their entrepreneurship.
“One of the exciting components that influences Georgetown is not simply the residents, but is arguably the amount of students that embrace Georgetown. … The exciting thing about these two universities is that we have 30,000 people that are in some form or shape innovators because they are young; they are looking at things differently than the existing population and that brings something to Georgetown that makes it always current,” Lanier said.
Unlike other neighborhoods in the District, Georgetown is not projected to add a substantial amount of residential units, putting the impetus on the existing population to jump-start the neighborhood’s development.
“[Students] are not willing to buy into yesterday’s values, they are bringing tomorrow’s values and I think Georgetown has to learn how to adapt to that,” Lanier said. “You have 30,000 people who are thinking about tomorrow who are going to influence our shops, our restaurants, our traffic, our eating habits and so on.”

After two years of planning, The Hilltoss, The Corp’s new salad and smoothie storefront and its first new storefront in 11 years, will open in the Healey Family Student Center today.
The Corp’s last new store was Hoya Snaxa, with the opening of the Southwest Quad in 2003.
The new restaurant will provide students with a range of healthy food options including salads, snacks and drinks from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday. The opening of The Hilltoss marks a milestone for The Corp as its first proper restaurant, according to Corp CEO Sam Rodman (MSB ’15). Rodman said this change brought new challenges in quality control.
“The big leap for us is to think about new regulations, new product quality and there’s a lot more preparation that goes into it, like fresh ingredients,” Rodman said. “It really folds into this idea of ensuring product quality, especially when we have a lot of strong competitors in the area that offer something similar. So that’s probably the biggest challenge, making sure we control the product quality. It’s something that we’ve been working very hard to achieve.”
Rodman said he believes The Corp will push through these obstacles, as it did when opening its first coffee shop, Uncommon Grounds, in 1994.
“It’s not the only big jump that we’ve made,” Rodman said. “We have a similar option to open coffee shops first time in 1994 when our products
had really been focusing on the groceries, something that was more service related. … From a historical perspective, though I consider this leap a bigger leap than from the groceries [to the coffee shops], I still think that we have confidence that it’s something we can push through a lot of obstacles.”
Hilltoss General Manager Monish Sabnani (MSB ’15) identified consistency as the biggest challenge in daily operations, and said that Hilltoss staff has trained for months to practice food preparation.
“As The Corp has a lot of different employees who change every semester, consistency is something that we, as upper management, have made the number one goal,” Sabnani said. “We spent tons of hours into training. … We are going for the idea that if you come in for a salad today, it’s going to be exactly what we get tomorrow, regardless of who’s working that shift.”
According to Rodman, the university reached out to The Corp in the HFSC planning process and offered them a storefront location to cater to future student needs.
“When the Healey Family Student Center was developed, it was more than a building,” Rodman said. “The university wants to ensure that students are as involved as possible in all the big decisions and developments of it. … They just want us there, knowing The Corp above all really understands student needs.”
HFSC Director Patrick Ledesma said that the location was carved out specifically for The Corp’s new business and was funded by The Corp during construction.
“We knew that we wanted The Corp’s location in the building.” Ledesma said. “Their location was funded by The Corp. That’s why it looks great and has a nice wood feel to the whole thing, which complements the building with natural elements.”
The Corp signed a contract with Auxiliary Services with confidential terms determining the operations of The Hilltoss and the relationship between two parties.
“From a qualitative perspective, the university was incredibly supportive in terms of answering questions, working with us in the process and essentially being a great landlord, but from a financial perspective, we funded the entirety of the project and are paying,” Rodman said.
Rodman said that the opening of The Hilltoss would not divert resources from other businesses The Corp currently runs.
“We financed and hired for The Hilltoss separately from our other businesses,” Rodman said. “The Hilltoss has been a strong focus this year, but we have also grown our company in other ways — Kickback, new scholarships, mobile app development, and renovations to our existing services.”
Rodman said that The Hilltoss will initially only operate on weekdays due to the current size of its staff. During the next two semesters, The Hilltoss will hire additional employees. Rodman said that after making these additional hires, The Hilltoss will likely expand to seven days a week and increase its hours of operation on a day-to-day basis.
“We try to keep our hiring classes in a manageable amount, so we’re not making any single hiring class have too many people,” Rodmand said. “At Hilltoss, we were shooting for about 15 to 20 people. We were hiring that amount so we require three shifts for new hires, and that comes out to about five days a week for shift coverage.”
The restaurant currently can accommodate between 30 and 36 customers, but plans to expand seating in the future.
“The goal is to make it the next new study spot on campus and we want to fill it up with lots of new seating. We are expecting to seat anywhere between 200 and 400 students a day,” Sabnani said.
According to Dana Mitchell (MSB ’15), Director of The Hilltoss, The Corp chose salad and smoothies as the main products of The Hilltoss based on a campus-wide survey.
“The Corp set out a campus-wide survey asking students if they wanted a deli, a salad shop, a smoothie shop, an ice-cream stand, another coffee shop or another grocery store,” Mitchell said.”The whole point of The Hilltoss is to communicate with students and to see what their needs are.”
Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese said that The Corp should evaluate the success of The Hilltoss based on student feedback.
“For any places that open any restaurant, the success is whether students like it,” Wiese said. “You have to be a place where the students want to go to. You have to support the community in many ways, have the hours of operations that students want and have the menus that students want. It has to be a place that students are happy with. And if you meet those needs of students, then you will always have people coming back.”
Jordan Sabourin (SFS ’18) welcomed the healthy food concept as a new alternative to O’Donovan Hall.
“Leo’s is not awful if you want to eat healthy,” Sabourin said. “But if you are trying to eat light, it’s very constraining to eat at Leo’s. … The healthy things tend to be the things that stay the same. It will be nice to have a bit of a change.”

The writer either can’t transcribe interviews or the interviewees don’t know how to form coherent sentences. It really took away from an otherwise interesting piece a great new happening on campus.

The Tombs has indefinitely cancelled its Sunday wine nights upon a directive from the Clyde’s Restaurant Group.
“I don’t know why exactly it was cancelled, but the reasoning behind it — I know it came down from our corporate office — we’re part of the Clyde’s Restaurant Group, and that it was a company-wide decision,” General Manager Rich Kaufman (SFS ’05) said.
The directive was handed down last Friday and went into effect for the first time on Sunday. Kaufman hoped the decision would be temporary but could not say for sure. He hypothesized that it could be for the safety of the restaurant’s guests, but he was unable to provide any further detail.
The Tombs, along with the other restaurants in the Clyde’s Restaurant Group, which include 1789, Clyde’s, Old Ebbitt Grill and The Hamilton, held wine night once a week. For The Tombs, this night fell on Sunday, a night when patrons could buy bottles of wine for 10 dollars, half the regular price, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.
Students expressed their disappointment at the end of the promotion.
“I always used wine night as a chance to catch up with my friends at the end of the weekend,” Meghan Bodie (SFS ’15) wrote in an email. “I loved it because the environment was low key and the wine deal was sweet. RIP wine night.”
Kaufman said that the restaurant was in the process of finding another promotion for Sundays.
“We have specials every night of the week. We’re hoping within a week or two to have something that could replace Sunday nights, but we haven’t made any plans yet,” he said.
The statement about wine night from the management group was coupled with a directive prohibiting the use of vertical IDs in Clyde’s establishments, causing some Georgetown students to be denied access to the restaurant last weekend.
“When I arrived, the bouncer checked my ID (a vertical Pennsylvania driver’s license) and asked if I had any other form of identification, explaining that he was no longer allowed to accept any vertical driver’s licenses as valid form of ID,” Audrey Utkus (COL ’15) wrote in an email. “When I told him I had nothing else, he called the manager over to see if there was any way I could get in.”
The restaurant discussed the vertical ID directive with the corporate offices and had the decision reversed the next day.
“I think that someone maybe got some erroneous information,” Kaufman said. “We talked to the people in corporate, and the decision was reversed within a day, which is good.”
Utkus was pleased with the way the restaurant handled the situation.
“The Tombs staff was very nice despite the circumstances and seemed frustrated with the policy,” she wrote.
Kaufman hoped that, despite the difficulties, customers would recognize the efforts of the restaurant to serve them.
“I hope everyone sticks by us. We’re definitely going to do right by the guests,” he said. “We’re going to come up with the best thing possible if we can’t do wine night anymore.”

Questions raised this week surrounding the university’s handling of former student Daniel Milzman’s March arrest for making ricin in his dorm room and the aftermath for those involved on campus have been met with silence from the administration, while gaining support among students.
After Milzman was sentenced Monday to one year in prison, 400 hours of community service, a mandatory mental health treatment program and 36 months of supervised release following his sentence, with a deal that means he could secure a January release, Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15), the resident assistant who first reported Milzman’s possession of ricin to the university and the police, wrote a viewpoint in The Hoya raising concerns about both the university’s handling of the incident and its lack of support for Lloyd as a university employee in the weeks that followed.
In his viewpoint, Lloyd recounted the night that Milzman showed him the ricin, detailing the delayed response of Counseling and Psychiatric Services when he first called them to report the incident, as well as the lack of a support system for him from the university — particularly, the Office of Residential Living — after Milzman’s arrest.
“It made me very cynical about when the safety net was activated, and what situations we actually support students. The university attempts to keep a story exploding at the expense of giving those traumatized the space to process emotion,” Lloyd said after the viewpoint’s publication.
As an RA, but not Milzman’s direct RA, Lloyd described how his involvement in the situation, and whether or not he was considered a university employee at the moment he turned in Milzman, was further blurred. He raised concerns about how RAs are treated by the university as both employees and students, which have since been echoed by other RAs on campus.
In response to questions regarding the handling of the ricin incident, Assistant Dean of Residential Life Stephanie Lynch, Residential Education Director Ed Gilhool, Associate Director of Residential Education Andrew Erdmann, CAPS Director Phil Meilman and the Office of General Counsel, which provides legal services to the university, all deferred comments to Rachel Pugh, the university’s director of media relations.
“We are grateful for the students and professional staff who worked to respond to this incident. We also recognized that there is always room for improvement and we are constantly evaluating our practices and learning from each experience. Feedback from all those involved in any incident helps to improve our processes,” Pugh wrote in an email.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson echoed Pugh, expressing gratitude toward RAs.
“We appreciate the great work of our resident assistants across campus. We know that RAs often make use of their extensive training in supporting their friends, as well as in working with students on their floors,” Olson wrote in an email, in response to request for comment on the university’s handling of the incident.
Pugh praised the university’s response time.
“In March 2014, the university reacted quickly, thoughtfully and responsibly to respond to an incident of ricin on our campus,” Pugh wrote. “The successful implementation of our protocols resulted in keeping our university community safe during this unprecedented incident.”
Lloyd and fellow RAs expect that Lloyd faces possible termination from his position as an RA for coming forward and violating the confidentiality agreement that RAs must sign.
“They’re going to fire Thomas, but they haven’t yet,” Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16), also an RA and a friend of Lloyd, said. “Word is something’s coming.”
According to Pugh, RAs are “trained and expected to protect the privacy of students.” She did not respond to requests for comment on whether this rule of confidentiality applies to an RA’s interactions with all students or just with his or her specific residents.
RAs, who remained anonymous for fear of being fired, shared their stories of mistreatment by the university on the Voice’s website Thursday. Students shared the accounts using the hashtag #yesallRAs.
One RA shared an experience being sexually assaulted by a resident, but feared that reporting the incident would result in loss of employment.
“I never officially reported the assault because I did not want to start any trouble. After hearing the stories of my fellow RAs who experienced indirect punitive measures in the rehiring process as a result of reporting incidents of sexual assault, I am glad that I never officially reported the incident. If I didn’t have this job, I would not be able to pay for tuition,” the RA said to the Voice.
Another RA also questioned the university’s treatment of residential living student staff.
“No one said anything about what to do if one of us in our capacity as an RA was assaulted. I don’t know whether I’m guaranteed equal protection as an employee of this university. I don’t know my own rights. It makes me very, very scared,” another RA said.
Afraid of the possible legal repercussions resulting from his involvement with Milzman, with whom he’d had a relationship, Lloyd asked at a meeting with Lynch, Gilhool and University Counsel Adam Adler whether or not he could receive legal protection as an employee of the university.
According to Lloyd, Adler told him that because he was not Milzman’s designated RA, it would be unlikely that he would get legal protection. However, Erdmann had told him previously that, as an RA, he was not permitted to speak about the incident to his friends or to faculty, only to CAPS or to his chaplain.
“I would sort of hope that if my position was being leveraged to keep me quiet and to really prevent who I could speak to, then at the same time I would have been offered legal protection, but that’s not what happened,” Lloyd said.
Rosenberger said that he believed that the university wanted to keep those involved quiet so as to control the story.
“The reason that they were really invested in us not talking at the time was the information coming out of Residence Life was deliberately false,” Rosenberger said. “I mean, the story they were spinning was ‘Danny Milzman was depressed. He came to his RA with depression, and his RA handled the situation.’ It wasn’t ‘Danny Milzman happened to be [involved with] an RA in a different building, may or may not have tried to poison him and/or other people, this kid spilled, and thank God we’re all safe.’”

Armed robberies have risen around the Georgetown neighborhood over the past few weeks, prompting a campus-wide email from Georgetown University Police Department Chief of Police Jay Gruber urging safety precautions.
“There have been a few armed robberies around Georgetown. Two of those armed robberies involved our students,” Gruber said in an interview.
According to the 2014 Annual Crime Statistics report, there were no robberies, two aggravated assaults and 24 burglaries, which do not involve force, in 2013.
According to Public Safety Alerts sent to the university community, on Nov. 7, two students were assaulted and robbed at the corner of 34th and N streets at 11:40 p.m., and on Oct. 31, a group of male and female subjects assaulted a student in an attempt to steal the student’s purse. In addition to the assaults, there have been four other off-campus burglaries that did not result in violence and two other on-campus burglaries this month alone.
Gruber could not point to a particular reason for the recent rise in robberies.
“From being in law enforcement for almost 30 years, there’s always ebbs and flows to these types of crimes,” he said. “I think we’re just in that period of time now where there’s been an increase. We really can’t put our fingers on it. There’s no new gang activity that’s in this area.”
As the robberies have occurred off campus in the Georgetown neighborhood, the Second District of the Metropolitan Police Department retains jurisdiction over the incidents.
“We’re in regular communication with the supervisor from our [police service area] in the Second District,” Gruber said. “I know that the Second District is doing things to help combat it. I can’t discuss the things that they’re doing, but I know they’re well aware of it, and they’re really supportive.”
Despite the increase in crime off campus, Gruber said he did not expect to see a similar increase in crimes on campus because of the concentration of police officers, noting that the burglaries that occurred on campus were crimes of opportunity, a result of people leaving doors unlocked.
“The campus is well-lit, there’s usually lots of students walking around at all hours of the day and night,” Gruber said. “The opportunity on campus for a successful armed robbery is a whole lot less than at some intersection in West Georgetown where nobody’s around.”
To keep students alert to the increase in crime, Gruber sent out the campus-wide email on Monday to urge students to take precautions when walking around the neighborhood. The email asked students to download the LiveSafe app, use SafeRides, walk in groups and on well-lit routes and not fight the perpetrator if faced with an armed robbery situation.
“If students will follow the simple steps that I put in my email, they’ll put themselves in a much safer situation,” he said. “Not to say they can’t be a victim of violent crime, but if they take certain precautions, they really lessen that opportunity.”

The Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service has cited slight increases in response times related to the closure of Library Walk and Tondorf Road because of the construction of the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall and the renovation of the former Jesuit residence.
GERMS has had to reroute its traffic on the now closed Tondorf Road to West Road, which runs parallel to Tondorf. All patients from south campus now reach MedStar Georgetown University Hospital via West Road.
“Though the construction has proved to be a minor inconvenience, we are still able to respond to calls and transport all patients to the hospital in a timely manner,” GERMS Captain Brian Monahan (COL ’15) and GERMS President Kathryn Stefos (COL ’15) wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our night response times have increased slightly, but our response times during the day and response times to double dispatches remain close to our normal average.”
Monahan and Stefos also said that the construction of Village C West has been a small inconvenience, since GERMS ambulances are usually parked in front of the residence hall.
“Most construction activities have simply altered our normal procedures slightly,” Monahan and Stefos wrote. “We have been given notice when we would need to move our ambulances.”
The Georgetown University Police Department and the Department of Emergency Management and Operational Continuity both said that the construction and road closures have had almost no impact on their operations.
GUPD relies primarily on foot officers who are able to easily bypass any construction detours. Only a few vehicles are on patrol at any given time while the majority of patrols are on foot or bike, according to GUPD Police Chief Jay Gruber.
GUPD’s response time of one to two minutes for all emergency calls has remained steady even with the construction closures, Gruber said.
“Response times haven’t been affected because the officers can still access the areas around the construction pretty easily,” Gruber said. “The construction is an inconvenience for the campus, but as far as my department is concerned, it doesn’t affect the safety and security of the campus or our community on campus.”
GUPD has the ability to make any of the closed roads accessible to emergency services within minutes, according to Gruber. Because of this Gruber said that the construction would pose no obstacle to a major campus emergency.
GERMS, GUPD and the Department of Emergency Management and Operational Continuity have been in regular communication with Planning and Facilities Management regarding closures. Additionally, GERMS meets twice a week to receive updates from DEMOC.
In the event of a major campus emergency such as a fire or shooting, DEMOC has drafted a response plan titled “Initiative on Life Safety,” which details dozens of potential emergency response issues, according to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey. The plan offers specifics on how the university would give D.C. emergency services such as the D.C. Fire Department and the Metropolitan Police Department access of closed construction areas.
“DEMOC has worked closely with … campus partners and external emergency responders to develop detailed campus maps and floor plans with up-to-date and accurate site drawings that incorporate campus access routes, construction activity, and critical infrastructure information,” DEMOC Director Thomas O’Regan wrote in an email to The Hoya.

The Georgetown University Police Department will not be patrolling New South Hall during weekend nights, despite an email sent out to New South residents Tuesday afternoon that stated that officers would be posted on weekend nights in the freshman residence hall.
“Since we are so fortunate, in the next weekend and those following, we will have GUPD officers within the building to make sure that all is well,” New South Community Director Jasmin Bush wrote in an email to New South residents. “They will specifically be around for the weekend and hours between 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. to ensure that the policies of the building are being followed given recent acts of vandalism (within New South) and theft (mainly in and around the community).”
GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber said that the email stemmed from confusion about GUPD’s community liaison program, which has existed since 2008. The program connects officers with students in each residence hall to develop a closer relationship between GUPD and the people it serves. Gruber said that community liaison officers at New South wanted to interact with more students and decided to host a meet-and-greet as a part of GUPD’s Personal Safety Week.
“It really came down to the fact that the campus liaison officers said they would give a little extra attention to New South, but we’re not going to do what the community director has here, be there for weekends and hours between 9 p,m. to 2 p.m., ensuring policies of the building are being followed. That’s not something that campus liaison officers wrote that they said they would do,” Gruber said. “So I’m not quite sure where this is coming from.”
Director of Residential Education Ed Gilhool said that this officer meet-and-greet came after a few minor acts of vandalisms in New South.
“Out of that, and the community policing model GUPD strives for, they had a conversation about the building and the fact that there had been some vandalism, and in partnership they decided this would be a good opportunity for the officers to spend some time in New South and be there to get to know the students, to introduce themselves and to just be there to be helpful and respond to concerns students may have about vandalism and other issues,” Gilhool said. “This is not an ongoing, sustained patrol of New South.”
According to Gruber, recent crime in New South has not been significant enough to warrant any sort of GUPD patrol.
“I’m trying to think what recent crimes have been in there,” Gruber said. “I don’t know of any. We have vandalisms here and there on campus or a burglary here and there, but I’m not aware of any sustained incidents of crime or any sustained incidents of student conduct that would warrant us spending an inordinate amount of time in New South.”
Gruber said that GUPD rarely patrols residence halls on a sustained basis due to lack of resources.
“It’s just an odd thing because although we will give special attention to certain areas that are experiencing problems or an elevated incidence of crime, but it’s not something that we would do on a sustained basis,” Gruber said. “We generally do not walk through residence hall hallways on a regular basis unless there’s a problem.”
According to Gilhool, community liaison officers will occasionally host meet-and-greets in residence halls including New South in the future to communicate with students.
“We’re not creating a patrol of New South, but really trying to bolster an opportunity for our staff, GUPD and students to make sure our students are safe and well in their building,” Gilhool said.
Bush declined to comment on the misleading email.

The National Mall hosted the Concert for Valor to honor veterans on Tuesday, drawing a crowd of over 800,000 people.
The event, sponsored by Starbucks and broadcast live by HBO, featured performances by Jennifer Hudson, Dave Grohl, the Black Keys, Metallica, Zac Brown Band, Bruce Springsteen, Rihanna and Eminem. Other celebrities, including Jamie Foxx, Meryl Streep and Bryan Cranston, appeared as well, thanking veterans for their service and, in Cranston’s case, sharing his family’s relationship with the military.
Attendees began lining up at the Seventh Street NW entrance well before police began letting people onto the Mall at 10 a.m., though the concert did not start until 7 p.m. Around 12,000 tickets were set aside for members of the military, who were situated right in front of the stage.The crowd stretched from the stage near the Capitol building to the Washington Monument.
Students who attended were awed by both the celebrities and the patriotism at the concert.
“There were a lot of people there, but they had a lot of screens and speakers so everyone could hear and enjoy the music,” Bianca DiSanto (MSB ’17) said. “I don’t think I’ve ever been in a more patriotic crowd.”
After each set, a short video would play on the screens to tell the stories of specific veterans.
“The story that resonated the most with me was the story of a veteran, Cedric King, who had both of his legs blown off, and he decided afterward to become a triathlete. He completed an Ironman competition. His story touched a lot of people,” Haley Florsheim (SFS ’18) said.
Though he was not interested in all the artists performing, Will Wrotniak (SFS ’18) praised the event as a must-see.
“I went because I wanted to see Bruce, to be honest,” Wrotniak said. “But more importantly, I thought it was an opportunity I couldn’t miss. Those are the experiences that make college. You’re going to look back 40 years after and say, ‘I went to that concert, and it was awesome.’”

Changes to housing eligibility have caused confusion among students seeking university housing for a fourth year, as juniors currently studying abroad no longer receive preferences for senior housing eligibility.
Previously, juniors spending a semester abroad were given priority in senior housing eligibility, in addition to other special interest groups. Under the new housing rules, only students with high financial need and junior transfer students are given preferences in the eligibility process, while students studying abroad are no longer prioritized.
Executive Director for Residential Services Patrick Killilee said that this change came in response to student feedback.
“Based on recommendations from a student working group, with representatives from Georgetown University Student Association and InterHall, extra points for seniors studying abroad in the fall was discontinued this year,” he said.
Allison Blankenship (COL ’16), who is studying abroad in Copenhagen this semester, was placed on the eligibility waitlist. Blankenship said she is unhappy with her housing result and she considers the system unfair for juniors studying abroad.
“I’m not happy with my housing result because I have the highest amount of points possible, but still can’t seem to get on-campus housing,” Blankenship wrote in an email. “It doesn’t seem fair to me. The people who studied abroad in the fall should have some sort of priority in choosing on-campus housing since we weren’t part of the previous housing selection process.”
Blankenship said that the eligibility process’s randomness and lack of transparency have become frustrating for her.
“The eligibility system is like a numbers game that you can never win,” Blankenship wrote. “People always try to put together the best group that will (hopefully) get them the greatest amount of points and give them eligibility, but no one really knows their chances. We try to outsmart this system that no one truly even understands.”
Violet Wey (SFS ’16), who is currently studying abroad in Shanghai, received eligibility for on-campus senior housing, but said that her financial aid status helped to secure this. She said that despite her success in the eligibility process, there is a lack of access to information for students abroad.
“I didn’t think the application process was extremely difficult,” Wey wrote in an email.”I was just a bit confused or unsure about some things, and the time difference being abroad made it difficult for me to ever contact anyone over at Georgetown for help, so that made me nervous and hesitant when it came time to actually submit for eligibility.”
Issues regarding senior housing extend beyond students studying abroad, with other juniors also expressing concerns about a confusing system.
Joseph Laposata (COL ’16), who is living on campus his junior year, also received waitlist status. He said that the university did not explain its policies well and that the system is misleading.
“The university has set up an incentive that makes us want to live on campus. If we applied for housing, we are likely to get apartments or townhouses. Those are wonderful housing options that we would definitely want,” he said. “But we don’t know that we can even get eligibility to get those excellent points. So it’s hard to make this a plan if it’s not guaranteed to all.”
Killilee however, said the Office of Residential Life has not received this negative feedback.
“We make every effort to make the process as simple and transparent as possible. We have involved students and student leaders from GUSA and InterHall over the past few years to review these processes and make recommendations for improvement,” Killilee wrote. “We have not received any real complaints. We receive a lot of questions about individual situations.  We try to work with students to resolve those individual concerns.”
After the university changed its housing policy this spring, requiring three years of on-campus housing beginning with the Class of 2017, Laposata said that current juniors became confused about their eligibility and options for senior year.
“This is just causing mass confusion,” Laposata said. “For one thing, I have no idea if my number is good. I have no idea if I should expect to receive eligibility.”
Killilee said he believed that the three-year housing requirement would only help rising seniors receive better on-campus housing.
“The third-year mandate should not make much of an impact on students requesting senior year housing,” Killilee wrote. “Rising seniors with eligibility will have first pick of townhouses, apartments and residence halls during selection. In the past, juniors had first pick. More seniors will be able to live in townhouses than in the past.”
While acknowledging the university’s limitations, Laposata said he remains dissatisfied with the current eligibility system.
“I realized that this is just a messy interim period,” Laposata said. “The university isn’t trying to disadvantage seniors. … But also it’s worth acknowledging that it’s incredibly inconvenient and there are mixed incentives because they want us to live on campus but they can’t tell us if they will let us live on campus.”
Killilee said that the Office of Residential living does not have plans to make major policy changes for senior housing in the future.
“Due to limited housing capacity, we are not able to guarantee or require four years of campus housing,” Killilee wrote. “Historically, about 25 percent of seniors have lived on campus. That number will increase slightly as we add more housing in the next two years.”

Georgetown researchers published a study questioning the prevalent theory of Alzheimer’s development in the journal Molecular Neurodegeneration on Oct. 31.
The research, led by investigators at the Georgetown Medical Center, explored neuron death in degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, and found that plaque was not the cause of such neuron death. It went on to explain why people with plaque build-up in their brains sometimes do not exhibit dementia. Instead, it pointed to malfunctioning tau, a protein, as the cause of the degeneration.
Charbel Moussa, the head of laboratory for dementia and Parkinsonism in GUMC’s Department of Neuroscience, was the head researcher involved in the project, and he co-authored the study with researchers from Capital Medical University in Beijing and Merck Research Laboratories, which provided funding for the study.
“As with most research, complicated studies such as this one can take years. The process began with an idea that I was able to support with a small set of data. From there, I wrote many grants to get the funding needed to conduct the research. The project itself and the follow-up analysis took several years.” Moussa wrote in an email.
Moussa hoped that the new developments released in the study would change the current thinking about Alzheimer’s and the search for a cure.
“The key finding is that we show malfunctioning tau, not amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque, is the seminal event that spurs neuron death in disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. This is a debunking of the current theory of Alzheimer’s development,” he said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as many as five million Americans were living with Alzheimer’s disease in 2013, but predictions estimate a threefold increase in diagnoses by 2050. The occurrence of the disease increases with age, with primary contributing factors believed to include family history. The disease remains one of the top-10 leading causes of death in the United States and the fifth-leading cause of death for adults above 65 years of age.
Crediting the Georgetown community for its contribution for the clinic, Moussa said that the study offered a culmination of his previous work in understanding Alzheimer’s. The study showed that nilotinib, a cancer treatment drug, has the potential to prevent the progression of dementias in cases where the tau is malfunctioning.
“This research builds on years of earlier work. While we inch closer to understanding the complete story of how Alzheimer’s develops, it is critical to be able to translate laboratory findings in meaningful improvements in the clinic,” he said. “At Georgetown, we are studying nilotinib in other neurologic diseases such as Parkinsonism. This clinical trial is based on our laboratory work and is supported in part, by generous Georgetown donors.”
Moussa stressed the importance of federal funding for finding a cure and the current dearth of support from Congress.
“Federal funding for biomedical research is abysmal, especially for a disease that profoundly impacts millions of people worldwide. Significant progress can be made if Congress would act now to increase funding for biomedical research,” he said.
Despite the lack of funding, Moussa saw promise in his study and similar efforts in expanding the existing understanding of the disease.
“This study suggests a completely new way to look at Alzheimer’s that might alter the way we study the disease, screen for it and ultimately treat it,” he said.

ISABEL BINAMIRA/THE HOYAThe sculpture garden at the National Gallery of Art will feature an ice-skating rink, set to open this weekend. The rink will stay open through the winter months.
As the weather takes a turn toward the chillier side, the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden Ice Rink on the National Mall and the Washington Harbor Ice Rink in Georgetown will be open to the public starting this weekend.
An annual Washington, D.C., winter tradition, the Sculpture Garden ice rink will give visitors the opportunity to skate while surrounded by sculptures displayed by the National Gallery of Art. The rink, which opens today, will remain on the Mall until March 16.
Since it opened to visitors in 1974, the National Gallery of Art Ice Rink has been a staple of winter in D.C. Though the widely frequented rink has always been on the National Mall, the construction of the Sculpture Garden in 1999 offered an ideal location for the rink each winter.
National Gallery of Art Chief of Press and Public Information Deborah Ziska said that the Sculpture Garden ice rink’s location provides a unique experience for visitors.
“The experience of skating in the Sculpture Garden, surrounded by the grand architecture of national museum and monuments, is enhanced by the splendid views of large-scale sculptures by modern and contemporary artists including Louise Bourgeois, Alexander Calder, Roy Lichtenstein, Roxy Paine, Tony Smith and others from the Gallery’s renowned collection,” Ziska wrote in an email.

According to Ziska, the ice rink also features a distinctive scenic backdrop in addition to the sculptures.
“Visitors may enjoy spacious seating and walking areas amid the Native American canopy and flowering trees, shrubs, ground covers and perennials,” Ziska said. “The majestic fountain at the center of the garden gives visitors a chance to rest and reflect on the works on view.”
This year, the gallery’s guest services will offer both skating and ice hockey lessons. Students can register individually or with a group.
Tickets for the rink are $7 for students, and a season pass that covers unlimited access to the ice rink is $195. In celebration of its opening, visitors to the ice rink on Saturday and Sunday will receive a complimentary cup of hot chocolate from the Pavilion Café at the museum.
This winter, the Georgetown neighborhood will offer its own annual skating rink, set to open this Saturday.
The Washington Harbor Ice Rink at Georgetown is the largest ice-skating venue in D.C. Skating lessons will also be offered, in addition to event planning services for private parties. Though normally tickets are $10, college students will receive a special entry rate, saving $2 off from the original price, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursdays.
Georgetown students praised the two ice rinks as an opportunity to go off campus and partake in the city’s culture.
“That sounds like a fantastic time. It would be great to get off campus for a few hours and just enjoy some of the unique experiences D.C. has to offer. Ice skating is pretty chill — no pun intended — so it is definitely something I would be interested in doing,” Nick Zeffiro (SFS ’18) said.
Kathryn Shortsleeve (NHS ’18) said that the prospect of ice skating helps remind her of winters at home in Massachusetts.
“Ice skating was something I loved to do at home, so it’s awesome that they offer it here in D.C. as a fun winter activity,” she said.
For students like Kris Muzzi (COL ’18) who haven’t mastered the ice, the skating lessons provided by the ice rink are a great opportunity.
“I don’t know how to ice skate, but I know that you can have lessons there, and what better place to get ice skating lessons than the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden?” Muzzi said.

A panel moderated by Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., discussed issues surrounding violence in El Salvador in an event sponsored by the Office of Campus Ministry in Healy Hall on Thursday evening, as part of a series of programs commemorating the 25th anniversary of the murders of six Jesuits in El Salvador.
The panel included Rev. Ismael Moreno Coto, S.J., a human rights activist in Honduras, National Advocacy Office of the U.S. Jesuit Conference Policy Director Shaina Aberand and Georgetown Global Politics and Security Chair Mark Lagon.
The panelists referred to the deaths of the Salvadoran Martyrs to frame their discussion of current violence in El Salvador. The murders were perpetrated by the El Salvadoran military at the Jesuits’ residence on the campus of the Jose Simeon Cañas Central American University.
“This is a region that is the size of Oregon,” Aber said. “You can imagine how violence and a coup that destabilizes one country can have a profound impact on the other nations as well.”
Aber also discussed the increasing rates of murder and sexual assault in the region, noting that all three countries experienced more than a 200 percent increase in murder rates since 2005. She stressed that children are also major victims of violence.
“[There are] vigilante death squads that go into communities that are known to be sites of gang activity and just pick off children because youth are admitted into gangs, youth are thought to be the problem,” Aber said.
Lagon attributed this increase in violence to greater levels of human trafficking and displaced people. He blamed this increased violence on the inaction of the El Salvadoran government towards gangs and the corruption of the local police over the past decade.
“The way in which the poor in many countries are unable to thrive because of their lack of access to justice,” Lagon said. “They have rights that exist on paper, laws, or treaties that their countries have ratified, but in truth, people don’t have land rights … and no confidence that law enforcement will protect them.”
Coto, who personally knew the murdered, tied the violence in Honduras today to the brutal massacre 25 years ago.
“Those assassinations 25 years ago stood out because they were irrational and brutal,” Coto said. “Now, if you look at the violence inside Honduras, it is increasingly brutal and increasingly violent and irrational in a way that is somewhat similar.”
Carnes noted the importance of the discussion and how the situation of violence in El Salvador has not improved in recent years.
“We spoke in a powerful way in underlying questions of justice, of dignity, which arise over and over again,” Carnessaid. “I’m struck by [how] we began and continued with and ended with destroyed bodies.”
After the panel concluded, a memorial mass was held to commemorate the Salvadoran Martyrs in Dahlgren Chapel. The rose garden of the chapel was blessed afterwards.
Will Rogers (COL ’18) said that it was important for a serious dialogue to be held on the issue.
“It was insightful. …What [Aber] had to say, was the most acute for me,” Rogers said. “The more you understand about different events in the world, you get a better picture of everything.”

A student at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh was charged with possession of ricin on Tuesday. Kyle Smith, 21, is now on interim suspension and is barred from campus, WSAW, a local news source in Wausau, Wis., reported. If convicted of possession of a biological toxin, Smith could serve up to 10 years in prison and face a fine of $250,000.
WLUK-TV, a Fox news station located in Green Bay, Wis. reports that two of Smith’s professors called the police after they grew suspicious that he was making ricin in his off-campus residence. His roommate told police that Smith had made the ricin with three castor plants he grew in his backyard.
Smith’s attorney told the court Monday that Smith is not a danger to the public.
Daniel Milzman, a former Georgetown student, was charged with possession of a biological toxin last March, after he made ricin in his shared McCarthy Hall dorm room with materials from a Maryland plant store. Milzman was placed on rigorous suicide watch, and has spent seven-and-half months in jail in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, with one hour of recreation time.
Milzman pled down the charge and was sentenced Monday to a year and a day in prison, with time already served in jail credited to his sentence.

A group of freshmen began publishing a one-page news source called The Daily Dog in early September, intending to offer a quick, printed source for a breadth of news.
The paper, which features headlines about campus, national and world news in one sentence or less, is distributed to four freshman residence halls, the Southwest Quad, Village C East and Copley Hall, as well as the Intercultural Center and the Healey Family Student Center.
The newsletter, created by freshman Luke Gile (SFS ’18), is run by a staff of 26 students and maintains an online presence with a website, Facebook page and Twitter account. The Daily Dog has garnered over 270 Facebook likes and 36 Twitter followers thus far.
“It started off as a really small thing,” Gile said. “We printed 20 copies on the first day, Sept. 9, and it just grew from there. We just kept up with demand.”
Although Gile prints The Daily Dog in his VCW dorm room, he credits the entirety of the newspaper’s staff for its success and expansion to additional residence halls.
“I do what I can, but the team is fantastic,” Gile said. “I couldn’t get this done without them. It would still be 20 pages a day in Village C, just on my floor.”
Gile said that since The Daily Dog is free, student staffers base the development and growth of the paper off student feedback.
The Daily Dog currently staffs four contributing writers and seven columnists. One of the writers is Jeremy Silas (COL ’18), who is responsible for city and campus news, which falls under a “Georgetown” heading. Silas said he was drawn to The Daily Dog because of his love of news and the simplicity of the paper’s format.
“It’s everything you need to know, within a couple of seconds,” Silas said.
The Daily Dog does not currently receive any university funding or support, and is entirely student-produced and printed. According to Gile, Student Activities Commission Gile said Chair Patrick Musgrave (COL ’16) reached out to the paper and offered expedited club status and funding, but the Daily Dog turned down this offer.
“We don’t need that right now,” Gile said. “If it ever becomes unsustainable, that we do need funding, an office and club status, then we might go to that.”
According to Musgrave, though, he only offered advice to Gile, and did not offer access to benefits.
“I told him that if he ever wanted to try and get access to benefits, I could provide advice,” Musgrave wrote in an email. “The Daily Dog wouldn’t be under SAC, it would be under the Media Board. … All new organizations must go through the same new club development.”
The distribution team began by taping the paper to announcement boards on each floor of VCW, but transitioned to sliding copies of each edition underneath students’ doors.
After distribution expanded to Harbin and New South, the team began placing copies of The Daily Dog at each freshman dorm’s front desk, instead of putting them under the doors, due to the increased workload.
Gile said that he has heard supportive feedback from the student body, and that their response has contributed to The Daily Dog’s expansion from VCW to the rest of the campus.
“We wouldn’t be this big, and we wouldn’t have grown this much in such a short time, if people didn’t like it,” Gile said. “When we stopped doing under-the-door delivery every day, people started to ask where it went.”
Marco Cull (SFS ‘18) said that he appreciates the creativity and convenience of The Daily Dog.
“I think it’s a cool concept,” Cull said. “I think a lot of people don’t read it, but it has plenty of potential for spreading information. It’s convenient, more than anything else. Unfortunately, I don’t read it often. But when I have read it, I haven’t regretted it. It’s well-written, relevant and, again, convenient.”

Students from Birzeit University in the West Bank spoke about violations of the right to education under Israeli occupation in an event sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday.
The students visited Georgetown as a stop on their U.S. Right to Education Tour, a two week trip to U.S. college campuses during which they have discussed their experiences as students in the West Bank.
The students emphasized that the conflict between Israel and Palestine affected them due to Israeli occupation.
“It’s not the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it’s the occupation. They are occupying us, our lands,” Hala Khalil, one of the students on the tour, said.
Ahmad Shwieki, another Birzeit student, said that one major violation of the right to education comes as a result of roadblocks that make it difficult for students to travel to school.
“Israel’s consistent policy is building road blocks, checkpoints, which are almost 600 by the U.N. stats,” Shwieki said. “So this consistent cutting of Palestine areas also affect Palestine students’ ability to get mobility and to reach their schools and universities.”
According to Shwieki, roadblocks restrict the schools that students can attend, and often make it difficult for particularly promising students to attend the best schools. He also claimed that the long travel times that result from the roadblocks impact students’ ability to spend a full day at school.
“Parents should be allowed to decide what school their kids go to, until the age of 15, by the international law,” Shwieki said. “We see that Palestinians don’t get to choose their school. They only find it possible to go to the nearby school because they cannot go to further schools.”
The speakers also discussed how the Israeli army’s break-ins at the university impact their quality of life.
“Occupation violates Birzeit University by breaking into the university,” Khalil said. “By breaking in, they made the campus empty by 2. Students go home at 2. The campus closes at 4. So we can’t stay on campus after 4. The library closes at 4 o’clock too so we can’t have a social life, we can’t see our friends after 4.”
Shwieki added that Israeli censorship of books permitted in Palestinian schools harms his education.
“We see that Israel controls the kind of books that get in Palestine,” Shwieki said. “Israel does not allow any book from Lebanon, does not allow any book from Syria, almost does not allow any philosophy books in Palestine.As a person who’s interested in philosophy, I rarely find books in Palestine that talk about philosophy.”
After giving their first hand accounts of experience, the students asked the audience to assist in boycotting Israel.
“Just know that supporting the oppressors is kind of being an oppressor with them,” Shwieki said.
Students for Justice in Palestine Treasurer Matt Martin (COL ’16) noted the large discrepancy between life as a Georgetown student and one at Birzeit.
“Beyond their front gates of their school are checkpoints and armored trucks. Beyond our front gates here is Washington, D.C. and everything it stands for,” Martin said.
Attendee Kathleen Bouzis (GRD ’15) felt that the right to education should be seen as a universal necessity.
“I think just the right to education is universal, no matter what your citizenship is and that no matter what the political situation is, people should have the right to be educated,” Bouzis said.

After 100 years of continuous publication, Ye Domesday Booke, Georgetown’s undergraduate yearbook, may not be published this year after the graduation of its two editors this coming spring.
In the 2011-2012 academic year, the yearbook only had one editor and was dropped from the Media Board, moving under the direct purview of the Center for Student Engagement. Director of the Center for Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr said that the decision was made when the Media Board no longer saw the publication as an opportunity for student involvement.
“During the 2011-2012 academic year there were transition issues for the student organization Ye Domesday Booke and the organization didn’t transition new students to become editors,” Cohen Derr wrote in an email. “The Media Board at the time considered the role of the yearbook as a student organization, and ultimately determined that it had become less of an involvement opportunity for students to serve as organizational leaders and more of a service for students — primarily seniors — to capture their senior year,”
This transition into the CSE was in large part due to financial issues.
“It wasn’t making money, there wasn’t a staff. The staff had died off. There wasn’t someone to step up as editor,” Ye Domesday Booke’s Editor-in-Chief Emily Coccia (COL ’15) said. “There was a threat that it would not exist anymore.”
After joining the publication as an editor in 2011 and working with just one other student in producing the yearbook, Coccia was left with the task all to herself with no assistance the following year.
“So it was a lot of sort of sitting alone in Starbucks and stuff like that trying to sort through pictures,” Coccia said.
In large part, this effort was unappreciated due to the general lack of awareness on campus of its existence.
“Sophomore year — that was the year I ended up doing the whole thing alone and telling people that and people just still not knowing that it existed was a hard thing,” Coccia said, “It was hard. It sort of had to be a self-deprecating sense of humor type of thing.”
The lack of visibility is the cause of many issues the production faces. The yearbook’s sports editor, Caroline Egan (COL ’15), expressed her difficulties in getting student groups to send in photos.
“I think what happens too often is that we reach out to clubs and we’re like, ‘Hey, can you send in photos?’ And they basically tell us, ‘Oh we had no idea you were a thing. We don’t have any photos. Sorry,’” Egan said.
After efforts in the past two years to increase visibility, there has been a slow growth in recognition.
“Last year we got [photos] from some of the groups that we had never gotten photos from before. We were able to get their photos rather than sort of reaching out just to individuals we knew,” Coccia said.
The yearbook’s popularity has declined throughout the past decade because of the rise of social media, which allows students to access photos and keep in touch with their classmates for free.
Sales increased by about 100 yearbooks last year, though, with sales of around 1,100 to 1,200 books last year, which marked the first time the yearbook has turned a profit in recent years. Students can purchase yearbooks for $85.
“Admittedly it’s sort of been a one- or two-person show, but we turned a profit starting my sophomore year,” Coccia said.
According to Egan, part of the growth can be attributed to the appeal of owning a hard copy in the digital age.
“One thing that I think is awesome is that sales are going up and we are increasing our visibility at least to some extent. And I think also in this age of everything being online, people are realizing how it’s nice to have a physical object to remember their time at Georgetown,” Egan said.
In addition to senior portraits, the yearbook includes photos and information about clubs and teams.
However, with only 35 likes on the yearbook’s Facebook page, this visibility continues to be limited, although seniors receive email notifications and fliers in the mail.
Because of the visibility problems, the yearbook may not have an editor for production this year, which will take place during the summer. Its continuation will depend on involvement from new members. Applications are available at all times throughout the year, and anyone in the Georgetown community, including alumni and faculty as well as students, is permitted to join.
“Spring and summer is really where we do the bulk of our work. So we have a few freshmen and a few underclassmen who had mentioned that they would really like to get involved, and if we can train them this spring and help them with it this summer, I think that would really be what we need to keep it going,” Egan said.
Since its transition to CSE, Ye Domesday Booke has received financial and other administrative support.
“The university pays for the book and then the university gets money back with the revenue, and we also have ads and parents can buy pages for their kids in the back of the book, so all of that revenue goes through CSE. I don’t end up dealing with any of it,” Coccia said.
The CSE also helps the editors with coordination, which can be difficult for an understaffed publication.
“[Cohen Derr] is really helpful about coordinating stuff with the Senior Class Committee, sending out calls for pictures to the senior class,” Coccia said.
There is a $40 fee for senior portraits, which is waived for students who purchase the yearbook.
Coccia and Egan said that they are hopeful the continuation of the yearbook, especially after its 100th anniversary last year.
“It’s a tradition that has gone on through the generations of Hoyas that I really hope will be continued,” Egan said.
Ye Domesday Booke also functions as a sort of time capsule for each student, according to Coccia.
“I think there is something to be said for also having sort of memories, even if they are not yours, getting to read about what other people were doing when you were at college … and really getting a snapshot of what your life was like for those four years,” Coccia said.
Pauline Huynh (MSB ’15) said that she does not feel the need to purchase a yearbook because of how large each class is.
“In high school you kind of know everyone and there are a lot less clubs but in college you’re not going to know all 7,000 students and you’re realistically only going to be involved in maybe two or three activities out of the hundreds on campus,” Huynh said.
Cristina Fletcher (SFS ’15) said that she would like to get a yearbook if it is reflective of the individuals that make up the senior class.
“I think it’s a good investment for those who have strong ties to Georgetown and who really loved their college experience. I think it’s a tangible memories of the experiences,” Fletcher said. “But that being said, I don’t know the specifics about the yearbook and how much space each student gets. If it’s just your picture and that’s it, then I’m not sure I’d buy one.”

Hypothetically speaking, if I had purchased a yearbook last year, how would I go about receiving it?

A D.C. Council vote on a bill that would make it easier for cyclists and pedestrians to collect damages in road accidents was delayed for a second time Wednesday evening, facing increasing opposition from the insurance industry and several council members.
The Bicycle and Motor Vehicle Collision Recovery Amendment Act of 2014 would protect vulnerable road users by establishing a comparative negligence standard to replace the current provision. Under the current system, termed “contributory negligence,” if one party of a collision is found to be at all responsible, that party cannot collect any damages. The change to a comparative standard would allow for injured parties to receive damages in proportion to each party’s negligence.
D.C. Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large), one of the bill’s sponsors, said he does not believe the bill will pass this year, attributing the resistance to the bill to the long history of contributory negligence standards in the city and in neighboring states. Although 46 states have already adopted the updated comparative standards, Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia all still have contributory negligence laws on the books.
“It’s a matter of justice when it comes to incidents where somebody has been injured or something has happened that you make sure people are covered for their injuries,” Grosso said. “To say that 1 percent on your part would totally preclude you from anything is a huge mistake.”
Washington Area Bicyclist Association Advocacy Coordinator Greg Billing called the current D.C. law antiquated, as most other states switched over to comparative negligence between the 1960s and 1980s. He stressed the importance of looking to the success of the rest of the nation when considering this specific bill.
“We’re definitely not leading. We’re trying to catch up,” he said. “Why that’s helpful is that it gives the lawmakers 46 other states’ histories of what laws they changed and how that affected the jurisdiction. We can pick the best model out there that protects some things that trial lawyers want to protect, but still moves us to a fairer standard.”
Despite the widespread comparative negligence laws, the insurance agencies still oppose the bill, since they considerably benefit from contributory negligence as they can deny coverage to any person found at least somewhat responsible for a collision
Vice President of the American Insurance Association Eric Goldberg told The Washington Post that a system of comparative fault results in higher insurance costs, which could be problematic for lower-income D.C. residents.
“When costs go up, people who are most affected are people with few means. They are the ones who are least able to afford these cost increases and they may drop the coverage and that doesn’t benefit anybody,” Goldberg told The Washington Post.
According to the most recent data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2012 saw a 6.4 percent increase in pedestrian fatalities and a 7.1 percent increase in motorcycle rider fatalities from 2011.
Billing said that that even if the specific bill fails to pass the council, the problem of protecting vulnerable road users must be addressed.
“Those numbers are trending upward, so the problem is not going away, and the number of people that are in crashes and have their claims denied are not going away, so we will continue to pursue solutions to this problem,” Billing said. “We’re going to push for this change because it’s an important one.”
Grosso said in negotiations and amendments to the bill moving forward, he will focus on broadening the legislation to include all road users, as the narrow focus on bicyclists and pedestrians was a cause of concern for several council members. Future versions of a comparative negligence bill will likely cover all types of collisions.
“When I introduced it, I probably should have been more cautious about making sure I included everybody from the beginning — all vulnerable users of our roadway,” he said.
Alyssa Kasher (COL ’15), captain of Club Triathlon, said she often feels unsafe riding her bike in the Georgetown area, particularly with the heavy traffic, though there have not been any accidents with the club’s members this semester.
“A lot of popular cycling routes have road signs that warn drivers to yield or watch for cyclists, but many drivers ignore these warnings. There have been many instances, especially over the summer, where I’ve been pushed off the road by a car that didn’t want to make space as it passed,” she said.
Kasher urged the city to take more steps to protect cyclists, starting with the comparative negligence bill.
“Increased protection would definitely be better for the team,” she said. “Everybody on the team should be comfortable riding on the roads in D.C., and the current reality is that driving behavior makes it difficult for all levels of cyclists to feel safe.”

Andrew Scott Cooper, a specialist in U.S.-Iran relations at the Middle East Institute, spoke about the troubled relationship between the two countries in an event co-sponsored by the Center for Australian, New Zealand and Pacific Studies and the Center for Security Studies Thursday.
Cooper, who has previously worked in the United Nations and the Human Rights Watch and is currently a columnist for PBS/Frontline’s Tehran Bureau, discussed the role of the United States in the Iranian revolution.
“The revolution might be over inside the country,” Cooper said. “But as far as historians are concerned, the revolution has just started. We have now 35 years out of the revolution, Carter administration documents have just started to come out in the last 12 months and this is going to be a very rich time for people such as myself, who are wanting to go back and look at the U.S response inside Iran and how this affected repercussions and relations today.”
In terms of Iranian sentiment toward the United States, Cooper reminded the audience about the events which occurred during World War II.
“When we talk about the U.S. and Iran going to war, it is important to keep in mind that the U.S. invaded Iran and occupied it in 1943,” Cooper said. “Given that they have done that, the Iranians will say that they sent tanks during World War II, together with the British and the Russians. People haven’t forgotten that, they have memories of the occupation by the great powers.”
Cooper also talked about his specific perspective as a historian who researches topics that are most commonly debated by political scientists.
“Why am I here? Why am I not a political scientist? We historians have, I think, a really important role because we are neutral, we are coming at this from decades down the line, we are going back, we are trying to perform a critical evaluation of any surviving principles,” Cooper said. “What I try to do is build a picture of what is going and it is a very exciting frontier of research for to me involved, looking at this poisoned relationship, as I’ve defined it myself.”
Cooper said that U.S. citizens should look at Iran now with a more modern point view instead of being caught up on past events.
“When I read The Washington Post, The New York Times, I’m so discouraged,” Cooper said. “I’m so discouraged to see that people are still living in the world of 1979. This needs to change and I hope that I’m one of the new generations of younger scholars that will help make that change happen.”
Madeline Westrick (SFS ’18) said she was was intrigued by Cooper’s perspective on so many pivotal details that shaped U.S.-Iran relations into what they are today.
“I think that the talk given by Dr. Cooper really stands out from everything that I have ever read before on Iran. I really appreciated how he did not focus on the issue of nuclear weapons, which I feel is always the main focus when it comes to Iran,” Westrick said. “His focus on historical facts gave me a much more in- depth understanding of how things came to what they are. It was very interesting to see a talk by a historian instead of the usual political scientist. I think that was very refreshing.”
Marcela Gelhoren (MSB ’18) said she was also captivated by the talk because of her interest in international politics.
“Cooper’s historical background taught me a lot about Iran and made me greatly appreciate the importance of looking at the past in order to understand the present and even prospects for the future,” Gelhoren said.”I really liked how he emphasized areas which scholars usually choose not to, but which are extremely important in order to understand the full picture.”
