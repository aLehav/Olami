The Georgetown S.T.O.P. Coalition, which advocates for black female survivors of sexual assault, called for greater trauma support for black women and femmes on campus in a letter delivered to the office of University Provost Robert Groves on March 22.
The petition has garnered signatures from 315 undergraduate students, including Georgetown University Student Association President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20). 
The letter drop was organized by S.T.O.P. and preceded by a walkout into Red Square. The drop comes after a March 13 discussion about masculinity hosted by the Black House revealed a lack of resources and university support for black women and femmes, according to the petition.
Chloe Diggs (COL ’19), co-organizer of S.T.O.P., read the letter to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Senior Associate Dean Adanna Johnson in the lobby of the provost’s office, requesting an official response to the letter’s demands by March 29. Olson thanked the students for the letter and promised a response would be issued by their requested deadline.
The university must listen to black women about their experiences to develop appropriate resources, said Nile Blass (COL ’22), a student involved in the letter drop.
“It’s OK, in dealing with these types of issues and hearing the way that black women feel, if you don’t have any inherent experience tied to it,” Blass said. “It’s OK to not know; it’s just not OK to dismiss them or to dismiss us.”
The proposal calls for the hiring of an additional black trauma specialist. Currently, Jennifer Wiggins, assistant director for sexual assault response and prevention services, is the only black trauma specialist working on campus. 
The letter also requests the university increase representation of black professionals in the Title IX office and the Office of Student Conduct to assist students with filing Title IX reports. The university has not had a full-time Title IX coordinator since Laura Cutway left her position unexpectedly in June 2018. Samantha Berner has been serving as both Title IX investigator and Title IX coordinator as the university searches for a new coordinator. 
However, the university should not neglect qualifications and experience in pursuit of increased representation, Blass said.
“It’s not just hiring more black people, it’s hiring reputable, comprehensive, educated-in-that-area-of-policy black women and men and nonbinaries who can handle these things,” Blass said. “What I don’t want is for us to be so committed in pushing forward for diversity and then it not actually be represented in the policies because the black people that they then hire in response aren’t actually educated, experienced and prepared in the areas they’re supposed to help us grow.”
S.T.O.P. is designed to be an acronym that can be interpreted multiple ways, according to the petition. While the “S” always stands for survivors, the following three letters are interchangeable for phrases based on each survivor’s interpretation, according to the petition.
Potential meanings include Survivors Targeting Oppressive Policies, Survivors Taking Out Perpetrators, Survivors Transforming Our Pain, Survivors Taking Our Place, Survivors Telling Our Perspectives and Survivors Tending Organic Power.
In addition to greater representation in campus offices, S.T.O.P. seeks to develop comprehensive sexual assault education on campus that goes beyond programming developed by Health Education Services. The coalition also aims to strengthen relationships between ally offices such as the Women’s Center and implement increased implicit bias training for Georgetown University Police Department officers that is designed with student input.
Students also proposed an evaluation and oversight system under which S.T.O.P. would publish a letter grade for the university each semester based on its compliance with the coalition’s demands. Students’ voices must be included to ensure that any new initiatives are in touch with the needs of black women and femmes on campus, Diggs told Olson at the drop. 
Coalition leaders intentionally made the language around gender identity in the letter inclusive to all female-identifying individuals, according to Diggs.
“In this letter, the use of ‘womxn,’ as opposed to ‘women,’ is meant to speak directly to the experiences of both black women and femmes,” Diggs said. 
Olson told the students that initial discussions about the letter would take place internally when asked by Shakera Vaughan (COL ’19), president of Georgetown University Women of Color, if students would be part of the administration’s discussions in response to the letter.
“I see all your concerns as legitimate,” Olson said. “I don’t know what else to say in this moment. I take it very seriously. I promise that we will answer that question directly by next Friday. I don’t know what more I can say that would be satisfying.”
Vaughan told Olson that the university’s actions in response to the letter are more important than a written or verbal response. 
Blass hopes the university will take serious action to provide the desired resources and stressed the role allyship plays in S.T.O.P.’s work. 
“It can’t just be us,” Blass said. “Because if it’s just us who are outraged, who are upset, who see the necessity of change, then nothing’s going to get done, because we can’t really do it by ourselves.”
Correction: This article has been updated with the correct last name of Nile Blass.

Georgetown University purchased a full block of property half a mile from the U.S. Capitol Building on March 18, less than two months after Johns Hopkins University acquired the Newseum Building a few blocks away.
With this new property at 500 First St. NW, Georgetown plans to expand the Georgetown University Law Center campus, house administrative offices and accommodate graduate programs, according to a university statement released March 19. The $70 million purchase follows a push by U.S. universities including the University of California, New York University and Arizona State University to bring student programs to Washington, D.C., according to The Washington Post.
The physical proximity of the property grants students greater exposure to the nation’s political center, according to Law Center Dean William Treanor.
“The building location is ideal, located just steps from the U.S. Capitol and the U.S. Supreme Court,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It also allows the Law Center to expand its footprint, completing a city block for the University.”
The building will accommodate new academic programs, including the Center for Security and Emerging Technology, the largest center focused on artificial intelligence and security policy in the country. 
The expansion is being funded by Law Center alumnus and Boardwalk Auto Group owner Scott Ginsburg (LAW ’78), who donated $10.5 million to the project. Ginsburg’s donation is the largest single donation to the Law Center in the school’s history.
Ginsburg also donated to the Scott K. Ginsburg Sport and Fitness Center at the Law Center, located in the same block as the new 500 First St. NW property. Georgetown hopes that Ginsburg’s donation will inspire more contributions, according to a university statement released March 19.
The Capitol Applied Learning Lab, which will offer undergraduate students internship opportunities and provide academic opportunities related to policy and public service, will also be housed in the building. 
The location is set to facilitate CALL students’ integration in downtown D.C., according to Randall Bass, vice provost for education and a CALL administrator.  
“The whole purpose of the CALL is to create a place downtown that can be a nexus for student immersion experiences in internships and related opportunities,” Bass wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Having the building is critical for that. It will serve as the home base for the cohort of students at the CALL.”
Administrators plan to incorporate student ideas as they redesign the new building, according to Bass.
“We want to make it as comfortable and multi-functional as possible,” Bass wrote. “We also want to engage the first cohort of students in helping us to customize the space to feel like their space. We want to co-design the look and feel with the students.”
Certain McCourt School of Public Policy classes are also set to relocate to the new building, according to McCourt School Dean Maria Cancian.
“We are excited to expand the McCourt School’s presence to Capitol Hill,” Cancian wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The move creates new opportunities to collaborate with our Law Center colleagues on key issues like technology, climate and immigration policy.”
Georgetown purchased the 130,000 square foot property from Office Properties Income Trust, a real estate investment trust. The property was originally built in 1969 and was vacant before Georgetown purchased it Monday, though the building once functioned as the Federal Bureau of Prisons headquarters.
Graduate students will reap the benefits from the property acquisition as their programming moves closer together, according to Treanor.
“Having the ability to bring together centers and institutes from across campus in one location will be extremely beneficial for our students, allowing them to work across disciplines with top experts addressing critical global issues today,” Treanor wrote.

The D.C. Circulator Bus, which provides transportation across six different routes in the District and Rosslyn, Va., will continue to provide service to riders free of charge indefinitely, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced during the State of the District address Monday. 
The Circulator began operating for free Feb. 1 as part of the “#FairShotFebruary” initiative, launched by the mayor’s office to improve access to city services for D.C. residents. The extension comes amid Bowser’s push to improve affordability and accessibility in housing and public transport during her second term in office.
Eliminating the Circulator’s cost, which used to be $1 per ride, has helped make public transportation more affordable for residents, who have expressed their desire for the continuation of the program, Bowser said in her address. 
“We may not think about it, because it’s just a dollar each way, two dollars a day, but for a working person, it adds up,” Bowser said in her address.
Bowser’s commitment to improving the accessibility of public transport also includes calling on the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to reinstate late-night services on the Metro. 
A strong system of public transport is vital to D.C. residents, according to Bowser.
“We know a resilient and sustainable public transportation system is the key to building a resilient and sustainable city,” Bowser said.
Late-night Metro hours need to be reinstated to help public transportation cater to workers with varying schedules, Bowser said. In a Feb. 28 vote, the Metro board elected to continue on a reduced-hours schedule, despite a petition circulated by Bowser for the restoration of late hours.
“We have always prioritized safety, reliability and building the capacity for Metro,” Bowser said in her address. “So now we need a commitment from Metro that they will return to late-night hours and that they will not become a system that only caters to white-collar workers commuting from the suburbs.”
Ride-share subsidies, proposed by Metro to subsidize Uber, Lyft and other ride-share trips for late-night workers, are not an adequate substitute for reinstituting late-night services, Bowser said.
“We’re not going to replace Metro with Uber and Lyft because we can’t move our region forward by further clogging our roads,” Bowser said. “We need a Metro system that works as hard as our workforce and stays open as late as our region.” 
Bowser also announced a $122 million investment in a new K Street Transitway that would create a middle lane for buses on K Street. This investment will help improve road accessibility and safety in D.C., according to Bowser. 
In addition to improving public transportation, guaranteeing affordable housing as property values in D.C. continue to rise remains a priority of Bowser’s administration, the mayor said in her address.
“We know the number one issue on the minds of Washingtonians is affordable housing,” Bowser said. “Rising housing costs have created new challenges for homeowners and renters alike, particularly for those on a fixed income and those who are struggling to make ends meet.”
Bowser also promised millions of dollars to District programs that aim to ease housing costs for D.C. residents in her address. Bowser proposed an additional $2 million in funding for the “Safe at Home” program, which provides seniors and adults with disabilities with preventative adaptations such as handrails and chairlifts to reduce accidents.
Bowser also proposed increasing investment in affordable housing by granting $30 million more in funding to the Housing Production Trust Fund, which aids in the production of low- to moderate-income-accessible housing projects.
Recognizing D.C.’s high homeless population, Bowser used her address to announce that D.C. will invest $26 million in Homeward D.C., a strategic plan with the goal of eliminating long-term homelessness in D.C. by 2020. D.C. also plans to invest $11 million to support recently opened family shelters across the District, according to Curbed DC, a local D.C. news outlet.
By using funds taxed from commercial real estate transactions, the city will be able to invest in generating affordable housing, Bowser said. 
“In the coming fiscal year, we’re asking our commercial property owners to share some of the upside,” Bowser said.“With this budget, we will capture more from commercial real estate transactions and therefore be able to invest more in affordable housing.”
Current policies should be altered to focus on supporting the livelihoods of all D.C. residents, according to Bowser. 
“In a city as prosperous as ours, it is our responsibility to decide how and when we adjust our policies to ensure that everyone living and doing business in the District is giving and getting their fair share,” Bowser said.

The Georgetown Scholars Program emphasized allyship through its family dinner, a film screening and the organization’s first speaker series event during its fifth annual GSP Advocacy Week, also known as GSProud.
Founded in 2004, the Georgetown Scholars Program has served over 1,600 first-generation and low-income Georgetown students and currently provides support for over 650 undergraduates, according to the GSP website.
GSP helps even the playing field between low-income and first-generation students and their affluent peers, according to Aleida Olvera (COL ’20), the vice president of the Georgetown University Student Association and a member of GSP.
“It’s easy to forget that financial stability is something students struggle with when the median family income at Georgetown is $229,100, whereas only 3.1% of students’ family income falls in the bottom 20%,” Olvera wrote in an email to The Hoya. “With GSP, the ground is somewhat leveled with our affluent peers.”
The group’s advocacy week raises awareness of and support for first-generation students at Georgetown, which has a reputation of attracting a relatively wealthy student body, according to GSP Executive Director Melissa Foy (COL ’03).
GSP debuted its speaker series, which served as a forum for Georgetown students, staff and faculty to share their experiences and reflect on ways to create a more supportive environment for first-generation and low-income students, March 21.
The series featured professors, students and alums, including Marcia Chatelain, Queen Adesuyi (COL ’16), Hashwinder Singh (COL ’20) and Derrick Arthur-Cudjoe (NHS ’19). (Full disclosure: Arthur-Cudjoe formerly served as a staff photographer for The Hoya.)
This year, GSP prioritized in-person events over social media posting. Liz Fieschko (SFS ’20), GSP strategic partnerships and advocacy team member, highlighted the goal of creating a stronger relationship not only among GSP members but also within the Georgetown community as a whole throughout GSP Advocacy Week.
“Throughout our programming and outreach campaign for GSProud2019, we hoped to make clear our theme of allyship,” Fieschko wrote in an email to The Hoya. “With these efforts, the GSProud Campaign, today, serves as reminder of the aspiration for a more integrated and interconnected Georgetown.”
The week began on Monday night with the “GSProud: I Am Phenomenal” dinner for GSP members. GSP partnered with female arts magazine Bossier for a “Colors of Your Personality” creative painting event Wednesday.
GSP hosted a screening of the documentary film “Unlikely,” which depicts five individuals’ stories regarding the college dropout crisis and the barriers in students’ educational and professional pursuits, Thursday evening.
This year’s GSP advocacy week comes at a time when many first-generation and low-income students at Georgetown may need more support and recognition from the university as a whole given the recent college admissions scandal. 
Through GSP advocacy week, GSP staff members and student leaders hope to send out a message of solidarity and inclusivity to both GSP and non-GSP members at Georgetown, according to Olvera.
“For students in GSP, I hope this week encourages you to use your story and experiences to leave an impact in whatever spaces you occupy,” Olvera said. “You belong at Georgetown. We bring in perspectives, experiences and narratives that no one else has. Be proud of the work you put into getting into this university and the work that you are putting in to graduate.”
This article was updated March 27 to correct GSP’s new name and Adesuyi’s class year.

The McCourt School of Public Policy and the McDonough School of Business both performed well in recently released nationwide and global surveys, with the MSB named first in the world for having the best-trained MBAs. 
The McCourt School moved up across three specialty categories in the latest U.S. News & World Report’s Best Schools of Public Affairs ranking released March 12. The school rose a combined 17 spots from last year’s rankings, with the largest increase in the public management and leadership category, from No. 33 to No. 21 out of 282 schools. Overall, the McCourt School placed in the top 10 percent of public policy graduate programs nationwide.
The McCourt School’s higher rankings are evidence of the meaningful work conducted at the school, according to Dean of the McCourt School of Public Policy Maria Cancian. 
“In my short time here, I have been incredibly impressed with our students, and the teaching and scholarship taking place at our school and research centers,” Cancian wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is great to see the growing reputation and impact of McCourt reflected in the U.S. News specialty rankings.”
McDonough’s MBA programs were also ranked highly in a March 6 survey of recruiter responses conducted by Bloomberg Businessweek, where the school was first in the world for having the best-trained graduates. Additionally, McDonough was in the top seven schools of all six categories surveyed.
McDonough’s rating from the employer survey is positive for the school’s reputation, Senior Associate Dean of MBA programs Prashant Malaviya said.
“According to business leaders, our MBA graduates are among the best trained in the world for serving the needs of global businesses,” Malaviya wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These graduates have relevant knowledge, skill sets and mindsets to make a strong contribution to business, and they do this in a way that also makes a positive difference in society.”
In the survey of recent full-time MBA graduates conducted last spring, MBA recruiters listed McDonough as first in the world for having the best-trained graduates. Additionally, it was ranked third in the world for both having the most creative graduates and for showing exceptional entrepreneurial skills.
Businesses often seek individuals who can identify creative solutions to issues spanning business, policy, law and diplomacy, according to Malaviya. The rankings are a reflection of the well-rounded education that Georgetown provides, centered in Jesuit values, Malaviya wrote.
 “Such an education is possible at Georgetown because of our location in DC, because of our world-renowned colleges and because of our Jesuit heritage,” Malaviya wrote.
In the U.S. News rankings, The McCourt School was No. 25 nationwide, placing it in the top 10 percent of public affairs graduate programs in the United States.
Compared to last year’s rankings, the McCourt School performed better in three categories: international global policy and administration, public policy analysis, and public management and leadership. In a new specialty area, social policy, the school was ranked No. 20 out of more than 280 programs. 
The rankings reflect the school’s growth and increased stature in academia and policy communities, Michael A. Bailey, the Colonel William J. Walsh Professor of American Government and professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“We’re a relatively young school and it is great to see that our rankings-based reputation is catching up with the reality,” Bailey wrote.
The McCourt School officially launched in October 2013 following a record-breaking gift of $100 million from former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt Jr. (COL ’75). The gift provided the resources to increase the number of faculty at the school, expand scholarship funds to attract gifted students and support innovative research aimed at solving complex policy problems.
The McCourt School has continued to focus on expanding its research capabilities by hiring notable faculty and building strong community connections, according to Bailey.
“We are building more ties to the policy community, ties that will help us affect policy and will also inform our research and teaching,” Bailey wrote.
In recent years, the McCourt School has brought on notable scholars such as Nobel Laureate George Akerlof and distinguished professors like Pamela Herd, Sheila Foster and Donald Moynihan. In September 2015, the McCourt School launched the Institute of Politics and Public Service, or GU Politics, to foster public service and empower students to engage with the practice of politics.
Although the higher ranking is encouraging, the primary focus of the McCourt School is to continue increasing its influence as a public policy school, Cancian said. 
“While we are gratified by the positive results, our focus is on expanding our impact and reach,” Cancian wrote. “We will continue to focus on producing the highest quality policy-relevant research, effective engagement with policy makers, and giving our exceptional students the tools and experience needed to lead across public, nonprofit and private institutions to contribute to the common good.”

The Catholic Church needs to incorporate indigenous people into its environmental advocacy to effectively combat the degradation of the Amazonian ecosystem, Catholic priests and environmental activists said March 20.
A movement to protect the environment must incorporate indigenous peoples in its advocacy, according to Patricia Gualinga, an indigenous rights activist from the Kichwa people of Ecuador.
“This struggle that is coming at us and which will come cannot find us isolated or fragmented, because the situation is going to be so complex that it needs to be done not only for the indigenous people in the Amazon, but for the whole planet,” Gualinga said at the March 20 press conference.
Gualinga spoke with other indigenous rights activists and church officials at the press conference for a three-day convention titled “Integral Ecology: A Synodal Response from the Amazon and Other Essential Biomes/Territories for the Care of our Common Home,” hosted by Georgetown. The event brought together church leaders, indigenous human rights activists and members of Red Eclesial Panamazónica, a network of Latin American church officials and indigenous groups that aims to counter environmental degradation across the world. REPAM organized “Integral Ecology” as part of its efforts to address environmental threats facing indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon.
Though “Integral Ecology” was closed to the press and public, priests and activists participated in the press conference to shed light on their working meetings.
Energy corporations are particularly responsible for devastating the land of indigenous communities, according to Cardinal Pedro Barreto, the archbishop of Huancayo, Peru, and the vice president of REPAM.
“The direct threats come many times from the corporations — the oil-extracting corporations — and often with cooperation from South American states,” Barreto said at the press conference. 
These corporations threaten the livelihood of the indigenous groups that have lived in Amazon for centuries, but often face punishment for advocating for their rights, according to Gualinga.
“Communities are being criminalized; some are in prison, some are threatened and harassed,” Gualinga said. “This creates a lot of fear in those who are dedicated to protecting the Amazon.”
The church has focused on outreach to indigenous communities for its environmental efforts during the new papacy, according to Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., Georgetown associate professor of government and director of the Center for Latin American Studies. Carnes cited the Church’s collaboration with indigenous rights activists in forming REPAM as a recent example of this outreach at the conference.
The conference is inspired by Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical “Laudato Si,” a document that critiques environmental degradation and calls for the care of our planet as a common home. 
The conference also precedes an upcoming October 2019 synod, an assembly of bishops called by Francis. Titled “Amazonia: New Paths for the Church and for an Integral Ecology,” the synod will address issues similar to those highlighted in “Laudato Si” as they apply to the Amazon basin and will be the first in Church history focused on a particular region of the world.
The property rights of Amazonian indigenous people have to be respected because they settled on the threatened land long before others tried to extract resources from the land, according to Barreto.
“The indigenous peoples have been there in the rainforest for centuries,” Barreto said. “Nevertheless, they are not recognized as the owners of their land, and this is the most important issue at stake. So we need to learn from the indigenous to live in harmony with the land, with the earth, with the water.”
Deforestation will leave 27 percent of the Amazon without trees by 2030 if the current trend continues, a problem largely attributable to deforestation for agricultural and ranching land, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature, an environmental advocacy group.
The effort is focused on bringing together individual, small voices to form a powerful network, according to Barreto.
“I like to use the image of a river: here we are, little rivers, coming together into a big river and bringing the voices of the indigenous communities trying to speak out on behalf of the care of our common land,” Barreto said.

Developing countries have less incentive to model their economies after the United States and allies following the success of China’s economy amid global stagnation, according to international economist Dambisa Moyo.
People around the globe are increasingly skeptical of a Western model of markets and democracy. Distinct from the West’s emphasis on market liberalization and free enterprises, the Chinese model adopts a form of state-led capitalism. This is particularly relevant as countries in Africa face a choice between the Western and Chinese models of economic development, according to Moyo.
“We have now different models of geopolitics and economics, China being one example, that has proven themselves able to deliver economic growth in a sustained way and move hundreds of people out of poverty,” Moyo said in her March 19 keynote address.
Economic downturns across the globe have compounded skepticism towards market capitalism and liberal democracy, according to Moyo.
“Fundamentally, we are in an economic situation where economic growth has slowed and continue to slow, and we’ve run out of bullets,” Moyo said. “We’ve used a lot of traditional tools of economics, both in terms of monetary policies, like interest rates, and also fiscal policies.”
Fears of persistent weak economic performances and economic stagnation led the International Monetary Fund to cut its prediction of global economic growth in 2019 from 3.7 percent growth rate to 3.5 percent. In developing countries, the IMF predicted a decrease in economic growth due to trade tensions, increasing U.S. interest rates and volatile oil prices.
Moyo named six challenges that require solutions to prevent economic slowdowns and sustain growth: demographic changes, technological development, income inequality, natural resource scarcity, debt and productivity growth.
The keynote address was part of the Lannan Spring Literary Symposium and Festival titled “Africa Imagines: Reversing the Gaze,” which aimed to provide African perspectives on the continent’s economic development and global affairs. 
Hosted by the Lannan Foundation, Georgetown University’s Lecture Fund and the African studies program, the keynote address delivered by Dambisa Moyo focuses on international development and sustainable economic growth. Born in Zambia, Moyo is a global economist and worked at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. From 1993 to 1995, she co-authored the World Bank’s annual development report. Currently, she serves on the board of Barclays Bank.
Despite differences between the Western and Chinese models identified by Moyo, both face persistent issues of growing income inequality, she said.
“The biggest puzzle is that these two countries, number one and number two with complete different political systems and economic systems, have roughly the same Gini coefficient, which is the measurement of income inequality.”
In order to maintain the benefits that economic growth has granted countless citizens of developing countries, their governments must reckon with resource scarcity and excessive debt for sustainable development amid demographic growth and environmental challenges, according to Moyo.
“We have to figure out a way to ensure that people are going to be able to continue to enjoy improvements in their living standards, even though arable land, potable water, the supply of minerals and energy are increasingly becoming a challenge,” Moyo said. 
All of these considerations present important questions to world leaders who face important crossroads between liberal democracy and protectionism, according to Moyo.
“We are living at a time when the world is becoming more fractured; people are becoming more protectionist in terms of trade, in terms of ideas, in terms of movements of people, in terms of movements of capital,” Moyo said. “Globalization is under threat. The question is, ‘How do we move on from here?’”

A former Washington, D.C., employee pled guilty to federal bribery charges for distributing $1.4 million in food stamp and temporary assistance benefits to individuals in exchange for $380,000 and sexual favors.
Demetrius McMillan pled guilty March 14 following a yearlong investigation into federal fraud charges. McMillan had worked at the D.C. Department of Human Services for 13 years, and court documents show that the criminal conduct began last year, according to The Washington Post.
Between April and July 2018, McMillan made 779 fraudulent assistance payments to approximately 305 beneficiaries, 296 of whom were women. Authorities found text messages between McMillan and 50 of the women soliciting sexual favors as payment, according to a March 14 news release by the U.S. Attorney’s office.
McMillan also solicited more than $380,000 in cash commissions from those who received his payments, and accepted at least $150,000, according to the news release.
McMillan could spend nine to 11 years in prison, an estimation in accordance with federal sentencing guidelines. McMillan’s sentencing is set to occur in June, and he has already agreed to pay $1.46 million in restitution, according to NBC News. 
The case is currently being investigated by the FBI’s Washington Field Office, the D.C. Office of the Inspector General, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General to discern if McMillan abused his authority in any other capacities. Investigators announced publicly they will not comment at this time on whether new charges will be brought to light. Whether recipients of fraudulent payments will be held liable for any criminal offense remains unclear.
McMillan’s case occurred two weeks after another former federal employee was charged with fraud in late February. Gary T. Holliday, who also worked at the Department of Human Services, pled guilty to a federal wire fraud charge. Holliday fraudulently channeled the $400,000 to himself from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, a program that assists families for a limited time when guardians are unable to provide for their children’s basic needs, according to The Washington Post.
Both former employees manipulated the process of underpayments, in which social service workers authorized up to $2,000 in payment adjustments for clients enrolled in TANF or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.
There have been previous efforts to prevent fraudulent practices in the welfare system which have been directed towards recipients. Despite reports of SNAP fraud levels resting at 1.5 percent from a Jan. 2017 audit by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, D.C. initially launched a federally-funded advertising campaign in spring 2018 encouraging residents to report food-stamp fraud. However, DHS officials cancelled the campaign after receiving critiques accusing the ads of being insensitive and encouraging low-income individuals to spy on each other, according to The Washington Post.
The D.C. government plans to cooperate with investigators and takes these allegations seriously, according to Dora Taylor-Lowe, Public Information Officer of the Department of Human Services.
“The District government takes suspected abusive and fraudulent activity seriously, and will always work and cooperate with our local and federal partners to ensure that those who engage in criminal behavior are held accountable,” Taylor-Lowe wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Observers of potential fraudulent behavior should report such behavior, Taylor-Lowe wrote.
