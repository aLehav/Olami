Though wireless cell phone service was supposed to be available to riders in all parts of the D.C. Metro by Oct. 15, the project may not be completed for another three years.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority made an agreement in 2008 with Congress to have wireless service installed throughout the system by mid-October of this year, but officials announced Oct. 16 that the project will need to be extended until 2015.
The work was funded by the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, which allocated $1.5 billion to the transit agency that set an October 2012 deadline for the improvements. But after a 2009 Red Line crash in which nine people were killed, Metro focused its financial resources on safety issues, making cell service in the 106-mile system a lower priority. Metro officials made a deal with Congress last month to extend the deadline to March 2013.
Metro General Manager Richard Sarles sent a letter to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Oct. 15 stating that the project has required a level of coordination and logistical planning rarely seen in the transit industry and requesting that the deadline be moved to December 2015.
“We are further challenged by the fact that the work must take place as we also continue our highest priority of making urgent safety upgrades,” Sarles wrote in the letter.
According to Metro officials, a lack of qualified safety experts to escort the crews installing the equipment has also caused delay in the update process.
In a 2009 press release, Metro announced that it had made cellular service available in 20 of its busiest underground stations, including Rosslyn. It reported to Congress in 2011 that installations in 82 percent of the remaining stations were complete and that it has wired two stations since then.
Georgetown students expressed disappointment at the delays to the installation of service, citing the inconvenience presented by wireless dead zones.
“It’s inconvenient to not have service when you are trying to meet up with people somewhere else in the city, like at Union Station or Reagan [National] Airport,” Ashley Lozier (SFS ’16) said. “It’s frustrating when you do not have service to check the Metro schedule so you can figure out if they are running behind.”
Alex Vicas (COL ’16) added that lack of service in the Metro undermines his sense of security when using the system.
“This delay will affect my overall sense of security,” Vicas said. “Although I never feel in direct danger, this … will elevate my sense of caution.”

The humanities and writing general education requirement could see changes next year if a proposal aimed at strengthening the role of writing in the curriculum is approved this December.
Professors from the General Education Committee have developed a preliminary proposal recommending the introduction of a first-year writing seminar capped at 15 students, a humanities and writing requirement integrated into majors and the transformation of the second humanities and writing requirement into a broader arts and humanities distribution requirement.
The proposal will be presented to the Main Campus Executive Faculty Senate this Friday. According to English professor Randall Bass, the presentation will be an opportunity for the Faculty Senate to question and give feedback on the recommendations. If the committee addresses all concerns, the proposal will be put to a vote in December.
Currently, the humanities and writing requirement for all four schools consists of two courses: Humanities and Writing I and II. However, students who earn a four or five on the College Board Advanced Placement English Literature or English Language exam or a six or seven on the International Baccalaureate English Higher Level exam have the option of skipping the first course, while students in the School of Foreign Service that earn these AP or IB scores may skip the second requirement as well.
“A lot of students never actually take Humanities and Writing I due to AP credits, though on the books, everyone is supposed to take the two courses,” Bass said.
Under the new proposal, the Humanities and Writing I course would be replaced by a more writing-intensive class, according to Sherry Linkon, director of writing curriculum initiatives.
Linkon said that the new first-year writing seminar would place a greater emphasis on writing than the current Humanities and Writing I course does and that the criteria for opting out of the class will be a five on the AP English exam.
The second aspect of the proposal would integrate the humanities and writing requirement into major-specific courses. Bass stressed that this second requirement would not add credits to the overall general education requirements; instead, an existing course already in the core curriculum would place a stronger emphasis on developing writing techniques.
“We understand that students and faculty are often concerned that the general education program is requirement heavy,” Bass said. “The major requirement would be overlaid with current courses. It is not an additional course, so there is no increase in terms of actual course requirements.”
The final component of the proposal would allow a broader array of arts and humanities courses to fulfill the Humanities and Writing II requirement.
“This will preserve the importance of the role of humanities in general education so that there would still be a requirement for the humanities course, though it wouldn’t necessarily be a writing-specific course,” Bass said.
According to Linkon, the discussions about changing the requirements began several years ago in the university’s General Education Committee in preparation for last year’s Middle States accreditation process. However, the committee did not begin formalizing a proposal until the summer.
Bass said that the group is now examining input from various faculty members who are concerned about the effect of the revised requirement, though he was optimistic about the proposal’s future.
“There was a growing sense among faculty that we weren’t doing enough to pay attention to the strength of student writing as it progressed through the curriculum,” Bass said. “We want to strengthen it the first year but also throughout their time at the university.”
According to Bass, student input supported this idea.
“We had some evidence from students that they would like to have more attention on writing, which is not the same as being assigned more writing,” he said. “There was a feeling that the way we were teaching writing was out of sync with national practices.”
But some students said they did not want the writing requirement to change.
“I think it’s a good idea that they’re trying to help students and their writing skills, but I liked how my humanities and writing course was structured,” Carmen Hernandez (COL ’15), who took the Humanities and Writing I class, “Reading & Writing Seminar,” said. “We learned about other things besides just reading and writing.”
Courtney Choy (COL ’14), who took the Humanities and Writing II course, “Germanic Christian Hero,” agreed.
“I like the way the Humanities and Writing requirement program is right now, but the second course, the writing course integrated into majors, sounds like a good idea.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate passed a resolution endorsing the implementation of the new “clear and convincing” evidentiary standard at its meeting Sunday night.
Though the resolution expresses support for Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson’s decision to raise the standard, it also urges the university to extend the new standard to off-campus incidents.
Olson announced last Thursday afternoon that he had accepted the recommendation made by the Disciplinary Review Committee to raise the burden of proof to “clear and convincing” from “more likely than not” for all on-campus incidents other than sexual assault.
The change will come into effect Jan. 1 and will not apply to violations that happen off-campus, which will continue to be judged by the current “more likely than not” standard.
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, off-campus designates all non-university property. Incidents that occur in university-owned townhouses and East Campus will still be considered on-campus.
GUSA Senate Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) applauded past and current executive efforts that pushed for the change. He also acknowledged the senate for introducing bills at critical moments, including a bill that endorsed the Disciplinary Review Committee’s recommendation to raise the burden of proof last spring and a bill that introduced the evidentiary standard referendum in September.
“This resolution is a cumulative effort of the senate,” Tisa said.
Several off-campus senators, however, voiced concerns about the resolution’s failure to consider the rights of off-campus students.
“I think we do need to recognize that as significant as this is, it’s also very meek,” off-campus senator Sam Buckley (COL ’14), who voted against the bill, said.
Buckley expressed disappointment in the standard’s inconsistent application.
“We seem to be moving rather consistently in campus debates recently towards the system [in] which there is a separate set of standards being applied to on-campus and off-campus students. That’s deeply concerning,” Buckley said.
GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Zach Singer (SFS ’15) agreed with Buckley but argued that the resolution tempers its endorsement with criticism.
“I think this resolution balances both the step forward and the step that needs to be taken in the sense that we acknowledge we’re happy that the change is made —  which is better than no change being made — but we’re not fully satisfied with it,” Singer said.
Tisa acknowledged the need to push for equal rights for both on-campus and off-campus students but said that the evidentiary standard change will have a substantial effect on student life.
“It needs to be the policy of the student association that student rights can’t be denied or shifted,” Tisasaid. “However, for anyone on campus, which includes about 90 percent of all incidents that are adjudicated, they are now protected by this new standard.”
GUSA Chief of Staff Jake Sticka (COL ’13) expressed optimism that the standard would be expanded to apply to off-campus incidents.
“We’re committed to advocate for the standard to be extended to off-campus incidents,” he said. “In good faith conversation, it will occur.”

The Georgetown Heckler, Georgetown’s online humor magazine of record since 2003, has undergone a revival under new management this year.
“I put it on my resume that I ‘resuscitated a defunct news magazine’,” newly appointed Editor-in-Chief Henry Thaler (COL ’14) said.
After taking over for former Editor-in-Chief Dan Thoennessen (COL ’12), Thaler transformed the Heckler from a seldom-updated site to one that regularly posts satirical Georgetown-related news articles with headlines ranging from “Wi-Fi Cuts Out in ICC, Lord of the Flies Reenacted” to “Gluten-Free Freezer Actually Portal to Narnia.”
The Heckler has long considered itself the university’s gadfly.
“The definition of satire is to take a viewpoint and adopt it to specifically point out how untenable it is,” writer Joe Laposata (COL ’16) said.
According to former Editor-in-Chief Jack Stuef (COL ’10), past Heckler antics have gotten the magazine in trouble with the university.
“We made a fake Twitter account for [University President] John J. DeGioia, but the university had Twitter shut it down,” he said.
University administrators have also complained about using Georgetown’s name in the Heckler articles, Stuef said.
“You could always get the sense that the university didn’t like the Heckler and tried to marginalize it whenever they could,” he said. “The print issues always seemed to disappear.”
Now, with a staff of two consistent writers, Sam Kane (SFS ’14) and Laposata, Thaler is trying to rejuvenate the magazine’s online presence.
“We’ve changed it from being an online magazine where you put up an ‘issue’ every couple of months to updating it regularly as articles come up,” Thaler said.
Though reenergized, the magazine’s organization is mostly informal.
“It’s not a [SAC-approved] club. There’s no budget. I haven’t held a meeting, and I’ve met a couple of the writers but not all of them,” Thaler said. “I’m an editor, but it’s minimal responsibility.”
Still, Thaler, Laposata and Kane are discussing ways to increase the Heckler’s writing staff and expand its readership.
“We are going to think about expansion … when my midterms are over,” he said.
Laposata has taken it upon himself to generate weekly article ideas but ultimately creates his own work schedule. Each Monday, he composes a list of 10 articles he aims to write that week. All articles are edited by Thaler.
Because some topics can be considered offensive, Thaler, Laposata and Kane have adopted aliases to preserve their identities.
“Sometimes you’re making fun of a specific club, and if it was actually going to be written under my name I would be a little concerned … so writing under a pseudonym is not really a problem,” Kane said.
Laposata, who has posted 17 articles since the start of the semester, said he is not afraid of negative responses to his writing.
“I have not gotten to that [controversy] yet. It may come up, but I’m going to try to not be afraid about that,” he said. “I’m going to try to post what I can post with little fear of recrimination simply because this is free speech, and it is comedy.”

In response to the high theft rate at Georgetown in recent years, Lamar Dawson, the hall director for McCarthy, has launched an initiative to increase student awareness about on-campus safety measures.
Working in partnership with the Department of Public Safety, Dawson has implemented a variety of programs geared toward educating students about on-campus crime, safety precautions and resources provided by the university to combat crime.
In addition to raising awareness, Dawson envisions the program as a way of fostering a sense of community in the Southwest Quad.
“The mission is to foster inclusive and vibrant communities,” Dawson said. “You can’t have a vibrant community if it’s not safe.”
Citing the examples of SafeRides and a DPS service that allows students to engrave and register laptops and other valuables, Dawson said that Georgetown offers an array of safety resources of which many students are unaware.
“The biggest thing is that there are so many campus resources already that they can use to make sure they are being safe,” he said. “A lot of people don’t realize that service is even here.”
As part of the initiative, Dawson organized an event Oct. 16 and 17 in which students could meet Adrian Black, the DPS Liaison to Southwest Quad, and ask him a question in exchange for a cupcake. Dawson said the purpose of the event was to break down barriers between DPS officers and students.
Brian Monahan (COL ’15), a Resident Assistant in McCarthy Hall, attended the program.
“I thought it was a great way for the residents to interact with DPS in a different way than most people are used to,” he said. “DPS has a negative connotation among students, and having an officer there interacting with students and fielding their questions and addressing their concerns was great for both DPS and the residents.”
Black is one of several members of DPS assigned to various areas of campus as liaisons. According to Dawson, these officers attend staff meetings, participate in RA training and walk on rounds with RAs in high-activity communities. Black, who has been working with DPS since February, has been working closely with Dawson on his initiative.
Black agreed that the project is a good way to foster better relationships between DPS staff and students, adding that he would like to see more opportunities for similar interaction in the future.
“Students get to know us … on a one-on-one basis. It’s not so standoffish. … I just get up there and talk to people,” he said.
Monahan said he believes Dawson’s initiative is beneficial because it educates students about basic safety precautions.
“I think that it is often very easy to get lost in the ‘Georgetown bubble’ and be lured into a false sense of security,” he said
Dawson has also created a display in the lobby of McCarthy listing facts and figures about on-campus crime. According to RA Ellie Smith (COL ’13), McCarthy RAs are required to have at least one safety-themed bulletin board during the month of October.
“Students are becoming more aware that there is a general safety problem in our environment,” Smith said. “This program is about how you can protect and enforce your safety. It empowers students.”

Georgetown’s expanded Living Learning Communities, which now encompass ten living spaces in both dorms and townhouses, bring students with common interests together under one roof.
The LLCs include Bayit — the Jewish interest living area — Culture and Performance, Explore D.C., the French Floor, Global Living, The Greenhouse, Justice and Diversity in Action, Living Well, MagisRow and Muslim Interest.
“Living Learning Communities empower students to integrate academic achievement with co-curricular programs in a collaborative environment allowing students to connect their learning,” Associate Director of Residence Life Katie Heather wrote in an email. “Although each LLC is different, the goals are the same.”
These goals, according to Heather, include enhancing the overall educational experience of participants, establishing a sense of community and encouraging members to maintain the university’s traditions and mission.
Building a Home
This semester, students founded two new LLCs: Bayit and The Greenhouse.
“I thought it was time that Georgetown [developed] a space where students can … live sustainably,” Megan Griffin (COL ’14) wrote in an email about her idea for establishing The Greenhouse, an LLC devoted to the environment and sustainability. “A lot of other universities have had that for a long time. But then my idea expanded to include programming, outreach [and] trips, and I realized this community could help to influence Georgetown as a whole … and I think this approach will make The Greenhouse much more dynamic and inclusive.”
While most LLCs are the product of student efforts, others were created under different circumstances.
In 2010, the French Floor was established by late French professor Dorothy Betz’s husband, professor emeritus of English Paul Betz. Dorothy Betz had advocated for a Francophone floor during her time at the university.
“The French LLC is fairly new,” French Floor Residential Assistant Jessica Rempe (COL ’15) said. “It was basically designed to give students a place to practice speaking their French and to help prepare them for study abroad or returners who want to keep speaking French when they get back from their study abroad.”
Heather said that Residence Life hopes to add more LLCs as long as students and faculty remain interested.
“The long-term vision is to associate an academic class with a Living Learning Community,” Heather wrote. “This would add to the richness of the community and allow students and faculty to integrate the experience inside and outside of the classroom.”
The Muslim Interest Living Community is currently one of only two reliigous-based LLCs; however, approximately one-third of its residents are non-Muslims, according to student coordinator Shifa Kanjwal (SFS ’13).
“The Muslim Interest Living Community was actually created as a living space primarily for Muslim students, but also [for] non-Muslim students who share similar interests in community building, campus activism and service,” Kanjwal said. “It seeks to create a strong and supportive alternative living environment for students who want to focus on things like prayer and service.”
Cultivating Community
Although four LLCs this year are grade-level specific — Explore D.C., the French Floor, Magis Row and Muslim Interest — the four others are open to all students. However, of the four LLCs that allow students from all years to apply, only three — Justice and Diversity in Action, Culture and Performance and Global Living — have freshmen through seniors living together in one location.
Eric Nevalsky (SFS ’16), one of six freshmen living on the JDA floor, said the community has helped define his first year at Georgetown.
“I think it’s been good to be on a floor that’s all four years because then you aren’t sucked into the craziness of freshman year,” Nevalsky said. “I think the community is very welcoming. There are people … who have been there four years, so a lot of them came in as freshmen, [and] know what it’s like.”
Lisa Frank (COL ’13) has lived in JDA since freshman year and said that she appreciates living in an LLC that includes people from all years and provides opportunities to interact with other students.
“I like being a leader, to help people just coming to Georgetown [figure] out what they want to get involved with. The energy of having new people on the floor every year is fantastic,” Frank said. “JDA allows you to walk into any community on campus and say, ‘Hey I know this person.’”
Like JDA, the Culture and Performance LLC also includes students from every grade. This year, there are 11 freshmen on the floor.
“So far, I really love it. I am so glad that I am living here my freshman year,” JDA resident Ericka Mabrie (COL ’16) said. “I still have lots of opportunities to meet freshmen and hang out with freshmen, but here, I feel so welcomed by the older people on the floor. There were all just really friendly, and no one made me feel like, ‘Oh, I’m a freshman so I’m not a part of anything.’”
Students who have lived in LLCs said that the close-knit communities allow residents to build unique relationships.
“I think it’s really a great way to connect with like-minded people on campus [whom] you wouldn’t have gotten the opportunity to meet before, to engage in things like activism and interfaith dialogue and really live in a supportive environment that makes you feel comfortable to hone these as parts of your identity as a student on Georgetown’s campus,” Kanjwal said.
Heather reiterated this objective.
“Living Learning Communities offer residential students the opportunity to live with people who share their interests and passions,” Heather wrote. “Members of Living Learning Communities report that they feel a strong sense of community and have access to programs, events and faculty they would not have otherwise. LLCs enable students to apply and synthesize classroom learning with everyday personal experience and encounters.”
Looking back at her four years as a member of JDA, Frank said the LLC has defined her time at college.
“JDA has been the most important aspect of my experience at Georgetown so far because of the people you meet, the places you can go with it and the way JDA challenges you to do more.”

Increased store security and employee vigilance have helped prevent theft from Students of Georgetown, Inc. retail locations since late January, according to Chief Operating Officer and Vice President Stephanie Wolfram (MSB ’13).
Last academic year, more than $6,000 in cigarettes was stolen from Vital Vittles over the course of five months in three separate thefts on Sept. 1, 2011, Dec. 6, 2011 and Jan. 23, 2012. In addition, $200 in cash was taken from the store’s office on Dec. 1, 2011.
“We have not had any issues [with theft] this year so far,” Wolfram said. “There have not been any big thefts that we know of.”
Wolfram attributed the decrease to The Corp’s recently installed preemptive measures.
“Last year, we had some issues with theft. They were [committed by] students or people outside of the community,” Wolfram said. “So once that happened, we took a lot of security measures.”
The Corp installed 24-hour security cameras in Hoya Snaxa, Vital Vittles and their offices, hallways and storage rooms. Safe combinations and locks were also changed.
“[Our combinations] probably hadn’t been changed in a while,” Wolfram said. “So we wanted to make sure that we fixed those.”
According to Katherine Bruce (NHS ’13), director of Hoya Snaxa, raising employee awareness has been among The Corp’s major initiatives to reduce thefts at its locations.
“One of the basic things has just been awareness of theft as an issue,” she said. “There have definitely been measures taken to mitigate that. … Both technical measures, like the cameras, as well as just educating employees.”
In addition, Corp management modified daily employee tasks to ensure extra security.
“We went above and beyond to make sure that all of our locations are secure at all times,” Wolfram said. “Our employees have been doing a really good job of keeping up with the new measures that we’ve put in place to keep security tighter.”
According to Wolfram, one such modification is that Corp employees count money in cash registers more frequently than in the past.
“It’s just so we can keep track and know that there are not thefts occurring,” Wolfram said. “But in general, our employees have just been keeping vigilant. If they see a suspicious person lurking around our back hallways that isn’t with FedEx or facilities and really shouldn’t be there, they’ll let us know right away.”
In addition, The Corp has been working with the Department of Public Safety to prevent thefts.
“We have a really good relationship with DPS now because they helped us out a lot last year with our theft problem,” Wolfram said. “So they will alert us if we need to look out for a suspicious person or if there has been a theft in another part of campus so we can know to be extra vigilant.”
Wolfram also stressed that despite extra emphasis on security, employee safety is The Corp’s foremost priority.
“We always tell our employees to never put themselves in harm’s way,” Wolfram said. “Our employees are instructed to call me or DPS in case of an incident.”
Wolfram added that strong communication about the importance of safety from The Corp’s upper management has contributed to the security of the storefronts.

Claiming that you believe in LGBT individuals’ inherent dignity and, in the same breath, telling them that their consensual love is fundamentally disordered requires a peculiar brand of cognitive dissonance, at best. Hypocrisy, at worst.
The Catholic Church describes same-sex attraction as “objectively disordered,” “a strong tendency toward an intrinsic moral evil” and essentially self-indulgent. Kieran Raval (“God’s Plan on Sexuality, THE HOYA, A3, Oct. 19, 2012) glosses over this harsh language in his depiction of the Church’s teachings.
This is neither the language of civility, nor of love and compassion. Church leaders have invoked this language to talk about people like me far more often than they cite the alleged pleas for acceptance found within “Always Our Children.”
Moreover, appeals to natural law and normative language cast LGBT individuals like me as inferior, living outside the bounds of what is “normal,” which is synonymous with “good.” For some, this is all it takes to justify actions of hatred and discrimination against me, no matter what the Church urges. You can dress it up in philosophy all you like, but the sense of superiority and judgment seeps through. Dialogue becomes impossible when one party insists that it holds a monopoly on truth and refuses to acknowledge another’s experiences as valid.
Trotting out a pastoral letter does not let the Church off the hook when it fails to practice what it preaches.
At a funeral service in Maryland, when Barbara Johnson approached the altar, Fr. Marcel Guarnizo covered the bowl and said, “I cannot give you communion because you live with a woman and that is a sin according to the Church.” She was first in line. It was her mother’s funeral. When she delivered the eulogy, he walked off the altar. He refused to administer the final blessing at the gravesite, claiming that he felt “sick.” How did his actions show compassion for a grieving daughter?
In matters of civil divorce, heterosexual cohabitation and premarital sex, the Church renders unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s. State recognition of same-sex marriage clearly falls under the purview of secular government. But the Catholic Church and the Knights of Columbus have contributed at least $1.1 million to the fight against marriage equality in Maine, Minnesota, Maryland and Washington State this election season. Considering that I have yet to see such substantial sums dedicated to the prohibition of civil divorce or heterosexual cohabitation, sins that the Church claims also go against God’s plan for sexuality, it’s hard not to feel personally targeted.
Studying abroad at Villa le Balze two summers ago, I overheard some classmates debating same-sex marriage. When someone cited Leviticus, I felt grateful to be at the other end of the dinner table, unable to respond. Such verses provide a rationale for every hate crime committed against my community with the concluding clause: “They shall be put to death.” I remained closeted and distanced during my stay there, which puzzled some of my classmates. It is hard to open up to people who quote verses that call you an abomination.
While the Catholic bishops may claim to be aware of the alienation that LGBT Catholics suffer, they do little to stem it and often actively participate in it. Archbishop John Myers of Newark recently urged practitioners who support same-sex marriage to refrain from receiving the Eucharist. He was not speaking to Catholic politicians, who have the power to set public policy, but to ordinary lay people who hold the opposing opinion. As the archbishop of my diocese, he was speaking to me.
I will abstain from Communion, but not out of respect for Archbishop Meyers’ words. I can no longer participate in a church whose actions and teachings on homosexuality introduce a moral inconsistency to the larger body of its doctrine. The call to chastity relegates us to life alone in a faith community that celebrates marriage as the highest expression of God’s love for us. Further, it meddles in public policy that touches the lives of non-Catholics. The Church does not attempt to bar childless or infertile heterosexual couples from state-recognized marriage due to their unwillingness or incapacity to bear children. I deserve more than “disinterested friendship.”
I admire my LGBT Catholic friends who continue to engage in dialogue with the Church. I live in hope that the Church will listen to them and set aside its ancient prejudices to become the truly welcoming community that Jesus envisioned. Like Martin Luther King Jr., I firmly believe that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” It bends toward equality. However, I cannot patiently wait for the hierarchy to rediscover its conscience.
Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “What you do speaks so loud that I cannot hear you speak.”
The Catholic Church’s actions have deafened me.

With over 14,000 downloads in less than a year, Georgetown alumnus Ethan Diamond’s (COL ’09) iPhone app, MyFaceWhen, has exceeded his expectations.
Inspired by his time as a computer science major at Georgetown, Diamond and business partner Rodney Curl co-created the app, which allows users to create and share animated images in a graphics interchange format through iMessage, email and Twitter.
The app, which costs $0.99, was launched last May. Users can record a video, convert it into a high-resolution GIF and use it in iMessage in a manner similar to an emoticon. The app lets users browse and import hundreds of GIFs from reddit.com to share with friends and family.
Diamond said that MyFaceWhen enhances the social media network because it allows users to communicate and express themselves in innovative ways.
“Why write ‘Oops’ when you can post a picture of Will Arnett’s ‘I’ve made a huge mistake’ face from ‘Arrested Development?’” Diamond said.
Diamond became interested in computer science while completing his undergraduate degree at Georgetown and began working at startup technology companies after graduating.
“There’s no way I’d be here doing this if I hadn’t taken that computer science class sophomore year. I’m the type of person who loves logic problems and riddles,” Diamond said. “I took it to fulfill one of my math requirements, but by the time I graduated, I knew it’s what I wanted to do.”
According to Diamond, inspiration for the app was a collaborative effort.
“Rodney sent me various animated GIFs throughout the day,” he said. “We combined his habit of working them into the texting conversation with my idea of using the iPhone to create them.”
Diamond said developing the app was a relaxed process, but busy work schedules made it difficult.
Diamond said he hopes to improve the app by making a website, like Facebook and Tumblr, where people publicly can share and view each other’s GIFs.
“It’s been a crazy ride, but it’s a great project to work on,” Diamond said. “There are so many different roads we can take. We have a long ways to go, but MyFaceWhen will only get better.

Let’s get this straight: Mitt Romney is not George Bush.

One of the Obama campaign’s main methods of vilifyingGov. Romney has been to conflate the two. Furthermore, Bush has become Obama’s go-to excuse for all problems the United States faces today.
The country is embroiled in the quagmire that is the Middle East. Of course that is Bush’s fault; he did begin two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Never mind the fact that Bush was the first president since Franklin Roosevelt to have to contend with the momentous crisis of an attack within American borders. Bush led this country through a time of extraordinary uncertainty and fear.
 
Hindsight is 20/20. We might not like the state of U.S. relations with the Middle East today, but let’s not forget that when Bush sent troops to Iraq in 2003, his approval ratings were at a record high. An argument that he went against the will of the American people is far fetched.
 
The Obama campaign compares Romney with Bush not only to inject doubt into the voter’s mind about the Republican candidate’s foreign relations ability but also to distract Americans from the fact that Obama himself has not been very successful in the Middle East.
 
Yes, Obama ended the Iraq War and has been drawing down troops in Afghanistan. But there is considerable doubt as to whether stability will remain — or if it’s even been there to begin with. Rushing to exit from an indisputably undesired situation may cost the United States more in the long run. We should have finished what we started rather than leaving loose ends untied. Furthermore, Obama has proven that his diplomatic abilities are limited by not interfacing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who would be a crucial ally against a nuclear-armed Iran.
 
Ask Obama about why the economy is in the toilet, and you’ll hear that that is Bush’s fault, too. He put two costly wars on a credit card. On top of that, he cut taxes on the wealthy.
 
Both of those claims are true, even if Republicans describe them differently. However, by keeping this memory fresh in the electorate’s mind, Obama is once again trying to downplay his only failures and poor decisions regarding the economy.
 
One would be remiss to ignore the fact that the Obama administration advocated and rammed through Congress a multi-billion-dollar stimulus package that did not bring a fraction of the change that was promised. The economy is still sluggish, with unemployment remaining just below 8 percent.
According to Obama-logic, there aren’t shortcomings or failures of the current administration — it’s just Bush’s fault. And if you elect Romney in November, you are just electing another Bush.
 
Ladies and gentlemen, Republicans and Democrats: Do not be deceived by this.
 
I am no Bush apologist, but there is a point at which blaming the previous president and his administration for all of the country’s woes becomes absurd.
 
The Obama administration is not without its own shortcomings and failures. These faults would be much more forgivable if the president was to take responsibility for them. But he does not.
Voters should hold their candidates accountable to their successes and failures alike. Assess them on both their shortcomings and their merits. Obama dispossesses the former to compensate for the latter. That is not a candidate who deserves a second term.

While Georgetown student debt in 2011 was slightly higher than the national average, a lower overall proportion of its students were in debt.
According to a study released Oct. 18 by the Institute for College Access and Success, approximately 66 percent of 2011 American college graduates had student debt, which averaged $26,600 per student. In contrast, the study found that only 39 percent of Georgetown students graduated with debt, with an average of $28,035 per borrower in 2011. This figure represents a 10.7 percent increase over the 2010 average debt of $25,315, with the percentage of students in debt remaining unchanged.
The study broke down average student debt by state as well as by institution. The District of Columbia had the ninth highest level of debt, with 52 percent of students graduating from D.C. schools saddled with an average of $28,241 in debt. The George Washington University had an average student debt of $32,714, with 45 percent of students facing debt. Students at American University had the highest debt levels in the District in 2011, soaring to $37,674 and affecting 58 percent of students.
Schools with the highest student debts included Kentucky State University, Temple University and La Salle University, each of which had average student debts between $31,900 and $45,100.
In comparison, colleges and universities that had the lowest debt included Yale, Princeton and Williams College with student debts averaging between $3,000 and $9,750.
According to Scott Fleming (F ’72), associate vice president for federal relations, the university tries to work with students to minimize the amount of debt they will carry come graduation day.
Georgetown’s recently launched Capital Campaign seeks to raise $1.5 billion, a part of which will be used for student scholarships. In particular, the new 1789 Scholarship fund will raise money for 1,789 new scholarships.
“The university continues its efforts to increase Georgetown scholarship funding, including making funds for Georgetown scholarships a major focus of the ongoing Capital Campaign,” Fleming said. “Increasing the pool of resources available for Georgetown’s scholarships, along with our work in the federal relations office to maintain strong federal grant aid programs, including Pell Grants and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, is designed to hold down the loan component of Georgetown financial aid packages.”

In his address at Germany’s Regensburg University in September 2006, Pope Benedict XVI asserted that faith without reason is fanaticism. Although he was not speaking about homosexuality, I think that this point directly applies to that debate. As students at a Jesuit institution, we are called upon to learn through reevaluating our ideas. Combining the ideals of both the Holy Father and the Jesuits, we can conclude that, without questioning what we are told, we run the risk of following others blindly.
In Friday’s issue of THE HOYA, Kieran Raval explained the Catholic Church’s stance on homosexuality by referencing various elements of Catholic theological doctrine (“God’s Plan on Sexuality,” A3, Oct. 19, 2012). However, as a Catholic, I would like to offer another opinion on the subject of sexual orientation.
Raval states, “Human sexuality is a gift from God that must be ordered according to God’s will and plan … of the spouses (love) and procreation (life).” By writing that homosexuality is “not properly ordered toward the natural and divine telos,” Raval implies that love and life are not part of a homosexual relationship. I would hope that most agree the first point is moot; obviously a relationship is built upon love, regardless of gender. I also take issue with the second point: life. Although homosexual couples cannot conceive a child through sex, this should not prevent them from being together. If gay couples are “disqualified” because of their inability to procreate, so too should barren individuals and women with ovarian cancer be considered “unnatural” in relationships.
Raval responded briefly to this argument saying, “This confuses the distinction between capacity and ability in an ontological sense.” However, his response is an argument about semantics rather than meaning. Both people who are incapable of bearing children and those who are unable to bear children cannot produce life through sex.
However, my purpose is not to dissect Raval’s viewpoint, but rather to question why some continue to view the Catholic Church’s stance on homosexuality as acceptable. Despite stating that homosexuals “must be accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity” (CCC 2358), the Church itself discriminates against them. Raval writes, “it seems to me that we must … encourage those people with same-sex attractions who desire to live according to Scripture and the tradition of Christianity.” Although this idea may seem inclusionary, it actually implies that those who identify as gay must ignore that part of themselves.
In short, the Catholic Church tells gay individuals that they can be themselves provided they subscribe to the large asterisk that asks them to disregard part of their identity. Despite Raval’s assertion to the contrary, that is not cura personalis.

Members of GU Occupy projected statistics about United States foreign policy, unemployment and military budget on a wall in Lohrfink Auditorium, interrupting a screening of the presidential debate Monday evening.
Occupy members refused the moderator’s request to turn off their projector, prompting the audio-video controller to yell and slam his laptop shut, according to Georgetown University Lecture Fund Chair Sean Keady (SFS ’13).
The Lecture Fund co-sponsored the debate screening, along with Georgetown University College Republicans and College Democrats.
During the closing remarks, GU Occupy members began projecting statistics again, at which point they were confronted by Department of Public Safety officers and Center for Student Programs Director Erika Cohen-Derr.
The students have been accused of violating the university’s speech and expression policy, which forbids any actions that impair other students’ enjoyment of an event, according to Keady. But since the projector did not directly obstruct students’ view of the debate, Keady was unclear whether GU Occupy violated the policy.
“It certainly made the atmosphere a little more tense and charged,” he said. “In general I think students were more frustrated rather than offended.”
The most recent violation of the university’s free speech policy was in January 2010, when Georgetown Solidarity Committee members read a list of grievances during a speech by Director of the Central Intelligence Agency David Petraeus.A group of about 20 students projected statistics about United States foreign policy, unemployment and military budget on a wall in Lohrfink Auditorium Monday evening, interrupting a screening of the presidential debate.

The most recent violation of the university’s free speech policy was in January 2010, when students, including some members of Georgetown Solidarity Committee, read a list of grievances during a speech by Director of the Central Intelligence Agency David Petraeus.
According to protester Sydney Browning (COL ’15), a member of both GSC and GU Occupy who said the demonstration was not associated with either group, the protest was not supposed to detract from the presidential debate or violate the speech and expression policy.
“Its purpose was not to disrupt the debate,” she said. “It was not meant to touch the screen where the debate was going on. It was projected on the side wall.”
Katerina Downward (SFS ’14), another member of both GSC and GU Occupy who was involved in planning the event but not present in the auditorium, said that the group purposefully did not use sound in their presentation.
“It was a strategic choice on our part,” she said. “We acted within the institutional knowledge of how certain protests and demonstrations have been treated in the past. This was not an attempt to alienate anyone.”
The student protesters developed the idea for the demonstration three weeks ago and began executing a four-step plan on Saturday. Browning said that the plan consisted of posting a banner critiquing U.S. foreign policy in Red Square, handing out pamphlets during the pre-debate panel, projecting a PowerPoint presentation during the debate and giving a speech with a megaphone afterward.
According to Browning, 20 students were involved in planning the protest but only 10 organizers were at the event.
The demonstrators wanted to focus on the last presidential debate topic of foreign policy, although many people associated the protest with the Occupy movement.
“The Occupy movement was predominantly predicated on critiquing injustices,” Downward said. “This is more … about providing through our counternarrative a more holistic representation of the ramifications of U.S. foreign policy abroad.”
The group currently has no plans for further demonstrations, but participants said that they believe they accomplished their mission.
“Even if people don’t agree with us, I think that as long as at least some of them listened, then hopefully they thought about it, and that was our goal,” Browning said. “It wasn’t to say, ‘You’re wrong in your beliefs’ — it was to say, ‘Please consider this viewpoint.’”

Journalists and politicos criticized the structure and substance of the 2012 presidential debates at a panel inLohrfink Auditorium Friday night.
The event, called “Presidential Debates: Performance, Spin and the Press,” was sponsored by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, Georgetown University College Democrats and Georgetown University College Republicans.
Robert Siegel, senior host of National Public Radio’s “All Things Considered,” moderated the panel, which featured Bloomberg News editor Al Hunt, Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker and NBC News political director and chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd.
The panel was hosted by the News Literacy Project, a national program that seeks to educate middle and high school students to think critically and synthesize information in the digital age.
Alan C. Miller, president and CEO of the News Literacy Project, delivered the opening remarks and explained the organization’s purpose.
“Our ultimate goal is to educate students in politics and media studies … in an age where they are being bombarded by information from all sides,” Miller said.
Siegel first presented clips from the two presidential debates and compared them to the media’s coverage of the events.
The panelists then pointed out how social media’s tendency to sensationalize has influenced political campaigns.
“When you say something like ‘binders full of women,’ something is going to happen,” Parker said, referring to Romney’s comment during the debate last Tuesday. “[But what] concerns me is that it forces the media to pay attention to something that is a joke.”
Todd said that the debate format is too focused on time.
“The goal was to get rid of the clock. … It is the campaigns that renegotiated everything, even the temperature,” Todd said. “They negotiated that the candidates couldn’t question each other directly.”
“The irony of television debates is that they have never been won on substance,” he said.
The panelists ended their discussion by taking questions from students.
Students who attended the event were impressed with the high turnout on a Friday night.
“I think it is great that many students attend speaker events, even on a weekend night. I love that students are so interested,” Charlotte Cherry (SFS ’16) said. “I think that the speakers acknowledged the good questions and really interacted with the students.”

From aspiring politicians polishing their rhetoric to overseas students looking to practice their English, Georgetown Toastmasters has been providing the community with a unique opportunity for a decade.
Toastmasters, an international organization comprising 13,500 clubs in 116 countries, aims to help its members hone their speaking and leadership skills. The Georgetown chapter, which was formally chartered in October 2002, celebrated its tenth anniversary last week.
Assistant Dean of Career and Alumni Services Jennifer Blanck (GRD ’06) founded the chapter during her freshman year at Georgetown.
“It’s amazing what can happen,” she said.
According to club president Nancy Crowell (GRD ’09), the club, which now has 20 members, mostly pulls on students and professors but also includes people from the wider community.
“Georgetown Toastmasters pulls together such a diverse group of people,” she said. “It’s such a great community to practice speaking and to practice leadership skills.”
At meetings, which occur every two weeks, group members give prepared speeches and impromptu table topics presentations before being evaluated by their peers.
“Everything is timed. We watch for interrupters, things like ‘like’ and ‘so,’ to make us better, more accomplished speakers. Everyone gets a chance to participate,” Crowell said.
Vice President of Public Relations Rodney Fisher (SCS ’11) has been participating in Georgetown Toastmasters for four years. He says that his experience with the group was particularly helpful when he worked as a legislative aide on Capitol Hill.
“I had to meet with people, sit on panels, give speeches to groups,” he said. “To this day I can’t speak enough. I love being in front of the group.”
Fisher said that Toastmasters can be especially beneficial for Georgetown students.
“Some people just want to learn the basics … other people are going into jobs that require public speaking,” he said. “It helps you focus on areas to improve on. When they see that people want them to succeed … that’s really helpful. We’re harsh critics of ourselves, so these evaluations point out things you did well and things you can improve on.”
Fisher said that now the group is focused on gaining members, especially undergraduate students, and increasing the group’s presence on campus by advertising on their website and on campus.
“We want to bring in as many people as possible,” he said. “It’s really benefited us, and we want people to know about it. When someone is struggling or wants to improve their communication abilities, they’ll think Toastmasters.”

Recent food safety and hygiene inspections conducted by the D.C. Department of Health revealed health code violations at five restaurants in Leavey Center and eight combined violations at Uncommon Grounds and Vital Vittles.
Cosi, Pizza Hut, Subway, KFC and Taco Bell were all inspected on Oct. 3 and were cited for a total of 12 violations. The DOH gave these locations five days to correct the violations.
Cosi, which is managed by Aramark Higher Education, had three critical violations, which included cold food items being held at improper temperatures, prepared food items with no date or content labels and an out-of-order hand-washing sink in the kitchen, none of which could be corrected on site. According to the DOH, a food establishment would typically need six or more critical violations to be closed immediately.
Cosi was cited for more violations than any of the other Leavey Center restaurants that were inspected on Oct. 3, but those violations were immediately addressed and corrected according to an email from Aramark Marketing Manager Kendra Boyer. She did not elaborate on the violations or the corrective steps taken by Cosi.
“We have ongoing, rigorous training and quality assurance processes to ensure we meet very high standards,” Boyer wrote. “Consistent with our rigorous practices, the issues noted in the inspection reports were all immediately addressed and corrected.”
Cosi employee Kia Hellams said that the hand-washing sink has been repaired since the inspection.
The DOH cited Pizza Hut for two critical violations, including the lack of a certified food protection manager certificate and an out-of-order garbage disposal. Subway shares the disposal with Pizza Hut and was therefore also cited for this violation.
According to Mithu Hasan, manager of both Pizza Hut and Subway, the garbage disposal is in the process of being fixed. He said that parts for the garbage disposal have been ordered and should arrive next week, and he obtained a food protection manager certificate after the inspection.
KFC and Taco Bell also received two critical violations each. When the inspection began, KFC did not have a certified food protection manager on duty, but this issue was corrected during the inspection. Meanwhile, Taco Bell was cited for unclean food surfaces. Additionally, neither restaurant’s employee health policies required employees to report information about their health and activities related to diseases that are transmissible through food, according to the report.
According to DOH Area Supervisor Ronnie Taylor, the DOH has not yet conducted follow-up investigations of the Leavey Center restaurants. Taylor said that the restaurants have the responsibility to correct all violations before the follow-up investigation,
The DOH also found two violations at Uncommon Grounds after a Sept. 5 inspection. Inspectors found holes in the kitchen floor and dust, dirt, food residue and debris on non-food contact surfaces.
According to Chief Operating Officer of Students of Georgetown, Inc. Stephanie Wolfram (MSB ’13), all violations have been addressed.
Wolfram added that the hole referred to in the DOH inspection was located in the wooden platform on the barista stand.
“We patched that up right after they noticed it,” she said.
To correct the second violation, Wolfram said that Uncommon Grounds employees now sweep the crumbs that accumulate under the bagel toaster multiple times per day.
Vital Vittles, which was inspected on Oct. 3, received five non-critical violations — not having a hand-washing sign or paper towels above the sink, inadequate ventilation and lighting and improper temperature in a refrigerator — and one critical violation, a dirty sink.
The store has since installed a hand-washing sign, according to Wolfram. She also said that the inspector did not see the paper towels, which were in fact present, and that the dirty sink was not used by employees.
The remaining violations were also corrected by cleaning up spilled milk, adjusting the refrigerator temperature and ordering new light bulbs for the freezer.

It’s been said that the states are 50 political laboratories, and indeed, some of the most important policymaking
in the country occurs at the state level. But with the attention of the media and the public fixed on the presidential contest and the battle for control of Capitol Hill, the 11 gubernatorial races taking place on Nov. 6 have been largely overlooked. That’s just wrong — these races have the potential to significantly alter politics and policy for the coming years. Ri
ght now, the 11 contests can be broken down into three broad tiers of competitiveness.
I’ll call the four non-competitive races Tier Three. In these cases, the incumbent governor will be reelected handily: Gov. Gary Herbert (R-Utah), Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R-N.D.), Gov. Jack Markell (D-Dela.) and Gov. Peter Shu
mlin (D-Ver.) all benefit from the significant partisan leans of their respective states, and are shoo-ins for another term in office.
 
The only remotely interesting campaign of these is actually occurring in Vermont, a state whose strong Democratic lean at the national level is often deceptive: it has a long history of liberal Yankee Republicans, such as former Gov. Jim Douglas and former Sen. Jim Jeffords. In fact, Shumlin was elected over Republican Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie by a margin of less than 2 percent in 2010 (in Vermont and New Hampshire, a gubernatorial term is two years). Vermont Republicans have a compelling candidate in State Senator Randy Brock, a former State Auditor who is black and in the Rockefeller Republican tradition. If any of these races is to be an upset, look for Brock to pull off a major surprise
in notoriously unpredictable Vermont. I wouldn’t put money on it, though.
 
Tier Two includes races that are much more competitive. In West Virginia, voters face a rematch from the 2011 special election after former Gov. Joe Manchin was elected to the U.S. Senate. Democrat Earl Ray Tomblin, the acting governor and president of the state senate, defeated Republican businessman Bill Maloney by less than 3 percent. Tomblin is now seeking a full four-year term, and should probably win again over Maloney. But Maloney is running a well-funded campaign that muscularly links Tomblin to the highly unpopular President Obama, particularly on regulation of the sacrosanct coal industry. The outcome of this race will show whether West Virginians, traditionally Democratic at the state level, are finally beginning to gravitate to the GOP at all levels.
 
On the other side of Appalachia, Missourians are likely to reelect Gov. Jay Nixon, a moderate Democrat. Nixon is a popular incumbent facing a challenge from St. Louis businessman Dave Spence. After state Republicans pressured Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder (R-Missouri), who had openly frequented strip clubs and tussled with e
mployees, to leave the race, Spence seized the GOP mantle. He has left much to be desired, running a gaffe-riddled negative campaign. While he could knock off Nixon, I am skeptical, and believe Missourians would be wise to reelect their governor.
 
Finally, Indiana features a fascinating contest to succeed the term-limited and hugely popular Gov. Mitch Daniels (R-Ind.). Congressman Mike Pence (R-Ind.) is primed to keep the governor’s mansion in GOP hands. He has been running a smart, polished campaign that has simply dominated his Democratic opponent, former State House Speaker John Gregg (D-Ind.). Gregg is an affable candidate whose campaign logo is his iconic bushy mustache, and, as a relatively c
onservative Democrat, he certainly is a credible contender. But the combination of a Romney romp in Indiana and Democratic energy focusing on the tossup senate race, Gregg faces a steep climb.
 
Tier One is where things really start to get thrilling. Four states have contests that will go down to the wire. Republican Pat McCrory (R-N.C.), the popular former mayor of Charlotte, increasingly looks like North Carolina’s next governor. After losing by the skin of his teeth to incumbent Gov. Bev Perdue (D-N.C.) in the Democratic tidal wave of 2008, McCrory looks like he can capture the governor’s mansion with his pro-business, pragmatic policy prescriptions. Facing tremendous unpopularity over her weak tenure in office, Perdue opted to retire rather than run for reelection, ceding the Democratic nomination to Lieutenant Governor Walter Dalton (D-N.C.). Dalton is likable and folksy, and the type of moderate Democrat who traditionally wins in North Carolina. Yet his ties to Perdue have hindered his campaign. If Obama runs well in North Carolina, he could put Dalton over the top. Otherwise, it’s McCrory’s race to lose.
 
Another swing state, New Hampshire, is also choosing a new governor. This time voters are pick
ing a successor to the very popular Gov. John Lynch (D-N.H.). Frankly, neither candidate is wildly impressive. Democrat Maggie Hassan, former majority leader of the state senate, is a textbook Democrat. Her campaign commercials are uninspired, and she is not a particularly strong speaker. Her Republican opponent is Ovide Lamontagne, whose political experience includes failed bids for governor in 1996 and the U.S. Senate in 2010. Lamontagne is smart and likeable, and his campaign has raised significant cash. Yet as a staunch social conservative, Lamontagne is generally too conservative for the majority of New Hampshirites. The two have been deadlocked in the polls, and I honestly can’t predict who will win the day.
 
The election in Montana is tight, as well. Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D-Mont.) is stepping aside due to term limits, but has expressed serious interest in running for president in 2016. Keep an eye on him. His party benefits from a strong candidate for his replacement in Attorney General Steve Bullock. Bullock is young, telegenic, a tough prosecutor and loyal to Montana values on guns and land issues. Republicans nominated a relatively underwhelming former congressman, Rick Hill (R-Mont.). Hill benefits from the overall conservative lean of the state, but Bullock is a better candidate with a superior campaign. Either could become the state’s next governor.
My favorite gubernatorial race this time around is in Washington state, where voters will replace retiring Gov. Christine Gregoire (D-Wash.). In a state that has not elected a Republican governor since 1980, this looks to be the GOP’s best shot yet. Republican Attorney General Rob McKenna (R-Wash.) is wonky, personable, effective and moderate. While Washingtonians strongly supported Obama in 2008, they gave an even larger reelection victory to McKenna, who consistently has proven his ability to attract Democratic support. Democrats nominated former Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), who frankly is not a flickering flame of intellect. Inslee is a generic liberal Democrat, who won a small victory over McKenna in the nonpartisan blanket primary held in August. The two now advance to the general election with Inslee holding a miniscule lead in the polls. If McKenna can tap into voters’ desires for independent-minded change —especially in the vote-rich Seattle area — he will eke out a win, and Washingtonians will be better for it.
States that are big and small, red, blue and purple will elect governors in two weeks. The decisions voters make in these races, particularly compared to how they behave in elections for president and Congress, will reveal a great deal about the political character of our country. On Election Night, you’ll have your work cut out for you: the returns from these 11 races are not to be ignored.
