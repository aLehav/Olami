Four days before the Democratic primary, which will likely determine D.C.’s next mayor, D.C. Council Chairman Vincent Gray maintains a sizable lead in the polls over incumbent Mayor Adrian Fenty.
Gray’s lead, however, has lessened in the past weeks. A poll released by The Washington Post on Aug. 29 gave Gray a 13-point lead among Democratic voters and a 17-point lead among those likely to vote. His lead dropped to just 11 points in a poll conducted by Public Policy Polling just three days later. The latest results from a Clarus Research Group poll on Tuesday has Gray leading by seven points among likely voters.
D.C. upholds a closed primary system, meaning voters must be registered Democrats before the election in order to vote. This means Fenty must focus on rallying more supporters than Gray, rather than recruiting new voters.
“Election Day turnout is still the key factor – and the best remaining hope for the mayor’s re-election campaign,” said Ron Faucheux, president of Clarus Research Group, in a press release.
Demographics remain key in determining voter preference. Gray leads 62 to 17 percent among black voters; Fenty leads 68 to 22 percent among white voters.
“Because voters are sharply divided by race,” Faucheux said in the press release, “Election Day voter turnout among each voter group is the No. 1 factor that will determine the winner.”
Gray also holds an advantage over Fenty in terms of personal favorability rating – 60 to 49 percent, according to Clarus. Fenty’s first term focused on reforming the public school system and enhancing government efficiency and accountability. He enjoyed success with last week’s announcement that D.C. was one of the winners of Race to the Top, Obama’s education program that provides competitive grants to states to improve public education. The policies of D.C. Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee have also received heavy criticism, however.
any poorer voters also feel alienated by Fenty, according to the Washington City Paper. In contrast, Gray has a higher favorability, but is also seen as too bureaucratic. Critics have come forward to comment on his lack of initiative in changing the Department of Human Services, which he ran in the early 1990s.
D.C.’s Democratic primary is generally regarded as the de facto mayoral election in a city that is heavily Democratic. Other Democratic candidates are Leo Alexander, Sulaimon Brown and Ernest Johnson – but Fenty and Gray are the clear frontrunners, with the other candidates receiving a combined 3 percent in Tuesday’s Clarus poll.
No Republicans have filed a candidacy in the general election for mayor. Five independents have declared their candidacy, including D.C. Councilmember Michael Brown. There is also one candidacy from the Socialist Workers Party and one from the Statehood Green party. The election will be held Tuesday, Nov. 2.

Once deemed a national disgrace by President Lyndon Johnson, the Potomac River is showing signs of improvement after decades of trying to decontaminate the murky waters.
A study released by the U.S. Geological Survey revealed that despite the Potomac’s still unsightly appearance, the water quality has improved enough for native submerged aquatic vegetation to increase tenfold between 1990, when the USGS started taking measurements, and 2007. The USGS also found that the abundance of exotic species has declined since restoration efforts began and more native species have been able to repopulate. Native SAV species now cover 3,081 acres of the bottom of the Potomac in the 50-mile stretch of the river that was included in the study.
Nancy Rybicki, a scientist and a co-author of the study released by the USGS, said that the conditions now are better than they have been for decades.
“These conditions are actually better than they were in the 1950s,” Rybicki said to The Washington Post. “The portion of the Potomac that we’re talking about was completely devoid of vegetation in the 1950s.”
The USGS attributes the improvement to the reduction of nitrogenous waste being dumped into the Potomac. They found a negative correlation between the levels of nitrogen present in the river and the abundance of SAV. As the average nitrogen-levels in the river decreased by nearly 50 percent during the 18-year study, the USGS saw an increase in the area of riverbed covered by underwater grass.
Reducing the concentration of nitrogen entering the Potomac has not been an easy process. Regulations passed by the federal government in the last 10 years have allowed the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is the largest of its kind in the United States, to add $1 billion to its operations, according to The Washington Post.
With the new funding, the plant can now allow nitrogen-eating bacteria to feast upon the sewage before it enters the Potomac. This improves the water quality because not as much algae can grow when there is less nitrogen in the river, and if there is less algae more sunlight can reach the bottom of the river and fuel the growth of underwater grasses.
Despite the recent improvements, many Georgetown students, including Sabra Simmonds (COL ’12), do not consider the Potomac their best option for a refreshing swim on a hot summer day.
“The last time I looked at the Potomac, it was basically a stagnant pile of garbage. I was not here this past year, but if anything, I would say it has gotten worse in the past three years. Hopefully it will improve soon, and it seems like they have been making progress in other areas,” Simmonds said.

As star chef Duff Goldman assembled a cake version of Jack the Bulldog on the stage of Gaston Hall Tuesday night, he could not help but turn to the audience for some background information on his baked good’s canine inspiration.
“What is a Hoya? Is a Hoya a breed of bulldog?” asked Goldman, host of Food Network’s reality show “Ace of Cakes.”
inimal Georgetown knowledge aside, Goldman put his culinary interpretation of the university mascot to work, painting the hat dark blue and designing eyes, ears, teeth and collar studs for the cake. Audience members watched on a projection screen as Jack’s face morphed from a gray form to a full model of the mascot.
Fielding an audience member’s question on the cake’s flavor, Goldman plunged a finger into the top of Jack’s skull without hesitation. A quick taste test was followed by his answer: “Vanilla,” he said, before apologizing to the audience. “I’m sorry; I just realized that was really rude.”
Goldman suggested aspiring cooks keep track of each and every move in the kitchen, especially in new locations. “When you’re in a new climate, you have to write everything you do,” he said. He compared the process to science class, noting that scientists record their experimental observations.
When a student asked for Goldman’s dream cake order, the celebrity chef revealed it has yet to be placed. “I’d love for the remaining members of Led Zeppelin, with Dave Grohl [of Nirvana and Foo Fighters] on drums, have me deliver a cake to them on stage at [London’s] Wembley Stadium . on a unicorn.”
Julie Gantz (SFS ’13) was very impressed with by Goldman’s talent and charisma.
“Duff was absolutely hilarious. I would like to go live in his bakery and never leave,” she said. “At the same time that he was making something artsy and fine-detailed and creative and complex, he cracked jokes, told ridiculous stories, and stayed most definitely himself.”

The transfer happened around 8 p.m. Four radios moved into the hands of the night crew, and Stephanie Young (SFS ’13) began her first shift as a member of Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service.
Without much ceremony, the 12-hour Saturday night shift was underway. For three veteran EMTs and Stephanie, those radios would enslave them until 8 a.m. The next radio tone could mean an abrupt end to dinner.
Several GERMS members were out at Surfside, a laid-back seafood restaurant in Glover Park. Duty crews may dine only at takeout restaurants, and they frequent Surfside enough that they approached management about a volume discount, one member told me. Management declined.
At 8:06 p.m., a tone sounded from the radios around the table: an injury in New South. With sirens blaring in perfect time with Katy Perry’s “California Gurls” on the stereo, and after promising to get his parking ticket validated, GERMS President Colin Brody (COL ’11) guided Unit 8, one of the EMT service’s two ambulances back toward campus.
“Oh crap,” Stephanie said to herself as she climbed several flights of stairs to the call. It had been a while since the GERMS training class last year, and there was only so much she could practice with her stethoscope and blood pressure cuff.
“It’s not like a math problem, which you can get wrong and do again,” she said.
The patient had sustained an injury a few days earlier, and wanted it checked out. Stephanie checked vitals and scribbled them on her latex gloves. She apologized as the Velcro of her blood pressure cuff caught itself on the patient’s shirt.
The crew informed an ER nurse that the night had been “quiet.”
“You said the `q word.’ That’ll jinx it,” she said.
The first alcohol-related call came from Darnall Hall at 11:51 p.m. The patient was vomiting, and Stephanie had to catch it. She shut her eyes and held her breath every time the patient’s mouth opened. She didn’t catch everything.
“I felt bad because I’m in GERMS and I shouldn’t have reacted as much as I did,” Young recalled. “I’d take a breath and tell myself to get over it.”
“The gag reflex goes away,” Kelly Arledge (SFS ’10, GRD ’11), another member of the crew, told Stephanie.
As GERMS left the scene, a roommate asked Brody what would get the stench out of their carpet.
“A lot of SHOUT,” Brody said, and rolled the stretcher to the elevator.
The men and women of GERMS are witnesses to a different side of Georgetown. They see a university within Department of Public Safety rope lines, and they see students in their worst states.
“You recognize some people around campus and you know you know them from somewhere,” Brody said. “You don’t know if it’s from a class or a GERMS call. You don’t know how to react.”
To protect the patients’ privacy, GERMS members won’t talk to a patient unless they’re approached.
The most experienced crews know the university’s pulse, what cases might affect students and when. Brody and Chris Santostefano (NHS ’12) explained a typical Saturday night: It’s rare to see critical intoxication in patients between 8 and 11 p.m., but ambulance crews are continuously on calls from midnight to 3 a.m.
any weekend calls are also for injuries from intoxicated students on campus staircases, Santostefano said.
There’s no exact science to predicting call volume for a weekend night. The first two weeks of school tend to be heavier, as does Halloween (if it falls on a weekend). Brody anticipated five to seven calls on Saturday.
“For those of us who’ve been around the block, it’s easy to say we’re gonna need a lot of people on a certain night,” Brody said.
GERMS stockpiled over $1,000 of supplies in August to make sure they were ready for the weeks following New Student Orientation, Brody said.
But he added that there are some moments, like the norovirus that affected about 200 students in 2009, that GERMS simply couldn’t predict.
Patients are sometimes unclear about exactly what GERMS offers, Arledge said. The first patient of the night had wanted a diagnosis from GERMS members. A diagnosis could come only from a doctor, and GERMS aren’t permitted to share personal medical opinions.
“They want an answer from us. We can’t give that,” Arledge said.
Crews spend their downtime in the GERMS office watching films and doing homework.
When the radios go quiet, the crews retire to bunk beds and a couch in the inner office. The long shifts forge a community among GERMS that makes it almost like a varsity squad.
“We’re like an athletic team, but not in shape,” one GERMS member said.
Over dinner, the GERMS counted the number of married couples that had met through GERMS. Many have come back and married in Dahlgren Chapel, Brody said.
On Saturday, the feature film was “Top Gun”, and the crew offered a collective sigh when they were toned out before the beach volleyball scene.
“California Gurls” was part of a mix tape that played throughout the crew’s ambulance calls on Saturday. Drivers request songs every semester for a new compilation album, Brody said.
All GERMS members remember their first calls after getting their EMT license. For Arledge, who was on the Saturday night duty crew, it was when she went to a movie after getting certified.
A movie-goer a few rows ahead yelled, asking someone to dial 911. Arledge stood and said, “I’m 911!”
Young said that people look at her differently when she walks around campus in uniform.
The primary duty crew handled seven calls on Saturday. One of the calls was dispatched to the secondary crew because the primary crew was engaged, and two calls were dispatched to D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services because both crews were on separate calls. The four members of the 80 crew, as they’re known when they’re using Unit 8, saw calls to Darnall, New South and West Georgetown. The crew returned around 4 a.m. to sleep for the last hours of the shift.
At around 8 a.m., the new shift roused the crew from the couch to ask where the radios were. Twelve hours later, it was the next hand-off. Stephanie’s first shift was over.

The Collegiate Readership Program, which provided free daily newspapers to students, has been suspended for the second semester in two years due to a declining readership and a lack of funding from campus organizations.
Despite vocal student support, the program’s sponsors did not gather sufficient resources to finance the service for this academic year, InterHall’s Vice President of Student Advocacy Shea Houlihan (SFS ’13) wrote in an email. InterHall was a sponsor of the program.
“[InterHall’s] on-campus administrative partners and fellow student organizations were unable or unwilling to put together the necessary funds. While we did receive vocal support from different areas, the money was simply not there,” he wrote.
With the boost in popularity of online news content, many saw the program as unnecessary.
“A couple of organizations we were working with tried to do fundraising. . But when funding is tight, it’s hard to fund a service that you can access for free online,” Vice President of Georgetown University Student Association Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) said.
The Collegiate Readership Program’s financial woes have persisted from the 2009-2010 school year, when the program was halted due to a lack of funding.
Houlihan commended his predecessor, Will Cousino (SFS ’12), for his successful revival of the program. “It was due to the efforts of Will Cousino . and his partners in GUSA, The Corp and other organizations that the Readership Program was restarted last semester after its intermission during fall 2009. InterHall talked to different vice presidents’ offices and other organizations to put together the necessary $6,000,” he wrote.
In addition to those groups, Georgetown University Alumni & Student Federal Credit Union, the senior vice president’s office and the McDonough School of Business contributed funds to pay for last semester’s newspapers. Incidentally, while shutting down stands at O’Donovan Hall, Leavey Center and Alumni Square, a new stand was placed in the MSB’s Rafik B. Hariri Building.
The program could be up and running in the future, Houlihan suggested, but only with financial independence.
“I would be only too happy to join with other organizations once more if we can develop the initiative into a self-sustaining program that does not require us to go cap in hand each semester looking for new sources of funding,” he said.
“It’s an initiative that is on hiatus, but not gone,” Kluger said.
Houlihan’s solution to the financial constraints – to negotiate a year-long contract that would cost less than two separate semester-long contracts – was unsuccessful due to a lack of funding by the contract’s August deadline.
Despite vocal support, Houlihan argued that statistics gathered by the program’s leaders show declining support for the program.
“Only 37 percent of the USA Todays delivered were read, on average, compared to 72 percent of The Washington Posts and 81 percent of The New York Times . I should also point out these numbers are further reduced from years past, so we have noted a decline of interest in the Readership [Program] over a few years.”
“This fact . led us to believe the program is not a high priority either for residents or for other student organizations. As such, InterHall has moved on to support more pressing matters, such as the intermission of the Residential Judicial Council,” Houlihan wrote.

With former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe Vélez’s arrival on campus Wednesday came a series of protests denouncing his appointment as a School of Foreign Service Distinguished Scholar in the Practice of Global Leadership.
On Wednesday afternoon, dozens of activists congregated in Red Square to protest alleged human rights abuses during Uribe’s two terms as president. Demonstrators held signs bearing the images of those claimed to be displaced as a result of the Uribe regime, as well as a large banner reading “Adios Uribe!”
At a gathering at 36th and N Streets by the Mortara Center for International Studies late Thursday afternoon, about 30 students showed their support for Uribe as four opponents to Uribe voiced their opposition nearby.
Colombian student Carolina Toro (SFS ’12) was among those supportive of Uribe’s new post in the SFS.
“I know that Uribe did many great things for our country, and I feel personally honored that he is coming to this school. I feel really proud, and thus I feel that we should organize a group to welcome him,” she said.
School of the Americas Watch, a grassroots movement founded in 1990, helped coordinate the objections to Uribe. SOA Watch cited persecution of journalists and human rights activists, as well as the 2008 “false positives” scandal, according to a press release on the group’s website.
According to a 2008 report in The New York Times, the scandal refers to allegations that members of the Colombian military recruited impoverished citizens before killing them and presenting their deaths as casualties of combat.
any university officials have welcomed the new faculty member.
“President Uribe will bring a truly unique perspective to discussions of global affairs at Georgetown,” SFS Dean Carol Lancaster said in a university press release published Aug. 11.
“It is a great honor to participate in this prestigious Georgetown University program, sharing my experience with younger generations,” Uribe said in the same press release.
SOA Watch member Nico Udu-Gama, who was present at both events, explained his opposition to the appointment.
“We don’t need more people like Uribe coming and teaching about leadership. People who don’t know about leadership. People who know only to kill, only to set up paramilitary units, are here teaching our students about what global leadership is,” Udu-Gama said.
At Wednesday’s protest, members of the university community such as Carolina Rodríguez-Garcia, a teaching assistant for Latin American Studies courses, joined SOA Watch members voicing their opposition to Uribe.
“Uribe’s [administration] had a lot of problems, and that is why I am here,” Rodriguez-Garcia said.
A press release on the SOA Watch website stated that university faculty, alumni and students met with local activists on Aug. 31 to discuss effective ways of protesting Uribe’s presence on campus. Organizations present at the meeting included the Dorothy Day Catholic Worker Foundation, Witness for Peace, the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, the Service Employees International Union and No War on Cuba, according to the SOA Watch website.
In an email, Udu-Gama elaborated on the organization’s goals of educating the university and local community about what inviting Uribe to campus meant. He also said that the organization hoped that Georgetown would drop Uribe as a speaker and not make such decisions lightly in the future.
In his new position, Uribe will lead seminars, discussions and various activities within the SFS.
“My greatest wish and happiness is to contribute in the continuous emergence of future leaders,” Uribe said.
SOA Watch was founded to protest the School of the Americas, now known as the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, which trains Latin American soldiers and promotes education to advocate democracy in the region. Multiple graduates of the Institute have gone on to become notable violators of human rights.
Colombian student David Betancur (COL ’11) believes the former president’s presence on Georgetown is nothing but a positive one.
“These people who are protesting do not have the clear distinction that Uribe is important for Latin American politics. He is a main actor and one of the most important. His input is extremely important for the university,” he said.
In regard to the “false positives” scandal, Betancur recalled that many of the top administration members and congressmen involved with the paramilitary had been dismissed after the allegations arose.
“If you see what was happening just before Uribe came into power, there was the peak of the lack of presence of the state in the rural areas. You could get kidnapped. This was one thing that this president has done – enforce the security and presence of the state and the power of law,” Betancur continued.
Uribe was elected to the Colombian presidency in August of 2002, and subsequently re-elected in 2006.
Considered by many as a key revolutionary leader in Colombia, Uribe established fiscal policies known to have stimulated the economy and stringent security measures in a country torn by the guerilla Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC). Juan Manuel Santos, who served as Uribe’s minister of national defense, was inaugurated as his successor in August. Uriber left office with an approval rating of over 70 percent.
The Office of Communications indicated there would be no formal or public welcome ceremony for Uribe’s arrival on campus.

Teach For America, one of the most popular post-graduation options for Georgetown students, won a $50 million grant this month, which will enable it to double the number of educators in its corps by 2014. Forty-one members of Georgetown’s Class of 2010 joined the TFA’s group of 4,500 instructors this year.
Although more graduating seniors joined TFA in the previous two years, with 53 joining in 2009 and 45 in 2008, Georgetown remains one of the biggest feeder schools to TFA. Georgetown has been involved with TFA since the onset of the organization in 1990, when six Hoyas joined its ranks. As of September of this year, an estimated 364 Georgetown alumni are involved with TFA or have completed the program.
“There is a strong commitment to service among the student body,” said Amanda Mills, senior recruitment director for Teach For America, in an email. “Georgetown students truly embrace `Men and Women for others’ and . they are seeking those opportunities to be truly challenged and work relentlessly to ensure opportunities for students across America.”
Brian Cook (COL ’10), who pursued a double major in sociology and English, joined TFA this fall and now teaches eighth-grade English at Thurgood Marshall Middle School in Temple Hills, Md. Cook originally planned on going to law school upon graduation, but midway through senior year, he began to think about TFA.
“On campus, I’d been really passionate about social justice issues, and so issues of equity on campus [were] important [to me], and it was only natural that I was looking for something that I’d be able to work toward a national goal and make changes on a local level,” Cook said.
Despite the raving reviews TFA receives at Georgetown, recent articles in national media have criticized the impact of the organization. An article in The Washington Post noted concerns over the quality of educators produced by TFA. Critics of the program are mainly concerned that the five-week intensive summer training course all new teachers undergo before hitting the classrooms is not enough to transform recent graduates into quality educators. Indeed, educators like Cook sometimes have some experience in education before joining Teach For America. In 2009, Cook started Black Leadership Summer Experience, a summer camp that brought 10 students from Maryland’s Montgomery County public schools to Georgetown for one week of seminars taught by Georgetown professors, other student leaders and guest speakers. The camp focused on black leadership and heritage and college preparatory skills. Cook has been able to apply what he has learned from developing the camp now that he has joined TFA.
Cook recognized the concerns over the training at TFA, but said he believes that the TFA corps ultimately does more good than harm.
“The key word here is `urgency.’ The time is very limited to make the kind of gains to have [students] ready for high school and . have them college-ready,” Cook said. “It’s a serious challenge because the [overall] mission is to change hearts and minds, but the day-to-day challenge is to change behavior. The ultimate goal is to change their outlook and their families’ outlooks on education and what it can do for their lives.”
TFA officials said that the criticism was unwarranted. Kaitlin Gastrock, TFA’s regional spokeswoman, stressed that those five weeks are just the beginning of training for TFA teachers.
“[T]raining continues once the school year begins and throughout their two-year commitment with regular professional development from experienced mentors and coaches,” Gastrock said. “Generally, the model [of training] we have honed is making an impact.”
Despite these methods, some find it troubling that almost half of the instructors leave the organization upon completion of the mandatory two-year commitment, creating concern that instructors left before their participation can have a real impact on students.
A study conducted by the Urban Institute in 2008 found positive conclusions to TFA’s training method, however.
“The findings . suggest that programs like TFA that focus on recruiting and selecting academically talented recent college graduates and placing them in schools serving disadvantaged students can help reduce the achievement gap, even if teachers stay in teaching only a few years,” the study said.
Cook believes the biggest problem is getting enough teachers, whether they are a part of TFA or not, into schools.
“We need people who are willing to sprint as opposed to jog, and we need teachers who are willing to stay beyond their two years and use framework, use data – and adjust things to meet their goals . to make sure our students are reaching higher levels,” Cook said.
Steve de Man (COL ’04), who now does administrative work for TFA, mentioned the impact that Georgetown has had on TFA’s development over the years.
“We are all over the country, including the Teach For America Executive Directors in San Antonio, Indianapolis, Alabama. We have a strong presence of Hoyas on the recruitment team, marketing, alumni affairs and program,”Wde Man wrote in an email. “No other school represents staff like Georgetown.”
Cook was fully supportive of Georgetown’s active role in sending graduates on to join TFA.
“Georgetown creates the type of leader that can bring these things together, and we should absolutely [continue] trying to be leaders [in supporting Teach For America],” Cook said.”

As national debate persisted over the proposed construction of a Muslim community center at a site two blocks from Ground Zero in New York, a panel of professors and experts on interfaith issues gathered in Gaston Hall on Tuesday to discuss the project and the public’s reaction to the proposal.
The Prince Alwaleed Bin-Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding facilitated the event, which enabled panel members to debate whether the status of the Park51 Islamic Center stood as a referendum on American values and constitutional rights.
“Muslims, like people of all faiths, have a constitutional right . to build [religious centers],” said professor John Esposito, founding director of the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding
Thomas Farr, professor of religion and world affairs and senior fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, did not completely discount the vocal opposition to the project. “Even a constitutional right [to build the center] doesn’t mean you ought to do it,” Farr said.
“I don’t think the view that all Americans are bigots is helpful . We need a civil conversation,” he added.
Bishop John Bryson Chane, eighth Episcopal bishop of Washington Parish, said a decision against construction would endanger American freedoms.
“If the mosque is not built, then we will have caved in,” he said. “We have placed the idea of American democracy at great risk.”
Intisar Rabb (COL ’98), assistant professor of law at Boston College Law School, said he questioned the legitimacy of some opponents’ viewpoints.
“There should be informed opinions before hateful ones, not protected by the First Amendment,” Rabb said.”
