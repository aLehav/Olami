Georgetown University moved up to no. 21 in U.S. News and World Reports’ annual college rankings.
Schools ranked in the national universities category must offer a full range of undergraduate majors and graduate masters and Ph.D. programs and be committed to conducting research.
Last year, Georgetown was ranked 22.
“We believe our location in D.C., the richness of our tradition and the excellence of our faculty, are all valuable to these rankings [and are] the criteria that our students consider when choosing Georgetown,” University Spokesperson Stacy Kerr said.

Legend has it that if you step on the campus seal at the entrance to Healy Hall, you will not graduate on time. Whether or not that story is true remains to be seen, but for some students, taking an unconventional path through Georgetown is not a myth.
According to U.S. News and World Report’s 2011 college rankings, about 13 percent of Georgetown undergraduates do not graduate within four years. The reasons for prolonging one’s academic career range from choosing a five-year plan to having to take a leave of absence due to a health condition.
When Four Isn’t Enough
For Julian Sesma (COL ’13), the decision to remain on the Hilltop for a fifth year made good academic sense. As a biology-theology double major and a premed student, Sesma could graduate on time only by taking a full course load during both the academic year and summer.
Instead, during summer 2011 he remapped his academic plans to include another year at Georgetown.
“Yes, I wanted to spread out my schedule. Yes, I wanted to think about what I was going to do after my fifth year. And at the end of the day, I still had some requirements to finish up,” he said.
Sesma said he also wanted an extra year to enjoy Georgetown’s social scene and explore more opportunities.
“I think Georgetown has a lot to do with building relationships with other Hoyas, and that’s one of the main things I’ve gotten from my Georgetown experience,” he said. “Building relationships in the context of the university is the thing you’re going to carry with you.”
Sean Quigley (SFS ’13), however, never considered taking additional time to complete his degree.
Quigley, who is currently on a leave of absence, began the process of applying for medical leave last spring after a combination of schoolwork, extracurricular activities, family issues and insomnia created an unmanageable load.
After serving as editor-in-chief of The Georgetown Voice, co-director of the Improv Association and a member of the foreign service fraternity Delta Phi Epsilon, Quigley said he pushed himself too far.
“I joined all those groups my freshman year, so I had done three years of the grind of Voice, improv, fraternity stuff and schoolwork, and my grades had always been fine,” he said. “For me, it was just kind of an endurance thing. I was tired of doing it all. I fell one semester short.”
Quigley said that his dean, Maura Gregory, ultimately suggested that he take medical leave in order to get back on track.
“I [have] to give them credit, because it was Dean Gregory’s idea for me to take this leave of absence, and I wouldn’t have even known it was possible to get this semester scrubbed off my transcript,” he said.
For some students, taking a leave of absence becomes a matter of medical necessity.
Former Super Senior Anna Martignetti (COL ’12) considered taking a medical leave of absence after feeling sick during her sophomore year but did not make the decision until the illness worsened her senior year.
“I was super disconnected socially I could hardly show up to my job at The Corp. I knew something was wrong,” she said.
Martignetti was rushed into surgery for appendicitis complications when she returned home for winter break, and she went on medical leave the following semester.
“When I left, it didn’t feel as strange, because being physically sick at school is just as isolating as being sick at home,” she said.
Rewriting the Plan
The decision to remain on campus an extra year or to apply for leave requires coordination across multiple university departments.
According to Anne Sullivan, senior associate dean of the college, voluntary leave is nearly always approved, while medical leave requires more careful consideration because each student’s situation varies.
“The college deans are fully supportive of students taking a leave of absence, for good reason,” Sullivan wrote in an email. “We do not pressure students to ‘stay in school,’ and we certainly do not pressure students to rush through the degree.”
After making the decision to take a leave of absence, students work with university counselors to develop a plan for their time away.
Quigley’s leave agreement stipulated that he receive treatment for his insomnia and find a job.
“Almost always, there is no academic credit to be earned while on leave — the leave is a ‘leave’ from the academic enterprise to do other worthy and interesting things, or to respond to a family crisis or some other circumstance where stepping out of the degree for a period of a term or a year is a good idea,” Sullivan wrote.
Christopher Dicks (SFS ’12), who took two separate medical leaves of absence, went to sessions at Counseling and Psychiatric Services to decide what to do during his time away from campus. Toward the end of his leave, Dicks took summer classes at American University to readapt to academic life.
Students who forgo the typical four-year Georgetown experience say that on-campus resources proved invaluable.
When contemplating taking an additional year, Sesma went to Associate Dean of Georgetown College and Director of Catholic Studies Fr. Ryan Maher, S.J., for advice.
“Fr. Maher reminded me you’re a human being,” Sesma said. “He provided an alternative to [the four-year route].”
Dicks agreed, noting that his dean periodically checked up on him during his time away.
“It took more agency on my part to make sure there would be that much of a system but I feel like when you ask most people to help, they’re willing to help,” he said.
“A Year of Closure”
Oftentimes the final year of a five-year stay on campus can be the most difficult because many familiar faces have left.
During her senior year, Martignetti lived in Dupont Circle instead of on campus.
“I felt a distance from my peers because they wouldn’t take that time to take care of themselves,” she said. “When you’re so sick at school, it’s easy to leave and harder to come back.”
Dicks, who currently resides in Tenleytown, says that the undergraduate experience is not something that interests him any longer. Although he worked at The Corp and was involved in New Student Orientation before his leave of absence, he explained that he now feels disconnected from other undergraduates.
“There’s such a difference between an 18-year-old and a 22-year-old … a 19-year-old and a 23-year-old. … There’s nothing bad or terrible about it — it’s just a different experience,” he said.
Because of his commuter status, he said he feels more like a graduate student. At the same time, he sometimes struggles to relate to old friends who have already graduated.
“All of them have these exciting new careers, and it’s weird to feel like I could be doing that, too, but I’m still in school right now,” he said. “It’s weird to feel like a transient person going between age groups.”
Dicks added that the culture of Georgetown makes it difficult for to make a decision to extend their time at college.
“The biggest challenge of it [is] that there’s no visible presence to people who have shared that experience,” Dicks said. “There’s even some social stigma attached to it, especially at Georgetown … [They are] very prescriptive; once you’re here after the first years, you’re here for four years and that’sit.”
Sesma said that he experienced mixed feelings while watching the College’s graduation procession last spring.
“I was thinking, ‘Man, that’s my class right there,’” he said. “But on the inside I thought, ‘I’m excited about this year because I still have a good chunk of friends that are here, and I have a chance to be on the Hilltop another year.’”
While some students are more eager to leave the college life, others want to relish their last moments before becoming adults.
“I thought I would feel out of place, but in a lot of ways, I’m glad that my college experience isn’t over,” Quigley said. “Talking to my friends who have graduated, they’re [saying], ‘It’s weird for me now to be at a random keg party on N Street,’ because they’re adults.
“I’m glad that I still have that excuse to do the dumb [things] that college kids do,” he added.
Quigley, who plans on returning for the spring semester, hopes that his story can serve as a cautionary tale to freshmen who try to do everything.
“Be sure that you don’t take on too much, because you can do it for the short term, but you can only run yourself into the ground for [so] long before you just can’t go on,” he said.
However, Dicks said that his story also demonstrates the beneficial aspects of taking an additional year to graduate.
“It’s almost a little more beneficial to see your friends go through that transition before you, because then they’re also able to give you advice about applying for different jobs and what it’s like to be in different sectors, and it’s kind of nice to feel like you have people who have gone before you,” he said.
Sesma is exploring a variety of options after graduating, including taking a position with student development at the School of Foreign Service in Qatar or going to seminary or medical school.
“It’s another year to be grateful and give thanks to God,” he said.

On Sept. 5, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education released its list of the seven best colleges for free speech; Georgetown, which has been consistently criticized by the organization, was not among them.
In January, FIRE ranked Georgetown a “red light” institution for the sixth consecutive year, citing the university’s policies on harassment and free speech as problematic.
According to FIRE’s website, “red light” institutions have a minimum of one policy that “clearly and substantially” hinders freedom of speech. Such restrictions can include bans on offensive speech and any other policies that restrict student and faculty expression that would otherwise be protected by the First Amendment. FIRE released the 2012 free speech rankings, which were determined by surveying publicly available policies from 392 colleges and universities, in its January report.
FIRE highlights the university’s definition of harassment and its stance on bias-related conduct as reasons for its ranking.
Georgetown’s Code of Student Conduct defines harassment as “any intentional or persistent act(s) deemed intimidating, hostile, coercive or offensive.”
According to FIRE’s website, however, for any behavior to be deemed harassment, it must meet a stricter definition.
“In the educational context, harassment must be conduct ‘so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institution’s resources and opportunities,” FIRE wrote on its website.
FIRE also holds that bias-related conduct is protected by the First Amendment, unless it rises to the level of harassment. By this definition, Georgetown’s reporting and investigation of bias-related incidents directly violates the the protection of free speech.
Georgetown’s treatment of non-school-affiliated clubs, particularly H*yas for Choice, has also called the university’s free-speech policy into question. These clubs are permitted to set up tables to promote themselves exclusively in Red Square, which is a designated free-speech area on campus because the federal government funded its construction. In theory, H*yas for Choice and other nonaffiliated groups are permitted to table in Leavey Center in the case of inclement weather, but according to Kelsey Warrick (COL ’14), president of H*yas for Choice, access for non-affiliated student groups varies from week to week because Leavey Center is not a designated free-speech area.
“One week, we will be able to table with no issues, and another week, we’ll be sent out into the cold,” Warrick said.
However, both Warrick and Vice President Haylie Jacobson (SFS ’15) said that Georgetown has been very receptive to allowing a club like H*yas for Choice to function on campus.
“We are fortunate that Georgetown gives groups they don’t officially support, like HFC, the opportunity to speak freely in certain settings, namely Red Square,” Jacobson said.
FIRE, however, cites such unequal treatment of clubs as a violation of free speech.
“Georgetown’s Access to Benefits Policy denies groups like H*yas for Choice equal treatment among student groups, contradicting its moral and contractual promises of free speech,” FIRE wrote on its website.
While FIRE lauded Georgetown for allowing Secretary of Health and Human Services KatherineSebelius to speak at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute’s Tropaia awards ceremony despite backlash from a series of religious and pro-life groups, the organization stressed that the university cannot be selective in its application of free-speech policy.
Despite the consistently low ranking from FIRE, Georgetown Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh stood by the university’s free-speech policies.
“We believe that our speech and expression policy is very appropriate for our campus community and offers students broad freedom of expression in keeping with our mission as a Catholic and Jesuit university,” Pugh said.

A new study released by Georgetown’s Center on Education and the Workforce last month shows that education level and gender both affected employment during the recent recession and recovery.
According to Tamara Jayasundera, Georgetown research professor and co-author of the report, the study was initially aimed at understanding the differing effects of the recession and recovery on men and women.
“We started off trying to understand the story behind the ‘mancession’ and the ‘mancovery,’ and then we saw that there was a bigger story,” she said, referring to the fact that men have been disproportionately affected by the economic downturn of the last few years.
But as time went on, the research team’s focus shifted to include the effects education level had on employment, and their findings were significant.
The study reveals that students who obtained a bachelor’s degree or higher were less vulnerable to the recession than other students. Since the beginning of the recession, jobs that require a bachelor’s degree have increased by 2.2 million. In comparison, jobs that require only a high school degree or less have decreased by 5.8 million.
However, Jayasundera cautioned that not all holders of a bachelor’s degree were immune to unemployment trends during the recession.
“It’s … saying they were better off. It’s not that they didn’t get affected — they did get affected. Overall, as a group, they were better off than those who didn’t have a degree,” she said.
The study also found that male, college-educated workers suffered more job losses than women. However, they led the recovery by adding 2.3 million jobs for college graduates.
In addition, the types of jobs that men take have changed in the aftermath of the recession.
“We’re seeing more men move into female-dominated fields,” Jayasundera said.
Natasha Bowman, an adjunct professor for the School of Continuing Studies who specializes in human resources, thinks that this trend will continue as the job market continues to recover. In addition, she believes that women will soon come to dominate the workforce.
“According to the study, women are still accepting lower salaries than men, which makes them more attractive to employers,” she said.
She also suggested that recent employment trends will make graduate school and other specialized forms of study more attractive.
“I think it’s important to continue with your schooling [and] get some kind of graduate or specialty degree that distinguishes you from others in the job market,” she said. “It’s absolutely significant that Georgetown students are made aware of this data and they know the importance of staying in school and finishing their degree. Employers are actually paying for degrees now.”
Jayasundera echoed this sentiment.
“Sticking through and completing your degree seems to be the best thing you can do during this recovery,” she said.

Georgetown’s GOCard Office and PNC Bank have partnered to allow students to link their GOCards to a PNC debit account, joining a national trend that has drawn criticism from higher education advocates.
The new service, which became available Aug. 20, allows students to use their GOCards as debit cards to make transactions and withdraw money at all PNC locations free of charge, providing they open an account with PNC.
Such university-bank relationships have come under fire for imposing a wealth of hidden fees. Rich Williams, higher education advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, co-authored a report called “The Campus Debit Card Trap” in which he revealed that accounts linked to campus cards typically carry heavy fees when students leave accounts inactive, spend in excess of their account balances or even swipe their cards at merchant terminals.
“These cards can carry fees that eat into your balance, including ones for buying or reloading the card and withdrawing money from the ATMs,” he told The Hoya. “It’s very costly to get new bank members, so banks like to target young people before they select a bank. This is why banks have a long tradition of trying to weasel their way onto campuses.”
Such partnerships have become widespread in the United States in recent years. The five largest four-year public institutions in the country, including The Ohio State University, have formed financial card partnerships. Peer institutions, including Johns Hopkins University, Northwestern University and the University of Pennsylvania, have implemented programs similar to Georgetown’s, the latter also with PNC.
According to a Nov. 14, 2011 post on The New York Times’ “Bucks” blog, about 60 students held a rally at Western Washington University in opposition to what they deemed excessive fees associated with the Higher One debit accounts linked to their student ID cards.
However, Fred Solomon, vice president and director of external communications and issues management at PNC, said that the product the bank offers at Georgetown has no minimum balance requirement, monthly service charge or extra fees for using the card, provided that the cards are used only for PIN-based transactions.
Overdraft fees will apply when cardholders spend in excess of their account balances, though the bank has agreed to waive them the first time they are incurred within the first 12 months of accounts being opened.
In an email sent to the university community last night, Director of GOCard Services Roman Fahrmannsaid that Georgetown chose to partner with PNC because the bank was willing to offer packages with no fees as well as free financial training workshops for students.
Fahrmann said that the program is designed primarily to simplify students’ lives.
Solomon added that PNC provides a convenient ATM network that can benefit students long after they graduate.
“PNC has an important presence in many of the markets where Georgetown students will ultimately take jobs,” he said.
Representatives of the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, which serves a large swath of the Georgetown student community, declined to comment on the announcement.
Georgetown students had mixed views on the service. Courtney Kishbaugh (COL ’15) said she preferred to keep her debit account separate from her GOCard.
“I already have a debit card, and I don’t mind having to bring that along with my GOCard when I need to get cash,” she said. “I also know the terms of service very well with the bank I now have a card with.”
Rebecca Aklilu (MSB ’15) echoed Kishbaugh’s sentiments.
“I think the service might be suited more to freshmen who come in with that service available, but for returning students who have already set up their banking plans, I’m not sure what a big difference this will make,” she said.
Alex Jung (SFS ’13), on the other hand, praised the practicality of the option.
“It’s very convenient,” she said. “As long as students are aware of [the conditions] beforehand, it sounds fine.”
PNC and the GOCard Office have been working together to ensure the program is implemented successfully. According to Solomon, Georgetown employees in the GOCard Office have been trained to deal with the card linkage, and PNC is sending representatives to campus to promote the program.
Upperclassmen with GOCards issued in past years and other staff interested in having their GOCardsserve as their debit cards must request new GOCards. The university is waiving the replacement fee for a new GOCard in those instances. Fahrmann added that students need not worry about spending from the wrong account when they use the linked card, as the GOCard and PNC account balances will be kept separate.
“All GOCard terminals only accept GOCard transactions from the card. ATMs and PIN-based debit merchants only accept PNC transactions from the card,” he wrote. “GOCardis the only card you will need on and off campus.”

Georgetown students and alumni stand on call to assist with pressing homework questions as InstaEDU tutors.
Launched last May, InstaEDU, an online tutoring service based in California, provides high school students with one-on-one academic support around the clock.
“I think that one-on-one relationships in education are very important, especially since class sizes are getting bigger, and research shows how detrimental that can be to students,” InstaEDU co-founder and CEO Allison Johnston said.
According to Johnston, roughly 24 Georgetown alumni and students currently serve as tutors for the company.
Alexandra Kenin (COL ’01) recently became an InstaEDU tutor to maintain her French skills.
“I thought it was an interesting service. I majored in French at Georgetown and thought it was a good way to continue using the language,” she said.
The InstaEDU website revolves around a chat feature that allows students to connect with tutors. By typing a subject into the search box, students are provided with a list of available tutors who can answer the questions based on their specialties.
Students can chat with tutors through Google or Facebook at any time, and all chats link back to theInstaEDU website, where students and tutors can access a private lesson place. These secure online locations allow students to upload homework assignments so both the student and tutor can write on the assignment. Video chat is also available in this shared workspace, and no special software is required.
“We have a lot of enthusiasm from our tutors because it is a very flexible job, and students love it, too, because they have access to homework help throughout the night, and it’s more fun to get help from college students,” Johnston said.
Kenin echoed this statement. “What I think is the best is the always-on functionality [of the website]. A lot of times, you don’t know what your questions will be before cramming for a test, so it’s good to have someone to reach out to at 11 p.m.,” she said.
Though she praised the general concept of InstaEDU, Kenin suggested one improvement for the website.
“They should better gauge the level of knowledge of the tutor when matching students with tutors,” she said.
Alison Johnston, her brother Dan Johnston and Joey Shurtleff, all graduates of Stanford University,cofounded the startup company after noticing that students living outside large cities did not have access to low-cost academic resources outside of school.
“InstaEDU makes great tutors more accessible, regardless of time and location,” Alison Johnston said.
Tutoring sessions do not include time limits but come with a fee of $22 per hour. Tutors receive a wage of $20 per hour.
“Private tutoring can be costly for families, and at the end of the day, most families cannot afford it,” Alison Johnston said. “With InstaEDU, 10 minutes of tutoring corresponds to a couple dollars, which is a more manageable price.”
Though InstaEDU launched less than six months ago in May, Alison Johnston wrote in an email that the company has already hired over 1,000 tutors, all current students and alumni of top colleges like Georgetown.
“We’ve had a really great response from tutors because of the flexibility of the job, and they can earn $20 from a dorm room,” Alison Johnston said.
Potential tutors must submit an application that includes questions about previous tutoring experience, subject of specialization and the reason for their interest in the job.

Professor Maya Roth’s office in the Davis Performing Arts Center looks every bit the domain of a seasoned theater professor — performance posters are plastered on the door, artwork lines the walls and books, papers and programs litter the tables. But for Roth, it’s far from her most important space on campus.
Roth is one of five participants in Georgetown’s Faculty-in-Residence program, which allows faculty members and their families to live in university residence halls alongside the students they teach.
Along with the chaplains-in-residence, these faculty members attempt to connect academics with student life in a way that enhances both facets of the Hilltop experience.
Roth, the program director of theater and performance studies in the College, has resided in a spacious fifth-floor LXR Hall apartment with her husband and five-year-old son for the past three and a half years. She sees living with students as an extension of her role as a teacher.
“Because I’m in theater — and I do creative practice as well as academic courses — from my first year, I’ve had a really close relationship with many students,” she said.
Roth holds several classes each semester in her apartment and organizes formal and informal events for students living on East Campus, often coordinating with resident assistants to attract more participants. These activities range from faculty dinners to themed group discussions to trips to the Kennedy Center.
Her role, however, isn’t limited to that of a floor event planner. Roth believes the simple presence of a family in the hall is comforting to students, especially those whose permanent homes are far from D.C.
“I don’t think quite as many students would stop by and say hi in the lobby if we didn’t have a five-year-old kid running around,” she said.
Roth also sees her on-campus residence as essential to balancing her roles as a parent and a teacher.
“Since having a child, I cannot imagine how I would do all that I did before, and indeed now even more, if I didn’t live on campus,” she wrote in an email.
While they can’t always compete with the entertainment value of an energetic kindergartner, Georgetown’s Jesuits-in-residence bring a spiritual element to the residence halls, while simultaneously serving as mentors, like Roth and her colleagues.
Fr. David Collins, S.J., holds open houses every week in his eighth-floor Village C West suite. All students are invited to stop by for good conversation and, if they’re lucky, Collins’ excellent hot cider and cookies.
“It’s an unstructured way for students to come up and, in fact, raise issues that they want to talk about,” Collins said. “The advantage of putting so much emphasis on unstructured open house is that it allows themes to be set by students.”
According to Collins, a history professor, the experience of living in a residence hall allows faculty to interact with students they might never otherwise encounter.
“I like the wide range of spontaneous interactions with students,” Collins said. “I have history students in the classroom. I have Catholic students in the church. … [Being a Jesuit-in-residence] is completely outside those two main contexts.”
For Fr. Dan Madigan, S.J., an Australian priest entering his first year as LXR’s Jesuit-in-residence, the experience represents a chance to expand his understanding of American college life.
“I was very interested to meet RAs — that was an eye-opener, because I didn’t go to a school like this,” Madigan said. “I went to undergrad in Australia, and we always go to state university as commuters, so we don’t have the sense of 24/7 residential contact.”
A theology professor, Madigan echoed Collins on the value of meeting a more diverse group of undergraduates.
“One of the things I wanted to do was get to know a broader cross-section of students,” Madigan said. “We make a lot of the fact that this is a Jesuit university, but many students never get to meet a Jesuit.”
Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., the chaplain-in-residence in Kennedy Hall, served as a Jesuit-in-residence for five years at Santa Clara University. He is taking his first crack at Georgetown’s program this semester and is in the process of organizing dorm activities that go way outside the box.
“I’m going to lead a secret Jesuit tour,” Carnes said. “Essentially, at nine at night we go with flashlights to different historical sites, get keys to see secret places around campus … and finish up with ice cream at my apartment.”
Whether they’re leading trips to the Kennedy Center or simply providing desserts and advice, it’s clear that faculty-in-residence are a useful — and possibly underutilized — resource for students.
“Their events bring together people from different floors who would otherwise not meet each other, but I don’t think students take enough advantage of the opportunity,” Giulliana Gonzalez (NHS ’14) said. “I think they’re a very good support network, even if you’re not religious. The chaplain I had wasn’t my denomination, but they were still a great support. Just because you’re not religious doesn’t mean you’re not in need of a chaplain.”
And despite the fact that Georgetown students have a reputation for playing nearly as hard as they work, faculty-in-residence say that dorm life is no more chaotic than is typical for a college community.
“I hear less student noise where I am now than I did in the house where I was living before,” Cadigan said, referring to an all-Jesuit residence on 35th Street.
Collins agreed, with one caveat.
“Other than when the Yankees won the World Series, I’ve never been kept up at night,” he said.

Imam Sabahudin Ceman recounted his experiences in a concentration camp during the Balkan War before a hushed audience in Riggs Library Monday afternoon.
“In 1992, I was taken from my home,” he said. “I was tortured, as were many others, but by the will of God, I survived. … It would be easy if this were only my experience, but there are so many people who share what I do.”
Ceman spoke on a panel organized by the Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at the event “Legacies of War and Reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina: Living Together in the Future.” It featured four panelists with a range of experiences in the Balkan region and was moderated by Berkeley Center Director Thomas Banchoff.
The event coincided with the International Prayer for Peace in Sarajevo, the largest annual prayer gathering in the world, which runs from Sept. 9 through 11, 2012.
The panelists discussed specific actions to be taken as well as broader ideas about reconciliation in the region.
“There is a hunger to learn more about peace; there is a hunger to dream about peace for this country and beyond,” said panelist Andrea Bartoli, dean of the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University.
Panelist Nida Gelazis, senior associate for European studies at the Woodrow Wilson Center, explained more practical ways that Bosnia and Herzegovina can continue to rebuild.
“It’s the integration of the west Balkans into NATO that’s really important,” she said. “It’s the process of [working with your former enemies] and becoming a member of NATO in itself that is transformative.”
Ceman described his wish for reconciliation and forgiveness among the Balkan people.
“I do not hold any hatred or wish for retribution in my heart. This is not a way to live,” he said.
Maryann Cusimano Love, associate professor of politics at the Catholic University of America, shared her expertise about the violence women face during war. She noted that rape is often used as a tool of war and also described the work of women’s faith-based non-profit organizations.
“There was an attitude of ‘boys will be boys’ [and] women are the spoils of war. This has been going on for all of humanity. Sisters in the religious communities did not take that lightly,” she said.
Students were affected by the panelists’ calls for peace.
“I thought it was interesting that the main theme of the speakers’ presentations was moving forward instead of seeking retribution for the past,” Dana Sievers (SFS ’14) said.
Ceman echoed this sentiment in his presentation.
“There’s a basic right of peace and justice for all. Justice and peace are two wings of one bird. We cannot fly with one wing only. There is no peace without justice. There is no justice without peace,” he said. “I do not know how long it could take, but this is what my hopes are, so future generations don’t have to experience what I did.”

Center for Social Justice tutoring groups D.C. Reads and the D.C. Schools Project have both seen a surge in interest this semester, according to organization leaders.
D.C. Reads and D.C. Schools are volunteer-based, student-run organizations that send Georgetown students to tutor in underserved local schools. Both incorporate one-on-one elementary school tutoring and middle and high school mentorship programs.
D.C. Schools employs roughly 200 students, while about 240 students are involved in D.C. Reads on a yearly basis, according to D.C. Schools Partnership Training and Advocacy Coordinator Alejandra Martinez (SFS ’13) andD.C. Reads Program Director Nathanial Roloff.
D.C. Schools updated its recruitment process this year to accommodate the increase in applicants.
“It’s our first year ever doing group interviews,” said Maya Gebeily (SFS ’13), D.C. Schools community liaison. “We’re making sure we focus on quality. … Interviewing really allows us to place people in the programs they’ll be most useful in.”
According to Gebeily, the program capped hiring at 130 volunteers this year.
D.C. Reads has similarly seen an increase in volunteer interest.
“Recruitment is going better than it ever has,” Roloff said, adding that the organization intends to accept the vast majority of applicants. “It’s not based on your experience. It’s based on your attitude.”
According to D.C. Reads tutor Daniel Silkman (COL ’15), the program increased its presence on campus this semester by tabling at the Student Activities Fair and in Red Square. He added that all of the required training sessions for D.C. Reads have been full.
Martinez is also confident about her program’s recruitment process.
“To know the program will be left in good hands is the most awesome, reassuring feeling of all time,” she said.

Georgetown has secured Xerox to conduct an assessment of printing options and access across campus, Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis announced in a university broadcast email Monday afternoon.
According to the email, a working group consisting of faculty and staff from the Main Campus, Law School and Medical Center will be established to work with Xerox to evaluate the total cost of printing, copying, faxing and scanning on campus.
The assessment will also address the age and state of the equipment, with the ultimate goal of reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency of printing.
Xerox’s analysis and data collection will begin on October 25 and last approximately 30 days, culminating in final recommendations at the end of November, according to Davis’s email.

Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) was named a student representative to the steering committee of the Georgetown Community Partnership.
The partnership is designed to provide a forum for resolving issues between the university and its neighbors and was a key element of the resolution to the 2010 Campus Plan negotiations, which ended this summer.
“I just found out this morning,” Gustafson said. “We’re very excited that we were able to get a student representative on the steering committee. It shows that students are a party in this discussion.”
Gustafson’s appointment comes at the end of several months of lobbying on the part of GUSA and other student groups to have a student representative included among the leaders of the GCP.
“It was our biggest concern right of the gate because the language of the Campus Plan said that the partnership would be led by someone from [Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E] and a top university administrator, but it didn’t say anything about students, so we’ve been talking and making sure to bring it up in every single meeting all summer,” Gustafson said.
ANC 2E chair Ron Lewis was appointed to co-chair the partnership last week, though the university has not named its own delegate to the committee. According to Gustafson, the organization and responsibilities of the steering committee have not been finalized, but she expects that it will meet for the first time sometime in October.

The Georgetown University Student Association senate voted unanimously Sunday to hold a student body-wide referendum regarding changes to the Code of Student Conduct’s evidentiary standard.
If passed, the referendum would not have the power to change the standard, which is currently set at “more likely than not.”
The bill is instead intended to demonstrate student support for the Disciplinary Review Committee’s proposal that the burden of proof be raised to “clear and convincing evidence” for all student disciplinary processes except those involving sexual assault.
The proposal is now awaiting approval from Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, who told The Hoya last week that he would delay his decision until the Office of Student Conduct had undergone an external review set for early this fall. According to GUSA senate Transition Chair Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), the bill was proposed in support of an open letter GUSA sent to Olson last week that urged him to expedite his approval of the change.
“[The delay] wasn’t acceptable to us, because the committee passed the recommendation in the spring. It’s very, very urgent. Every week we don’t pass this recommendation, more students are harmed by this flawed standard,” Tisa said.
The voting process will resemble that of the Student Activities Fee Endowment referendum, which was held last January; all students will receive an email with a link to an online ballot.
The text of the referendum urges a swift adoption of the stricter evidentiary standard. “The ‘more likely than not’ standard of evidence for disciplinary procedures has proven a disservice to students and enforcers alike,” it reads. “This change must be implemented with the utmost urgency.”
The referendum will be held on Sept. 27, concurrent with the external review and with the general elections for the GUSA senate.
Tisa pointed out that the date was specifically set in order to show the external auditors that students support the evidentiary standard change.
According to GUSA’s open letter to Olson, the Georgetown University Law Center and several peer universities, including Duke, Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania, use the “clear and convincing” standard.
GUSA senators expressed their support of the referendum and their disappointment with the university’s lack of action.
“The very frustrating disciplinary process we have here makes me feel we’re almost barbaric or archaic in a way,” senator Zach Singer (SFS ’15) said. “The fact [is] that it doesn’t look like you’re doing it, but you don’t have evidence to prove yourself innocent. … I find it incredibly ridiculous.”
The referendum must receive at least 2,000 votes to be considered valid. Of those votes, a majority must be affirmative for the proposal to pass.
Tisa stressed that the referendum result will not be a binding change to the university policy but will instead prove students’ support for the change.
“This is the most official action we can take,” Tisa said. “It’s meant to show people in the [Office of Student Conduct] that the student body isn’t going to forget about this. It’s not something that’s transitory or [will be] dropped. This is something that’s here to stay. We’re going to continue to pressure for this change.”
GUSA senator Jay Factor (COL ’14), however, expressed concern about the nonbinding nature of the referendum.
“If [they] pass it by whatever percentage, and then still nothing happens, thi s seems like students might get cynical towards GUSA, at least a little, in terms of being able to express our opinions any time, but we can’t do anything to change,” Factor said.
According to GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), the Student Advocacy Office plans to collect testimonials from students who are willing to share their experiences with the Office of Student Conduct in the disciplinary process. The testimonials will then be presented to the auditors of the Code of Conduct Office.
Olson declined to comment on issues pertaining to the evidentiary standard at press time.
