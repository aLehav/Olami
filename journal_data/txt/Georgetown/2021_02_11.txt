The Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy and Howard University launched a full-tuition scholarship for a current student or graduate of Howard to attend one of the McCourt School’s four master’s programs in public policy, broadening academic collaboration between the universities.
Representatives from both schools signed a formally written commitment to the joint project, titled the Howard Scholar at McCourt program, on Jan. 29 that will further connect and encourage new research partnerships between Howard and Georgetown.
The program and memorandum will strengthen the relationship between the two Washington, D.C. universities, according to Georgetown Provost Robert Groves.
“This partnership creates an additional vehicle for collaboration between two world-class faculties, and deepens the ties between the Georgetown and Howard communities,” Groves wrote in an email to The Hoya.
All Howard students and alumni who apply and are admitted to one of the McCourt School’s five graduate programs will be automatically considered for the scholarship. The first recipient for the 2021-22 academic year will be announced April 15. The application process is now closed for the current cycle.
The new program underscores both universities’ dedication to community, according to Anthony K. Wutoh, Howard provost and chief academic officer.
“This agreement deepens the relationship between Howard and Georgetown, two preeminent institutions committed to service and scholarship in the name of improving our local and global communities,” Wutoh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Howard Scholar at McCourt program is the latest of several partnerships between Georgetown and Howard. The Georgetown-Howard Universities Center for Clinical and Translational Science is a multi-institutional consortium of medical research institutions established in 2010 to promote clinical research in the District. In October 2020, the Georgetown University Law Center’s Innovative Police Program partnered with Howard University and The Lab @ DC, a scientific team based in the D.C. Office of the City Administrator, to co-host the final session of a seven-part workshop series focused on the role of police stops and their impact on local communities.
The universities may have further opportunities for collaboration because of Georgetown Law’s new campus building near Capitol Hill, about two miles from Howard’s campus, according to Maria Cancian, dean of the McCourt School.
“We are excited to build on our collaboration with Howard University as we prepare to move to the Capital Campus and take advantage of being even closer neighbors,” Cancian wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The collaboration between Georgetown, a predominately white institution, and Howard, a historically Black university, supports efforts to increase the diversity in public policy, according to Barron Harvey, dean emeritus and associate provost for academic innovation and strategic initiatives at Howard.
“The Faculty of the McCourt School is committed to ensuring that the school increase the diversity of its student body and to increasing diversity in Public Policy. Howard University is excited about the partnership and its future achievements,” Harvey wrote in an email to The Hoya.

LaHannah Giles (COL ’23) was first drawn to community service after interacting with the younger members of her neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago and witnessing the lack of support adults had for her community’s youth. 
Determined to change what she saw, Giles launched March for the Hood, a youth-led organization with a mission to invest directly in the education of young people in predominantly Black neighborhoods such as Chicago’s South Side. In August, the group successfully delivered book bags of school supplies and food to 250 Chicago students. 
March for the Hood aims to guide youth in marginalized communities, according to Giles. 
“It’s to change the narrative surrounding youth leadership and to, in some ways, empower youth to be change agents within their community,” Giles said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I guess through taking initiative they could make a huge difference.”
As Giles learned about her neighbors’ experiences, she realized her peers were not receiving enough praise and support from their teachers. In one conversation, a high school neighbor told her that instead of thinking about college visits or attending pre-college programs, he felt as though the adults in his life were urging him to join the army after graduating, according to Giles.
“There’s nothing wrong for fighting for our country, but it was hard for this student to hear someone tell him that was all he could be,” Giles said. “It was heartbreaking to hear that no one was inspiring him.”
Giles originally planned to launch March for the Hood with an Aug. 15 citywide march in an effort to increase awareness about investing in Black communities, according to a March for the Hood July 28 Instagram post. 
“We must demand that the City of Chicago invest in Black communities as disinvestment accelerates issues such as gang violence, youth detainment, mental health issues, and more,” the post said. “By the end of the march, community members will leave aware of how much investment is needed.”
Due to unexpected circumstances, Giles was forced to cancel the march, but she hopes to reschedule for this summer. 
Because hosting an in-person event was not possible, Giles instead focused her attention on gathering resources for South Side students, including backpacks of food and school supplies donated in August. Using a GoFundMe page, Giles worked alongside Kariel Bennett (COL ’23), another Chicago organizer, to raise funds to purchase school supplies for students on the South Side. As of Feb. 10, the page has received $802 in donations, the majority of which came from Georgetown students, according to Giles. 
“Increased resources in communities of color, instead of increased police presence, would and could save many lives,” Giles wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In addition to her work with March for the Hood, Giles was awarded the Patrick Healy Scholarship this fall. The scholarship aims to promote diversity at Georgetown by supporting undergraduate students, specifically minority students, with a demonstrated financial need. 
It was an honor to be recognized for living up to the honor of Patrick Healy, former Georgetown president, according to Giles.
“It means a lot because it means I can continue my education without worrying about how I’m going to pay for it,” Giles said. “Not having to worry about where my financial support will come from has been really rewarding. It’s something most people don’t get to experience.”
Giles’ leadership propelled the March for the Hood forward last year despite how new the group is, according to Nia Welch, co-founder of March for the Hood.
“LaHannah is very hands-on and dedicated, and once she puts her mind to something there’s nothing stopping her,” Welch said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “There were challenges along the way, but what makes a great leader is someone who keeps it all in control and thinks on their feet. She challenges us to go out of our comfort zones.”
Confidence is the key to continued success with March for the Hood, according to Giles.
“Something I’ve learned is that I need to always have confidence in the work I’m doing, not having confidence leaves people questioning their vision for community work,” Giles said. “You can have a vision for your community, but the vision won’t really be impactful unless you talk to people in the community you’re trying to impact. Understanding their experience is very important.”

Georgetown University announced it will move forward with an in-person, five-week, on-campus experience meant to integrate first-year and transfer students into the Georgetown community. 
The program, which will take place from June 4 to July 9, will give students the opportunity to take credit-bearing courses, live in on-campus dorms and engage in group activities. Most first-year and transfer students have not experienced the campus aspect of college life because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The university will offer financial assistance to ensure all students have adequate support to attend the program, according to the Summer Sessions website.
The optional program will provide first-year and transfer students with the opportunity to bond with their peers while experiencing campus life, Vice Provost for Education Rohan Williamson wrote in a Feb. 3 email to students. 
“This will be a unique experience for the Class of 2024 and our new transfer student Hoyas, which will offer an opportunity for in-person interaction with faculty, on-campus activities with peers, building community in residence halls, and learning about Washington, D.C.,” Williamson wrote. 
The program is an exciting opportunity, according to Amelia Wanamaker (COL ’24), who is from Atlanta, but is living in Washington, D.C., for the spring semester.
“I think it would be a good chance to meet more members of my class in a way that I wasn’t able to this year in the Georgetown setting, so actually on campus,” Wanamaker said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I’m hoping that I’ll get to meet a lot of new people and get some time to meet faculty and staff face to face — and then also get my bearings on campus because I don’t know where anything is.”
Because of changing public health conditions and COVID-19 infection rates, the program is subject to modification, according to a university spokesperson, and the program will have to be reviewed and accepted by the D.C. government before its initiation.
In a Nov. 16 email, the university announced it would hold classes online in the spring semester and invited only 500 additional students, mostly seniors, to live on campus. The university was disappointed to deny many students an on-campus, in-person experience, according to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
“We know how eager the members of our community are to return, particularly our first-year and transfer students who have had to delay the beginning of their time on campus, and the disappointment that comes with this decision,” DeGioia wrote.
Provost Robert Groves also acknowledged the disappointment many first-year and transfer students are experiencing in a Feb. 3 post to his Georgetown blog.
“One damage inflicted by COVID at Georgetown is that it deprived the Class of 2024 and transfer students from having those informal bonding experiences,” Groves wrote. “Most of them continued to live with their families, probably occupying the same spaces they did as a high schooler. They were, by and large, experiencing Georgetown in physical isolation.”
The university hopes the program will give first-years and transfer students an experience to offset their unorthodox first year as Georgetown students, according to Groves.
“We can’t replace the on-campus experiences that the students would have had between August and May,” Groves wrote in his blog post. “We do believe that this immersive experience may help to form some of the important bonds among classmates.”
However, Lincoln Le (COL ’24), a Florida native who is living in Arlington, Va., this semester, said he feels the program is an inadequate introduction to life at Georgetown.
“Students who are on campus or close to campus, they would have to go home for like a month, and then they’d have to fly or book some sort of fare, or like drive or something back onto campus, stay for five weeks and then go home for another month and then fly back,” Le said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “That’s four different flights, four or five different flights. And yeah, so that definitely, like, cuts into the cost of your whole summer.”

Georgetown should offer free tuition for this session and just charge for Room & Board.  It’s a nice bonding experience, but there is no academic benefit for students who have taken a full load.  The administration should review the Yale model, which is offering two free Summer classes to the Class of 2024.

I appreciate the effort but what about kids w summer jobs? And for those kids that can’t go bc they aren’t eligible for financial aid yet still can’t spend the money, are they deprived of a proper orientation? Will they have to begin their sophomore year w no real orientation? The Student affairs office said the focus on the fall will be on the class of 2025. This adds insult to injury for the class of 2024 whose virtual orientation hardly suffices. There needs to be some serious re tweaking of this plan. The class of 2024 more than anyone, deserves to have the ref carpet rolled out in the fall.

Please don’t consider this summer session as a substitute for an orientation for the class of 2024. They have been overlooked and deserve to have an in person orientation -on campus- just as much (and some would agree more than the class of 2025!) Also, a large percentage of students and families will likely not be able to participate in the summer program due to plans for summer employment, family trips or financial constraints. The university needs to make up for all that this freshman class has already missed out on. They need to be oriented to being a Hoya

The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected Washington, D.C. wards with a high percentage of Black and Latinx residents and a greater number of people who are less likely to be able to work remotely, according to a study by the Georgetown University Center for Global Health Science and Security.
The COVID-19 special report titled, “Analysis of Demographics and Mobility Across D.C. During COVID-19,” was published Jan. 26 and is the third citywide report commissioned by the Office of the D.C. Auditor. GHSS partnered with the research and development company Talus Analytics for all three reports, which are part of a larger six-month effort to understand the efficacy of current COVID-19 pandemic mitigation policies. 
Stay-at-home guidelines and policies, especially the official Apr. 1 stay-at-home order released by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), coincided with the largest drop of mobility across the District, according to the report. These guidelines were less successful in reducing mobility effectively in Wards 7 and 8, which have higher poverty rates than the rest of the city. 
“Those in Wards 7 and 8 had the smallest increase in people staying home, both in the spring when stay-at-home orders were in place and through the end of 2020, consistent with needing to leave home for work,” the report reads. “These results are consistent with trends reported nationally: underserved and socially and economically vulnerable populations face disproportionate impacts from COVID-19.”
The report hypothesized that mobility limiting efforts to prevent transmission failed in certain wards because those areas are home to more essential and frontline workers.
Using employment data from the American Community Survey from 2014 to 2018, the report found that the wards that saw the smallest decrease in mobility also had the most amount of jobs in which teleworking is impossible, thus leading to the disproportionate levels of COVID-19 cases in Wards 4, 5, 7 and 8, with particularly high fatality rates in Wards 7 and 8.
The report’s findings are important because they highlight the demographics of essential workers and the risks they take to do their jobs, according to Ellie Graeden, CEO of Talus Analytics and adjunct professor at GHHS.
“Those people who didn’t stay at home and remained more mobile were also those who are disproportionately employed as essential workers, for example. Then, obviously, they couldn’t stay home. It wasn’t a matter of not following the rules, which is too often the assumption,” Graeden said in an interview with The Hoya. “They were the ones who were making it possible for you to stay home.”
While COVID-19 cases in D.C. have been declining in recent weeks, at least 38,348 cases and 965 deaths attributed to COVID-19 have been reported in D.C. since coronavirus was first detected in the city in February 2020. A June report published by the School of Nursing & Health Studies confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the inequities of the healthcare system and has predominantly hurt communities of color and socioeconomically vulnerable communities. This newest report by GHSS not only confirmed minorities were more likely to contract and die from the virus, but also identified several economic and social risk factors for why these communities in D.C. have been most affected. 
In addition to identifying correlations between demographics and COVID-19 rates, the report also aimed to provide targeted policy recommendations to the Office of the D.C. Auditor. The report used policy data from the COVID Analysis and Mapping of Policies, a database tool created by Graeden and GHSS in early 2020, to identify effective policies to inform future response efforts, according to Graden.
“Building all the work we had done together, we then performed all of this analysis, applying what we had learnt in the context of COVID AMP to solving this as a practical policy question that was being raised by D.C. in the context of managing the response,” Graeden said. “But as the pandemic gets longer, it gets easier — more data is available, for better or for worse.”
As of Feb. 8, the D.C. metropolitan area remains in Phase Two of Mayor Bowser’s reopening plan, and approximately 14.5% of the District’s population has been vaccinated against the coronavirus. D.C. should continue to prioritize vaccinating essential workers with high mobility rates to not only curb the spread of the virus but also to help address equity issues, according to the report. 
“The current focus in the District’s vaccination plan is well aligned with this focus on testing essential workers, with clear targets for vaccinating high risk essential workers starting January 11, 2021, with remaining essential workers eligible as of February 1, 2021,” the report reads. “Ensuring that these groups feel comfortable receiving the vaccine and have easy access to places of vaccination will be key.”

As the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues in Washington, D.C., community members are frustrated over vaccination sign-up protocols and a lack of racial equity in distribution.  
Some D.C. residents are criticizing the District’s vaccination effort as supplies from the federal government fail to meet residents’ demand and concerns arise over registration system technology failures, misinformation and racial disparities in vaccination distribution. D.C.’s vaccination program is currently in Phase 1B, which expands vaccine eligibility to those living in the District who are 65 years and older, teachers and other educators in addition to frontline workers, first responders and residents of community facilities like group homes and homeless shelters.
D.C. residents can sign up for a vaccine by calling the city’s coronavirus call center or through an online portal. New appointments are made available for registration on a weekly basis, and residents can register for alerts to notify them when slots open.  
The chiefly digital vaccine registration process has challenged some eligible residents, especially those who are 65 and over, according to Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Commissioner Kishan Putta.
“They make seniors go online every single week to try again and to keep trying over and over again. It is really stressful,” Putta said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Like cities nationwide, the amount of residents who are trying to book vaccination appointments outnumbers the quantity of vaccine doses D.C. has received from the federal government. As of Feb. 6, 94,100 doses of the vaccine were delivered to D.C. officials, with 67,688 having been administered. District officials are currently working with the Biden administration to secure greater stores of the vaccine, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said in a Jan. 22 press conference. With the shortage of vaccines in D.C., Georgetown University is punishing first- and second-year medical students who were vaccinated while ineligible. 
Beyond digital barriers and vaccine shortages, racial disparities in vaccine distribution also trouble many advocates and officials. Black D.C. residents are receiving vaccines in lesser numbers than white ones, as are Hispanic residents to non-Hispanic ones, according to data released by D.C. Health. As of Jan. 28, 17,520 white residents had received at least one vaccine dose, while only 9,967 Black residents and 1,625 Hispanic D.C. residents are recorded as having received at least one dose. Racial and ethnic identity data are often self reported, however, which leads to missing information, according to D.C. Health. 
These discrepancies exist despite low-income communities of color experiencing the most significant repercussions of the pandemic. Lengthy appointment registration processes along with difficulty securing transportation and time off from work have contributed to the problem. 
Communities of color have also demonstrated heightened skepticism surrounding the vaccine in comparison to other groups. In December, a Pew Research Center poll found that just 42% of Black Americans indicated a willingness to be vaccinated in comparison to 63% of Hispanic and 61% of white adults.
Even within the medical community, reluctance to receive the vaccine exists, according to Anita Jenkins, CEO of the Howard University Hospital, who spoke at a Jan. 29 Public Oversight Roundtable on the District’s vaccination rollout hosted by the D.C. Council Committee on Health. 
“I surveyed our own employees, who are majority Black and Brown, and we did realize that we had a significant portion of even that hospital community who were hesitant or unwilling to take the vaccine,” Jenkins said in her testimony. 
City leadership must improve communication with residents and prioritize equity in vaccine distribution, according to Councilmember Elissa Silverman, who spoke at the roundtable. 
“We do not communicate well with our residents and businesses in a crisis,” Silverman said in her testimony. “We need to be aware that a first-come, first-served approach is just not racially equitable in our city to distribute government services, given that all our residents do not have equal access to high-speed internet, to computers and even just time — time to sit on the phone and schedule appointments.”
To increase equity in vaccine distribution, officials made certain appointments available only for eligible residents in Wards 1, 4, 5, 7 and 8, which have large minority populations and have seen low sign-up rates. D.C. Health announced its “Faith in the Vaccine” initiative Feb. 7, which will host vaccination clinics at churches. The Pennsylvania Avenue Baptist Church in Ward 7 will serve as the pilot for the program, vaccinating residents with pre-registered appointments. 
D.C. officials should provide more educational resources about the safety of the vaccine, as many residents lack adequate information, according to Kevin Poge, an essential worker who spoke at the roundtable. 
“Most of us get our information from the news or from social media,” Poge said in his testimony. “You know as well as I know when you get your information from social media, you get all the conspiracy theories and everything that comes along with that.” 
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have undergone rigorous clinical trials and have been proven safe by the Food and Drug Administration, but some residents remain hesitant about making their appointments, according to Putta.
“There are a lot of people who were worried that these vaccines were developed so quickly and that shortcuts must have been taken. There are a lot of people who worry about the side effects,” Putta said. “Luckily I think we can say that both of those reasons for hesitation have been disproven, but we need to really work hard to not just disprove it in theory, but actually to show people and reach people with messaging and convince them that they don’t have to worry about it.”
Considering and accommodating the need for vaccines in multiple D.C. demographic groups is an ongoing challenge for city officials, according to Putta. 
“We have priorities based on the need to run our society, and we need to prioritize essential workers,” Putta said. “But we also need to prioritize those who are most vulnerable, and it’s a very hard balancing act.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate unanimously approved a resolution calling for greater transparency surrounding the university’s COVID-19 guidelines in a Feb. 7 meeting.   
The university’s Community Compact was updated in January with stricter health regulations for the spring semester. On-campus students and staff and students living in the nearby neighborhoods of Georgetown, Burleith and Foxhall were required to sign the Community Compact, a set of guidelines Georgetown established last August to limit the spread of COVID-19. 
The compact prohibits gatherings of 10 or more students on or near campus, requires weekly COVID-19 testing for students on campus or in the surrounding neighborhoods and outlines disciplinary measures for violating the regulations.
GUSA’s resolution urges the Office of Student Conduct to consolidate all Compact guidelines and provide clear communication to students, according to GUSA Senator Nirvana Khan (SFS ’24), who introduced the legislation.
“Basically, just asking Georgetown to do their job and be clear on community guidelines, include specifics of the policies and the Community Compact and equitably enforce noise complaints and things like that, because it’s not fair for one person to get suspended over a one-time offense and then another person gets a slap on the wrist,” Khan said at the meeting.
Last semester, many students living off campus in the surrounding neighborhoods reported unfair punishment for violations unrelated to COVID-19 regulations, such as noise complaints. These rules are enforced by the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program, a service provided by the Office of Neighborhood Life that addresses community complaints against off-campus student houses. 
SNAP has focused on addressing non-COVID-19-related noise complaints rather than more pressing COVID-19 violations, which is what the resolution wants to change, according to Khan.
“You might think that most noise complaint violations come from parties, but from what I’ve heard that’s far from the case — practically every person I’ve heard who received a noise complaint got it when they were hanging out with masks on outside,” Khan said in a message to The Hoya. 
SNAP has concentrated its efforts on health and safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically addressing large student gatherings and enforcing mask wearing and social distancing, according to a university spokesperson.
“We are grateful that the vast majority of Georgetown students are following public health guidance and taking care to ensure the safety of themselves and others in the community. We have been concerned about, and will continue to monitor, violations occurring with gathering size, as well as lack of mask usage and appropriate social distancing,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Punishments were further exacerbated after the university repealed its appeals process for students facing disciplinary action, according to Khan.
“Students felt this illusion kind of, because they were getting flagged when they were hanging outside with their friends,” Khan said. “They would get flagged by SNAP for noise complaints and things like that, and SNAP would just drive around and if they could hear anything then they would put sanctions even if nobody complained.”
The resolution demands the university reinstate its appeals process for students facing COVID-19-related consequences less severe than suspension.
In addition to urging greater transparency, the resolution recommends the university create incentives for students who follow guidelines and create spaces on campus that foster safe social interaction, according to Khan. 
Following weeks of student and staff complaints of unsafe protocols, the resolution also asks the university to implement stricter regulations at Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall.
With the addition of 500 more students living on campus this semester, GUSA Senator Bella Fassett (SFS ’24), who lives on campus, says more COVID-19 precautions are necessary for the dining hall.
“I, myself, started to feel unsafe in the dining hall, with there being now at least three times the amount of people here on campus,” Fassett, who endorsed the legislation, said at the meeting. “They’ve actually recently made some changes, for COVID safety, but I still feel like there is a lot more that can be done.” 
The resolution encourages the university to implement an occupancy limit in Leo’s, extend dinner hours until 8 p.m. to alleviate a dinner rush, increase signage encouraging mask wearing and social distancing and provide Leo’s workers with medical-grade masks.
According to Khan, the resolution’s goal is to increase student compliance with the university’s guidelines by clarifying, rather than lessening, any COVID-19 regulations.
“The resolution definitely doesn’t seek to take off penalties for not following COVID guidelines and it’s very clear about that,” Khan said. “There’s no chance of students following the guidelines if they don’t even know what they are.”
