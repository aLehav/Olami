O’Donovan Hall has been evacuated three times this semester after fire alarms have sounded due to faulty equipment.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, the most recent fire alarm went off Oct. 31, when a faulty heater started to smoke in a storage room that is connected to the Southwest Garage.
“When we all heard the alarm go off, we were told there was some sort of grease fire and that we had to get out of the building,” said Ronald Lowery, who has worked at Leo’s for three years. “We and some students waited outside for 30 to 45 [minutes] while DPS checked out the facility. I never saw anything to imply that an actual fire had taken place, though.”
The two previous incidents occurred in mid-September and early October. The first was caused by a bad sensor in the fire alarm system, the second by a faulty food warmer in the lower-level kitchen.
“Generally, there have been more alarms here this fall than usual. I’m not sure if it’s just a coincidence or not,” said Capricia Lorick, who began working at Leo’s in February. “All I know is that none of them have been the result of any major problems. We just all have to follow the evacuation order — that’s mandatory.”
Kerr said that each issue that caused a fire alarm in the dining hall has been subsequently repaired by University Facilities.

For 25 years, the Georgetown University Law Center’s early assurance program has admitted a select number of Georgetown undergraduates without requiring them to complete the LSAT.
For many prospective undergrads aspiring to careers as hotshot lawyers or august judges, the program is among the most appealing features of a Georgetown undergraduate education. But it can also be the most elusive.
Applicants are required to submit only a transcript with five semesters of grades along with two letters of recommendation, but they must also boast an undergraduate GPA of 3.8 or higher.
Georgetown Law Dean of Admissions Andy Cornblatt said that although all law schools have seen a decline in applicants in recent years, the program has remained competitive.
“It’s pretty steady,” he said. “We haven’t seen a significant drop.”
According to the Law Center’s website, 21 of the 52 Georgetown applicants for the class entering in fall 2013, or 40 percent, were admitted in that cycle. That reflects a more competitive pool than in the 2012 cycle, when 50 percent of applicants were accepted, but a less competitive pool than in 2011, from which only 26 percent were admitted. The accepted pool has had an average GPA of at least 3.9 since the 2008 cycle, with the figure peaking at 3.93 for the class entering in 2009.
“It’s a very difficult program to get admitted to,” Cornblatt said. “Many students don’t get in through early assurance but are admitted through the regular process.”
Laura Brayton (MSB ’13) applied to the early assurance program last winter but was ultimately accepted as a regular decision applicant this fall. Nonetheless, she expressed enthusiasm about the program.
“I think it’s a great program for students to have the opportunity to get into law school in the spring semester of their junior year,” she said. “It provides a stress relief and makes applying to other schools for regular decision easier, as you are already guaranteed to go to a top 14 law school and have a personal statement already written.”
Cornblatt said that the purpose of the program, which is non-binding, is to allow top students to make the most of their senior years by taking less conventional course loads. Cornblatt said he considers the program, which is unusual among law schools, a success.
“It’s helped us to attract and keep some of the very best students from our terrific undergrad school,” he said. “For many top students … it makes it that much easier to say yes back to us. It allows us to keep many of our stars in the Hoya family.”
Though such early assurance programs are common among medical schools throughout the country, Georgetown’s program is unique among law schools. According to The Wall Street Journal, another university to offer early assurance to a select pool of its undergrads is the University of Michigan.
Monica Perrigino (COL ’12), who was admitted to the early assurance program but ultimately chose to attend the New York University School of Law, had a generally positive opinion of the program.
“Having only thought of law school for the first time the prior September, it was pretty surreal to know that I secured a spot in a school without even starting senior year and without having begun studying for the LSAT,” Perrigino said. “There is also a nice calming feeling as you study for the LSAT and know that, should you totally bomb it, you can still go to a great school.”
However, Perrigino said she feared that students admitted under early assurance would have difficulty gaining the respect of their peers because they had not completed the LSAT.
“I’m not sure how fellow law students would look at you if they knew about your ‘special’ admission process. I have explained it to some friends [at NYU], and they are truly baffled at the idea of attending … one of the best law schools in the country without even having touched an LSAT question,” she said. “That does not at all mean you did not earn your spot there or you got in through some sketchy backdoor entrance, but a lot of people will see it that way, and that’s something that one should prepare for.”
Perrigino also cited frustration at the Law Center’s requirement that accepted applicants make a sizeable deposit before hearing from other schools.
“If I had known what my fate would be elsewhere, it would have been nice to avoid essentially wasting so much money, but of course I wanted to know that there was still a place for me [at the Law Center], so I made the payment even though I ultimately ended up at a different school,” she said.
The Law Center begins accepting applications for the early assurance program Feb. 1 and the deadline for submissions is April 10 for the fall semester.

Hi! So I know this was a couple of years ago and I was wondering if this still applies. We have to take the LSAT even if we are at Georgetown although it does not affect their decision. Would it still affect the decision of NYU, if I wanted to go there instead? Thank you!

Two years after its founding, the GUSA Fund is rethinking its role on campus.
Given changes in sources of funding for campus groups, the fund is looking to alter its mission from providing supplementary funding for existing groups to helping kick-start new organizations and working with groups that are not recognized by the university.
The fund, which is a branch of the Georgetown University Student Association, was established in 2010 to aid student groups that were not allocated sufficient funding by their advisory boards.
Organizations can apply directly to the fund, which is allocated a portion of student activities fee revenue, to receive additional funding for events and programming.
“It is sort of a funding of last resort. Groups come to us when they have pursued all of the other options,” GUSA Fund Chair Cody Cowan (SFS ’14) said.
During the 2011-2012 school year, the fund gave out about $32,000; this year, it will allocate about $16,000.
According to Finance and Appropriation Committee Chair Sheila Walsh (COL ’14), whose committee approves the fund’s allocations each week, the GUSA Fund’s role has changed as advisory boards receive increased funding due to last year’s Students Activities Fee Endowment Reform. This, in turn, allows advisory boards to allocate more money to their student groups.
According to Walsh, the number of requests submitted to the GUSA Fund has not fallen, but the amount of money requested on average has decreased. Walsh said that this presents an opportunity to refocus the fund’s purpose.
“Post-SAFE Reform, we’ve opened up hundreds of thousands of dollars for student groups through their advisory boards, so clearly, it’s time to take a second look at GUSA Fund and determine if there’s still that need for this supplementary funding,” Walsh said.
According to Walsh, the group is not looking to alter its charter but will instead approach its job from a new perspective. GUSA Fund members, along with the Finance and Appropriations Committee, have explored options to allow the GUSA Fund to pursue a different mission. According to Walsh, options include focusing on philanthropy, building new businesses off the ground or allocating funds to groups without access to university funding.
“Our hope is that we can still help out clubs, but perhaps this year, [we can put] more of an emphasis on soliciting applications from individual students or groups that don’t receive access to benefits,” Walsh said.
Both Cowan and Walsh emphasized that the GUSA Fund can play an important role for new organizations.
“It’s really important that the fund remain as a support system for individuals who want to do something but don’t know how,” Cowan said.
Cowan pointed out that the co-founders of the Georgetown University Farmers Market were succesfulbecause they were able to supplement funding from a Reimagine Georgetown grant with support from the GUSA Fund.
“We were able to give them money. But, more importantly, [also] access to benefits that university student groups have,” Cowan said.
Another potential focus for the fund would entail helping student entrepreneurs gain recognition from the university. Currently, groups like H2Bro and Buyback Brothers are banned from campus. Partnering with an official student group with access to benefits, however, would allow them to operate at Georgetown, according to GUSA Director of SAFE Reform Implementation ColtonMalkerson (COL ’13).
“There are a lot of students with good ideas for events, programs and initiatives, but they need funding and access to benefits,” he wrote in an email. “The GUSA Fund should provide that funding and access to benefits.”
However, SAC Chair Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) pointed out that SAC still struggles to fully fulfill funding requests.
“Even after SAFE reform, the total funding requests for SAC groups still exceed our available resources,” Appelbaum wrote in an email. “Because we cannot fund the full needs of our student organizations, alternative funding sources [like the GUSA Fund] are certainly necessary to supplement SAC funding and help SAC groups put on excellent programming.”

With speakers, dancing and food, the NAS Arab Society aimed to bring the plight of Syrians affected by the nation’s civil war to Georgetown students Friday night.
The event, titled “One Night for Syria,” took place inSellinger Lounge and raised $5,000 for the Syrian Sunrise Foundation.
“Our goal was twofold,” NAS president Yomna Sarhan (SFS ’14) said. One, to raise awareness about what is happening. Two, to raise money to send.”
The event, which was co-sponsored by The Hoya, focused on providing educational information and promoting humanitarian relief.
“This event is very apolitical,” Sarhan said. “Of course individuals here might have their own political opinions, but we want to make it clear that the fundraiser is only focusing on the people who are suffering. This is about the people.”
NAS, which means “people” in Arabic, is an organization that aims to develop understanding and appreciation of Arab culture on campus.
The educational portion of the program featured three reflections from Syrian student speakers, who spoke about their personal experiences in the civil war, the struggles of protesters and the government treatment of youth involved in protests.
Two of the speakers, Ali Alsayed and Hadi Al-Shammaa, were detained by Syrian security forces as a result of their political activities. Alsayed, 17, moved to the United States with his family a year ago, and Al-Shammaa, 16, emigrated a few months ago. Alsayed now attends Hayfield Secondary School in Virginia and Al-Shammaa goes to J.E.B. Stuart High School in Virginia. Both used a translator in order to address the crowds.
“I was afraid to sleep in my own house. I was afraid they would come and take me from my bed, so I would sleep in various locations in Damascus with my friends,” Al-Shammaa said.
Al-Shammaa said his involvement with the protests began with handing out pamphlets for the revolutionary cause. He witnessed firsthand the escalation of government response toward protesters.
“We saw how it spread to other cities, and the regime started to put down the revolution in other cities. We saw that with our own eyes. And then the security forces started to use live ammunition against the protestors,” Al-Shammaa explained.
Al-Shammaa was released after three weeks. He said that his American citizenship made a difference.
“They did not release him after they found out that he was American, but they could not hurt him,” Al-Shammaa’s translator explained. “Calls were made to the Syrian government, but they denied that they had him. They said, ‘If we have him, you’ll know when he’s released.’”
Alsayed was released after two months of detainment without explanation or going through a formal judicial process.
Mohammad Abu Ghazali, a freshman at George Mason University and an active member of the Syrian American Council, said that the values of the U.S. Constitution should compel Americans to help the Syrian people.
“We can’t even imagine what it would be like to go without those freedoms, but oppression is the everyday reality in Syria,” Abu Ghazali said. “Once a government loses its legitimacy, the people have not only the right but the responsibility to abolish that entity.”
According to Khweis the event was conceptualized during the first NAS meeting of the year.
“We wanted it to be educational, but we also wanted it to be fun,” she said.
Organizers of the event, titled “One Night for Syria,” said they were pleasantly surprised by the turnout.
“We were very worried that we wouldn’t have enough food. I think we used every chair in [the Leavey Center,]” event coordinator and NAS member Juman Khweis (SFS ’13) said.
NAS will donate proceeds from the event to the Syrian Sunrise Foundation, which helps families, children and widows in the civil war.
“We heard of this organization that had boots on the ground and was really Syrian and decided it would be better to donate to them,” Khweis said.

Georgetown’s Latin American Student Association is clearly committed to dancing til the world ends.
LASA presented “Apocalypto,” its sixth annual Reventón Latino dance bash in Gaston Hall Friday night.
The event, which showcases international dance and culture, was first established in 2006 as a way to foster a Latin American presence in the Georgetown community through artistic expression. To date, the event is the only Latin American artistic showcase on campus.
“What [Reventón] is all about is to show the culture, to promote the energy that we share as Latin Americans with Georgetown and to bring the region to the Georgetown community,” LASA President Alma Caballero (SFS ’13) said. “We want to engage the Georgetown community, and we think the best way to do this is by dancing and having fun and sharing the spice and energy that we all bring.”
Reventón’s scope has become broader since its founding, transforming from an expression of Latin American pride to a celebration of worldwide culture. This year, members of Irish and Middle Eastern dance groups were invited to perform alongside the Latin American dance group.
“It was really telling that we incorporated other cultures, because Latin America is not only a region that is composed of people from one heritage. It is a combination of many,” Caballero said. “All of us are bringing our own cultures here, and as a way of bringing it here, we share our culture with others.”
This year’s theme, Apocalypto, was based on the Mayan prediction that the world will end on Dec. 21, 2012.
“The theme came about by accident,” Reventón co-chair Yasmin Serrato (SFS ’13) said. “The year 2012 and the end of the world happened to fit with Latino and ancient history,”
Caballero agreed.
“What we want to do is celebrate and dance our message as if it was the last day we had to celebrate. It’s a way of bringing history and heritage together,” she said.
Reventón Masters of Ceremonies Julian de la Paz (SFS ’15) and Sophia Stid (SFS ’14) asked the audience for suggestions about ways Latinos and the broader Georgetown community could unite to prevent the impending disaster.
The audience’s answers included dance, travel and celebration, but education — with a focus on service to the broader Georgetown and D.C. community — arose as the fundamental solution.
Reventón doubled as a fundraiser, and all ticket and after-party proceeds will be donated to Students Helping Honduras and Mentores Solidartes — organizations that fund schools in Honduras and Nicaragua, respectively. While a total has not yet been calculated, Serrato said she believes the event surpassed last year’s total of $4,000.
“We are hoping to match it,” Serrato said. “The show was more expensive this year since [student technical crew] Strike Force no longer exists, forcing us to contact outside vendors”
Sam Dulik (SFS ’13), LASA vice president of public affairs, praised the event’s accessibility.
“[Reventón] is for people who share an interest in communicating culture through the arts,” Dulik said. “I think the message is very clear: You can know nothing about Latin America — you can never havetravelled to Latin America before — but Reventón is something that everyone can enjoy.”
Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., who attended the event, said he enjoyed the wide array of performances.
“I especially appreciated the way the show highlighted the diversity within the Latin American and Latino communities,” he said. “The feeling of celebration extended to all, from those on stage to those at the back of Gaston.”

Members of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network protested in front of the Washington Monument Saturday morning during Autism Speaks’ event, Walk Now for Autism Speaks.
Both ASAN and Autism Speaks are nonprofit organizations that focus on autism advocacy; however, ASAN is run entirely by autistic individuals, while Autism Speaks does not include autistic leaders and focuses on preventative research.
“Most of what they do is … preventative care. … We don’t want to be prevented. I am not a puzzle piece,” said Lydia Brown (COL ’15), who identifies as autistic and interns for ASAN.
The protest featured five to 10 ASAN representatives holding posters with slogans such as “Autistic is awesome” and “You are perfect the way you are.” The protesters did not harass the walkers, and some Walk Now participants stopped to speak to the ASAN representatives and took pamphlets.
Brown first discovered ASAN in 2009 while researching Autism Speaks. Through her research, Brown discovered that only 4 percent of Autism Speaks’ budget actually goes back to family services, while 44 percent of the funds support research.
“Autism Speaks has no funding for alternative and augmentative communication — things that would make our lives better, like speaker-to-text and sign language services,” Brown said.
Unlike Autism Speaks, which has no autistic individuals on its board, ASAN is run entirely by autistic individuals. The organization was founded in 2005 and gained prominence through a successful campaign to remove billboards in Times Square that equated autism to stealing the life of a child,
“The only people [who] can really speak to the autistic experience are autistic people. It is important that people understand what we want and need,” ASAN Director of Community Engagement Melody Latimer said.
ASAN focuses on providing support and public policy advocacy for autistic individuals through programs such as the Empowering Autistic Leaders Project for college-aged students. ASAN also help autistic adults — for whom the unemployment rate can be up to 80 percent — find jobs and live as independently as possible.
Latimer said the protesters attempted to convey a message of optimism.
“What we’re trying to say is, ‘Look, its not all bad — we were your child at some point,’” she said. “I’ve found that a lot more people have begun listening to us, are taking our word for it.”

Building on its success in unionizing adjunct faculty members at The George Washington University and American University, officials of the Service Employees International Union Local 500 Coalition of Academic Labor have begun marshalling support for a similar union at Georgetown.
According to Kip Lornell, vice president for higher education at SEIU Local 500, the union has begun discussions with interested Georgetown faculty and hopes to develop a presence on campus in the coming months.
The union has drawn interest among adjunct faculty at Georgetown, who cite unsatisfactory wages and working conditions as compelling reasons to form a union.
Pablo Eisenberg, a senior fellow at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and adjunct member of Georgetown’s faculty for 12 years, supports the unionization effort.
“Adjunct faculty throughout this country … are basically what I’ve called … the ‘untouchables’ of our higher education caste system,” he said. “They are grossly underpaid, have no benefits, no academic rights [and] are badly treated in many cases by tenured faculty who look upon them, in some sense, as third-class teachers.”
Eisenberg said he fears that low wages for adjunct faculty, which he claims average in the thousands of dollars per course and are below minimum wage if divided by the number of hours involved in teaching, preparation and grading, may have adverse effects on the quality of teaching at Georgetown.
“If adjunct faculty are not taken care of, not treated better, not given the wherewithal that classroom teachers require, their students are going to suffer as much as they do,” he said. “There’s a link between the treatment of adjuncts and the quality of teaching in the classroom.”
According to a June 2012 report by the Coalition on the Academic Workforce, the median compensation per course for adjunct faculty nationwide was $2,700 in fall 2010. In contrast, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that the annual median salary for full professors in the same year was about $116,000, equivalent to about $20,000 per course assuming each professor taught three courses each semester.
Eisenberg added that a growing proportion of instructors at Georgetown are adjunct professors rather than full-time, tenure-track professors. The Hoya previously reported April 28 that there are about 200 adjunct faculty members at Georgetown, a figure that is almost double that of a decade ago.
Those numbers reflect a nationwide trend. According to a study by the New America Foundation, the proportion of teaching positions filled by adjunct faculty rose from 36 percent in 1985 to 48 percent in 2005.
This, in part, explains the growing movement for faculty unionization at D.C. colleges. Adjunct faculty at The George Washington University unionized in affiliation with SEIU Local 500 in 2000, and, according to Lornell, adjunct faculty at American University should have a union in place by Jan. 1 of next year.
Barbara Wien, an adjunct professor in the justice and peace studies program and supporter of theSEIU movement, said that in addition to low wages, adjunct faculty suffer from job insecurity and insufficient access to the university’s resources.
“The big thing is that … you never really know if you’re going to be teaching from semester to semester … because [adjunct] faculty can be laid off at any time,” she said. “We’re not really supported very much as professors in terms of our book orders in the bookstore, and there are occasions where I have not been paid for weeks on end because payroll got screwed up. … We kind of fall between the cracks.”
Wien added that the university does little to facilitate collaboration between adjunct faculty, a reality that she hopes would be overturned by the formation of a union.
“I’ve never really met my counterparts because we’re so scattered,” she said. “I’ve met five other adjuncts, and they’re all positive about unionization.”
The university sent an email to faculty Sept. 28 signed by Provost Robert Groves, Executive Dean of the School of Medicine Howard Federoff and Dean of Georgetown University Law Center WilliamTreanor acknowledging that SEIU Local 500 has begun to corral adjunct faculty to unionize and encouraged those faculty members to explore their options.
“Our university respects employees’ rights to freely associate and organize, which includes voting for or against union representation without intimidation, unjust pressure, undue delay or hindrance in accordance with applicable law,” the email read. “Georgetown encourages adjunct faculty members to gather information about SEIU Local 500 and the process by which a union can become the exclusive bargaining representative for a group of employees under federal labor law.”
Both Eisenberg and Wien acknowledged the university’s strong track record in negotiating with the newly formed union of Aramark workers within the last year as a promising sign of its willingness to cooperate with a union of adjunct faculty.
“We do have a precedent at Georgetown in terms of cafeteria workers … so hopefully the administration will be open to this union as well,” Wien said.
According to Lornell, this attitude marks a significant shift from the resistance adjunct faculty at GWUfaced in 2000 from their administration. Lornell said that the university tied up the union in various appeals processes for 18 months before agreeing to enter negotiations.
“[GWU] was carried into this kicking and screaming, [but] I think they rather like it now in some ways because it gives them a sense of control,” he said. “The union has standardized things. … Unionization is not the devil that has come out from behind the tree.”
Lornell said that the GWU union has guaranteed its members greater job security because its contract with the university forces the administration to guarantee the renewal of contracts except in specific circumstances, including curriculum changes and national disasters.
Despite the potential benefits of forming a union, however, not all adjunct faculty members are behind the movement. Though Sarah Stiles, a visiting assistant professor in the sociology department, agreed that adjunct faculty face inferior working conditions, she is not interested in joining a union.
“My feeling is that I hate that it has come to this. The only reason that people unionize is because they’ve been pushed to the point that they can’t take it any longer. I think it’s an embarrassment that higher education would do this to our own,” she said. “I personally don’t want to be part of a union, but I know it is necessary for many people.”
Eisenberg recognized that convincing enough adjunct faculty to sign the authorization cards necessary to form a union will be a challenge moving forward.
“I think that because so many adjuncts at Georgetown are basically well-off people who are professionals … that love teaching and want to get a little more experience, they’re sort of among the elite and they don’t care about the money as do adjuncts as a whole. So it’s tougher at Georgetown to unionize than at other comparable universities,” he said. “But it’s not just how you’re faring. It’s about how the mass of adjuncts are faring, and I urge people to think about that and not their own little private concern.”
According to federal labor law, at least 30 percent of employees must sign a petition to the National Labor Relations Board declaring their interest before a union can be formed. Though Lornell and Eisenberg could not give exact figures as to the number of adjunct faculty now enlisted, they stressed that the movement at Georgetown is only in its beginning phases.
Lornell and Eisenberg both said that unionizing under SEIU Local 500 is ideal because it has the potential to change the standard for hiring adjunct faculty District wide. He hopes the formation of a union at Georgetown will also inspire similar movements at Catholic University of America, Howard University and the University of the District of Columbia.
“The basic tenet is that there is strength in numbers,” Lornell said. “Once we have close to half the folks who are adjuncts in the Washington area in a union — and once we have a contract at Georgetown we will have a clear majority of people — the bottom line will be that if you want to hire part-time faculty in D.C., you have to meet our requirements.”

Students may complain about the inconvenience of the university’s hills and stairs, but for Whitney Weldon (COL ’15), getting around campus is a daily challenge.
Weldon navigates campus in a motorized wheelchair, which she says prevents her from reaching some dorms and facilities.
“I feel like it’s not really fair that people like me can’t visit their friends or just hang out with their friends in Henle or Village B,” Weldon added. “It’s not like you can control or choose to not be disabled, and the school should make a better effort to accommodate us.”
For Weldon and a number of other students with physical disabilities, the Georgetown campus can be difficult to traverse, even with the addition of elevators and ramps. Henle Village and Alumni Square do not have elevators, and in older buildings such as the Edmund A. Walsh Building and Lauinger Library, many accessibility features are in need of an update.
“I feel that some of the older elevators on campus are particularly difficult or scary to use,” Cody Williams (SFS ’15), who has cerebral palsy and uses crutches, said. “For instance, I’m slower in getting into the elevator because of my condition, but the elevators in the Walsh Building and Lau, they don’t have sensors. I’ve had situations where I’ve had to have people hold the door open with their own strength just so I can get in the door.”
Weldon agreed, pointing to the Leavey Center elevator. She said that the elevator platform often does not align with the floor, making it impossible for her to use it.
“I need to go back down and through the parking center to take the elevator to right outside Starbucks,” Weldon said. “It’s really a hassle sometimes.”
Evan Monod (COL ’14), who also has cerebral palsy, joked about the lack of working elevators on campus.
“Some people, when they graduate and are successful, donate scholarships to the university,” he said. “I’m going to donate elevators.”
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, Georgetown makes a concerted effort to accommodate disabled students and improve disability access around campus, and Weldon acknowledged that the university has made some strides since her freshman year.
Chief among these is the implementation of public door access clickers. Every student who needs one can receive a handheld clicker device that opens doors on campus through a radio signal. Formerly, these clickers only opened the doors to a student’s residence hall and dorm room. This year, they were upgraded to open doors to main campus buildings, such as Lauinger Library and Leavey Center.
Weldon said she had a hard time getting into buildings her freshman year because she can’t reach buttons for the automatic doors.
“It’s better now with the clickers that we have to be able to open almost all of the doors on campus in addition to my hall and my dorm room,” she said.
But this project was spearheaded by Weldon’s father, who had to pay for all students to receive the clickers in order to get the university to make the public doors clicker accessible.
“I’m not sure how much it was in total, but it was very expensive,” Weldon said. “I’m just very lucky that my father was able to foot the bill.”
For Williams, the advancements in newer buildings such as Regents Hall have shown a movement toward a more disability-conscious campus.
“On the more modern and newer buildings, the university has done a good job,” Williams said. “These recent innovations let me know that they’re working on accommodating our situation and innovating the way we conceptualize the campus and that the university really puts us as a priority.”
However, problems still remain. Both Williams and Weldon said that ramps and walkways intended for those with wheelchairs or trouble with stairs are sometimes blocked by other traffic, preventing those who actually need the route from using it.
“Sometimes, people misuse things that are supposed to make accessibility easier,” Williams said. “In particular, bicyclists make it hard for me to use the ramp out of Red Square to Leavey.”
According to Williams, the Academic Resource Center has helped him navigate campus.
“When I first got to campus, I got an accessibility map that the university had drawn up for disabled people,” Williams said. “It showed me what elevators to take, which buildings connected to which ones, where the ramps were and where to avoid. It’s really just about using your resources and developing an intuition about the problem spots.”
Monod agreed that the ARC is a valuable resource but lamented a lack of greater university support. For some students, trial and error is the most effective way of figuring out how to get around campus.
“It’s sad that at a school like this, we only have three or four people working in the disability office,” Monod said.
Weldon stressed, however, that disabled student life on campus is what students make of it.
“It’s about having the confidence to ask for help when you need it,” she said. “I let myself do whatever I really want. If it involves asking someone to help, such as asking someone to help carry me up a flight of stairs, I ask.”

As campaigns draw to a close and millions of voters head to the polls today, many Georgetown students have a reason to be particularly invested in the results.
During a time when most students are focused on midterms, Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14) has dedicated 10-15 hours per week volunteering for Barack Obama, on top of a campaign internship and weekends spent canvassing.
“It’s kind of a do-or-die situation, and I know if I don’t do my all, I’m going to wake up on Election Day and feel regret if he doesn’t win,” she said.
Jonathan Espinoza (COL ’16) , a member of the College Republicans who spent an average of 64 hours a week recently campaigning for Mitt Romney, agreed with the sentiment.
“I feel very strongly about a lot of Romney’s ideas, and I think we need someone who knows what he’s doing in the White House,” Espinoza said.
Espinoza and Peterson are two of many students on campus who have dedicated time, effort and money this election season to helping the candidate of their choice take the White House.
According to Georgetown University College Democrats President Joe Vandegriff (COL ’14), students who limit their involvement in politics to voting are missing an opportunity to have a greater impact on the country.
“If you are a strong Democrat or a strong Republican, you clearly have a view on the way politics should be run in this country,” he said. “If you don’t volunteer, then you don’t have the right to complain, as you had a chance to impact those viewpoints and you chose not to.”
Students have traveled as far as Boston, Mass., to canvass, dedicating significant amounts of time to campaign for their candidate. But those involved say the experience is worth the time and effort they put in.
“I’ve learned an enormous amount from this campaign: what it means to be working on a campaign, what it means to have a campaign and, really, the amount of personal effort that goes into these campaigns,” College Democrats Speakers Co-Director Audrey Denis (SFS ’15) said. “It just shows me how much of a campaign relies on real people, individuals, the grassroots — real people spending their own time. It made me realize that every vote in these battleground states is a hard fought, hard won vote.”
Some have even experienced unique opportunities to impact the campaigns. College Republicans member Tim Rosenberger’s (COL ’16) voice was briefly used as the recording for the Romney campaign’s automated calls in Pennsylvania.
“At one point, the voice recording for calls in Pennsylvania was somehow erased, and I got to record the new one,” Rosenberger said. “So for a little while, at least, I was the robo-voice for Romney in Pennsylvania.”
College Republicans and College Democrats have both encouraged their members to participate in various events such as phone banking, canvassing and voter registration.
According to College Republicans Chair Maggie Cleary (COL ’14), a member of the group leads a trip to a phone bank once a week, and members participate in canvassing every weekend, especially in the swing state of Virginia.
College Democrats Events Leader Jayme Amann (SFS ’15) added that members of College Democrats have attended canvassing trips every weekend since September.
“We’ve been on the ground in all the key swing states around the D.C. area,” she said. “And in this last push before Election Day, we’re leading four trips over the weekend to try to do as much as possible.”
Vandegriff said the impact of the election results could be greater for students than they realize.
“Policies about the economy, education, climate change, Medicare, Medicaid, retirement, etc. We’re the people who will feel the effects of these problems, so we have the most at stake.”
Espinoza agreed.
“There are policies that the older generation, people who are no longer going to be with us in a couple years, are putting in place, and they’re hurting us [students],” he said. “Those are policies that worked during their generation, [but] those policies will not necessarily work for our generation.”
But balancing campaign work with academics can be a challenge for some, and Denis said numbers at College Democrats’ campaign events have dropped since midterm season began in full swing — a situation she found frustrating.
“Honestly, I have been a little disappointed with the superficial relationship Georgetown students have with political activism,” she said. “A lot of people are willing to put a T-shirt or a sticker on, but it’s a big battle to get some of them to pick up a phone or to knock on a door — but that is the way voters are won.”
But Amann said that College Democrats tries to help students strike that balance.
“We try to give our members as many options as possible,” Amann said. “We’ve noticed that our numbers have been dropping as compared to other schools, and we really want to get more of our members out to these events.”
Amann also stressed the importance of voting above all else.
“You have to be knowledgeable about who you are voting for … but I always tell people: ‘I don’t care who you vote for, I just care that you vote.’”

Updated plans for Georgetown’s Intercollegiate Athletic Center will move forward after being approved by the Old Georgetown Board Oct. 4 and the Commission of Fine Arts Oct. 18.
The approvals came after the university adopted the April recommendations of both boards.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, the plans have since undergone significant changes. The new facility’s athletic courts will be stacked to form a taller building, maintaining McDonough Arena’s southern facade.
In addition, a tower on the east side of the new building will mark the main entry and link Harbin Field, the IAC and McDonough.
OGB agreed to approve the most recent design submission Oct. 26, but recommended that the designers specify their stylistic intent.
This approval is just one of several steps remaining before the facility can be built. Kerr said that the university plans to continue working with the designs, which are only in the schematic phase, and must still have the final drawings approved.
“The details will be worked out as the project continues its natural course through design,” she wrote.
Kerr added that the next required clearance would be for the full building, but the university expects to return to the boards prior to seeking approval for the final design. The timeline for future such meetings is uncertain.
According to Kerr, the project will be funded entirely by donations, so work on the facility moves forward as funds trickle in. While the university has already raised $12 million, the total cost of the project is estimated at $60 million.
“Construction [will] not begin until we have the fundraising commitments secured,” Kerr wrote in an email.

As Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14) and Craig Cassey (COL ’15) prepare to become the likely student representatives on Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, it is apparent that they will confront many of the same challenges faced by decades of student commissioners before them.
Justin Kopa (COL ’03) served as commissioner from 2001 to 2003 alongside Justin Wagner (COL ’03), marking the last term during which there were two student representatives on the commission. This year, after a recent redistricting of ANC 2E’s jurisdiction, two single-member districts are allotted to areas almost entirely occupied by students.
Both seats are likely to be occupied by students, as Cassey and Prindiville are each running uncontested.
According to Kopa, the biggest challenge he and Wagner faced as new commissioners was trying to establish themselves on the committee.
“We had to work hard to gain credibility,” he said. “It took a lot of time and work to do that.”
Several past commissioners said that the most substantial ongoing challenge during their terms involved forging productive and friendly relationships with fellow commissioners while remaining focused on representing students.
Brett Clements (COL ’07), who served as an ANC commissioner from 2005 until 2007, highlighted this dilemma.
“It’s easy to get swept up in the relationships with the other commissioners, but it’s important not to forget that your goal is [to make] the university better,” he said.
For Michael Glick (COL ’05), who served on the ANC from 2003 until 2005, it was his obligations to students that dominated his agenda.
“I think that there is a tendency to make it students versus the community — and there was certainly some of that — but by and large [for] most of the issues we tackled, we were one big community working together,” Glick said. “But one of the bigger challenges was prioritizing and compromising and trying to work with my fellow commissioners to make sure the student voice and perspective [were] heard.”
Outgoing student commissioner Jake Sticka (COL ’13) said that building strong relationships with fellow commissioners was particularly challenging during his term because he served amid the often-toxic negotiations related to the 2010 Campus Plan and area redistricting.
“The personal relationships I was able to build [differ] from commissioner to commissioner, and some of them will tell you that given the constraints of the Campus Plan period, that was difficult,” Stickasaid. “But I feel as though they respect me and I respect them. Our interactions have always been professional and some of them … have been very helpful as mentors [whom] I think I will be able to speak to for years to come.”
Sticka added that his successors are set to join the commission amid a new era of cooperation — facilitated by the newly established Georgetown Community Partnership — and should therefore have a less difficult time forging relationships with fellow commissioners.
Apart from this overarching challenge, past commissioners dealt with issues unique to their terms.
Kopa recalled a fight over a district-wide moratorium on issuing new liquor licenses that took place during his time on the ANC.
“To get [a license], you had to buy one from someone who already had one,” Kopa said.
“In Georgetown, we leveraged that to limit local bars and the types of drink specials aimed at college students and young people.”
Clements used his position on the commission to lobby the university about its proposal to ban kegs from campus.
“I was able to get the other commissioners to support my opposition to the keg ban. Neighbors realized that banning kegs in on-campus housing would push parties off campus,” he said.
And when Daniel Rigby (MSB ’05) perished in a townhouse fire in 2004, Clements joined with the other commissioners in calling for more housing inspections.
“Basically, a lot of the off-campus housing was not up to code and was not properly inspected to rent to a large number of people. We tried to make a big effort to get those inspections done at all of the houses,” Clements said.
Sticka added that while he made the most of his status as the lone student commissioner during his term, he is enthusiastic about the possibilities available to Prindiville and Cassey.
“Throughout my term, I did my best to voice student opinion in a respectful manner. On the commission where there’s one student and six non-students, my ability to … win votes by myself was limited,” he said. “In terms of redistricting, we ultimately got a compromise plan where there’s going to be two students elected just about every year … and that’s certainly a better one than we’ve had in the past 10 years.”
