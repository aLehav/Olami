The stone facades of campus buildings were illuminated by shining blue lights as the most recent university fundraising campaign made a bold effort to be seen and heard. By all accounts, it has made its presence known.
According to Chief Operating Officer for Advancement Paul O’Neill (CAS ’86, GRD ’96), the Campaign for Georgetown: For Generations to Come has raised $848 million of its $1.5 billion goal and remains on track for completion in 2016.
“Since the successful public launch of the campaign during the last weekend in October, we continue to meet and exceed our monthly and quarterly fundraising goals and anticipate a strong first year of the campaign,” Vice President for Advancement R. Bartley Moore (SFS ’87) said.
The public launch in the fall was preceded by a beginning phase of quiet fundraising. From July 2006 to October 2011, the university brought in $778 million in the largest five-year fundraising effort in Georgetown history.
To shore up alumni support for the latter half of the campaign, the Office of Advancement has also planned a series of regional launches in major cities around the world on a smaller scale than the on-campus event in October. The first was held yesterday in Chicago to coincide with the annual John Carroll Weekend.
According to O’Neill, the funds raised from the campaign will be allocated to support the four pillars of giving upon which the initiative stands.
The first pillar, student access and excellence, has been allocated $500 million. Undergraduate programming and scholarships will receive $400 million, while graduate programming will be given theremining $100 million.
Financial aid is a priority within this allotment, according to O’Neill. The capital campaign has raised $188 million for scholarships so far and will fund about 1,000 undergraduate scholarships this year, up from 800 a year ago. Ultimately, Georgetown hopes to support 1,789 scholarships with money raised through philanthropy.
“Alumni relate very personally to the impact that scholarships have in making Georgetown accessible to the very best students, regardless of finances,” O’Neill said.
The second pillar, faculty access and excellence, will receive $500 million, $400 million of which has already been raised. Half of the money will be used to maintain existing faculty positions, create new positions and secure salary and research funding. The remaining $250 million will contribute to faculty research.
The third pillar consists of $200 million for student life and capital expansion. The proposed Intercollegiate Athletic Center and New South Student Center — as well as projects already funded and planned, such as the Calcagnini Contemplative Center in Virginia and the restoration of DahlgrenChapel — are included in this category. According to Moore, the university is planning a large-scale public push for the athletic center fundraising effort to coincide with the beginning of the 2012-2013 basketball season.
The university has raised $140 million of its $300 million goal for the fourth and final pillar, designated for “transformative opportunities,” which will develop a variety of programs that will define Georgetown in the future, spanning from the Georgetown Public Policy Institute to initiatives that promote inter-religious understanding.
To achieve long-term success in fundraising efforts, the university aims to increase the number of alumni who give back to Georgetown. According to Moore, about 27 percent of undergraduate alumni currently donate money to the university.
This number is on track to increase. According to Moore, Georgetown had more donors last year than during any year in its history and expects to break the record again this year.
If the university could up the level of alumni donations to 35 percent, it would be ranked 12th in the nation for alumni support and bolster its comparatively low endowment, which ranks 63rd in the National Association of College and University Business Officers-Commonfund Study’s rankings, and last among the top 25 American universities, according to U.S. News and World Report.
The campaign has also reeled in a number of large-scale donations from members of Georgetown’s Board of Directors. Chairman Paul Tagliabue (CAS ’62) and his wife, Chandler, allocated one-fifth of a $5 million campaign donation to expand the LGBTQ Resource Center, while campaign Chair William J. Doyle (CAS ’72) gave $10 million to permanently endow the Doyle Initiative, which he created in 2009 to increase tolerance and diversity on campus.
Additionally, the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs secured $5 million from its original backer, William R. Berkley, another member of the university’s Board of Directors.
In addition to soliciting donations from alumni, the Office of Advancement hopes to involve current students in every stage of the fundraising process.
“We do not want what we do in advancement to be invisible,” Moore told The Hoya at the campaign launch in October.

Contract negotiations between the Georgetown University Dining Services employees’ union and its employer, Aramark Higher Education, had been left hanging for over a month when workers decided to demonstrate in O’Donovan Hall on Jan. 28.
After the rally, conversations immediately resumed and a tentative three-year contract agreement was reached Feb. 7.
The contract, which was ratified in early March and signed in mid-April, secured a 50-cent-per-hour wage increase for each of the next three years and includes coverage of 80 percent of employees’ health care costs for the next two years and 85 percent during the third year of the contract.
This year’s raise retroactively covers all hours worked since Feb. 1, and a $200 signing bonus per employee went into effect April 19, according to Leo’s employee Dante Crestwell, who was involved in the discussions.
These gains mark significant progress after 10 months of official negotiations between university employees and Aramark. But the road to the formation of a union and a better contract began with an underground movement two years earlier.
Organization of the union and identification of goals — higher wages, provision of health insurance, better shift scheduling and increased opportunities for advancement — originally grew out of discussions between students and university employees.
“Students organized me, not UNITE HERE,” Tarshea Smith, who helped organize the union and has worked at Leo’s for 18 years, said. UNITE HERE, the umbrella organization that houses the union, represents members of the food, airport, hotel and other industries. “I already had a relationship with [the students].”
Advocacy for a union also developed out of a widespread desire among workers for a greater voice.
“Before, our relationship with [Aramark] wasn’t good at all. Our managers and supervisors didn’t respect us,” Smith said.
Although they were not part of the actual contract negotiations, about 60 student leaders from groups across campus collaborated to provide support for the workers.
“The idea behind this committee is that it would be as broad-reaching across the student body and as diverse as possible,” Samuel Geaney-Moore (SFS ’12), a member of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee and an integral member of the student coalition, said.
For Geaney-Moore, working with the union was a formative experience.
“It’s the most meaningful thing I’ve ever worked on in my life,” he said. “It did what we were hoping to do. … Workers are understood and treated [as] a part of the Georgetown community.”
The union now plans to focus on securing better pensions and retirement plans as well as further educating university employees about their rights.
But to Smith, the most important result of unionization for workers — and what they need to be aware of — is their increased job security.
“It’s different now. Because we have a union, you don’t have to be afraid and think you’re going to lose your job,” she said. “Now we have a voice.”

During a year characterized by a seven-candidate presidential election with record-breaking turnout and a delayed start to Georgetown Day planning, student interest has surged in the Georgetown University Student Association.
In February, then-GUSA senators Clara Gustafson (SFS’13) and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) won the executive election with over 57 percent of the vote in the sixth round of instant runoff voting. The election saw the highest turnout for any GUSA vote to date with over 3,000 ballots cast, and for the first time in GUSA history, more than 50 percent of the student body participated in a single election or referendum.
But the race itself proved just as dramatic as the record-breaking election.
Sophomore point guard Markel Starks (COL ’14) ran for vice president on a ticket with GUSA senator Daniel LaMagna (COL ’13), marking the second consecutive executive race in which a basketball player has vied for the vice presidency. The pair received the fewest votes of the seven tickets, however.
Further controversy arose when a large American flag made of campaign posters for former GUSAsenator Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) and former Director of Executive Outreach Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) was spray-painted with the words “U.S. WANTED FOR MURDER!” the weekend before the election.
Despite the tension of the seven-way race, Gustafson said she was proud of the way the election captured the attention of students.
“All the different candidates were out there talking to people and engaging with each other,” she said. “It was a hub of energy about student activity at Georgetown.”
After their March 17 inauguration, Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount began to form their executive cabinet, which includes three new positions: secretaries of social justice, campus ministry and academic affairs.
The executive pair also appointed Student Activities Commission Chair Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) to be director of Student Life Report implementation to ensure that the recommendations listed in the 60-page report, released by the previous GUSA executive administration in late February, are gradually put into action.
The report, which investigated the five student organization funding boards and academic life at Georgetown, is the first broad set of recommendations for improving student life since 1999.
Among the suggestions in this year’s report, Appelbaum has prioritized centralizing the student room booking process and increasing student space.
Many of the report’s recommendations, including the hiring of a professional director of club sports and adding satellite offices for the Center for Social Justice, will require significant cooperation from the university and student group leaders.
Report Committee Chair Shuo Yan Tan (SFS ’12) suggested, however, that the document is intended to prompt constructive conversations rather than provide a specific course of action.
“The recommendations are specific … but this is just a small inkling of the possibilities,” Yan Tan said at the time of the report’s official release. “Ultimately, there’s so much more that can be done.”
Discussion was certainly sparked in March when it became apparent that little planning had been done for this year’s Georgetown Day. According to Gustafson, the lack of planning was brought to her attention at her first meeting with administrators.
While in previous years GUSA had never been involved in the organization of the celebration, it quickly formed an ad hoc Georgetown Day planning committee, spearheaded by Maeve Brody (COL ’14). Though there will be no beer garden or inflatables this year, the committee has worked to ensure that the live performances, free food and lawn games that have come to define the day’s events will still be present. This year, there will also be barricades around the events on Copley Lawn and additional hired security to secure the area.
“I think the administration and students both realize that it is a very important celebratory day for our community and our student body,” Gustafson said.

For more than a decade, the Georgetown football team was a laughingstock on campus. Having notched 11 consecutive losing seasons, the squad attracted neither buzz nor crowds. That changed last fall.
When the Hoyas took to the gridiron to begin the season, no one expected a turnaround from a winless 2009 campaign and a 4-7 2010 team. But there was some cause for hope, which would be justified as the season went on.
“We have an excellent recruiting class, and some of the newcomers are supplementing our existing guys very, very well,” Head Coach Kevin Kelly said going into this season. “I feel good about really all positions, quite frankly.”
After a week of indecision, junior quarterback Isaiah Kempf got the start in the first game, and Georgetown came out firing on all cylinders in a rare twilight matchup against Davidson, romping to a 40-16 win.
But it wasn’t just Kempf; the Blue and Gray’s defense — led by senior defensive end Andrew Schaetzke and senior defensive back Jayah Kaisamba — was key in the win against Davidson and throughout the remainder of the season.
In the following game, Georgetown held Lafayette to just one touchdown in its first Patriot League win of the year.
Next, a trip to Yale loomed for Georgetown, and the overmatched Hoyas struggled to a 37-27 loss. Even worse, Kempf was injured during the third quarter and senior quarterback Scott Darby was thrust into the game in his place.
The Yale contest was the first of a four-game road swing for the Hoyas, who next traveled to Marist. Darby was under center again against the Red Foxes and helped the offense explode to a 52-28 win. But the fact that the defense — especially the pass defense — gave up 28 points was a serious worry.
“[We are] looking closer at how we are teaching and practicing the coverages,” Kelly said after the game. “We will be better.”
But they weren’t — at least not right away. The next weekend was worse, as Bucknell flustered Kempf, who had returned as quarterback, and lit up the reeling Georgetown defense. The 35-18 loss left the Hoyas 1-1 in conference play.
Adjustments in the ensuing weeks improved the team’s defense, especially the secondary. This was clear in both a 24-10 victory at Wagner and a 21-3 demolition of Howard across town in two back-to-back weekends.
“These last couple weeks, we’ve been able to make plays on balls. It’s helped us out. It’s helped out our run game,” Kaisamba said after the win over Howard. “And we’ve been able to shut down some other teams.”
With the secondary — and the defense as a whole — looking up, Georgetown demolished Colgate, 40-17, in a Homecoming rout that also secured a very meaningful winning season for the Hoyas.
“It’s huge. We haven’t had [a winning season] here since 1999,” Kelly said after the victory. “There are a lot of guys who were here two years ago when it was at its lowest point, and they stuck through it. I’m proud of those guys. They are the character guys.”
Now 2-1 in the Patriot League and hunting for the title, the Blue and Gray kept rolling the next Saturday, this time in the middle of a western Massachusetts snowstorm.
With visibility so poor that Holy Cross’ radio broadcasters couldn’t see the placement of the football from the press box, Schaetzke had six tackles and two sacks, and Kempf keyed two touchdown drives in the second half. That was enough for the 19-6 win.
With Fordham ineligible for league play, Georgetown’s game against the Rams was rather meaningless, but the Hoyas still notched a 30-13 win, giving them momentum heading into the season finale with Lehigh, where the Patriot League championship was on the line.
Though a large contingent of fans followed their team on the road, the Mountain Hawks were too much for the Hoyas, who ended their 2011 season with a 34-12 loss.
Even in defeat, Kelly and his team were celebrating Georgetown’s campaign. After the season, once Schaetzke had been honored as an FCS All-American and Kelly had flirted with, then withdrew from consideration for, the top job at Yale, the coach’s words after the last game rang true.
“No one will ever forget this football team,” Kelly said. “[The seniors] might not realize it today, but someday they will understand it — we have to celebrate this season. This is a special group.”

In its finest moments, the Georgetown women’s basketball team’s 2011-2012 season was as sweet as Sugar Rodgers’ long-range jump shot. At its low points, however, offensive struggles and inconsistent performances were enough to dampen the Hoyas’ sense of overall success.
The veteran squad, led by junior guard Rodgers and a cast of seven seniors — including forward Tia Magee, point guard Rubylee Wright and forward Adria Crawford — finished with a record of 23-9 overall and 11-5 in the Big East. The Blue and Gray cemented their position as an elite program in the world of women’s hoops with a third consecutive at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, a program-best fourth-place finish in the Big East and a national ranking for the duration of the season.
“For our seven seniors to have won 20-plus games for the four years that they have been here has truly been amazing,” Head Coach Terri Williams-Flournoy said after the season ended. “I’m very sad to see these seven seniors go, but one thing’s for sure: They know that what they’ve done for this program, and that will never be touched by any other group that comes in here, because they put Georgetown on the map.”
But reminiscent of Georgetown’s roller-coaster season, the program’s future — so bright at the end of the year — may have taken a hit, as Williams-Flournoy recently announced her intention to leave for Auburn next year. The departure of the eighth-year coach, coupled with early exits from both the Big East and NCAA tournaments this season, made for an uncomfortable conclusion to another winning campaign.
The season began in auspicious fashion, as the then-No.10-ranked team dropped two of its first three games, mustering just 53 and 40 points in road losses at Maryland and Louisiana State, respectively.
“Obviously we didn’t want it to go this way, but we have a lot of growing and a lot of maturing to do,” Magee said at the time. “I want my teammates to know that we’ll learn from this and get better.”
The Hoyas responded promptly with an 11-game winning streak that stretched from Nov. 19 until a loss on Jan. 3 and included a 71-46 home thrashing of then-No. 7 Miami. Its trademark press wreaked havoc among opponents, and its up-tempo transition offense resulted in quick buckets, allowing Georgetown to enter the heart of its conference schedule with guns blazing. Rodgers, the regular-season Big East scoring leader with 18.8 points per game, recorded 39 points in a Dec. 30 rout of Dartmouth.
“We’ve seen Sugar do this before — we’ve seen her shoot the lights out,” Williams-Flournoy said that day. “But what people don’t realize is that Sugar does so much more. She rebounds, she gets steals, she plays defense [and] she just played an all-around game.”
The rigorous conference schedule, however, was a wake-up call for the hopeful Hoyas. The Blue and Gray dropped their home opener to DePaul, and abysmal accuracy on field goals doomed Georgetown in subsequent home defeats to Notre Dame and Louisville.
“This was one of those games that we’ll go back and look at and kick ourselves,” Williams-Flournoy said after the loss to the Cardinals. “Our shooting was what hurt us tonight: We turned them over 25 times and had 18 offensive rebounds, but we can’t shoot 33 percent and expect to win.”
Georgetown responded to the Louisville loss by concluding the regular season with seven wins in nine tries, sewing up a double-bye in the Big East tournament for the first time in program history.
However, a 39-32 quarterfinal defeat to West Virginia in the league tournament was followed by a second-round loss at the hands of Georgia Tech in the NCAA tournament. The fifth-seeded Hoyas fell, 76-64, to the fourth-seeded Yellow Jackets, crushing their dreams of a storybook ending for the senior class.
After the season, Rodgers was named to the Big East’s first team and was recognized as an honorable mention AP All-American. Magee received an all-Big East honorable mention.
In the final assessment, despite the uncertainties going forward and the unfortunate ending against Georgia Tech, it is clear that this group of seniors and their coach will be remembered for years to come. Their work and success firmly placed Georgetown as a powerhouse in women’s basketball for the first time in the program’s history.

Although Georgetown’s season ended in an all-too-familiar fashion — at the hands of a double-digit seed in the NCAA tournament — the feeling was undeniably different from past years.
Picked to finish 10th in the conference by Big East coaches in the preseason poll, the young Hoyas went 24-9, finishing fifth in conference thanks to a 12-6 record in Big East play. The reward for their stellar regular season was a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament’s Midwest Region and a matchup with Belmont, which the Blue and Gray won handily. The win broke an embarrassing three-game tournament losing streak for the program and was arguably the crowning achievement of a season that saw the Hoyas exceed the expectations of all but the most optimistic Georgetown fans.
And precisely because of the team’s relatively surprising success, the Hoyas’ heartbreaking 66-63 loss to NC State in the next round of the tournament was less disappointing than the upsets of years past. In the moment, as time expired and senior guard Jason Clark’s off-balance attempt at a game-tying three sailed past the rim, the result was upsetting. After all, the loss marked the fourth time in Georgetown’s last four tournament appearances that Head Coach John Thompson III’s team had been sent packing by a double-digit seed. But, in the big picture, the Hoyas had a season that can only be judged an unqualified success.
The Blue and Gray crushed their preseason expectations for the first time in five years, and got the tournament win that Clark and fellow senior Henry Sims so richly deserved. Beating the No. 14 seed Bruins before falling in the next round might not be a noteworthy accomplishment for most teams, but this year’s Hoyas were no ordinary No. 3 seed.
The burden of repeated postseason failures weighed heavily on the team, and this year’s iteration of the Blue and Gray wasn’t expected to even earn a chance to get rid of that baggage. So when the Hoyas finally won, the sense of relief was palpable.
“I think [there] was definitely a sense of urgency, not just for me but [for] the whole team,” Clark said after defeating Belmont. “We’ve known what we’ve done in the past. So it was a big thing for us to get this win today.”
“[We] finally got the monkey off our back,” said sophomore guard Markel Starks.
The groundwork for the success of the season was laid in China, as the team and the media noted throughout the year. The ugly preseason brawl with the Bayi Rockets may have gotten the Hoyas into the headlines for all the wrong reasons, but it bred a toughness and togetherness that no amount of practicing could have.
The regular season started normally enough, as Georgetown crushed Savannah State and UNC-Greensboro by a combined 70 points. A four-point loss to then-No. 14 Kansas in the first round of the Maui Invitational was the first indication that these Hoyas might be a little better than initially thought. When they beat then-No. 8 Memphis in the fifth-place game two days later, that suspicion was confirmed. Sims’ 24-point, eight-rebound, five-assist performance against the Tigers was an early sign of things to come for the Hoyas. The senior center enjoyed a breakout season after three largely ineffective years on the Hilltop.
Sims and the rest of the Hoyas kept rolling when they returned to the continental 48, ripping off nine straight wins after returning from Maui. By the time the winning streak ended on Jan. 7 against West Virginia, the Blue and Gray were no longer sneaking up on anyone. Ranked No. 9 in the country, thanks to impressive wins over top-25 foes Alabama, Louisville, Marquette — ranked No. 12, 4 and 20 respectively at the time of their losses to the Blue and Gray — plus a second defeat of Memphis, Georgetown had arrived on the national scene.
Unsurprisingly, the strength and depth of the Big East took its toll on the Hoyas, as they won ‘just’ nine of their last 15 regular-season games after taking 13 of their first 14. Arguably the worst moment of the season came during this stretch, when Seton Hall blew out Georgetown by 18 points in February. Worse still, Starks and Thompson III were reportedly involved in a heated argument as the team walked off the court. Starks was benched for the entirety of the next game — a 21-point thrashing of Villanova — and came off the bench for the rest of the year.
Starks’ replacement in the starting lineup in some ways epitomized the Hoyas’ year. Freshman forward Otto Porter came out of seemingly nowhere to lead the team in rebounds (6.7 per game) and contributed nearly 10 points per contest, providing an unexpected source of offense for Thompson III’s team. Porter’s considerable defensive impact was at least matched by freshman forward Greg Whittington, whose offensive capabilities became obvious only at the end of the year but who served as a defensive stopper for the Hoyas from day one. Those two, along with fellow freshmen Jabril Trawick and Mikael Hopkins, displayed maturity well beyond their years throughout the season and were vital to the team’s overachievement.
As for next year, they’ll be looked at to contribute even more, as the team’s three leading scorers are departing the Hilltop. Junior forward Hollis Thompson has declared for the NBA draft, while seniors Sims and Clark are set to graduate. Their leadership and scoring will be sorely missed next year, but, if nothing else, the returning Hoyas will have ample experience in defying expectations. If they duplicate the formula that brought them success this year — a swarming, stifling defense coupled with timely, efficient scoring — this space next year could very well be recapping a season that includes more than just one NCAA tournament win.

Following a year of rocky relations between the university and its neighbors, recent developments in the debates surrounding the 2010 Campus Plan suggest that a final compromise may be on the horizon.
After six inconclusive D.C. Zoning Commission hearings since the campus plan was filed in December 2010, many of the proposal’s details remain contested, while the neighborhood position has been emboldened by endorsements from Mayor Vincent Gray in October and Councilmember At-Large Phil Mendelson in September. The opposing parties have resorted to private negotiations to arrive at a compromise.
“My hope is that everybody can sit down at a table and work something out that’s agreeable to everybody,” Chris Clements, president of the Burleith Citizens Association, said. “As we come back to the negotiation table … maybe we can find that common ground.”
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E commissioner Tom Birch agreed that the shift to private negotiations represents a step in the right direction.
“I think it’s been a difficult process, and I have to say I’m pleased that there is this revisiting of the plan that’s happening now,” Birch said.
The issue of off-campus student housing is chief among the disputes that have yet to be resolved. The BCA, the Citizens Association of Georgetown and ANC 2E all continue to demand that the university provide housing for all of its undergraduates.
But Clements acknowledged that the university has compromised on some controversial measures. In a supplementary filing on the campus plan submitted last March, Georgetown offered to impose a voluntary enrollment cap of 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students and to house 250 additional student beds on campus by 2016. In addition, the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle bus loop road was relocated from a route parallel to Glover-Archbold Park to an area outside of Harbin Hall.
Clements said that the changes give him hope that a satisfactory middle ground may be reachable.
“I think we’ve all come a long way. All you have to do is line up what Georgetown … proposed in its [original version of the campus plan]. If you were to match that up with what they offered to the D.C. Zoning Commission [at the most recent hearing], it’s not the same plan,” he said.
Although the university has implemented several measures to respond to neighborhood concerns about student misconduct, including a weekend shuttle to M Street, twice-daily trash collection at area homes and heightened patrols by the Metropolitan Police Department, their effectiveness remains in dispute.
At the Zoning Commission’s sixth hearing on the campus plan Feb. 9, Commission Chairman Anthony Hood was reluctant to factor the initiatives into a final ruling.
“We don’t know if they work because they were just instituted. We don’t have a track record,” he said. “The test of time has not had time to run its course.”
However, according to Jake Sticka (COL ’13), who represents Georgetown’s single-member district on ANC 2E, the university’s willingness to implement such measures demonstrates its desire to cooperate.
“[We’ve] seen in the last year a number of compromises made in response to concerns raised by the community. I think that’s the philosophy of the university — to do everything that it can and work in good faith with the community,” he said. “The initiatives that have been going on more recently have been fairly successful.”
Depending on the duration of the university’s talks with neighbors, the negotiations may also be affected by changes in Georgetown’s representation on ANC 2E.
During the redistricting process that occurred last fall, D.C. added one single-member district to ANC 2E. The new district, SMD 2E08, encompasses Henle Village, Copley Hall and Nevils Hall and will almost certainly be represented by a Georgetown student. In addition, student candidates have the potential to contest seats in three other SMDs that encompass off-campus areas occupied by large numbers of students.
“It’s all up to who’s running and who gets elected,” Birch said.
Whether or not a third student-occupied seat is possible, Birch added that the addition of at least one student representative on the ANC is likely to change the dynamic of the commission.
“There were two students 10 years ago, and I thought it was a very successful ANC,” he said. “So much depends on the ability of any of the commissioners to understand the issues and be responsive to their constituents,and then look for ways to be productive as a total commission. I expect that same kind of strong voice for the university.”
The reconfiguration, which was hotly debated during the summer of 2011 because it made it more difficult for students to gain a third seat on the commission, was confirmed in a D.C. Council ruling in December.
While Sticka had initially supported an alternative plan drawn by John Flanagan (SFS ’14), which would have split a third SMD evenly between Georgetown students and permanent residents and made the election of a third student to the commission more likely, he expressed satisfaction with the approved reconfiguration.
“I think that we made some really significant gains in redistricting,” Sticka said. “I think given the circumstances we’re working with this year, being able to say with confidence that we’re going to have two students on the ANC is an accomplishment.”

Georgetown University’s Relay For Life saw a 30 percent drop in fundraising during a year with dramatically decreased participation.
The walkathon event last Friday raised $207,533, down from last year’s profits of about $300,000 and a little more than half of the $400,000 raised in 2010.
Participation in the fundraiser also declined. About 1,800 people attended the event at MultiSport Facility, and according to Co-Chair DJ Wise (COL ’13), there were between 500 and 1,500 participants on the field at any given time during the night. By comparison, over 3,000 people participated last year.
Despite the drop in fundraising and participation, the event’s coordinators said that group morale and cause awareness remained high.
“It looks like we were down in numbers, but in the ways that mattered the most, we made huge strides,” Co-Chair Ryan Muldoon (COL ’13) said. “In general, the committee members and those that attended the event were more intimately involved in the cause.”
According to Muldoon, a larger group than usual remained at the event throughout the night this year.
Wise added that many colleges and universities across the country have seen similar unexplainable decreases in fundraising and participation despite increased marketing throughout the year.
Wise also pointed out that most Relay teams waited longer than usual to begin raising donations this year, and many did not launch their fundraising efforts until early April.
“It did seem like the campus wasn’t reacting as much as they had in the past,” he said.
In previous years, Georgetown’s fundraising efforts were comparable to those of much larger schools, including Virginia Tech and the University of Georgia. But recently, Georgetown’s ability to compete has stagnated. Virginia Tech raised $570,695 this year, while the University of Georgia’s relay raised $276,442.
“It is simply difficult for a school of just 6,000 students to compete with schools of 25,000,” Muldoon said.
Rachel Carrig (COL ’13), the top individual fundraiser for Georgetown’s relay and captain of the Hoya Blue team, expressed frustration with the fundraising process and said that her success was partially due to her contacts from previous years.
Kendall Sarson (COL ’15), whose team raised over $1,400, said that she found it difficult to get people to donate.
“I think that part of the problem is that people don’t know where the money goes,” Sarson said.
According to Wise, the event committee aims to have a stronger presence on campus next fall, with a kickoff event planned for either October or November. The group will also take greater advantage of social media in its marketing strategies.
“One of the things that we saw that was successful [was] the sharing and liking of photos through social media, particularly Facebook,” Wise said.
New event Co-Chairs Emily Moffat (COL ’13), Dan Silkman (COL ’15) and Molly Paris (SFS ’13) were announced Thursday evening.
“This year was kind of a rebuilding year. Sometimes, when you focus on that, you lose a little bit of the numbers,” Moffat said.

Georgetown’s Disciplinary Review Committee passed a recommendation to raise the burden of proof for disciplinary responsibility to “clear and convincing evidence” in a meeting Thursday afternoon.
The recommendation will now be considered by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson.
Current policies dictate that a student must be found responsible for a disciplinary violation if the adjudicator believes that he or she was “more likely than not” responsible. The new standard would require a higher level of certainty on the part of the adjudicator and would apply to all violations of the Code of Student Conduct except incidents of sexual assault, for which the U.S. Department of Education mandates a “more likely than not” burden of proof.
“The current system is arbitrary, it’s ambiguous, it’s confusing and it doesn’t provide for equitable outcomes consistently,” student appointee to the DRC James Pickens (COL ’12) said.
Pickens was one of three students on the DRC, which also included former Georgetown University Student Association President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and graduate representative Fitz Lufkin (COL ’11). The remaining members include student affairs administrators and university faculty.
The final decision now rests in Olson’s hands.
“He ultimately has the final say about whether he will accept our recommendation, send it back to the committee for review or reject it. All three have happened in the past,” Pickens said.
“We hope that he would look upon the recommendation of the committee favorably since we spent three meetings on [the issue],” Lufkin added.
Representatives of GUSA’s Student Advocacy Office, which was founded in the spring of 2011 to advocate students’ rights in the university disciplinary process, praised the higher standard of evidence.
“This is a really significant benchmark, simply for the fact that we haven’t really had any kind of long term, macro-level accomplishments as an office,” said SAO co-director Sam Schneider (COL ’13), also a member of The Hoya’s Board of Directors. “Student code of conduct reform … [is] something that the office is very dedicated to.”

Recent Georgetown alumnus Florian Lorenz (MSB ’10) died earlier this week due to complications from a chronic heart condition.
An international student from Switzerland, Lorenz left his mark on Georgetown, working in both the McDonough School of Business Technology Center and the Office of International Programs and serving as the president of Georgetown UNICEF during his senior year.
Describing her brother, Christina Lorenz (MSB ’12) said, “He was always in a good mood, he always helped everyone who asked him and he was always very rational.
… When I needed help, he told me not to worry and comforted me.”
Because of his heart condition, Florian knew there was a possibility that he could die at any time, but, according to his sister, he never lost his optimism.
“He wanted to live life like a normal person,” Christina said.
Florian’s best friend at Georgetown, Brata Yudha (MSB ’10), said that his friendship with Florian blossomed during the first day of International Students Pre-Orientation.
“He was the first person I met,” Yudha said.
A memorial service was held in Florian’s honor in Copley Crypt Chapel Thursday.

Academic council elections took place across all four undergraduate schools this week, and the winners have already begun planning for the upcoming year.
The College Academic Council elections results were released on April 23, with two new sophomore class representatives and two new junior class representatives joining the its ranks.
According to incoming sophomore representative Dan Silkman (COL ’15), who served as freshman representative this year, the College Academic Council has big plans for the upcoming year.
One initiative is the introduction of a printing plan option that would be included in tuition, similar to the NHS and MSB models.
College students would pay $75 every semester in exchange for 1,000 prints, redeemable at Lauinger Library or any University Information Services printing station. Silkman said that the CAC is planning to speak with the SFS Academic Council to discuss extending this option to students of both schools.
This past year, the CAC also updated its website as part of an effort to make academic council websites as uniform as possible across the four undergraduate schools.
During this transitional period, additional plans for the upcoming year are still taking shape.
“Reflecting on what we did this year or what we haven’t done this year is a conversation started within the last few months,” Silkman said.
The executive board of the CAC will be chosen internally next Sunday.
According to incoming SFS Academic Council President Jon Askonas (SFS ’13), the SFS Academic Council also has ambitious plans for the upcoming year, with about three-quarters of the current members returning.
His main focus is increasing course flexibility for SFS students and introducing humanities and business minors. Askonas also hopes to decrease the SFS economics requirement from four to three courses by allowing students to take Econ 003, an introduction to both macro- and microeconomics.
“Most of the policy on the platform has already been discussed with the Dean’s office,” Askonas said. “It’s very accomplishable.”
Scott Wisniewski (NHS ’13) and Katie Dunn (NHS ’13) were elected as NHS Academic Council co-chairs.
According to Wisniewski, the NHS council will focus on increasing faculty-student interaction next semester. While the NHS Academic Council has held social events for both students and faculty in the past, Wisniewski also hopes to hold roundtables to provide a forum for an academically focused dialogue and to continue to expand a project from last year that supported St. Aloysius Gonzaga, a Jesuit school for AIDS orphans in Kenya.
“We’re excited to bring the community service aspect back,” Wisniewski said.
The MSB Academic Council also has extensive plans for the upcoming year, according to incoming sophomore representative Patrick Moore (MSB ’15), who served as freshman representative this year.
According to Moore, the focus will be on fundraising through events and through the Dean’s Office to increase programming for all MSB students, not just seniors.
“Now we’re looking to spread what we do over all grades,” he said.
Moore plans to institute a majors fair for incoming freshmen and hopes to increase the transparency of course requirements.
Next semester’s Academic Council leaders for each school are Scott Wisniewski (NHS ’13), Katie Dunn (NHS ’13), Jon Askonas (SFS ’13), Jared Coppotelli (MSB ’12) and Vanessa Magli (MSB ’12). The CAC president will be elected internally on Sunday.

University President John J. DeGioia announced Thursday that Georgetown will take advantage of a one-year delay offered by the Obama administration before adding contraceptive coverage to its student health insurance policy.
“After thoughtful and careful consideration, we will continue our current practice for contraceptive coverage in our student health insurance for the coming year, as allowed for under the current rules,” DeGioia wrote in an email to members of the Georgetown community.
The university’s policy will have to implement coverage for contraceptives by fall 2013 under the regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.
In the weeks prior to his decision, numerous student and university groups on both sides of the issue submitted letters to DeGioia requesting that he either delay or immediately implement coverage for contraceptives. Most recently, 780 students from the Georgetown University Law Center called on the university not to take advantage of the one-year grace period.
DeGioia acknowledged these requests in his announcement.
“I am grateful for the respectful ways in which you have shared your opinions,” he wrote. “I hope this is helpful in clarifying a matter of concern to many of you.”
H*yas for Choice President Kelsey Warrick (COL ’14) said the group plans to submit a petition from undergraduates asking DeGioia to change his stance.
“Obviously, H*yas for Choice is upset with President DeGioia’s decision,” she said. “The health and safety of the Georgetown community is at stake by deciding to defer.”
In contrast, Kieran Raval (COL ’13), who signed a letter asking the university to clarify its position earlier this month, was pleased with the announcement.
“I think it was important for President DeGioia to come out and say specifically, first of all, what the university health policy is, that it does cover [contraception] for therapeutic purposes,” he said. “I think it’s wise of him and the university to take the time and space that they’ve been granted to review how the regulation will affect Georgetown as a Catholic and Jesuit university.”
In response to DeGioia’s announcement, Georgetown Law Students for Reproductive Justice issued a letter of its own. The group expressed concern with DeGioia’s decision and the fact that he did not meet with LSRJ.
“We believe President DeGioia’s decision is an affront to the health concerns of the Georgetown student body. … It is disrespectful that President DeGioia, as the head of our university community, did not at least meet with students who have expressed legitimate and important concerns,” the letter read.
Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12), the former co-president of LSRJ and a subject of focus in the contraception debate since she testified before the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee in February, expressed her concern that this most recent decision might affect alumni donations. Fluke said that she would bear this announcement in mind when she is contacted to donate to the university.
“I’ll remember that in addition to how it felt the first time my friend told me that she was losing her ovary as a result of this policy,” she said.

“The Congressman and his staff already knew me and my work product as their intern. The transition was pretty easy,” she said.
Ex-Hoyas have long been a formidable presence on the Hill. Thirteen members of the House of Representatives and seven members of the U.S. Senate are Georgetown graduates.
But in addition to these public figures, graduates can be found working behind the scenes in almost every government office building. According to the university’s Office of Federal Relations, 17 Georgetown alumni serve as officials for the administration of President Barack Obama alone.
Rowley began interning on Capitol Hill soon after graduating and credits her Georgetown education with helping to launch her career.
“The academic experience prepared me so well [that] I passed the [Foreign Service Officer Test] the first time I took it,” Rowley said.
Sean Foertsch (SCS ’05), an assistant working in the Department of Veterans Affairs, recalled the fiercely competitive nature of applying for a job on Capitol Hill.
“I can remember being so excited about getting a call from a chief of staff to come in and interview, but then my excitement quickly faded as I learned that the interview pool was quite large. But I got the job,” he said.
He said the strong presence of Georgetown alumni creates a sense of solidarity and community on the Hill.
“Getting a degree from Georgetown … is an introduction into a community that becomes part of your life,” Foertsch said. “Our school is a special place, and it is not hard to see how it binds us to each other.”
Scott Fleming, Georgetown’s associate vice president for federal relations, said that having so many alumni in the federal government can be beneficial to Georgetown students in a variety of ways, such as when students have trouble with work visas.
“We interact a lot with Capitol Hill,” Fleming said. “We do not receive preferential treatment, but sometimes doors can be opened and direction given.”
Foertsch, for one, has mentored Georgetown students seeking employment in the government and values the new connections he has formed with Hoya alumni on the Hill.
“I have both hired Hoyas and worked with them,” he said. “It is always a nice thing to see a Georgetown degree listed on a resume.”
Jonathan Ossoff (SFS ’09), a senior assistant to Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), maintains regular contact with the federal relations team and has returned to campus to appear on career panels. He considers a Georgetown education good preparation for a job on the Hill.
“Many of the challenges that we’re dealing with I studied from a theoretical perspective in school,” he said. “That training has helped me understand the implications of policy we debate up here.”
Ossoff described his job, which includes finding staff for Johnson and writing legislation for the Department of Defense, as demanding yet rewarding.
“It sometimes requires you to make difficult policy decisions that impact people’s lives with imperfect information and little time,” he said. “It can be frustrating [but] … it’s often thrilling.”

After Vital Vittles lost several thousand dollars in a string of thefts earlier this school year, new security features recently installed at the on-campus convenience store appear to be working.
More than $6,000 worth of cigarettes was stolen from the student-run grocery store over the course of three separate thefts on Sept. 1, Dec. 6 and Jan. 23, and $200 in cash was taken from the store’s office on Dec. 1.
The series of incidents prompted Students of Georgetown, Inc. to work with University Facilities and Student Housing and the Department of Public Safety to implement security measures designed to discourage further thefts.
According to Stephanie Wolfram (MSB ’13), The Corp’s chief operating officer, these measures have been successful in preventing further incidents at the convenience store. No thefts have been reported at Vital Vittles since the Jan. 23 incident.
Efforts to increase security at the store focused on installing new locks and ensuring that any broken locks were fixed.
“The Corp has worked with Facilities to make sure all doors have locks and [that] the structure is secure to prevent attempts to get into locked doors,” Wolfram said. “Facilities and DPS have been very helpful.”
The hallway behind Vital Vittles was an area of particular concern because the offices and storage areas there are not easily visible, which prevents employees from monitoring them closely.
These efforts are the most recent phase of ongoing security upgrades at various Corp locations. Last semester, security cameras were installed at Vital Vittles and Hoya Snaxa, enabling employees to provide investigators with images of theft suspects.
As an additional precaution, service directors have also encouraged staff members to exercise more awareness while on duty.
“[Staff] have stuck to the new plans to help with security and have been nothing but supportive of the new measures. It has been a great turnaround,” Wolfram said.
Wolfram added that The Corp continues to further enhance security at its stores.
“We will maintain the current level [of security] with only plans to increase surveillance,” Wolfram said. “[We’re] making sure that we do not become too complacent.”

After Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E completed a redistricting process this year, it is likely that students will have a chance to win two spots on the commission in next year’s election. With Jake Sticka (COL ’13), incumbent student commissioner, set to conclude his term in November, Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14) launched his campaign for one of the two student seats. If elected, he would serve for two years. Though the campaign is still months away, this summer, Prindiville must gather the signatures of 25 students eligible to vote in D.C. in order to be put on the ballot. The Hoya sat down with Prindiville to talk about his goals and the challenges he will face.
The Hoya: What are the key tenets of your platform?
Prindiville: I would want to first and foremost support students. We can do a lot more than everyone thinks [on issues of] police enforcement, transportation and zoning. Zoning directly affects the university when they want to expand. … I want to help establish a dialogue … with students and the neighborhood and I think the ANC is where that can happen. My final point is to encourage engagement. I think [that it’s] extremely important for students to get involved in neighborhood affairs. I knew what the ANC was, but I never was engaged. … I never knew how to get involved, or that it was important to get involved. … It’s really easy for the student voice to get lost when the only voice[s] that [show] up at meetings [are those of] disgruntled neighbors.
The Hoya: What do you think needs to be changed about the way the university and the surrounding neighborhood relate?
Prindiville: I think the most important part … is dialogue. We need bona fide efforts to sit down at the table and talk these things out. … With the campus plan, the chair of the ANC and some members from [both] the administration of [the Citizens Association of Georgetown] and [Burleith Citizens Association] decided to sit down for a number of talks about the campus plan. But it was the administration and the neighborhood, no students. Legally, we are given representation on this commission. My role in that is going to be [to] foster communication between the students, administration and the neighbors.
The Hoya: Is there anything you would change about the ANC as an institution?
Prindiville: I think we’re already seeing change. This is the first year [that] we’ll actually have two student representatives and I think that’s an important improvement. … It gives the students representation on par with the neighbors, which is what they deserve as residents of the neighborhood. … The institutional culture really can change. … I think this “us versus them” mentality is unhealthy.
The Hoya: Do you have any plans for getting students out to vote?
Prindiville: I was in Red Square [Wednesday] registering voters. Right now, my major hurdle is getting my petition signed and verified, and to do that I need 25 registered voters. … Once I’m eligible, I’ll push hard to register voters and get them out to vote. … There’s usually low voter turnout and I want to change that. … I think that [low voter turnout] gives us a lack of legitimacy in a sense.
The Hoya: How can your representation on the ANC be used as a source of student empowerment?
Prindiville: I plan on using Twitter and Facebook and most likely an email newsletter to let students know when meetings are coming up … [and] what the issues … on the agenda [are]. As more students go to … meeting[s], they’ll begin to realize they have a say in what affects them.
The Hoya: Your term would start in November and end two years later, by which point you will have graduated. How will you make that work?
Prindiville: I think right now I’m prepared to complete the term. I obviously can’t look into the future and see what my life will be in a year and a half, but I’m thinking seriously about doing a five-year grad program here.

Georgetown University Hospital overbilled Medicare by over $659,000 between 2009 and 2010, according to a recent audit released April 9 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General.
The audit reviewed 265 inpatient and outpatient claims and found that only 131 of the claims complied with Medicare billing requirements. While the hospital has acknowledged that the remaining 134 claims were incorrectly filed, it is currently disputing the amounts of some of those charges. The hospital has confirmed $24,718 of the overcharges as billing errors but is currently disputing and reviewing claims pertaining to the remaining $634,653.
“We continue to work closely with OIG to determine a final resolution to this issue,” Marianne Worley, director of media relations for Georgetown University Hospital, wrote in an email.
The hospital’s Medicare contractor had previously flagged the 265 claims as at-risk for incorrect filing. The OIG conducts between 250 and 300 hospital audits each year after being notified of such at-risk claims and frequently finds evidence of overbilling.
“This is extremely typical, extremely routine,” OIG spokesman Donald White said. “This is just an audit. There is no suggestion of any willful wrongdoing or criminal activity.”
White added that the volume of overcharges is unsurprising.
“The hospital will continue to provide documentation, coding and compliance education to coding and billing staff, attending physicians and residents on an ongoing basis,” Paul Warda, vice president for finance and chief financial officer of Georgetown University Hospital, wrote in an official response to the audit.
The executive summary of the official audit attributes the errors to a poor understanding of Medicare billing procedures and a lack of adequate controls to prevent the inaccurate filing of claims, an issue the hospital plans to address.
“The hospital will continue to monitor and audit internal controls and remediate any identified errors,” Warda wrote.

This semester, the university found its stance on contraception thrust into the national spotlight after conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh went after one of Georgetown’s own.
Third-year law student Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12) became embroiled in a political controversy after Limbaugh called her a “slut” and “prostitute” on his nationally syndicated radio show Feb. 29 and March 1. The previous week, Fluke had testified to the U.S. House of Representative’s Democratic Steering and Policy Committee in an unofficial hearing on issues regarding contraception and the affordability of birth-control.
“These denials of contraceptive coverage impact real people,” Fluke said at the Feb. 23 hearing.
Under Georgetown’s current insurance plan, both undergraduate and graduate students can choose to use private health insurance or the university’s plan, which covers birth control for medical purposes but not for pregnancy prevention. Under a Department of Health and Human Services regulation announced earlier this spring, all religious institutions that offer insurance plans will need to cover contraceptives regardless of their purpose.
After her testimony, Limbaugh discussed Fluke’s stance on contraception, condemning her use of the pill.
“If we’re going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex … we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch,” Limbaugh said on his show.
“[Fluke] is having sex so frequently that she can’t afford all the birth control pills that she needs,” he added the next day.
Following these comments, Fluke found herself at the center of a media firestorm stoked by election-year politicking.
President Barack Obama called her that Friday to extend his support, and Republican leaders, including Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio), condemned Limbaugh’s comments.
University President John J. DeGioia issued a statement the same day that was hailed nationally as a call to civility.
“If we … allow coarseness, anger — even hatred — to stand for civil discourse in America, we violate the sacred trust that has been handed down through the generations beginning with our founders,” DeGioia wrote. “The values that hold us together as a people require nothing less than eternal vigilance. This is our moment to stand for the values of civility in our engagement with one another.”
Confronted with a public outcry and fleeing advertisers, Limbaugh issued an apology to Fluke on his website on March 3.
“For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke,” he said.
Though the political attention she has received has died down, Fluke has remained vocal about the need for complete contraceptive coverage in the university’s health care plan. While speaking on campus April 16 in an event sponsored by the Lecture Fund and the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, she reiterated the continuous need to push for contraceptive equality.
“It seems wrong to ask female students to choose between their health care and the quality of their education,” she said. “If Georgetown is the best school you got into or offers you the best career opportunities, why should you … have to not attend Georgetown and have to find somewhere else because of your health care needs?”
In light of the controversy, students and faculty from both sides of the issue have submitted letters to DeGioia asking for the university to take a stance.
DeGioia responded on Thursday with an email to the Georgetown community stating that he planned to take advantage of a one-year grace period offered in the HHS mandate.
H*yas For Choice President Kelsey Warrick (COL ’14) said she was disappointed with DeGioia’s decision, though she remains optimistic.
“I think the most respnsible decision would be to begin coverage next year … [But] at the end of the day, the school is going to have to begin coverage in 2013 anyway.”

When about a dozen Occupy protesters settled in D.C.’sMacPherson Square Oct. 1, it seemed that they had appeared overnight.
But Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown, believes that the movement was fated.
“There’s been a long critique for decades now about income inequality,” he said. “[The movement] was inevitable.”
Seven months later, the encampment is still home to a core group of protesters. The gradual growth of the D.C. branch of the Occupy protests has been mirrored by the development of Georgetown’s own Occupy group.
According to member Gina Bull (SFS ’12), Georgetown Occupy’s primary goal this year has been to strengthen activism on campus, particularly by establishing ties with organizations passionate about similar issues.
Members frequently join protests organized by the local movement, protesting in front of the White House and the Department of the Treasury and attending marches like that on the Key Bridge Nov. 17.
In late February, the group also organized a teach-in and has since established partnerships with other D.C. schools, including American University and The George Washington University.
According to member Rachel Nethery (COL ’12), Georgetown’s location has been integral in the ability to form such a coalition.
“Being in D.C., we have a lot of power that other groups … don’t have,” she said.
But she and Bull added that Georgetown Occupy has a role to play on campus as well, challenging the idea that protest is not a legitimate means of voicing discontent.
“A lot of people don’t consider activism … a normal resort,” Bull said. “It’s not a very mainstream activity at Georgetown … [and] we’re trying to get more Georgetown students to see that this is an appropriate and a more democratic form of representation.”
While attendance at the group’s twice-weekly meetings hovers around 15 regulars, Bull believes that the work it has done has been effective thus far.
According to Kazin, who is also a co-editor of the left-leaning magazine Dissent, college students are an integral part of the continuation of the Occupy movement because they are directly affected by national economic issues like student debt, low wages, the falling quality of public education and unemployment.
“There’s a question of where are jobs going to come from in the future, this fear that the finance industry … [is] going to be soaking up all the money and that a few people that are good with economics and money will be fine but that everyone else will be scrounging,” Kazin said.
Nethery and Bull both identified a need to challenge many Georgetown students’ definition of social justice as charity.
“I feel like philanthropy is good, but to make any substantial changes, you have to make changes to the system,” Nethery said.
Bull added that in the coming semester, Georgetown Occupy plans on developing its role as an umbrella organization for progressive student activism on campus and throughout D.C.
“I’m sure [Georgetown Occupy] is going to live on and be really strong,” she said.

Former US Secretary of State and Georgetown professor Madeleine Albright will be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom later this spring. The award is the highest honor an American civilian can receive.
The first female Secretary of State, Albright served from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton.
A press release from the White House applauded the Secretary for her hand in expanding NATO, fighting terror and ethnic cleansing in the Balkans and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.
Speaking about all this year’s recipients, President Barack Obama said, “[The recipients] have challenged us, they’ve inspired us, and they’ve made the world a better place. I look forward to recognizing them with this award.”
Albright is one of two Georgetown professors who will receive the award. Holocaust hero and Georgetown professor Jan Karski (GRD ’52) will also receive the medal posthumously.

University President John J. DeGioia announced that Georgetown will take advantage of a one year delay offered by the Obama administration before adding contraceptive coverage to its student health insurance policy.
“After thoughtful and careful consideration, we will continue our current practice for contraceptive coverage in our student health insurance for the coming year, as allowed for under the current rules,”DeGioia wrote in a letter emailed to members of the Georgetown community Thursday morning.
The university will have to implement coverage for contraceptives by Fall 2013 under the rules issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.
In the weeks prior to his decision, numerous student and university groups on both sides of the issue have submitted letters to DeGioia requesting that he either delay or immediately implement coverage for contraceptives. Most recently, 780 students from the Georgetown University Law Center called on the university not to take advantage of the one-year grace period.
DeGioia acknowledged these requests in his announcement.
“I am grateful for the respectful ways in which you have shared your opinions,” he wrote. “I hope this is helpful in clarifying a matter of concern to many of you.”
