The university has condemned the defacement of Georgetown University Right to Life’s anti-abortion chalk display in Red Square, after it was erased and replaced with phrases including “End hate,” “Choose Women” and “End the racist sexist capitalist cishetro patriarchy” early Wednesday morning.
On Tuesday night, GU Right to Life chalked messages including “End abortion” and “Choose both” in Red Square to celebrate national Pro-Life Chalk Day, according to the group’s Facebook page.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said the incident violated the university’s Speech and Expression Policy, which protects the right of student groups to chalk in Red Square.
“This incident of chalk messages being erased and altered in Red Square is a clear violation of our Speech & Expression Policy,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is troubling, and demonstrates a real lack of respect for other students’ viewpoints.”
Olson said the university will investigate the incident and work to ensure that the freedom of expression in the community is adequately protected.
“Our Speech & Expression Committee will look into the issue. It is vital that the right of all members of our community to express their views is protected,” Olson wrote.
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber said Thursday evening GUPD is currently investigating the defacement, after GU Right to Life President Amelia Irvine (COL ’19) reported it to GUPD and filed a bias report.
“We did take a report. Our Criminal Investigations Unit is looking into the case,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUPD had not identified a perpetrator as of press time.
GUSA Free Speech Policy Team Chair D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17) also criticized the Red Square defacement. Members of GU Right to Life met with GUSA representatives Wednesday evening to discuss the incident.
“I find the erasure and manipulation of the Right to Life messaging directly opposed to the ideals set out in the policy,” Angelini wrote in an email to The Hoya. “What could have been a civil back-and-forth turned into an infringement of free speech in one of Georgetown’s spaces dedicated for healthy contrasting dialogue.”
GUSA said in a campuswide email Thursday evening that erasing or manipulating chalking in Red Square is “in direct opposition to the university’s ideals of Free Speech and Expression.”
On Wednesday morning after the defacement, H*yas for Choice posted a statement on Facebook stressing the importance of respecting GU Right to Life’s freedom of expression.
“Last night, anti-choice messages were chalked in Red Square as a part of ‘National Pro-Life Chalk Day.’ While we condemn their calls to ‘end abortion,’ and their other anti-choice messages, we ultimately know the free speech rights of students on campus allow them to share their opinions in public spaces, even if that speech is problematic and often biologically unsound,” the statement reads.
Irvine said GU Right to Life leaders have reached out to leaders of H*yas for Choice in the hopes of establishing a firmer commitment for respect for each other’s viewpoints.
“I reached out to HFC yesterday to ask them out to coffee. [GU Right to Life Vice President] MyLan Metzger [COL ’19] and I will be meeting with their co-presidents this Saturday afternoon to talk about how we got here and how we can do better to love one another and treat each other with respect,” Irvine said.
Irvine said she was taken aback at the alterations to GU Right to Life’s intended message of love and acceptance.
“I was surprised to see that our message of love had been changed to something different, something aggressive and accusatory,” Irvine wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our theme was ‘Love Them Both,’ meaning that we as pro-lifers want to love both the woman and the child.”
Irvine said the defacement unfairly portrayed GU Right to Life as an organization that is hateful toward women.
“Those who disagree with us still accused us of hate, changing ‘End abortion’ to ‘End hate.’ I believe that this is a complete misunderstanding of what it means to be pro-life,” Irvine wrote.
Irvine also said members of GU Right to Life were harassed while writing the chalk display.
“There were precursors to this event. While a group of RTL members were chalking late Tuesday night, several students scuffed at the chalk and poured water on it. A couple of them cursed, saying such things as, ‘Get the f—–g government out of my vagina.’” Irvine wrote.
GU Right to Life On-Campus Service Chair Lindsay Caprio (NHS ’19) said the group sought to express a message of love for both the mother and the child.
“All we wanted to do for this year’s pro-life Chalk day was to send a message of love. We as members of the pro-life movement equally love and support both the life of the mother and the life of the child,” Caprio wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Caprio said it is important students on campus who disagree with each other can find a way to voice their disagreements without resorting to vandalism when it comes to the stances of others.
“Others who disagree with our view then resort to acts that destroy the integrity of our message,” Caprio wrote. “We, as students who attend such a rigorous school like Georgetown, are more than capable to engage in these difficult yet critically important discussions.”

Amazing the Hoya finally got around to reporting on this 3 days after the incident. Goodness knows if a HFC envelope fell off a door they’d be sending emergency notifications to the entire campus and be calling for demonstrations in Red Square

Absolutely disgusting. Though I disagree with Hoyas for Choice, it is absolutely vital that we allow for civil discussion of these issues. If the opposite had happened and anti-abortion advocates had defaced a pro-choice message, I can’t help but wonder if this would be national news.

This is sad. says 
October 31, 2016 at 10:38 pm
Wow. What have we come to as a campus that ‘pro-life’ is meaning hatred? The chalk had phrases like “choose life” and “love them both.” How does that translate to hatred in any way? As much as pro-choice hoyas get angry about the university infringing on their rights, you would think that they had a little more respect for other organizations. Just pathetic. I hope they find whoever did this foolishness.

Members of H*yas for Choice were the ones who defaced the chalkings.

Black women with criminal records are more likely to experience discrimination in the Washington, D.C. housing market than white women of comparable criminal backgrounds, according to a new report released Oct. 18 by the Equal Rights Center.
The ERC, a nonprofit civil rights organization, identified these findings as possible violations of the Fair Housing Act, which protects buyers or renters in a protected class, including race, color and national origin, from housing discrimination.
Though individuals with criminal records are not a protected class under the Fair Housing Act, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a directive in April that declared blanket policies of refusing to rent to anybody with a criminal record as de facto discrimination. However, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s general counsel, turning down an individual tenant due to a criminal record can still be legally justifiable.
The ERC found differential treatment favoring white over black testers in 47 percent of trials, which paired black and white women in 60 tests in which they were assigned similar criminal profiles and instructed to pose as a single woman searching for a one-bedroom or studio apartment for herself.
In 22 of the 47 tests that were able to provide conclusive results, white women received favorable differential treatment after disclosing their criminal backgrounds. Differential treatment was categorized in three ways: disparity in information or quality of service, differences in housing agents’ reactions toward testers’ disclosed criminal records and speculation from agents on the impact a testers’ criminal record would have on the success of her housing application.
ERC Director of Fair Housing Kate Scott, who spearheaded the research project, said the different attitudes black female women encountered greatly impacted their housing search.
“I think the difference in information about what policies are is a really big problem,” Scott said in an interview with The Hoya. “In many of those tests, one person would have walked away thinking ‘I have a chance. I’m not sure that I’ll have a successful application here, but I have a chance’ and the other tester would have walked away thinking, ‘There’s absolutely no chance. I won’t be able to rent here, so why would I even try?’”
Scott credits “Evicted,” an ethnography by Matthew Desmond discussing low-income housing in Milwaukee, as an inspiration for the report after it drew her attention to the often-overlooked plight of black female convicts.
“There were several goals at play, but I think one of the most important ones was to add a more nuanced look of what was happening that focused on gendered experiences of both the criminal-legal system and housing discrimination,” Scott said.
According to the ERC report, although there are more men in prison than women, the rate of growth for female imprisonment has outpaced the growth for male imprisonment by more than 50 percent between 1980 and 2014. Black women are imprisoned at more than twice the rate of white women.
Taylar Nuevelle, who did not wish to disclose the nature of her conviction, said the report captured the discrimination she experienced in her housing after being incarcerated.
“It actually brought tears to my eyes because it’s very difficult when you feel like you’re living in a vacuum and no one is experiencing what you’re experiencing,” Nuevelle said. “I could not have asked for a more comprehensive and validating piece. It was as if they had modeled the entire thing after me, and they knew nothing about me when they did this report.”
Nuevelle said the anecdotes included in the report helped humanize black female convicts in a way statistics could not.
“You can look at statistics and you can not feel, but this is real, tangible evidence that you can’t deny,” Nuevelle said. “You can’t dismiss it, and you can’t just relegate it; it’s tangible. You can’t just disassociate yourself from it.”
Scott said the study is limited in that it was not tested on subsidized housing, the most popular form of housing convicts pursue, because of its long waitlists. However, Scott said nevertheless the policy recommendations included at the end of the report for housing providers, local government and the Department of Housing and Urban Development were still valid for combatting housing discrimination.
The report recommended revising the role that criminal records and screening practices play in their screening processes and providing greater transparency about what screening criteria are for housing applications.
Ibilola Owoyele (SFS ’17), secretary of civil rights advocacy in the GUSA Federal and D.C. Relations Committee, said Georgetown students should take interest in the findings of the report.
“The report mentioned that one out of three Americans has some sort of criminal history. When you look at Georgetown students, someone is going to be affected by that number,” Owoyele said. “I think as people within D.C., it’s within our right and obligation to examine what role we can play in mitigating that number — first the high number of people who are criminalized, but also, once these people leave, what kind of rehabilitative justice we can do.”
Director of the GUSA Federal and D.C. Relations Committee Kotryna Jukneviciute (COL ’18) said the report was significant for promoting dialogue about housing discrimination. The ERC suggests D.C. residents concerned by the findings of the investigation should consider serving as a tester for the ERC.
“Some people, after reading it, will hopefully feel inspired to do something,” Jukneviciute said. “That’s what I think is the beauty of reports like this, is that it gives students the opportunity to ignite a fire inside of them and then hopefully go out and do something about it.”

Eighty-five percent of Georgetown faculty and staff’s presidential campaign contributions went to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, while 0.6 percent went to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, according to The Hoya’s analysis of Federal Election Commission filings.
A total of 153 Georgetown faculty and staff donated about $206,000 to presidential campaign organizations or affiliated super PACs from January 2015 through July 2016 according to the analysis.
Clinton received about $158,444 of that total from 121 donors, through 555 contributions, while Trump received a total of $1,110 from four donors.
Total donations to Democrats account for 96 percent of contributions, with an additional 11 percent going to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.
Seventy-four Georgetown community members donated $5,211.86 to Sanders, while one person donated $500 to O’Malley.
The remaining contributions went to five other Republican primary candidates: former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and businesswoman Carly Fiorina.
Trump’s four donors from Georgetown’s faculty and staff included a web developer, a tax analyst and two registered nurses, while Clinton’s included a variety of administrators and professors.
Previous election years have yielded similar results. In 2012, 94 percent of Georgetown faculty and staff contributions went to President Barack Obama. Then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney received significantly more contributions than Trump received in this cycle, but Romney still only garnered 5 percent total contributions.
All FEC donations are publicly available online and are not anonymous.
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said Georgetown is unable to be associated with political campaigns, but encourages faculty, staff and students to be involved in politics in a personal capacity.
“All members of our community are free to contribute personal funds to support candidates or causes of their choice,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While there are restrictions on the use of university funds to support partisan political campaign activity, as long as faculty and staff are acting in their personal capacities, the university does not restrict, monitor, or interfere with their political contributions.”
Government professor James Lengle said the data does not necessarily suggest that Georgetown faculty and staff are liberal.
“I’d be careful about jumping to the conclusion, based on the contributions, that faculty and staff are overwhelmingly Democratic,” Lengle said. “All this data shows is more Democratic faculty and staff members contributed than Republicans contributed. The data might be suggestive, but it’s certainly not definitive.”
However, Membership Director of Georgetown University College Republicans Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) said the contribution data reflects a liberal faculty and campus climate.
“We were surprised the Republican donations were even that high,” Estes said. “I think you find without a doubt that in classes that shouldn’t even have a political tone to it, somehow politics comes up.”
For government professor Matthew Kroenig, who served as a senior national security adviser to the Marco Rubio and Scott Walker campaigns this election cycle and who donated to Republican Wisconsin congressional candidate Mike Gallagher, the FEC data reflects a broader liberal bias in academia across the country.
“It definitely is the case that the academy is overwhelmingly liberal, and that’s not just at Georgetown, that’s true nationwide,” Kroenig said. “There have been a number of studies looking at this, and the overall finding is that academics tend to be overwhelmingly liberal.”
Kroenig said he believes a bias within the faculty could impact the education that students receive.
“I do think that liberals and conservatives tend to see the world in fundamentally different ways,” Kroenig said. “If the faculty is all on one side of that equation, I think at a minimum you’re going to be missing the perspective on the other side, and I think that will color the nature of the education.”
According to Kroenig, the problem is not with professors expressing their opinions to students but with the ideological makeup of the faculty as a whole.
“If all of the analysis and viewpoints and subjective perceptions students are getting tend to be from one side, I think we’re doing a disservice to students because they aren’t understanding that other side,” Kroenig said.
McCourt School of Public Policy professor Lynn Ross said there is evidence that college faculty are largely liberal-minded but said this ideology rarely seeps into the classroom.
“My definition of professional comportment in the classroom is that my political views don’t really matter,” Ross said. “I am certainly not ever, nor do I want to be, in the position to prosthelytize or convince students of one viewpoint or another.”
According to Ross, who teaches courses on public management, her students often would not be able to tell whether she is liberal or conservative because of the way she approaches her lectures.
“If students have a particular point of view, I view my position as playing devil’s advocate,” Ross said. “If they’re liberal I become a conservative, and if they’re conservative I become a liberal.”
Ross said that, if Georgetown indeed has a largely liberal bias, the solution is to have more educated voices on the other side.
“What we probably need is more people of the minority view to balance things out,” Ross said. “If [someone] is arguing that there is a bias that teachers are imparting with their political views, I would say that what we need to do is get more of those biases so they can cancel each other out.”
Lengle said he has encountered this diverse array of opinions in the government department.
“In my department all I can say is that there is a vast range of political opinions, and I think that’s what makes for a good department. That diversity of opinion ends up in the classroom, and that promotes the educational process,” Lengle said. “The whole point of the educational process is the exchange of different ideas in search of the truth.”

I’d be careful about jumping to the conclusion, based on his comments, that Lengle is a deluded idiot.   The data might be suggestive, but it’s certainly not definitive. Instead of being genuinely ignorant he could also just be shilling for the left.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell defended the increase of Affordable Care Act midlevel premiums by an average of 25 percent next year, citing the benefits of the health care program for millions of Americans who were uninsured in 2010 in Gaston Hall on Wednesday.
“One in seven Americans did not have insurance,” Burwell said. “Twenty million more Americans now have insurance. We have the lowest uninsured rate in the history of our nation. That’s access.”
Burwell was the guest of the third Exit Interview, a six-part series created by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service to examine the political and policy record of President Barack Obama.
McCourt School professor Judy Feder introduced Burwell by praising the Affordable Care Act’s extension of health coverage to nearly 20 million Americans, but conceding that the next administration will face unresolved problems, including the widening Medicaid coverage gap.
“Tonight, with Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, our focus is on health reform and health care — safe to say, one of the biggest challenges this administration has faced, both politically and operationally,” Feder said. “When President Obama came into office, we were approaching having 50 million people without health insurance.”
McCourt School of Public Policy professor E.J. Dionne Jr., who also serves as a GU Politics board member, moderated the event. Previously, The Exit Interview”has featured National Security Adviser Susan Rice on Sept. 14 and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Oct. 13.
Burwell said she was most proud of her work transforming the U.S. health care system through the 2010 Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, which expanded Medicaid eligibility and offered cost assistance for the uninsured through health insurance marketplaces.
“The work that we’ve done there and the impact that we’ve had there, that I’ve contributed to, is probably one of the things I’m most proud of,” she said. “The Affordable Care Act is about three things: affordability, access and quality. … When we think about where we are, I think it is important to think about where we were and where we are now.”
Burwell discussed how her past experience as the White House deputy chief of staff under President Bill Clinton prepared her for the demanding aspects of the job. However, she said she was still taken aback at the fast-paced nature of her job, especially during the 2014 Ebola outbreak.
Burwell further addressed solutions to the current state of the American opioid abuse crisis, noting that 250 million opioid prescriptions were given in 2014 in the United States. She discussed her department’s strategy for tackling the opioid epidemic, which includes revising the guidelines whereby doctors prescribe opioids and monitoring whether doctors are prescribing opioids responsibly.
“In terms of the problem, the administration has been working on it over a period of time in lots of pieces and parts across different parts,” Burwell said. “Our strategy is based on three things. One is controlling the prescribing — that’s how many of the drugs are getting out to people. And so this is about helping doctors.”
The other two priorities of the Department of Health and Human Services are to increase the use of drugs combatting the effects of opioid use, especially overuse, and to expand the medication-assisted treatment, which is a combination of behavioral therapies and medication to treat opioid overuse.
Burwell concluded by discussing how her faith as a Greek Orthodox Episcopalian has shaped her career.
“In my work, that’s an important part of it — thinking about the world and how Christ turned things on its head, in terms of who he was helping and who he was being connected to,” Burwell said. “So [my faith] is something that is an important part of how I think about my work, both in terms of what I do and how I do it.”
John Davis (NHS ’17), who attended the event, said the interview helped elucidate many aspects of the Affordable Care Act for him.
“There are definitely a lot of aspects of the ACA that I was not aware of previously, such as the fact that young adults can stay on their parents’ plan until they are 26 and also the annual and lifetime limits that a lot of people were reaching,” Davis said. “I’m looking forward to seeing the work that [Burwell] is going to do in the future.”

America’s health care and educational resources have struggled to meet the needs of disabled individuals, according to disability rights advocate Anastasia Somoza (COL ’07) and her mother Mary Somoza in an event hosted by the Academic Resource Center on international disability rights Monday.
Anastasia Somoza and her twin sister Alba Somoza were both diagnosed at the time of birth with cerebral palsy spastic quadriplegia, a condition that affects speech and motor control.
Since her graduation, Anastasia Somoza has undertaken numerous endeavors to advance disability rights around the world, including speaking at this year’s Democratic National Convention endorsing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Besides completing a graduate degree at the London School of Economics, Anastasia Somoza currently works as a consultant with the Shield Institute, an organization that provides tools for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and has spoken to audiences in numerous countries.
Anastasia Somoza began her work in disability activism after her sister was placed in a class for students with disabilities at a public school. At Wednesday’s event, which was held in the Leavey Program Room, Mary Somoza said the system was ill-suited to cope with Alba Somoza’s disabilities. Students in the class had a range of needs and the teacher was overwhelmed.
“No teacher on this Earth could have taught all the different disabilities of the children that were in that classroom. Ranging from deaf-blind, to cerebral palsy, to Down syndrome, to autism, to emotional disturbance, everybody was packed in together,” Mary Somoza said. “Nobody was getting an education.”
In 1993, Mary Somoza received a message from the New York State Advocate for the Disabled inviting one of her daughters to represent children with disabilities at a town hall with President Bill Clinton. She accepted and sent Anastasia Somoza.
Anastasia Somoza said advocacy was a natural career choice for her growing up with a mother who spent her time advocating for her children.
“It happened naturally, because I grew up with her advocating for us,” Anastasia Somoza said. “I always recognized that I was able to do what I was doing in my everyday life as a child, as a teenager, as a young adult because of the help that I received from other people.”
Anastasia Somoza also said her experience at Georgetown highlighted challenges facing Georgetown’s resources for disabled students. Oftentimes, those assigned to assist her would not provide adequate service. Her shortcomings as a test-taker also affected her academics negatively.
Nevertheless, Anastasia Somoza learned to play to her strengths and find support in the resources available on campus and in the many friends she made at Georgetown.
“I’m so glad that I made the decision to come here,” Anastasia Somoza said.
Obtaining treatment for her daughters was a challenge, according to Mary Somoza, because of America’s health insurance system.
“Having grown up in the socialist environment in England, with free medicine and doctors, it appalled me that in the richest country on Earth, they didn’t have free medicine for all,” Mary Somoza said.
Mary Somoza said she was able to fight her way through the health care system to ensure that her daughters would receive appropriate medical care.
“I realized that one of the great things about the United States is that if you don’t like something, and you don’t like it bad enough, you can change it,” Mary Somoza said.
Academic Resource Center Director Jane Holahan said the Anastasia Somoza’s emphasis on self-care is an important lesson for all students to remember.
“Self-advocacy is key for all students, particularly for students with disabilities,” Holahan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Learning how to communicate one’s needs is essential, and we — the ARC staff — want to assist students in developing their advocacy skills. Advocacy is embedded in the Academic Resource Center’s mission.”

Georgetown’s Sexual Assault Peer Educators program has educated 300 students in sexual misconduct policies and bystander intervention so far this year, putting it on course to exceed the 700 students it educated last year, according to SAPE Faculty Advisor Jennifer Wiggins.
This year also marks the largest group of SAPE educators in the program’s history, with 75 peer educators.
Wiggins said the increase is due in part to increased dialogue on preventing campus sexual assault.
“The amount of traction that we got last year from our programming meant that student groups we connected with last year knew this is something that we want to bring in for our new recruits this semester,” Wiggins said.
While SAPE is on track to exceed last year’s numbers, it is still working on further diversifying the dialogue regarding sexual assault on campus.
Wiggins said in an article in The Hoya last April that SAPE needed to work on improving its diversity. According to Wiggins, only 15 of the 60 students involved with SAPE last year identified as male and few people of color were represented. Wiggins declined to provide a breakdown on SAPE trainers’ backgrounds.
According to Wiggins, the organization is currently prioritizing its selection of SAPE facilitators and how to train them to reflect the diversity of Georgetown.
“SAPE is definitely more diverse than it was last year,” Wiggins said. “I think when we are putting together task forces or focus groups we should be making sure there are diverse voices in the room — also being able to connect with offices like LGBTQ [Resource Center] or [Center for Multicultural Equity and Access] to encourage people to apply to be in programs that are centered around the dialogue is very important.”
SAPE’s Development Chair Maneesha Panja (COL ’18) said SAPE still needs to take more measures to better represent minorities.
“We are definitely in a transition period right now. I am not going to say that we are at a point in terms of the organization where we’re representing all groups that are being affected by sexual assault on this campus,” Panja said. “At the same time there is a lot of initiative that both [Wiggins] and the board has embarked on that is really trying to change that.”
According to Panja, this push for increased diversity needs to start with the university administration.
“I would like to see more administrative initiative to empower more people of color to be on the decision-making boards when it comes to choosing things such as Title IX coordinators,” Panja said.
SAPE’s growth is part of a larger effort on campus to improve bystander training since the release of the university’s Sexual Assault and Misconduct Survey on June 16. University President John J. DeGioia approved funds for “Bringing in the Bystander,” a bystander training program that will be administered to all student leaders on campus.
At least three members of Georgetown’s largest student groups will be trained on how to identify and respond to high-risk situations.
Panja said the new initiative will help improve awareness of sexual assault on campus.
“By administrating this training to all student leaders on campus, that is basically indicating that Georgetown is willing to take a shift in focus in that we’re taking this problem very seriously and we are taking direct action to make sure that every single person on this campus in whatever social involvement is hearing this message from somebody in power in a club or organization,” Panja said.
SAPE will also be altering the structure of its own bystander intervention to accommodate the new university initiative, according to Wiggins.
“What we are going to be doing with the bystander intervention workshop that SAPE does is that we are updating the curriculum to not mirror that of ‘Bringing in the Bystander,’ but it’s going to work to augment it,” Wiggins said.
SAPE’s Special Projects Chair Carlo Izzo (COL ’17) said the SAPE program was most recently updated following the first campus climate survey on sexual assault and misconduct, whose results were released in June.
“We have tailored our bystander intervention workshop to reflect some of the results from the campus climate survey,” Izzo said. “I think the bystander intervention training is going to be tough because it’s not personalized to the groups whilst SAPE personalizes everything to the culture at Georgetown.”
According to Izzo, bystander intervention training help will help increase the ability of students to respond to incidents of sexual assault.
“First of all it is an easy way to enter into the conversation around sexual assault because it doesn’t point figures or place blame right away,” Izzo said. “I think inactive bystanders do have a lot of blame and I think that we are trying to frame it in a way that you can be a positive force — it creates a lot more positivity and makes it much easier to join the conversation and is more welcoming.”
Izzo said the issue of sexual assault is becoming more widely spoken about on campus.
“What’s new now is that people who aren’t survivors or haven’t experienced sexual violence are suddenly interested in this topic,” Izzo said. “You get a lot of interest, and people power together to give voice to an issue.”
Bystander training is a key step toward creating a community committed to ending sexual assault, according to Izzo.
“My future step would be to end sexual assault, and I think it’s going to come through bystander intervention,” Izzo said. “Right now we have an awareness that it exists, but I think we need to get to the point where the awareness moves people to action.”

Local parents incensed by the mandatory transportation of school children from the public Hyde-Addison Elementary School to a swing site located three miles away are urging Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and members of the D.C. Council to prevent the transfer.
The movement, which adopted the slogan “Don’t Wing the Swing,” has amassed 235 signatures online and plastered Wisconsin Avenue and O Street with signs to bring attention to its demand that D.C. Public Schools find a site closer to Georgetown than the proposed Meyer Elementary School location in Shaw.
The Shaw location would require students to travel more than an hour per day on buses to the location on Euclid and 11th Streets NW.
Hyde-Addison, the only public elementary school in Georgetown, is slated to begin two years of renovations this summer to expand classroom space and construct a new media center and multipurpose room. The project has been delayed for over five years as budget allocations, problems with a sewer pipe and concerns about historical preservation have repeatedly pushed back plans.
DCPS Communications Coordinator Janae Hinson said Hyde-Addison’s location in Georgetown presented unique challenges during planning and were responsible for these delays.
“Important to remember is that Hyde-Addison is located in Historic Georgetown, which means that there are limitations,” Hinson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We cannot build up or out, only down.”
Originally, parents were provided with local options for the relocation including Ellington Field in Burleith and Hardy Middle School in upper Georgetown until DCPS opted to funnel all Hyde-Addison students into the Meyer site.
Hinson said the decision was reached after considering a number of factors to minimize disruption for students.
“Our goal is to provide an equitable learning experience for all students and to design a building that allows for future student body growth,” Hinson wrote. “We took into account school population, classroom space, the teaching and learning environment and the overall impact on students, families and staff.”
According to the parent petition, 93 percent of Hyde parents surveyed by the city opposed the move to Meyer, claiming no neighborhood elementary school to date has been located so far from the community it serves.
DCPS established a School Improvement Team at Hyde-Addison to consult on issues arising during construction and disseminate information to the community about the project’s progress. The SIT is comprised of teachers, parents and community members who collaborate with the principal and Parent Teacher Association during all DCPS modernization projects.
SIT member Elissa Alben, who is involved with creating the petition, said she took issue with the city’s lack of transparency during the project.
“If you go back to when this started, the city initially sent us a letter as parents telling us first that the school was not going to move anywhere,” Alben said. “Then we received a letter saying that we were going to have to move, but they were only looking at local sites, and then a short time after we received another letter that they were no longer looking at local sites, they had chosen Meyer as their swing site. So parents were just constantly whipsawed in this process.”
Fellow Hyde-Addison parent Garance Genicot, a professor of economics at Georgetown, said DCPS was also inconsistent in its estimation of the length of the project.
“At first they were saying, ‘Oh, we are going to do this and it will take three months for major work and we will finish it locally,’” Genicot said. “And then they wake up and realize, ‘Oh no, it’s going to take two years,’ then they hide information. At the end, I don’t trust DCPS anymore to do anything. They were hiding the information from the parents.”
Henson said DCPS plans on providing transportation for Hyde-Addison students to Meyer.
“As stated in our letter to families, we feel that Meyer will best meet the academic needs of Hyde-Addison,” Henson wrote. “DCPS will provide transportation to and from the swing space, which is always done during a modernization of this scale.”
DCPS Interim Chancellor John Davis wrote in an Oct. 7 letter to Hyde-Addison parents that their feedback was an invaluable part of the Hyde-Addison modernization and would continue to be considered during the project.
“The DCPS modernization team will continue to work with the SIT to ensure a successful modernization process,” Davis wrote. “We understand the challenges that come with any modernization and the associated swing and will continue to engage students, parents, and staff to ensure two productive and enriching years.”

The debate over Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s late-night services intensified last week as riders overwhelmingly petitioned to bring back midnight to 3 a.m. services on weekends at an Oct. 20 public hearing in Washington, D.C.’s Metro headquarters.
WMATA cut back hours in June due to its yearlong SafeTrack initiative, which is fixing lingering maintenance issues that have plagued the Metro through 15 “safety surges” that shutter segments of the line for weeks at a time. As a result of increased maintenance hours, Metro trains open at 5 a.m. on weekdays and 7 a.m. on weekends, closing at midnight every day.
However, pressure has mounted on WMATA to bring back late-night hours on weekends, with Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and the D.C. Council both voicing support for the restoration of the service. The reduced hours will remain in place at least until SafeTrack concludes in April, but the WMATA board of directors will determine by December whether to bring back late-night services or continue extra maintenance.
Among those who wish to see late-night service returned is D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), who also serves as the chair of the WMATA board of directors. Evans drafted a resolution from the D.C. Council that passed unanimously this month calling for late-night services to be returned.
Evans’ Director of Communications Thomas Lipinsky said the councilmember wants to make it easier for workers and residents of nearby towns to go to and from D.C. at night.
“The Metro is a way to connect employment centers and where people live that would be seriously disconnected if Metro were closed at midnight indefinitely,” Lipinsky said. “That’s Councilmember Evans’ concern.”
WMATA General Manager Paul Wiedefeld previously said the current schedule must be maintained and may reduce to even shorter hours in order to fix maintenance problems. In July, Wiedefeld proposed permanently reducing Metro hours to midnight on Fridays and Saturdays and 10 p.m. on Sundays.
However, at the all-day hearing at Metro’s headquarters Oct. 20, multiple riders and officials made the case to restore late-night hours.
In particular, Lipinsky said that, for those who must commute to jobs at restaurants that are open late on weekends, having Metro cut its late-night hours causes significant concerns with transportation. Lipinsky also said Evans is concerned about how the local economy will continue to fare without late-night Metro transportation.
“There are concerns about safe passage for those individuals who are patronizing those dining establishments,” Lipinsky said. “But even more importantly for the councilmember is the folks who are working at those establishments.”
Kurt Erickson, president and C.E.O. of the Washington Regional Alcohol Program, spoke at the hearing in support of restoring late-night hours. According to Erickson, keeping Metro open late would help alleviate instances of drunk driving.
“We don’t want to incentivize anybody to get behind a wheel of their own car if they’ve been drinking,” Erickson said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s the same thing with Metro. As long as they stay open, they are hopefully incentivizing people to use Metro to get home rather than driving home in their own vehicle when they’ve been drinking.”
Wiedefeld stressed the need to keep hours at their current rate, citing multiple potential safety issues. In 2016, Metro has faced multiple such issues, including a track fire that prompted Metro officials to shut down the service for a day in March, a track explosion in May and a train car derailment in July. According to Wiedefeld, by closing Metro at midnight on weekends, there is increased time to maintain the tracks.
Lipinsky made it clear that Evans also supported additional maintenance hours, and conceded that the Metro is the least busy between midnight to 3 a.m. However, he maintained that the many benefits of late-night services need to be accounted for when deciding the time maintenance is done.
“Metro definitely needs additional maintenance. Nobody’s disputing that,” Lipinsky said. “Councilmember Evans agrees with the general manager that we need additional maintenance hours. And, the general manager’s proposal to reduce hours from 3 a.m. to midnight is based on where ridership is lowest.”

The mainstream LGBTQ movement has lost sight of its founders’ liberation ideology, according to author and activist Urvashi Vaid in a discussion of the political, local, national and global histories of the community Wednesday as a part of LGBTQ History Month.
Speaking at the event “Reading Our Many Pasts,” organized by the LGBTQ Resource Center, Vaid called for a thorough reassessment of the LGBTQ movement’s motives, means and aims.
Vaid said she was initially inspired to join the LGBTQ movement to help create a more equal society.
“As a 17-year-old college student in the United States in 1975, I was an idealist. I believed not only that utopia could be possible, but that it could be realized in my lifetime,” Vaid said. “I defined utopia as the spread of social prosperity to benefit all people. I believed in social movements and rushed to join them.”
Vaid said that in spite of the work of the movement’s founders and initial proponents, present-day
LGBTQ activism lacks commitment to and understanding of the implications of liberation.
“[It] came to be interpreted as synonymous with equality,” Vaid said.
Vaid said having equality as an end goal is ultimately limiting.
“It does not deliver justice. It does not transform family or culture nor expand freedom for all. It does not touch, much less end, structural racism or the enforcement of the gender binary,” Vaid said. “It does not end familial homophobia or deliver women’s equality. It has nothing to offer about ending mass incarceration and the systematic employment of state violence against black and brown communities.”
Vaid said the movement must instead focus on fighting for justice.
“The only way we are going to win the fight [for liberation] is for the LGBTQ movement to commit to win the larger struggle for social, racial and economic justice.”
For Vaid, one of the movement’s biggest contemporary challenges is defining the issues it is fighting for, including who is involved in the struggle, for whom it is getting involved and what it is fighting against.
Vaid praised the community for its willingness to engage with society at large through social, political and economic endeavors but said there are areas where significant progress is yet to be made, including defending communities of color.
Vaid said while the securing of equal marriage rights was a significant step forward, the existence of state laws that allow public officials to deny adoption requests and engage in other discriminating acts, which the community is unable to repeal due to a lack of local political power, shows there is still work to be done.
Vaid urged students to pursue social justice in their everyday lives.
“Social justice activism is the most rewarding journey you can make and you can imagine,” Vaid said. “And it is one I wish on every one of you.”
Assistant Director of the LGBTQ Resource Center Julian Haas said Vaid’s views mirror the mission of the LGBTQ Resource Center.
“When it comes to honoring many complexities that make up who people are, all of our work — all of the work that comes out of the LGBTQ Resource Center at Georgetown University — is intersectional by nature,” Haas said. “We give folks the language and framework to seek deeper understanding and visibility in themselves and then also to carry that forward in all the things they do in their community.”
Abhinab Katineni (SFS ’20) said Vaid handled the topic effectively.
“I think it’s really powerful because a lot of the issues aren’t common to discuss, such as the intersection of race and economics,” Katineni said. “I think she did a good job shedding light to those issues and explaining their role in the struggle as a whole.”
Kennedy Foles (SFS ’20) said the address changed many of her opinions of the LGBTQ issues.
“Her discussion of LGBT issues was very transformational, and I think that it really made an impact on everybody who was listening,” Foles said.

Despite Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s growing momentum in polls two weeks ahead of Election Day, there is still a possibility for Republican nominee Donald Trump to win the election, argued several panelists during a Georgetown University Law Center discussion Oct. 24.
Moderated by CNN Washington Bureau Chief Sam Feist (GRD ’99), Decision 2016: What’s Trending — #ImWithHer or #MAGA?: A Panel Discussion, featured seven political advocates for both Clinton and Trump, who offered their predictions of Trump’s prospects following recent allegations of sexual misconduct and leaked audio featuring Trump making lewd remarks about women, which have resulted in sliding poll numbers and establishment Republican politicians withdrawing their support from the nominee.
Polling data aggregator Real Clear Politics gives Clinton 262 electoral votes to Trump’s 126, excluding “tossup” states, which displays an improvement of over 60 electoral votes for Clinton since late September. Over 10 national polls included in the aggregator highlight Clinton’s current lead, some by margins as large as 13 points.
Brookings Institute Senior Fellow E.J. Dionne, a professor at Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy, expressed confidence in Clinton’s lead.
“My basic view of the election is that, unless between now and Election Day we repeal both women’s suffrage and the remaining parts of the voting rights, Donald Trump will lose,” Dionne said. “Trump is caught in a bipartisan narrative of defeat.”
Washington Post National Political Correspondent Karen Tumulty said her publication’s release of Trump’s private audio was instrumental in changing the tide of the election by bolstering Clinton’s support among white women.
“If the race is not over, it is close to over,” Tumulty said. “Nothing else affected the race as much.”
However, GOP political commentator Paris Denard said he believed Trump’s campaign was still salvageable if he focused on his policy points for the remainder of the campaign, specifically concerning the economy and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
“He needs to stay on message and talk about his strengths: jobs, the economy, NAFTA, trade, the business leader he is,” Denard said. “If he stays on message and continues to message directly to the people, he will win this election.”
Lieutenant General Joseph K. Kellog Jr., foreign policy adviser for Trump’s campaign, counseled voters to focus less on candidates’ personalities and more on their stances on political issues.
“I don’t think you need to count anybody out in the election,” Kellog said. “I think it’s foolish to do that, because you just never know. To me, it’s come down to something very simple. The election is either status quo or change.”
Tumulty agreed that the 2016 election cycle presented voters with a choice between Clinton’s pro-establishment stance, which builds on the previous work of President Barack Obama, and Trump’s narrative of dramatic reform.
Denard suggested current polls may be misleading, as certain segments of the population, including black Americans in urban areas, may publically express disapproval of Trump but privately support him on Election Day.
“There is a growing sense that the black community are left behind in the economy,” Denard said. “If you have more black people owning homes in the Great Depression than we do now, we have some real problems.”
Celina Lake, president of Democratic polling firm Lake Research Partners, challenged the dichotomy between the two candidates and contested that Clinton, too, advocates change.
“Clinton has to make sure that her exceptional qualifications and leadership do not become an argument for the status quo,” Lake said. “But I think if you look at the number of plans she has put out, she is for change as well, and America is for change.”
George Dobbins (GRD ’19), who attended the event, said despite their differing views, the panelists provided a civil discourse otherwise absent from the election.
“I was really grateful that they were so civil during the whole thing, because so much of the problem with this year’s election is that people aren’t able to talk civilly to one another; but these people were, and they had very different opinions,”  Dobbins said.
Marina Smith (GRD ’19) said the conversation alerted her to the importance of students turning out for the election.
“I think after [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)] dropped out, large potentials for students our age thought their vote wouldn’t matter, but I think one of the biggest issues is voter turnout,” Smith said. “It all depends on who’s turning up to the polls.”

Shortly after the election of Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) to the executive, Federal and D.C. Relations Committee Director Kotryna Jukneviciute saw an opportunity to fill a hole in GUSA’s advocacy efforts.
“I always had that notion that there was more to be done, because for me, the real issues are outside of Georgetown,” Jukneviciute said. “That’s where the real problems are that need to be addressed.”
She convened the group through consultation with Khan and Fisk to serve as a liaison between the federal government, the local government and Georgetown.
In its seven months of operation, the 20-person committee has worked to improve outreach efforts and accomplish goals it set in early April when the new GUSA executive leadership announced its formation.
The team identified several policy goals last semester, including advocating for the Higher Education Reauthorization Act, a mentoring program with public schools in the District, advocacy for D.C. statehood, a network to organize college student activism across the country and a partnership with D.C. Central Kitchen to provide summer storage space.
To address national advocacy efforts from various college campuses, the team’s Secretary of Institutional Outreach Zachary Schroepfer (MSB ’19) worked to organize a Student Leadership Alliance.  The coalition of students from different schools seeks to organize activism on Capitol Hill regarding student life.
“What I specifically have done is reaching out to universities from every state and inviting them to become a part of the SLA. Up to this date we’ve gotten a little more than 40 universities to join,” Schroepfer said. “We have petitions that are student-generated, so students write one-page petitions that typically support specific pieces of federal policies. After that the petitions go on our website, and we begin national campaigns.”
So far, the SLA has conducted a national campaign for a sexual assault policy reform petition, according to Schroepfer.
“This petition supports the Campus Accountability and Safety Act Bill. This act is seen as the most comprehensive sexual assault bill that is currently on the docket of Congress,” Schroepfer said. “We were able to acquire over 200 signatures, which may not seem like very many for a national petition, but we were at a smaller size than we currently are.”
Since Congress is on recess until Nov. 14 the SLA eventually plans to take these petitions to Capitol Hill and meet with congressional staffers. In the meantime, the network does not plan immediate action.
On the education front, the team’s Secretary of Local Educational Affairs Kamar Mack (COL ’19) lobbies with the D.C. Public School system, the D.C. City Council and the mayor’s office about local educational policy.
Mack said he is looking to advocate for more civic education to be taught in D.C. public schools.
“The project I’m working on this semester is a civic education bill, and essentially we are proposing legislation to incorporate more civic education into the D.C. public school curriculum,” Mack said.
Not all of the team’s education efforts this semester have been successful. The Hoya reported efforts to create a mentorship program with D.C. elementary schools on April 26. The team will no longer pursue this since it is a redundant effort the Center of Social Justice is already pursuing, according to Mack.
The team’s other initiatives include lobbying to maintain the federal government’s Pell Grant funding and organizing on-campus events to spread mental health awareness.
The committee receives $400 dollars in funding from GUSA, even though some students may believe otherwise, according to Jukneviciute..
“GUSA has very, very limited finances, and I think there’s a misconception where students think that GUSA has money.  Even buying pizza becomes a battle,” Jukneviciute said.
Jukneviciute said her team is working to improve perceptions of the team.
“Ultimately, you can understand your campus,” she said. “If you’re one of those people who is involved, is very social on campus and has a good feeling for the student body in general, you should be able to understand the feeling of your campus.”
Former GUSA Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) said GUSA’s youngest initiative is promising.
“Any organization is worthwhile if it’s comprised of students willing to donate countless hours to improving our community, and those who are quick to criticize but reluctant to contribute display a contemptuous ignorance that too many Hoyas consider a virtue,” Rohan said.
Correction: This article previously stated the committee is named the D.C. and Federal Relations Relations Committee; the committee is named the Federal and D.C. Relations Committee.

The next president must facilitate bipartisan compromise and cooperation to solve major issues facing the country, advocated three business and former government officials at the second annual Hariri Symposium in Lohrfink Auditorium on Tuesday.
The symposium, hosted by the Business, Society and Public Policy Initiative of the McDonough School of Business, sought to find solutions to the problems Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton or Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will face after inauguration Jan. 20.
The speakers, former Ambassador to Iceland Charles Cobb, former Senate majority leader George Mitchell (D-Maine, LAW ’61) and former District of Columbia mayor Anthony Williams identified the biggest issues the nation faces and proposed solutions for the winner of the 2016 race, while urging elected officials to try to cooperate on issues even if not every problem is solved.
Cobb, who served as CEO of the Arvida Corporation and Disney Development before serving as an ambassador under former President George W. Bush’s administration, identified five major issues facing the United States today: excessive deficit spending, growing resistance to free trade, a decaying military and fading international presence, a lack of immigration reform and a failing health care system.
Cobb said immigration policy should be focused on improving the economy rather than resettling families already in the United States, including providing longterm work permits for immigrants currently residing in the United States illegally who pay a fine, learn English and have no criminal record.
Mitchell said the country should not be closing its borders but selectively taking in immigrants.
“Common sense makes it clear that we need fair and realistic limits on how many people can enter. But we should not limit the discussion to who we want to keep out and who we want to throw out,” Mitchell said. “We must also discuss who we want to enter and how we can continue to replenish our society with new people to their benefit and to ours.”
Mitchell, whose father was an Irish orphan who worked as a janitor in a local school and whose mother was an illiterate Lebanese refugee who worked the night shift in textile mills, said ensuring access to education is key to making a fairer society.
“Because of the openness of this country I was able to get an education … and become the majority leader of the United States Senate,” Mitchell said.
Cobb said there must be a bipartisan commission to regulate government spending.
“There should be a commitment to listen and implement their suggestions,” Cobb said.
According to Cobb, the tax code should be rewritten to provide greater clarity. Cobb said the government should reduce corporate tax rates, eliminate loopholes and reform entitlements like Social Security and Medicare.
“We have entitlements for Social Security and Medicare that just don’t work anymore,” Cobb said. “It cannot survive.”
According to Mitchell, environmental policy and climate change are some of the most immediate issues facing America.
Mitchell said a significant portion of the problems facing America are the result of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case, which enabled corporations and nonprofits to make unlimited donations to political campaigns.
“The Supreme Court did not create the problem. Money and political power have always mixed, but the court has made a bad situation much worse,” Mitchell said. “The Citizens United case will go down in history as one of the worst decisions ever made by any Supreme Court in our history.”
Williams said the next president needs to focus resources on major metropolitan areas and use these areas as a base and a drawing board for ideas that can then be implemented throughout the nation.
William Sleiman (COL ’18), an attendee, said making the country more open is important in ensuring progress.
“How Mr. Mitchell talked about immigration was very moving,” Sleiman said. “How we have to continue to let people in, in order to continue the innovation in America.”
Meghan Bodette (SFS ’20) said it is important that the United States make efforts to unite following this year’s election.
“His appeal to the common story that somewhere in the history of most American families we have relatives who risked a lot to come here and who were not treated with the dignity that they might have had in their home country was very powerful,” Bodette said. “After such a contentious election we need to start reclaiming a narrative that both sides can see themselves in.”

Dating violence needs to be addressed as strongly as sexual violence on college campuses, according to D.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence Program Director Elizabeth Odongo in a discussion about dating violence in the Intercultural Center on Tuesday.
The event, cosponsored by Georgetown’s chapter of sexual assault awareness group Take Back the Night and the DCCADV, addressed ways for students and bystanders to intervene and react to instances of dating violence on campus through activities and conversations.
Sexual Assault Peer Educators member Victoria Shakespeare (SFS ’19) said while arguments are common in relationships, dating violence occurs when a specific line is crossed.
“Couples disagree on things all the time, but the way you disagree about things is different,” Shakespeare said.
Dating violence, including physical and emotional abuse, extends to stalking and domestic violence, according to Odongo.
According to “Love is Respect,” a project of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, one in three American adolescents is a victim of abuse from a dating partner. Forty-three percent of college women report dating violence and abuse early in life can have lasting effects.
Half of dating violence victims attempt suicide and are at a higher risk for substance abuse and depression, according to “Love is Respect.”
Odongo stressed the need to raise awareness around dating violence on college campuses.
“Universities are getting better and better at supporting people with sexual assault but not dating violence. They’re trying to keep it in the conversation, but we’re not spending as much time talking about dating violence statistically,” Odongo said. “More students will suffer from dating abuse than they will sexual assault on college campuses.”
Take Back the Night President Maddy Moore (SFS ’17) said it is important to recognize that dating violence can take a variety of forms.
“The conversations right now are really focused around sexual violence and the one-time incident of violence that someone might experience, and we frame it in a way that’s like happening at a party with stranger, but it’s really important to think about how this is a spectrum, and a spectrum of violence can start with anything from harassment to someone in a very serious longterm relationship experiencing patterns of abuse,” Moore said.
According to Moore, it is important to take steps to address all forms of violence.
“It’s important to reframe how we think about violence, especially when it comes to acknowledging that dating violence on college campus happens and that there are people experiencing economic, physical, psychological, emotional, sexual abuse in their relationships with their roommate, in a partnership, with maybe a close friend, and often we’re overlooking that,” Moore said.
Odongo said instinct was crucial in identifying situations of abuse.
“If you feel like something’s not right, trust your gut,” Odongo said. “A lot of the time, we can’t explain why we feel certain ways about certain people, but in my field, our gut is the most important thing.”
Odongo said the personal nature of relationships can make support from friends or family challenging, however.
“It’s absolutely up to the survivor about what happens next,” Odongo said. “There are reasons why people don’t leave abusive relationships. We have to trust that they know their relationship the best and when they’re ready, they will leave.”
Moore said she has seen a positive cultural shift in the university in discussing sexual assault and dating violence on campus.
“There’s definitely a lot more work to be done, more communities to reach and conversations to have, but I’m glad that it’s been moving forward,” Moore said.

Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority police are reviewing use of force during transit officers’ arrest of a young black woman caught on camera being pushed to the ground after bringing chips and a lollipop to the Columbia Heights Metro on Oct. 18.
The video, released by activist organization Black Lives Matter D.C., shows an unnamed 18-year-old woman enter the Metro station at 6:35 p.m. with food, which violates Metro policy. After refusing to discard her food when asked twice by WMATA police, the woman was handcuffed and pushed to the ground. Charges have not been filed by WMATA police.
WMATA spokesperson Richard Jordan said the arrest is still being evaluated by WMATA administration, which has yet to arrive at any final decisions on how to address the incident.
“[Metro Transit Police Department] is reviewing the matter, as is the case whenever there is a public concern raised,” Jordan wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The incident has raised concerns for members of the D.C. Council, including Councilmember Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), who called for an investigation of the incident last week in a letter to WMATA General Manager Paul Wiedefeld. Nadaeu referred to the incident as an excessive use of force and requested more information on WMATA police training.
“I am extremely concerned that WMATA police officers took the measures they did in detaining this young woman,” Nadeau wrote. “Please conduct an investigation into the conduct of these officers. Please also describe to me what training WMTA police undergo for de-escalation tactics.”
Arthur Spitzer, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of the Nation’s Capital, said the officers’ demonstrated excessive force. According to Spitzer, because the teenager did not present a danger to other passengers, there should have been a less forceful way to make her comply.
“The officer’s reaction was certainly excessive,” Spitzer said. “An officer should have ways to deal with uncooperative citizens that are short of taking them down to the floor and putting them in handcuffs. Especially when there are other officers nearby who can assist.”
Spitzer noted however there would not have been trouble had the woman simply followed Metro rules to begin with. Spitzer said citizens should exercise commonsense restraint when asked by officers to follow rules.
“People are not supposed to be eating on the Metro system. There are signs all over about that; people should be aware of that,” Spitzer said. “If she was a good citizen and the officer had said, ‘You’ve got to get rid of that lollipop,’ really she should have gotten rid of the lollipop.”
Spitzer said this incident is not unusual for WMATA police, and officers need to work better with young people rather than immediately resorting to force.
“We’ve had several lawsuits that we have brought against Metro officers over the years for excessive force and in particular for excessive force against juveniles,” Spitzer said. “We think that Metro needs to do a better job of training their officers to deal with people, particularly young people, and we think there’s a serious difference between a crime and a lollipop.”
Victoria Efetevbia (COL ’17), a student involved in civil rights activism, said the matter goes beyond police force and is instead indicative of the pattern of unequal treatment received by different races at the hands of Metro police.
“I feel that it’s not even an issue of excessive force, but an issue of force in general. Force should have never been used,” Efetevbia wrote in an email to The Hoya. “When white professionals cram into the Metro trains on their way to and from work with their smelly salads and bagels, they are never arrested or even fined.”
Raquel King (GRD ’16), who organized a march from Georgetown to the White House earlier this month to raise awareness for the deaths of unarmed black people, agreed the teen was breaking the rules but said the Metro police should have instead involved her parents and made the situation more positive.
“This should have been a learning experience, a teaching experience,” King said. “What I think they should have done is say, ‘I want you to stay right here. I want to call your mom and speak to her about the fact that there’s this law in place. This is a warning.”
