Budget-conscious Georgetown students will have another resource for preparing their taxes and battling other financial woes this semester other than relying on the wisdom of their parents.
Common $ense, the financial literacy program co-sponsored by the George Houston Memorial Fund, the Office of Student Financial Services and the Georgetown University Alumni & Student Federal Credit Union will be holding another semester of seminars intended to equip students with the tools necessary to navigate their own finances.
The series of interactive and engaging workshops are led by Georgetown professors, alumni and professionals who specialize in the world of finance. These workshops, the first of which is Wednesday, deal with relevant financial issues such as taxes, investing and credit and debt management.
“When a student progresses to college, [he] typically [achieves] a new level of maturity and independence. With that maturity and independence comes a level of responsibility. We’re here to help students make informed, intelligent decisions about their finances,” GUASFCU CEO Katie Cohen (COL ’12) said.
Common $ense connects students with external resources and contacts to help them with any financial issues they may encounter. The program was started in 2006 as a series of five events during the spring semester. This year, it has expanded to become a more extensive and comprehensive series by offering workshop every month since the start of the fall semester.
“Last year’s sessions marked a tremendous success as the result of a fresh marketing campaign and new website,” Cohen said.
By attending as many workshops as possible, students can accumulate skills of increasing financial complexity.
However, students are encouraged to attend any workshop they can, regardless of potential inconsistency.
“Even attending one workshop, however, is extremely instructive and informative in terms of building knowledge about personal financial management, and students can pick and choose which topics/workshops are most relevant on a personal basis,” Cohen said.

Student Workshops at Georgetown, recipient of a 2011 ReImagine Georgetown grant, launched its programming Friday in an event celebrating its mission — free workshops offered for students by students.
The team plans to hold about 10 student-led workshops, with themes ranging from ping pong to sushi making, during their inaugural semester.
Founder Christina Crisostomo (SFS ’13) said she had long been playing with the idea of creating a student education series.
“I’ve always been interested in [do it yourself] stuff. I became fixated on this idea that people with similar interests could meet up and try something completely different and new,” she said.
According to Crisostomo, the purpose of SWAG is to introduce students to their own creative energies and teach new skills while requiring a minimal commitment.
“It truly enriches the cultural life here at Georgetown,” Ambika Kumar (MSB ’14), who works on the technology team for SWAG, said.
In addition to receiving funding from the ReImagine Georgetown grant — a combined effort of Students of Georgetown, Inc., the Georgetown Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and The Hoya —Crisostomo’s idea was supported by Compass Incubators, a student-led entrepreneurship group.
After Crisostomo presented her idea to the group, Compass supplied her with a team of nine undergraduates who have helped implement the proposal.
“We all tag-team it. Although we have set titles, everyone really helps out everyone else,” MerjanBubernack (MSB ’15), who works on marketing for SWAG, said.
SWAG’s kickoff fest in Alumni Lounge focused on adding students to SWAG’s listserv while highlighting different cultural and club opportunities available at Georgetown.
While the idea has gotten off the ground, members say they still have a lot to do to  ensure that the organization becomes cemented in campus life, such as the development of a new website and programming.
“We are really looking into making sure the idea for the club is sustainable, with an eye toward the future,” Sean Foley (MSB ’15), a SWAG development manager, said.
Crisostomo said she is confident that the group’s workshops will be successful.
“I was a part of Flip Dis Funk Dat my freshman year, and we would have these days of workshops where everyone kind of let their guard down. It was really silly and really fun. I always remembered that experience, and I know this is something that can really happen,” Crisostomo said.

Although the university’s recycling program has made significant gains since the implementation of a series of initiatives in 2008, key areas for improvement remain.
At January’s monthly Advisory Neighborhood Commission meeting, Councilmember Jeff Jones estimated that residents of ANC 2E, the district that includes Georgetown University, recycle only 25 percent of recyclable material.
However, Georgetown’s recycling program has dramatically improved over the last few years. According to the Sustainability Office’s website, a record-high 45 percent of total waste was recycled in 2010, marking a tripling of the 2007 level.
Additionally, only 15 percent of all waste on the Main Campus ends up in a landfill, demonstrating the university’s pursuit of a zero-landfill policy. The remainder is largely incinerated and converted into electricity.
According to the Sustainability Office, the recycling initiatives implemented in 2008, which resulted in the hiring of a manager and support staff specifically responsible for campus recycling, have been instrumental in updating sustainability practices. The staff has also placed recycling bins close to trash bins to encourage the Georgetown community to dispose of waste responsibly.
Megan Griffin (COL ’14), president of the student group EcoAction, said the sustainability practices of Georgetown students could still be improved.
“I don’t think students are making the most of recycling opportunities on campus,” she wrote in an email. “Many students probably don’t realize just how much Georgetown is equipped to recycle.”
Griffin attributed the deficiency in student recycling to a lack of student awareness, though the university holds events such as the Switch It Off Challenge and participates in the national Recyclemania competition designed to popularize its conservation efforts.
“If Georgetown educated its students on the recycling opportunities on campus, we could take better advantage of the system in place,” she wrote. “I think Georgetown could do more to create an environment where sustainability comprises an important part of the student culture.”

The Student Life Report Committee presented recommendations for improving campus engagement at a press conference Sunday.
“Over the last five months we’ve sought out what we like to think of as the limitless upside of student happiness on campus,” Report Committee Chair Shuo Yan Tan (SFS ’12) said.
According to the report’s Editor-in-Chief Matt Hoyt (COL ’12), the Student Life Report investigates aspects of student organization advisory boards as well as intellectual and student life from a qualitative and quantitative perspective.
The document, which is still in draft form, is slated to be finished and released within the next two weeks. It is the first comprehensive report about student life completed since 1999.
According to Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12), the report is intended to help provide a better framework for how student money is allocated. It offers suggestions for improving five student advisory boards, including the Student Activities Commission, the Center for Social Justice, the Advisory Board for Club Sports, the Media Board, the Performing Arts Advisory Council and the Georgetown Program Board, as well as various recommendations for institutional and intellectual improvement.
Many of these recommendations call for expansion of student space, improved transparency among the funding boards and better centralization of information.
The report also includes more specific recommendations, such as combining What’s After Dark andGPB into one group and moving the Lecture Fund under the purview of GPB.
The committee also analyzed data from questionnaires including the Senior Survey, Enrolled Student Survey and Civic Engagement Survey. Based on this analysis, the committee suggested that there is a positive relationship between engagement in Georgetown-related activities and student satisfaction. The called for an investigation into students who do little to engage in activities on campus through surveys, focus groups or other initiatives.
The 1999 Student Life Report, which primarily addressed student space, funding and bureaucracy, has been used as the outlining document for initiatives to address relevant issues on campus for over 10 years. Implementations of the plan’s recommendations include an online system for student groups to request classroom space, the provision of free movie screenings by the Georgetown Program Board and the creation of the Advisory Board for Club Sports.
The suggestion of a new student space to expand upon that offered in the Leavey Center, an integral part of the report, had not been addressed until the decision was made to renovate the New South Student Center, a plan that was drafted last semester.
Hoyt said he was surprised to discover that members of the Advisory Board for Club Sports felt that their needs and interests were often overlooked in favor of Georgetown’s intramural sports.
“People very involved [in club sports] felt alienated and were a distant second in priorities in the eyes of the university and [Yates Field House],” he said.
The committee has recommended expanding club sport teams’ access to student space and hiring a full-time staff member to support club sports.
To research the issues tackled in the report, GUSA members and volunteers traveled to college campuses, including Stanford, American and William and Mary Universities to study those institutions and their framework for campus life.
The Student Life Report Committee listed William and Mary’s A Cappella Council and Stanford undergraduates’ complete control over their student activities funds as noteworthy aspects of other colleges. Georgetown’s Center for Social Justice stood out when compared to similar organizations at other universities.
“[CSJ is] way ahead of the field and will only get better,” Tan said.
The committee is currently seeking feedback on the report from various campus organizations before the final document is publicly released.
GUSA hopes to meet with University President John J. DeGioia in the coming weeks discuss the report.

Ten months after the certification of their union, workers for Georgetown University Dining Services and their employer,Aramark Higher Education, have tentatively agreed upon a three-year employment contract.
The contract agreement reached Tuesday between Aramark and the negotiating committee is subject to the approval of the union, which is comprised of workers in O’Donovan Hall, the Jesuit Residence, Cosi, Starbucks and the Pre-Clinical Science Building’s Dr. Mug. Members of the union will meet in the coming weeks to discuss the proposed contract.
The agreement includes significant gains for the employees, including a 50-cent-per-hour wage increase for each of the three years. Aramark has also agreed to cover 80 percent of employees’ healthcare costs for the next two years and 85 percent during the third year of the contract.
Samuel Geaney-Moore (SFS ’12), who has been involved in assisting Leo’s employees, believed that last week’s lunchtime demonstration by union members was an important part of moving negotiations along.
“I think the recent demonstration in the cafeteria was essential in showing [Aramark] that the workers are united and [have] significant support from the student body,” he said.
Leo’s employee and negotiation committee member Tarshea Smith said she was grateful to the students involved in the demonstration and those who supported the formation of the union last spring.
“I think the students played a big role in us getting together. If the students weren’t behind us, I don’t think the negotiating committee would have been as strong,” she said.
Smith added that last week’s demonstration was particularly significant because all of the Leo’s managers happened to be on site, which rarely occurs.
“They must have called the negotiators at Aramark and said to them, ‘These people aren’t playing around,'” she said.
The university reacted positively to the news, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr.
“We are pleased that Aramark and the union worked collaboratively to reach an agreement that honors Georgetown University’s just employment policy,” she wrote in an email.
