Georgetown University administrators launched a $400,000 Reconciliation Fund nearly three years after committing to create the fund to benefit descendants of the 314 enslaved people whom the Maryland Jesuits sold in 1838 to financially uphold the university, commonly referred to as the GU272+. 
In an Oct. 26 announcement, the university announced the new fund, which will provide $200,000 worth of grants twice a year for community-based research projects impacting descendants of the GU272+. Both organizations and individuals can apply. Contributions from over 500 university graduates and members of the Georgetown community will help support the fund. 
While the fund will prioritize projects benefiting the descendants of the GU272+, the university will also accept applications for projects that seek to engage with descendant communities related to those held by Jesuit slaveholders throughout the U.S. 
The Board of Directors of the GU272 Descendants Association, a nonprofit organization committed to commemorating the 314 enslaved people that the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus sold in 1838, said they are grateful that the Reconciliation fund has come to fruition. 
“The Descendants of Jesuit enslavement believe the Reconciliation Fund is a valuable part of a much needed response for truth, healing, reconciliation, and atonement,” the GU272 Descendants Association wrote to The Hoya. “Descendants hope that the leadership displayed by GU students and supported by the University will be an example of what can happen at all Jesuit Colleges and Universities.”
The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) held a referendum in April 2019, in which 66.1% of students voted in favor of establishing a $27.20 semesterly fee that would go toward a fund to benefit descendants of the GU272+. Following the student referendum, in October 2019, Georgetown failed to incorporate the fee but announced its intentions to form an initiative supporting community-based projects related to the GU272+. 
GUSA members organized a petition in December urging the university to deliver on their promise to establish this fund, prompting a university spokesperson to announce the fund would be launched in Spring 2022. 
Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) acknowledged the collective efforts of alumni, community members, students and descendents to help create the fund.
“The Reconciliation Fund represents a new stage in our work to understand and respond to our University’s historical role in the enslavement of people of African descent and fulfills a commitment we made to our community in 2019, following an undergraduate student referendum,” DeGioia wrote in an email to community members.  
Nile Blass (COL ’22), who served as Georgetown University Student Association President from Spring 2021 to Spring 2022, said she can’t predict the impact of the fund until the community begins to hear from descendants. 
“Ultimately, the ‘adequacy’ of the fund is not determined by anyone other than the descendant community,” Blass wrote to The Hoya. “Though stakeholders like students and alumni obviously play an important role, they will (and should) always be secondary.”
According to the GU272 Descendants Association, student activism on campus was crucial to the formation and implementation of the fund. 
“We, the Board of Directors of the GU272 Descendants Association are extremely grateful to the student body of Georgetown University,” the GU272 Descendants Association wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “It has been their leadership and activism, over the past seven years that has helped expose to Descendants and the public the Georgetown and Jesuit legacy of slaveholding.”
Applications for community-based projects will be reviewed by the Students Awards Committee and the Descendant Advisory Committee, which will provide a recommendation to the university regarding the projects and programs to receive funding. The Georgetown University Review Board — made up of university administrators — will be responsible for reviewing these recommendations and determining which projects will earn funding. 
Zac Colon (GRD ’26), the Vice Chair of the Student Awards Committee, said the committee developed the application questions and the scoring rubrics with input from bi-weekly meetings with the Descendant Advisory Committee. 
The five-section application asks applicants how their projects will impact the descendant community, how much funding they will need and how they will measure the success of the intended outcomes of their projects. All students interested in applying for the fund must submit applications by Nov. 25, and they will hear back from the university in December. The application cycle for Spring 2023 will open in January. 
Colon said it may take many years to fully recognize whether the Reconciliation Fund achieves its goal of benefitting descendant communities. 
“It is hard to judge the Reconciliation Fund in the early stages,” Colon wrote to The Hoya. “This is a sensitive topic to many students and community members around the country, so it is up to the Awards Committee to continue to find ways to broaden our outreach to descendant communities and make sure this committee does its job with due diligence. It will require continued student input and support.”
Colon said the Reconciliation Fund is a long-term project that he hopes will lift descendant communities and is a necessary first step for the university to take to acknowledge its history of slavery. 
“This is a long-term project at Georgetown, it will take many years to fully forgive the University’s history of slavery, but it’s a necessary first step,” Colon wrote. “We need to make sure that this is not an empty gesture. We need to make sure that these organizations succeed long term.” 
For Blass, key questions still remain regarding the fund.
“I think two huge questions remain — will the functioning fund operate as is presented by the administration? And does the Descendant Association fully represent the broader descendant community’s wants and needs?” Blass wrote. “Either way, if descendants do not feel valued or seen by this measure, it is inherently inadequate.”

Georgetown University is offering a new undergraduate certificate in South Asian studies following years of student and faculty advocacy for an expansion of programming covering the subcontinent. 
In order to receive the certificate, students must take six courses reflecting a comprehensive study of South Asia, take a research seminar course on Asian Studies in their senior fall and demonstrate facility in a language indigenous to South Asia either through the university or an approved third party service for languages the university does not offer proficiency tests for. Any undergraduate student who has already met or plans to meet the requirements can pursue the certificate starting this year. 
Professors and students in the Asian Studies program, the GU South Asian Society (SAS) and the SFS Academic Council (SFSAC) collaborated to make the certificate a reality, meeting over the summer and throughout the beginning of the Fall 2022 semester, according to Professor Yukhi Tajima, who has served as director of the Asian Studies program since July 2022.
The certificate comes after multiple years of student advocacy, most recently in the form of a petition written by Nikash Harapanahalli (SFS ’24), Suhani Garg (SFS ’23) and Shevani Tewari (SFS ’24) that received over 250 signatures in Spring 2022.
Harapanahalli — president of the SAS and academic co-chair of the Asian Studies program — helped develop the certificate and said getting it operationalized was a community endeavor that firmly asserts the place South Asians and South Asian Studies have at Georgetown.
“This is a chance for me, for the first time in my life, to receive a unique confirmation of my study of South Asia,” Harapanahalli said in an interview with The Hoya. “For me personally, this represents the collation and physicalization of my community’s dreams, my dreams, to finally be able to study this.”
Tajima said the certificate will bolster Georgetown’s coverage of South Asian studies and build community around the study of the subcontinent.
“It is important for the Asian Studies Program to expand beyond its historical strengths in Northeast Asia with more offerings on South and Southeast Asian studies,” Tajima wrote to The Hoya. “South, Southeast, and Northeast Asia are all important and dynamic regions in their own right and are also all intimately connected to each other in their shared histories and destinies.”
Garg said the certificate reflects the impact student advocacy can have, though the process takes time.
“It shows that students can take control of what they’re learning at Georgetown and make demands of the university in order to be able to get the kind of education and experience that all students deserve,” Garg told The Hoya. “Hopefully as more of these campaigns and advocacy happen, not just for South Asian Studies but throughout the university, there will come a time where it’s an efficient and faster process.”
SFS professors voted to approve a certificate in South Asian studies in 2017, but it was not operationalized until this semester. Tajima discovered the certificate after Harapanahalli and Ali-Caccamo approached him with a petition for a South Asian Studies certificate at the beginning of the Fall semester and said the delay in rolling it out likely stemmed from a lack of sufficient language offerings at the university at the time, which have since expanded to include Hindi and Urdu. 
After Tajima found the 2017 certificate, which was nearly identical to the certificate the team had created together, SFSAC President Adrian Ali-Caccamo (SFS ’24) said the team shifted their focus from the logistics of getting it approved to effective implementation.
“From there, we obviously did not have to go through the bureaucratic processes anymore,” Ali-Caccamo said. “With help from members of the Academic Council, with members from South Asian society, we worked to strategize on communications for this new certificate.”
The certificate marks a step in the right direction, but to accurately depict South Asia requires an expansion of class offerings on South Asian religions and languages, according to Harapanahalli.
“We need to represent the entire region and all of its regards to vibrancy and diversity,” Harapanahalli said. “South Asian students at Georgetown have a right to study their heritage. They have a right to understand their past so they can make a better present to forge an even better future.”
Professor Shareen Joshi, a scholar of development economics with a focus on South Asia, said Georgetown must offer a broader set of courses taught by faculty with knowledge of the subcontinent in order to sufficiently support students pursuing the certificate.
“It is very important for the School of Foreign Service to ensure that the curriculum is coherent, academically rigorous, rich in variety, and most of all, sustainable for years to come,” Joshi wrote. “We need to see real experts, with the best possible academic credentials as well as rich lived experience in South Asia teaching in this program and mentoring our students outside the classroom.”
A university spokesperson said the certificate is part of an ongoing commitment to making Georgetown’s coverage of the subcontinent more comprehensive.
“Through this addition, our Asian Studies program recognizes the need to deepen engagement with the South Asia region,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “We continue to actively work on efforts to expand our course offerings, convenings and opportunities to understand the critical importance of South Asia to global affairs.”
Harapanahalli said he hopes students will use the momentum from the new certificate and continue to advocate for South Asia through events like the South Asia Speaker Series, a project of the Asian Studies program that aims to bring South Asian speakers to campus to discuss topics relevant to the subcontinent.
“It is my sincerest hope that underclassmen not only take this but make it bigger and make it brighter and make it better,” Harapanahalli said. “We can only go up from here.”

A team of students performed traditional South Asian dance at Vice President Kamala Harris’ Washington, D.C. residence for a celebration of Diwali on Oct. 21.
Guzaarish, a competitive Bollywood fusion dance team composed of 23 Georgetown University students, performed four different types of dance for an audience of over 100 politicians, actors and other prominent members of the South Asian community including Charithra Chandran, who plays Edwina Sharma in the hit Netflix series “Bridgerton” and U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy. 
Harris, the first person of South Asian descent to serve as U.S. Vice President, hosted the event to celebrate Diwali, a Hindu religious festival also known as the Festival of Lights. 
Rishma Vora (SFS ’23), who helped found Guzaarish in 2019 and served as captain for three years, said the performance was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the team, who competed nationally for the first time in Spring 2022.
“It was like this insane dream that we didn’t even know we had,” Vora told The Hoya. “It really means a lot for a South Asian person to be able to have this experience.”
The team also got to mingle with guests at the event after their performance, according to Vora.
“Charithra Chandran actually came up to us and told us that she was so happy that we danced to a song in her native language,” Vora said. “It was surreal to be around all of them.”
Vora said a close friend of the team recommended Guzaarish to the Vice President as soon as she expressed interest in finding Bollywood dancers to perform at the celebration. Just nine days before the event, Vora received a call confirming Guzaarish would be performing. 
Guzaarish Finance Captain Druhi Dangi (MSB ’25) said the team’s four-minute performance included several different styles of dance: Raas, a traditional Indian folk dance; Bhangra, a popular Punjabi folk dance; Bollywood, a theatrical fusion dance; and Kuthu, a South Asian folk dance. A group of youth dancers from the Taal Academy of Dance, a D.C.-based Indian dance company, performed after Guzaarish.
Guzaarish usually dances to mixes of traditional South Asian music with Western songs, but event organizers said they wanted the team to take a more traditional approach for their Diwali performance, according to Vora. 
“We took what was already within our repertoire and changed some of the songs around,” Vora said. “For example, we took our Bollywood piece that was a mix between the song ‘Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!’ and a South Asian song and we ended up having the same choreo to a different South Asian song.”
Harris’ team invited Dangi and two other members of the executive board, Logistics and Operations Captain Ruhie Rapolu (COL ’25) and Choreography Captain Prisha Punjabi (COL ’25), to visit Harris’ residence two days before the event to see the space where the team would be performing. 
Preparations for the performance coincided with deadlines to submit audition videos for competitions taking place in Spring 2023, so the team could only rehearse once for the show, according to Dangi. 
Punjabi said the team rehearsed together until 2 a.m. to perfect their routine the night before the performance.
“We had a five-and-a-half-hour practice that night,” Punjabi said. “Usually our practices don’t go that long, but because it was such an important thing, everyone was super excited to practice and the morale was really high.”
After the performance, the team got to meet, speak with and take photos with Harris, who gave motivational remarks to the performers and encouraged the team to continue to take pride in their heritage. The team also joined the rest of the guests in a sparkler ceremony, a popular tradition celebrating the festival of lights, outside Harris’ home. 
Vora said the performance was a success and reflected a culmination of years-long commitment to the club for seniors on the team, who helped start Guzaarish in their first year on the Hilltop.
“It’s just an incredibly proud moment as Georgetown students, as South Asian students, to be able to have been inside of the vice president’s residence and meet her and share something we work and practice nine hours a week for,” Vora said. “We really are dedicated and passionate about what we do and to have been able to share that on such an important stage was everything we could have asked for and more.”

With early voting for the 2022 midterm elections in Washington, D.C., beginning Oct. 31 in advance of Election Day on Nov. 8, The Hoya has compiled a comprehensive profile of the candidates running for Mayor and D.C. Council’s At-Large seats. 
While the D.C. Council seat for Ward 2, which contains Georgetown University’s campus, is not up for election during the 2022 cycle, voters will also cast their ballots on Initiative 82, which would change D.C.’s tipped wage rule and raise the minimum wage for workers who receive tips to the District-wide rate of $16.10.
Mayor
Incumbent Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), who was first elected in 2014 and then re-elected in 2018, is running for what would become her third term as Mayor, and would become only second mayor to hold the office for three consecutive terms. 
In the Democratic primary last June, Bowser’s moderate stances allowed her to succeed over the more progressive views of Councilmember Robert White (D-At-Large), who finished second in the race with 40.5% of the vote. 
Bowser has been campaigning on her success with the overall recovery of D.C. following the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as developments in health care and housing projects in the District. 
Key components of Bowser’s agenda for her next term include expanding affordable housing, improving D.C. public schools and investing in social programs Bowser believes will decrease street violence, while also arguing for expanding the police force. Bowser is also a firm advocate for D.C. statehood, and promises to maintain her commitment to the goal in her third term.
According to data collected by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve from 1960 to 2018, there is no clear correlation between increased spending on policing and a decrease in crime.
Bowser has also been endorsed by several labor unions, The Washington Post and Emily’s List, an organization that funds pro-choice female candidates. 
Republican challenger Stacia Hall, a small business owner from Ward 3, will look to take down the incumbent Bowser after being the only GOP candidate to announce a run for mayor. Hall is a firm supporter of expanding policing activity, and believes that stronger police training programs will be one of the best solutions to deterring crime in the District. 
Hall has said police must work closely with communities they are located in to ensure that residents feel safe when they are around. According to a 2018 report, just 54% of D.C. residents agree the police do a good job to support their community in the District, with lower numbers for Black residents and residents of low-income wards. 
Citing her experience as a businesswoman, Hall hopes to promote economic growth following the pandemic by investing in small businesses.
According to Hall, changes she hopes to make to better balance the District’s budget will tackle infrastructure issues and WMATA delays that residents frequently endure. As an outsider to politics, Hall plans to work as a team player with the largely Democratic D.C. Council when working on policy. 
Entertainment executive and comedian Rodney Grant is running as an independent for Mayor. Grant is hoping to make crime prevention a top priority if elected, and like Bowser and Hall, he also plans to expand the D.C. police force. 
Grant believes better youth programming may prevent the spikes of juvenile crime seen in D.C. in recent years, and improving funding in the District’s violence prevention program, especially those focusing on mental health and deescalation, which he believes will decrease crime in the District. Grant also hopes to work on street safety, reducing traffic fatalities and reconstructing the traffic ticket system. 
Grant is also campaigning on increasing funding to revitalize small businesses following the pandemic, as well as better allocating funding towards affordable housing for D.C. residents. As an entertainer himself, Grant wants to expand the role of the film, music, sports and tech industries in the District as well.
Libertarian Dennis Sobin first ran for D.C. mayor 40 years ago. Now, the 79-year-old is running for D.C.’s highest office once again, despite his turbulent career that involves prison time for fraud and child pornography charges, and other failed political campaigns.  Sobin wants to fully legalizing drugs and sex work. 
D.C. Council At-Large
Incumbent Councilmember At-Large Elissa Silverman (I) is running for her third term since first being elected in 2014. In the D.C. Council, Silverman has served as a member of the Council Labor Committee and has been working to expand paid leave and increase minimum wage for District residents. 
Silverman wants to improve D.C. street safety, and supports a well-trained police department and funding violence interrupter programs. 
Silverman also wants to increase funding for low-income housing and expand programs that support housing payments for seniors on fixed incomes. Silverman hopes to allocate more funding for schools, especially those with students coming from high-poverty neighborhoods.
Current At-Large Council member and Chair of the Housing Committee Anita Bonds (D) is also running for reelection, and has held the position since 2012. Bonds wants to expand home ownership opportunities in the District by improving investments in affordable housing. 
Bonds also wants to ensure that there is greater communication between D.C. lawmakers and leaders of each D.C. ward.
Attorney Karim Marshall (I) is running in his first bid for Councilmember At-Large. Marshall hopes to significantly improve the education resources provided by the D.C. government to public schools by advancing equity-based funding, expanding tutoring programs, and funding essential school staff like counselors, psychologists and nurses.
Marshall wants to tackle the root cause of violence in the District in areas such as mental health, drug addiction and generational poverty by enhancing community-based violence prevention programs and expanding mental health crisis resources. 
Marshall also wants to make the D.C. housing market more accessible for individuals of all backgrounds and income levels. Marshall also promises to make the city itself a more environmentally-friendly place to live by cutting emissions in public transportation and making composting more accessible.
Air Force Veteran and businessman Fred Hill (I), who formerly served as chief division manager at the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development, wants to prioritize public safety by restructuring the police department, EMS and emergency call center. 
Hill is also focused on poverty reduction in the District, and plans to work with the Council to create programs that will reduce unemployment and make housing in the District more affordable.
Current Ward 5 Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie (I) decided to run a last-minute Independent bid for an At-Large seat. McDuffie suspended his race for Attorney General after election officials ruled he was ineligible for the job given that he is not currently an actively engaged attorney. McDuffie’s key public safety policies include removing barriers to affordable housing, preventing juvenile crime and creating a more transparent police department with the use of body cameras. 
McDuffie also wants to expand economic opportunity in the District by increasing grant funding for small businesses and supporting minority entrepreneurs. 
Retired professor David Schwartzman (G) is a strong environmental justice advocate who wants to see a Green New Deal implemented in D.C. He wants to focus on reducing gaps in income, achievement, life expectancy and health equity that exist in different parts of the District by amending the budget. 
Health executive Graham McLaughlin (I) wants to reform the D.C. jail using therapeutic rehabilitation and creating safer roads for cyclists and pedestrians. McLaughlin is also campaigning on a platform to lower homeownership barriers by building more affordable housing in the District and better regulating unnecessary spending in the District’s budget. 
Navy reservist Giuseppe Niosi (R) is prioritizing improvements to public safety, increased support for local businesses, and protection of school choice, a policy that allows families to choose their child’s education site. Niosi is also hoping to reform D.C. government spending and remove red tape for local businesses. 
Initiative 82 – Tipped Wage
Initiative 82 has the potential to significantly change the dining and serving experience in the District. Initiative 82 would require employers to pay their employees the District’s minimum wage of $16.10, a rate that would increase gradually until it would be fully in place by 2027. Under current tipped-wage rules, employers pay employees a minimum wage of $5.35 and must cover the rest of the District-wide minimum wage only if employees do not earn the remainder in tips. 
Critics have argued Initiative 82 may cause a decline in tips for servers, something they say  could cause businesses to suffer economic loss or cause them to close. Others argue the bill will help support low-income workers who are in need of increased wages, also arguing that oftentimes employers do not reallocate tips into the employee’s total earnings.

This is Dennis Sobin, Libertarian Candidate for Mayor. Thanks for your article about my police arrests and imprisonment for speaking out on behalf of sexual rights and other lifestyle minorities. Indeed I have been arrest almost as many times as Martin Luther King, with whom I once worked. He was no sexphobic. Thank you again.

The Georgetown Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues hosted a discussion on China’s economic strategy and its implications for domestic politics. 
David Steinberg, an associate professor of International Political Economy at Johns Hopkins University, spoke on his research about how China’s rising global economic influence impacts support for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the country at the Oct. 21 event. Steinberg’s presentation focused on his team’s three-year-long experiment that surveyed the Chinese public in 2019, 2021 and 2022 to gauge the popularity of China’s major economic projects. 
Though many studies have been conducted on China’s growing economy, Steinberg said a lack of existing literature on the political consequences of this development inspired his research. 
“There has been extensive debate about how China’s rise in general, and its growing economic influence in particular, is reshaping world politics and economics,” Steinberg wrote to The Hoya. “We suspected that these developments also have important political impacts within China itself, and we wanted to see if that was the case.” 
Steinberg said nations hoping to accumulate greater political power often use economic success to gain legitimacy on the international stage. 
“Rising powers have generally sought to expand their role in global economic governance, and of course, China is no exception to this,” Steinberg said at the event. “China has gone historically from being a recipient of foreign aid to a provider of foreign aid.” 
The Belt and Road Initiative, a multibillion dollar investment by Chinese President Xi Jinping to connect Asia, Africa and Europe by land and sea routes, is one example of China’s attempt to secure economic dominance, according to Steinberg. 
Steinberg also surveyed the Chinese population on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a Beijing-based lending program that finances Asian infrastructure projects, and China’s foreign vaccine distribution efforts during the pandemic. 
These displays of economic strength commonly correlate with increased trust in the government, according to Steinberg.
“There’s evidence suggesting that when the population is more optimistic about the economy, both in democracies and authoritarian regimes, this tends to boost support for the incumbent,” Steinberg said. 
For his experiment, Steinberg created three separate versions of a survey assessing popular support of the CCP that depicted China’s economic expansion projects as either successful, unsuccessful or neutral. 
Participants who received a survey mentioning the failures of these initiatives tended to rate their support for China’s global economic expansion 0.7 points lower than control respondents on a 10-point scale.
Steinberg said this change may seem negligible, but it actually holds significance considering that Chinese citizens have largely only been exposed to state-controlled media that paints the government and its investments in a positive light. 
“They’re consuming national media, which, yes, there are some more critical portrayals of these programs in the Chinese media, but I bet you have 99 positive articles for every negative one,” Steinberg said. “There’s sort of an existing sense that these have been overwhelmingly successful programs.”
Steinberg said one explanation for his findings is that a strong economy fosters citizens’ pride in their national identity and thus bolsters public support for the government. 
“People might think about a country’s global economic influence as telling you something about the status of the nation in world politics,” Steinberg said. “The people that identify with the Chinese nation as a relevant identity group see that the nation-state is playing a larger role and would view that as a sort of positive for status or self esteem.” 
Steinberg said he is confident China’s ability to manipulate public support using economic strategy will influence their political choices moving forward. 
“It sure seems like this will matter,” Steinberg wrote. “The initial signs seem to suggest that Chinese foreign policy will take on an even more assertive stance than beforehand.”

A professor of management and business administration has released a new book highlighting frameworks for implementing racial diversity, equity and inclusion in corporate workplaces. 
Georgetown University McDonough School of Business (MSB) Professor Ella Washington’s “The Necessary Journey: Making Real Progress on Equity and Inclusion” is set for release on Nov. 8. The book provides frameworks for corporate organizations to achieve meaningful racial equity and inclusion in their workplace. Washington explores this topic by profiling different companies with stories of failure and success, such as Slack, Best Buy and PwC.
Following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, corporate interest in DEI greatly increased. Although many companies made promises to implement racial equity initiatives, Washington noted in her book that many of these organizations did not know how to proceed in fulfilling them. Her research found them struggling to make long-term advancements that are not just limited to their initial verbal support.
Washington said these observations inspired her to provide resources in the book that would allow corporations to follow through on important DEI initiatives.  
“As I continued supporting organizations in wrestling with DEI, I found a great need that many organizations shared: The need to understand the arc of DEI and how they could best position themselves to pursue meaningful and lasting change,” Washington wrote to The Hoya. “Combining my passion for research and my tactical approach to DEI, I set out to create a framework that would invigorate an organization’s DEI Journey, one that I think is a Necessary Journey for all organizations.”
As an organizational psychologist and DEI expert, Washington drew from her own professional experiences and Ph.D. work to research for her book. She also explored case studies with the DEI journeys of clients and partners in various industries. For example, Washington examined Denny’s, where, after recieving several discrimination lawsuits, the company was able to take a top-down approach in addressing DEI and turning around their reputation. 
According to Washington, her research revealed that DEI initiatives have to be specific to any given organization.
“Although I went into the book with the intention of highlighting the numerous types of DEI journeys various organizations have had, getting the chance to really dig into these organizations and really look under the hood was a privilege,” Washington wrote. “It really confirmed the truth that the Journey is neither linear nor the same for any two organizations.”
Paul Almeida, dean of the MSB, said Washington’s work exemplifies the school’s mission of promoting DEI initiatives. 
“Ella is a shining example of how Georgetown McDonough uses innovative research to solve today’s critical challenges,” Almeida wrote to The Hoya. “Her research in the field of diversity, equity, and inclusion provides actionable steps for leaders as they navigate important conversations within their companies. We hope Ella’s book encourages many more organizations and leaders to work toward achieving true inclusion.”
Joshua Datz (MSB ’26) said he appreciates the ways in which MSB professors are inspiring their students with the real-world business initiatives they are leading. 
“It’s pretty exciting to be in an environment where I can learn from faculty that offer alternative perspectives on the role of business in society,” Datz wrote to The Hoya. “I appreciate that members of the MSB’s faculty are integrating important societal issues into the curriculum and, in effect, preparing students to have a positive impact through business.”
Washington said the book demonstrates why an inclusive workplace is an important ideal for employees and companies alike.
“At the core, I want people to embrace and explore the idea of the workplace utopia because that concept can be the north star for strong DEI work,” Washington wrote. “When organizations are able to create a clear image around what they want their workplace to look and feel like — and they are able to do so with feedback from employees, they stand a great chance at creating a strong inclusive environment.”

The first urgent care center in Ward 8 opened on Oct. 10 as part of a multi-step plan to improve access to quality, timely health care for residents of Wards 7 and 8. 
Cedar Hill Urgent Care provides comprehensive urgent care to all District residents and is operated by the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences and Universal Health Services, a leading provider of hospital and health care services in the United States. The new urgent care center was built in an effort to serve the predominantly Black community living in Wards 7 and 8, which have lower life expectancies than communities in D.C. wards with predominantly white residents. 
Christine Searight, George Washington University Hospital’s Strategic Marketing director, said Ward 8 residents have historically lacked access to a variety of health care resources.
GW Health hopes the opening of Cedar Hill Urgent Care will remedy this inequity by making quality critical care more accessible to those living in Ward 8, according to Searight. 
“Over the past several years, we have been partnering with the Government of the District of Columbia to create a comprehensive healthcare system to better meet the needs of our region,” Searight wrote to the Hoya. “Opening Cedar Hill Urgent Care was the next step in creating a robust academic medical network which will enhance access, equity and outcomes in D.C., particularly within Wards 7 and 8.” 
According to Searight, Cedar Hill will give residents in Wards 7 and 8 access to timely care, as they will not have to travel to other wards to receive care. 
“Instead of visiting a hospital ER for everyday illnesses, a patient can visit an urgent care for faster service,” Searight wrote. “Our goal with creating this comprehensive network is to allow individuals to get the right care, at the right time and in the right location.” 
Expected to treat around 8,800 patients in its first year of opening, Cedar Hill has the capacity to handle a variety of emergencies including allergic reactions, broken bones, sinus infections and urinary tract infections. The health center will also be equipped to conduct basic lab work and X-ray imaging. 
Searight said GW Medical Faculty Associates will provide emergency care for adult patients and medical professionals from Children’s National Hospital will provide emergency care to pediatric patients.
The creation of Cedar Hill Urgent Care is part of the District’s larger plan to establish a comprehensive health care system to serve the residents of Wards 7 and 8. Once complete, the system will include two urgent care facilities, an ambulatory center for outpatient care and the new Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center, GW Health, for which construction has already begun.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), who was present at the opening of Cedar Hill Urgent Care, said the center is a step in the right direction for bridging the health equity gap in the District, according to an Oct. 7 press release from the Mayor’s Office.
“It is not just about building one hospital — it is about the entire health care system,” Bowser said in the press release. “This new urgent care is a critical piece of that system.”
Searight said there is more work to be done to improve health care accessibility in Wards 7 and 8. 
“Our goal is to continue to develop a comprehensive health care system which provides more options to prospective patients,” Searight said.

A new vice president for student affairs will join Georgetown University at the beginning of 2023, serving as the culmination of a year-long search process to fill the role.
The university announced Oct. 22 that Eleanor Daugherty will assume the position Jan. 10, 2023, after nearly eight years serving as the associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students at the University of Connecticut. While the university conducted its national search to fill the vice president position, Jeanne Lord served as the interim vice president of student affairs. Prior to Lord, Todd Olson held the position for 19 years before departing in July 2021.
Daugherty said she hopes students will show her Georgetown through their own eyes and personal experiences, allowing her to better understand campus culture and student life.
“Georgetown is special and has been special for hundreds of years, and making sure my greatest priority is to immerse myself in that culture and understand that culture and then emerge as a leader is going to be very important to me,” Daugherty said in an interview with The Hoya. “So I think you’re gonna see a lot of me around campus, both in professional attire and Uggs late at night, and that’s exactly how it should be.”
University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) said Daugherty has a strong understanding of the student experience after many years working in higher education that will enable her to support students at Georgetown. 
“For more than two decades, Dr. Daugherty has engaged in all aspects of student life from admissions to advising as well as alumni relations at multiple institutions,” DeGioia wrote in a statement shared with The Hoya. “She shares a deep knowledge of the student experience and unwavering care for students’ well-being.”
Rosemary Kilkenny, Georgetown’s Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity who served as co-chair of the search committee, said Lord’s work as interim vice president helped  Georgetown throughout the pandemic.
“Not only has she paved the way for a smooth transition for our new Vice President of Student Affairs, she has also supported countless students and colleagues as we have navigated through the COVID-19 pandemic and a new school year,” Kilkenny wrote in a statement shared with The Hoya. 
Daugherty said her experience at the University of Connecticut showed her the importance of being a figure who others can trust in uncertain times, and she hopes to become a person that Georgetown students can trust as well.
“I think there is a deep and sincere love for students that Georgetown has that has resonated with me deeply throughout this process,” Daugherty said. “And I look forward to approaching my work with that same love.”
Daugherty said throughout her career, she has sought to embrace students as whole, multifaceted and complex people, rather than just seeing them as smart students. 
Daugherty said she decided to accept her new position at Georgetown because the university reflects her values.
“And so the university that I care for is the university that shares that commitment to students, and that outlook on students as a whole person, not a perfect person, and a student who is trusting us with one of the most important times of their lives,” Daugherty said. 
The first step she will take to embrace diversity and inclusion on campus is to listen to the stories of the students on campus, Daugherty said. 
“After we establish those points of connection, we’re really able to cultivate, bring those identities into our sense of community and have a sense of being a Georgetown community,” Daugherty said. “And that’s where I start.”
Ricardo Ortiz, an English professor at Georgetown who co-chaired the search to fill the position, said Daugherty’s integrity and experience will allow her to relate to and work with members of the Georgetown community.
“In Elly Daugherty, Georgetown students will find an ally who listens, an ally who cares and an ally who leads,” Ortiz wrote in a statement shared with The Hoya. “The Georgetown community in general can look forward to welcoming, and working with, a new member with an impressive record of professional accomplishment, integrity, and collaboration.”  
Daugherty said she also plans to connect with students in the environments they feel most comfortable in to allow relationships with students to flourish. 
“What I’ve always enjoyed in the past is, as I meet with students and get to know students, I go to them in their places and spaces that have meaning to them, and for some, that’s a corner of the library,” Daugherty said. “For others, that’s a traditional event.”

The Georgetown University Center on Faith and Justice hosted three religious experts for a panel discussion examining the consequences of the proliferation of white Christian nationalism ahead of the November midterm elections.
The Oct. 26 panel featured Reverend Michael B. Curry, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, Amanda Tyler (SFS ’00), the executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty and Samuel Perry, an associate professor in the department of sociology at the University of Oklahoma. The Center on Faith and Justice director, Reverend Jim Wallis, moderated the discussion. 
From 2012 to 2021, right-wing extremists, most of whom were white nationalists, committed almost 75% of the murders that were classified as domestic terrorism in the U.S. At the same time, an Oct. 27 Pew Research survey found that more than half of U.S. adults have not heard or read anything about Christian nationalism.
Wallis said the center made an effort to select speakers from diverse areas of expertise when organizing the event.
“We didn’t know how well White Christian Nationalism is understood on campus and in the wider community, so we wanted to include a broad range of voices to help explain both what it is and why it’s so dangerous to our democracy,” Wallis wrote to The Hoya. “We thought each of the panelists could address those questions from different perspectives.”
Perry said white Christian nationalism comprises three distinct dimensions of religious, political and personal identity.
“It is an ideology that idealizes and advocates a fusion of American civic life with a kind of Christianity that isn’t characterized by giving my life to Jesus or wanting to be a good disciple, but is about white Christian ethnoculture,” Perry said at the event. “It is also a political strategy, and increasingly a political strategy that is leveraged by people who don’t have to believe the ideology.”
Reverend Curry emphasized the importance of separating white Christian nationalism from Christianity as a religion. 
“It’s important to make a distinction between an ideology, which in America you have the right to hold, but I would argue you don’t have the right to claim that it is Christian,” Curry said at the event. 
Curry spoke about how long this conflation of religion and white nationalist ideology has been prevalent, as the Ku Klux Klan co-opted Christianity as a justification for their ideology in the early 20th century. 
Lauren Freed (NHS ’26) said she attended the event to better understand the context behind the effects of white Christian nationalism that she has personally felt as a Jewish American. 
“Democratic institution is very important to me and how I identify as an American,” Freed told The Hoya. “Seeing people wearing shirts like ‘six million weren’t enough’ and White Christian Nationalists at the Charlottesville neo-Nazi rally has been deeply offensive to me.”
According to Freed, the speakers helped to reconcile the contradictions with people who allege to follow the Christian faith but fail to live out her understanding of Biblical ideals. 
“I’ve been very confused by how people can perpetuate anti-Semitic messages while also professing to follow the Gospel’s messages,” Freed said. “It was nice to hear the speakers at the event, especially Reverend Curry as the Head of the Episcopal Church, call out hateful rhetoric and detestable actions as not representative of the true essence of the Christian faith.”
Speakers called for community members to work together in dismantling the divisions white Christian nationalism has caused. 
“Silence is complicity so we have a moral obligation to speak out,” Tyler said at the event. “To be political is not the problem, but the problem is when you insist that the government reflect your theological views or think that only people who are like me religiously belong fully in the country.”

The Disability Cultural Initiative (DCI) built a ramp out of legos during a two-day event in Red Square to promote accessibility on Georgetown University’s campus. 
The event — titled “Ramping Up Access” — attracted more than 75 Georgetown students, faculty and staff to help construct the ramp, and was hosted Oct. 13 and 27. Many disability rights activists have built lego ramps in an effort to highlight the importance of inclusive and accessible spaces. The Ramping Up Access event aimed to show the Georgetown community that conversations about accessibility don’t always have to be difficult.
The event was meant to encourage community members to expand accessibility on campus whether that be by using ramps, alt text or Zoom captions in classrooms, according to Amy Kenny, associate director of the Disability Cultural Initiative. 
“Building a ramp out of Legos invites everyone in the Georgetown community to participate in creating this culture of access, first by building a ramp, and then by implementing practical recommendations for expanding access in your classroom, club or office,” Kenny wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Plus, who doesn’t like Legos?”
The completed ramp was two feet deep, three feet wide and approximately the height of a stair. According to Kenny, the event was open to all students regardless of previous lego experience.
Briana Valle (COL ’23), the DCI’s student assistant, said one of the goals of the event was to get more people to learn about DCI’s resources and events in an original way. Near the lego ramp, DCI had little paper sheets printed out with instructions on how to make classrooms, offices and clubs on campus more accessible. 
“We are trying to get more people to see our website,” Valle said. “We have a lot of resources, all of our events there. The main purpose was to call out accessibility, so it’s like a creative way to get people to want to stop by and play with legos, but in a way you’re still realizing ‘oh we need a ramp to call out accessibility.’” 
Kenny said that the ramp often serves as a symbol of accessibility because it creates an inclusive space for people who use mobility devices such as wheelchairs and mobility scooters. However, she said accessibility extends beyond just ramps. 
“It’s a practice, an ethos, a way of creating inclusive space that acknowledges that all of our body-minds have access needs and that we as a community get to meet those access needs as part of our commitment to cura personalis,” Kenny wrote.  
Kenny said accessibility is often an “afterthought,” one that only comes up once a person with a disability advocates for their disability rights. Kenny hopes that the Georgetown community can come together and be more proactive in creating a culture of accessibility before issues arise. 
“But we want to be a community that plans for accessibility from the beginning of every class, event and meeting so that disabled people with apparent and non apparent disabilities are able to thrive in our Georgetown community,” Kenny said. “Brick by Lego brick, we are building a more accessible world where our disabled classmates and colleagues get the opportunity to belong.”
Valle said DCI is still deciding where they will place the completed ramp, but it will cover one or two steps on a staircase. 
According to Noah Martin (COL ’17, GRD ’19), the senior program designer for the Core Pathways Initiative who helped build the ramp at the event, there is an immediate need for ramps everywhere in Georgetown. 
“You can just bring people in through something like play to do something that’s a little more visible and also a little more inclusive, bringing people in the conversation to talk about disability culture on campus,” Martin told The Hoya. 
Dane Tedder (COL ’24), who learned about the event from his Disability and Culture anthropology class, said he decided to come and help build the ramp to engage with a community of students reflecting on accessibility. 
“I came out to see a very visual example of community, and it’s definitely showing,” Tedder told The Hoya. “Seeing all the people around the table and all the people coming together, even in just that past 20 minutes I have been here, I think it’s just really powerful visually.”
Valle said support from the Georgetown community will help support DCI given its status as a new initiative that launched earlier this year. 
“It’s very new,” Valle said. “I know there’s a lot of other organizations and clubs for disabilities but this one is really trying to take into consideration race, sexuality and the whole intersectional identity that people who are disabled come with.”

Students anonymously posed sexual education questions to sexual health experts at an event aimed at increasing transparency and improving sexual education on Georgetown University’s campus. 
Organizers of the event gave students free glow sticks at the lights-off event, titled “Sex in the Dark,” which was held in the Hariri Lohrfink Auditorium on Oct. 24. Georgetown partnered with Sex Discussed Here!, an organization that brings sex educators to college campuses, conferences and high schools across the country to improve transparency in sex education and give an opportunity for students to ask questions, to host the event. Students submitted questions on their phones, which could be up-voted by other participants as the speakers aimed to answer the most popular questions from students.
According to Donté Smith, who was enrolled at Georgetown from 2004 to 2006, was one of the speakers at the event and serves as a sex educator for Sex Discussed Here!, the Sex in the Dark program seeks to create a safe, anonymous space for students to ask questions about sexual health without fear of judgement from others. 
Young adults in the United States often have limited access to comprehensive sexual education. While 96% of parents support sexual education in high school, it is mandated in just 39 states, and in these states where it is mandated, sexual education is not nearly as thorough as it should be. A recent study from Planned Parenthood revealed that students in 1995 were more likely to receive thorough and comprehensive sexual education than students in the past decade.
According to Sex Discussed Here! co-founder Dorian Solot, the information provided to students at Sex in the Dark events extended beyond the sexual education typically offered in K-12 schools. 
“So often, the education about these topics that students receive in middle school and high school is all about what NOT to do,” Solot wrote to The Hoya. “But as college students enter young adulthood, many have really legitimate questions.”
According to Smith, Sex Discussed Here! aims to remedy this lack of access to sexual education by offering over 1,000 programs in 47 states throughout the past decade, all of which hope to give students the necessary information about sexual education.
“Sex in the Dark is all about answering students’ questions about bodies, relationships and sexuality,” Smith wrote. “For some students and some topics, the information may be relevant immediately. For others, it might not be useful for years, until they’re married or in a serious relationship.”
Smith said that while they were at Georgetown, they would have appreciated programming such as the Sex in the Dark event and reaffirmed the importance of making sexual health programming widely accessible for college students. 
“When I was an undergrad here figuring out who I am and how to interact with the world, having sexual health programming like what Sex Discussed Here provides would have deepened my understanding of consent and my own body, and enriched my time as a Georgetown student,” Smith wrote. 
According to Solot, increasing access to sexual education informs students how to protect themselves and informs safe decisions in the future.
According to a university spokesperson, trainings on healthy relationships and sexual health are offered by a variety of Georgetown University offices, including Health Education Services, the Women’s Center and the LGBTQ Resource Center. These trainings highlight the importance of consent and the experiences of the LGBTQ+ community, areas which the university believes are essential in ensuring sex education. 
“We strive to make all of our trainings and well-being resources inclusive of all members of our community, inclusive of sexual orientation, background, gender and other factors,” the spokesperson wrote. “It is important that all students feel included in these important conversations.” 
Smith said faith, sexual orientation, gender identity and one’s personal experiences play a core role in one’s understanding of their sexuality and relationships, warranting sexual education that remains intersectional and acknowledges the role these factors have. It is important for students to have the ability to ask questions relating to their own sexual health without feeling judged, according to Smith.
“When sex education is taught in a one-size-fits-all way, I think a lot of people tune out because the assumptions don’t fit their lives,” Smith wrote, “We try hard to hold all these possibilities in our minds when we’re teaching, to acknowledge there’s no such thing as one answer that feels right for everyone.”

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, a special program dedicated to reducing student loan debt for public servants in the District, has led to the forgiveness of over $1 of student loan debt for Washington, D.C. residents.
D.C. residents who have worked in the public sector for at least 10 years are able to apply for student loan forgiveness through the PSLF program, according to an Oct. 18 announcement by District Mayor Muriel Bowser (D). The program was created in 2007 by the United States Congress to encourage D.C. residents to work in the public sector. 
The program received renewed focus and attention in late 2021 with the creation of a waiver program to streamline the process, allowing borrowers to receive credit for past periods of repayment of student loan debt that would have not been accepted under the regulations of the original PSLF program, expanding the number of D.C. residents eligible for the program. 
Prior to 2022, only one resident had received student loan forgiveness through the program, but the waiver, along with increased awareness, has led to 15 residents receiving assistance, averaging $70,000 each in federal student loan forgiveness.
Federal student loan debt has become an increased conversation point in politics after President Joe Biden announced $10,000 of student debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 or households with less than $250,000. The Department of Education will also provide up to $20,000 in student debt cancellation to Pell Grant recipients. William English, an assistant professor in the McDonough School of Business, said that offering student loan forgiveness to public servants is a strategic move to both improve the public sector and offer relief to student loan borrowers. 
“If you go into public service, if you’re gonna work for the government or a public interest nonprofit, and you go into a career where you spend 10 years working for the government, then you can have your student loans forgiven,” English told The Hoya. “The end result is that this is essentially a subsidy to encourage people to get good educations and go into public service.”
The temporary PSLF waiver program, created in 2021, allows borrowers to earn credit for past repayments that would not have qualified under the previous PSLF program to alleviate economic stress from the pandemic.
English said the temporary waiver program was important to ensure borrowers did not fall short on repayment programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I think the waiver makes sense in the sense that you had this unprecedented period of economic turmoil, you didn’t want people to be disqualified or to lose months in this program because of  unforeseen circumstances,” English said. 
Bowser said that while the temporary waiver provided key relief for District residents during the COVID-19 pandemic, long-term loan forgiveness is a necessary step to encourage work in public service.
“This Public Service Loan Forgiveness temporary waiver program has been an important lifeline for public servants,” Bowser said in the press release. “Thanks to the Biden Administration and through the execution of the D.C. Student Loan Ombudsman, hardworking public servants are finally getting a fair shot.” 
The waiver aimed to attract more D.C. residents to work in the public service. According to Pew Research Center data, as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, jobs in the public sector have lagged behind private employment opportunities. This reduction in public service workers has led to negative impacts on service delivery and the economic security of workers.
The program offers a way for D.C. officials to encourage work in the public sector, English said. 
“The most important thing I thought, and I think this is what the DC government is doing, is to make sure people understand there’s an opportunity here,” English said. “Take advantage of this opportunity, and even once the waiver goes away, the loan forgiveness program is still in place.”

Georgetown University community members raised over $1 million for cancer research as a part of the inaugural Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer BellRinger race.
Over 850 riders across 147 teams participated in the Oct. 22 bike race to support research into cancer prevention, diagnosis and therapy at Lombardi, a sector of the Georgetown University Medical Center dedicated to cancer research and treatment. BellRinger was launched in 2020 and intended to host a ride in October 2021, however, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the inaugural event’s postponement until 2022. This year’s participants rode either 25, 50 or 100 miles as a part of their fundraising efforts, starting on Georgetown’s campus and riding to either Germantown or Urbana, Md. By committing to riding one of the three distances, participants were asked to raise $1,000, $1,250 or $1,500 for Lombardi.
According to Chris Timko (SFS ’15), BellRinger executive director, the event was inspired by similar fundraiser events at other universities to raise money for cancer research. Timko said he planned a similar event for cancer research at Ohio State University that now hosts 8,000 riders and raises over $20 million for cancer research, and remains hopeful that BellRinger will increase its impact in the coming years.
“I’m honored and humbled to be a part of it because the impact has the potential to be transformational for Georgetown Lombardi and save lives,” Timko wrote to the Hoya. “This kind of philanthropic funding, every dime of which funds research, will transform Georgetown Lombardi’s capacity to conduct groundbreaking research. It will generate advances that will save lives.”
Timko said student participation was a key factor driving the effort behind the event, and that he was pleased by students’ willingness to help fundraise and volunteer as a part of the weekend’s events.
“BellRinger is about building a community united to end cancer, and there’s simply no way to build a community at Georgetown without students driving the effort,” Timko wrote.
Students participating in the race raised between $500 and $750 depending on how many miles they were biking, and over 125 students rode as a part of over 20 student-based teams, according to Timko.
Estefania Acosta (COL ’23) rode for Team Corp, organized by The Corp, Georgetown’s student-run business, and was one of the few riders who elected to participate in the 100-mile course. According to Louis Weiner, director of the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, 15% of riders committed to raising the necessary funds for the 100-mile ride.
Acosta said she chose to ride the longer distance as a testament to the strength of a family member who fought breast cancer, despite having never completed a ride of over 60 miles prior to BellRinger.
“The ride itself was one of the hardest and simultaneously most rewarding things I have ever done,” Acosta wrote to The Hoya. “To be honest, by mile 70 I was pondering on quitting. However, being surrounded by fellow riders while working up Maryland’s never-ending hills reminded me that this ride was supposed to be challenging both physically and mentally.”
Weiner said he was pleased by the turnout for the race, especially given the number of students who elected to participate.
“This event represented the fulfillment of a dream I have had for years — to bring a signature participatory event to Georgetown that raises money for cancer research, elevates Lombardi’s recognition in our region and strengthens our community,” Weiner wrote to The Hoya. “Mission accomplished — and we are just getting started.”
Georgetown’s chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon (SigEp), a social fraternity on campus, and the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union (GUASFCU), Georgetown’s student-run bank, were among the largest teams and fundraisers, according to Timko. SigEp raised over $18,880 with 28 riders, while GUASFCU raised more than $11,400 with 20 riders.
Scott Kase (MSB ’23), who organized SigEp’s team and is in charge of the fraternity’s philanthropy efforts, said the team quickly rallied around raising money for cancer research. 
“A lot of people have either been personally and second-handedly affected by cancer with family members and others,” Kase said to The Hoya.“To be able to have an impact on the Lombardi Cancer Center, as opposed to a cause that is a lot further away, was a pretty big driver for us. I think the guys really rallied around that.”
Lombardi Deputy Director Michael Atkins organized and led one of the largest community-based teams that participated in the race: Team Immunotherapy. Atkins’ team raised over $155,000, championing cancer survivors who were treated using immunotherapy methods, whom Atkins calls “Thrivers.” 
“The sense of community was palpable and helped me envision how this will only grow over the coming years,” Atkins wrote to The Hoya. “I look forward to the day when the ride is filled with Thrivers and their friends and families and we are riding to celebrate the research that has led to many more victories over cancer.” 
Atkins said the funds raised from the event will allow Lombardi to recruit new investigators and purchase newer equipment, enabling the center to stay at the cutting edge in the battle against cancer. 
Taylor Deasy (MSB ’24), who participated in the ride as a part of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority team, said she felt empowered as hundreds of people came together to support a shared mission and goal of supporting cancer research.
“The event was important to me because it symbolized the greater community coming together to support a cause that detrimentally affects the lives of so many people,” Deasy wrote to The Hoya. “I feel like everyone has some sort of personal association with cancer and the bellringer race was meaningful in that it allowed everyone to bike for their personal connection as well as the great community.” 
Timko said he is already working to launch next year’s BellRinger event and that the planners will continue to recruit riders, volunteers and donors throughout the upcoming year, hoping to expand the event and raise even more money to fund cancer research.
“BellRinger Weekend is designed to be the culminating celebration of months of effort by our Riders and teams working together to train and fundraise,” Timko wrote. “Relationships are built at BellRinger that are nurtured in the months following the Ride and the cycle repeats itself as we launch for the following year.”

Georgetown University welcomed its fifth cohort of Pivot Program fellows, 19 formerly incarcerated individuals who will participate in the year-long reentry program. 
The Pivot Program is designed to provide formerly incarcerated individuals with leadership development and professional opportunities. It was co-founded by the McDonough School of Business, Georgetown College and Georgetown’s Prisons and Justice Initiative, which seeks to provide education for incarcerated students and returning citizens. Fellows, who began the cohort Oct. 11, participate in nine months of academic courses, an internship with a local business or nonprofit and a business pitch competition. 
Raashed Hall, a new Pivot fellow, said he learned about Pivot through his reentry program coordinator and immediately knew he wanted to apply.
“Before I got incarcerated, I had aspirations of obtaining my own business and having my own ventures going for myself,” Hall told The Hoya. “So, it was like a no-brainer.”
Hall said he is looking forward to completing the program and hopes to start his own fitness venture after graduating.
“I do personal training on the side, so I wanted to expand into my own outfit or my own business venture in that personal training field and physical fitness,” Hall said.
Jihad Barnes, a fellow in this year’s program, said the program bridges a path toward his future goals, both professional and personal.
“I knew it could be a stepping stone to greater things that I wanted to achieve,” Barnes wrote to The Hoya. “It also was an opportunity for me to grow in different aspects and become in tune with who I was and what I aspire to be.”
Hall said his favorite course is grammar, a skill he worked on while he was incarcerated.
“I never learned good grammar growing up and I developed a bad habit,” Hall said. “I kind of re-taught myself how to talk in a manner where I can convey my thoughts in an intellectual way, as opposed to using slang all the time.”
Pivot courses are largely taught by Georgetown faculty and emphasize oral and written communication, interpersonal skills, design thinking, financial literacy and digital technical skills, according to Alyssa Lovegrove, Pivot academic director and Georgetown professor.
Pivot is part of the D.C. Reentry Action Network, a coalition of nonprofits that provide direct services to returning citizens, and the Second Chance Business Coalition, a group of private sector companies committed to expanding second chance hiring. 
The Department of Corrections, the public defender’s office, parole services and various nonprofits refer potential applicants who show strong ambition to the program, according to Lovegrove.
“It’s really designed for people who self-identify as potential leaders within the community,” Lovegrove told The Hoya. “We’re looking for people that have a plan and have a vision for what they want to achieve and are emotionally ready to make a commitment to a program that’s the better part of an academic year.”
Typically, the program receives more than 100 applications and aims to enroll a cohort of 10 to 20 fellows each year, Lovegrove said. 
Fellows receive stipends to support living costs during their participation in the program, funded by the D.C. Department of Employment Services (DOES). As one of Pivot’s major partners, DOES also pairs each fellow with a job coach and serves as a resource for graduates. 
Jason Washington, DOES chief of staff, said Pivot aligns with the department’s goal of helping all job seekers in D.C. thrive.
“To leverage a local institution like Georgetown to provide on-ramps to employment for returning citizens makes sense for our workforce, economy, and public safety,” Washington wrote to The Hoya.
According to Washington, the employment rate for Pivot graduates is almost 80%, which is double the national average for returning citizens.
Jack Gasdia (SFS ’24), who has been a Pivot peer tutor since Spring 2022, said the program places an emphasis on second chances, focusing on the future and challenging misperceptions surrounding returning citizens.
“I have so much respect for the people who participate in Pivot for their ambition and their courage to go back out there and advance their education,” Gasdia told The Hoya. “It’s really rewarding to help people discover the core parts of who they are and what they want to be and helping them build the skills to get there.”
Pivot is more rigorous than similar programs as it is longer and expects that fellows go beyond simply attending sessions to receive a check or certificate, according to Hall. 
“The seriousness of it is kind of surprising, in the sense of when you measure Pivot up to other reentry programs, it’s just leaps and bounds ahead,” Hall said.
Beyond offering programming for its fellows, Pivot aims to promote awareness about second chance hiring, which is the practice of employing formerly incarcerated individuals. 
In doing so, companies can work toward addressing racial disparities in the workforce, according to Lovegrove.“We want ultimately for second chance hiring to not to be the exception, but to be the norm: that every candidate is evaluated on the basis of what they can bring to the job and not on the basis of some historical fact in their path,” Lovegrove said.

Totally racist program. All but one of the 19 previously incarnated are black. Georgetown is singleing out one minority. Crime is a people problem that should not focus on race.

The Georgetown University Coalition for Workers’ Rights organized two events with facilities workers and dining hall workers to create a space for students and workers to openly discuss workers’ concerns about student behavior and their treatment.
The events, held Oct. 18 and 20, hosted approximately a dozen university workers and around 20 students to engage in productive conversations about workers’ experiences. In the meeting, facilities and dining hall workers raised concerns about student disrespect relating to treatment of workers, cleanliness and a lack of overtime pay due to third-party companies being hired to supplement Georgetown workers during move-in and graduation.
Josh Gavsie (COL ’24), who served as the lead organizer of the events, said the solidarity meetings were intended to give students the opportunity to have constructive discussions with workers and hear about concerns they raised. 
“We’re trying to show workers on campus what we’re up to and remind them that we’re here,” Gavsie told The Hoya. “To help and increase the solidarity between students and workers foremost.”
Aidan Connors (SFS ’26), who attended the Oct. 18 meeting, said he thought it was important for students to have a space to meet and listen to workers at the university outside of a working environment. 
“I recommend it to everybody to meet people who actually work here and in a setting where they’re not serving you or something, but when they’re in a conversational mood, and it’s really fascinating to get that insight,” Connors said.
According to Gavsie, at the event, workers expressed their discontent with the university’s decision to bring in third-party contractors for major events, limiting the amount of overtime pay workers were able to receive. 
“A lot of responsibilities that used to be designated to facility staff on campus, including cleaning the rooms before the end of summer and setting up for graduation, have all been outsourced to external contractors hired by the University,” Gavsie said, “Which is particularly problematic because this work used to be done by campus facility staff who received overtime pay for doing that work and which was a big part of their compensation.”
Ulises Olea Tapia (SFS ’25), a member of GU Coalition for Workers’ Rights, said workers also raised concerns about students’ frequently disrespectful attitudes and actions. According to Olea, some students have mocked workers on Flok, an anonymous social media platform, for not speaking English. In addition, many students fail to clean up after themselves and increase the burden on workers. Olea said students must consider who will be affected by their actions. 
“We really do not stop and think about how, who’s going to clean this up? Who is doing this? Who is cooking my meal?” Olea told the Hoya. “This really affects our relationship with workers because they really have told us they feel isolated.” 
According to Gavsie, Epicurean and Company’s extended hours for this year have led to increased negative interactions between intoxicated students and employees, leading to workers reporting these interactions to the Coalition for Workers.
“The extension of hours has exposed them to really drunk and disrespectful students who are harassing the workers, directing racist comments at the ones who don’t speak English, and being incredibly disrespectful to the women who work there by making unwanted, very uncomfortable advances,” Gavsie said.  
According to Olea, the Coalition was encouraged by the success of their events, with a significant showing of both students and workers, and plans to make solidarity breakfasts and dinners a recurring event, and are currently discussing options to hold conversations with workers on a monthly basis or twice a semester. 
Olea said it is important for students to continue to listen to workers’ concerns and to actively reevaluate their interactions with university workers.
“We tend to take for granted all of these wonderful things that we have, and that’s nice. But we also need to be very aware of who are the people making this possible,” Olea said. “That they are people, that they have lives outside of working for just that they have dreams, and aspirations and how we can better engage with them in order to make them feel at home.”
