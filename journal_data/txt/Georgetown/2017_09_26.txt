Attorney General Jeff Sessions is set to give a speech at the Georgetown University Law Center to condemn rising opposition to unrestricted free speech on college campuses this afternoon.
Sessions’ address is set to focus on the transformation of universities into an “echo chamber of political correctness and homogenous thought, a shelter for fragile egos,” according to Axios, quoting a source close to Sessions.
Sessions is scheduled to deliver remarks at the law school’s Center for the Constitution at noon, followed by a question-and-answer session with GULC professor Randy Barnett, the center’s director.
The Georgetown chapter of the student group Young Democratic Socialists of America said it would protest Sessions’ speech, promising to try to “shut him down.”
“A university that claims to care about the travel ban and DACA rescindment shouldn’t invite the man who defended both,” a Facebook invitation for the protest of Sessions’ speech reads.
Sessions, a former U.S. senator and the first to endorse President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, has vocally supported the president’s hardline policies on immigration during the campaign and while serving in his administration.
University President John J. DeGioia has taken public stances against two such policies: a series of bans on refugees and visitors from some majority-Muslim countries, and the decision to rescind the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected about 800,000 young immigrants without documentation from deportation.
Sessions’ remarks echo criticisms that have been leveled against a number of colleges in recent years, as they have faced pressure from students to disinvite conservative speakers.
The University of California, Berkeley, has come under fire multiple times this year for its handling of student protests of controversial speakers, including protests that turned violent in February and led Berkley to cancel a scheduled speech by conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. More recently, Ben Shapiro, a conservative media figure, was met by hundreds of student protesters Sept. 14 after being invited to speak by the student group Berkeley College Republicans.
President Donald Trump threatened to withhold Berkeley’s federal funding in a Feb. 2 tweet at the height of the free speech standoff.
If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view – NO FEDERAL FUNDS?

Georgetown has had its own share of showdowns over speakers in recent years. In May 2016, a group of Georgetown students petitioned the university to rescind its invitation to then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to speak at that year’s School of Foreign Service commencement, citing Johnson’s role in deporting immigrants living in the country without documentation.

If GU is serious about exchange of ideas,  if members of the GU Chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America cause violence or otherwise prevent AG Sessions from speaking, the University should have no choice other than to expel them.

Dude, this is Georgetown.  The university is more likely to give them an award.

I agree…Why be afraid of hearing information that may challenge your opinions?  Issues are often complicated and require research and the ability to reason and make distinctions.  It is this ability to reason and make distinctions I see so lacking today. STRIVE FOR THE TRUTH. BE TENACIOUS FOR THE TRUTH. One must take the time to investigate all aspects of an issue, not just rely on one or two liners from the media. For example, how many of you actually read or listened to President Trump’s speech to the United Nations? Or did you just accept the media’s brief assessment that it was ‘warmongering.’ I found it balanced, informative and educational (do you know what the three pillars of the UN and the Marshall Plan are?) and put the problems with our enemies in a wider perspective.

The Washington, D.C. Council is considering two bills this week that aim to make public wireless internet available to city residents to promote digital literacy. These bills are intended to close the gap between residents with and without Wi-Fi.
The Wi-Fi Task Force Act of 2017 proposes a task force composed of governmental and nongovernmental representatives whose goal is to research a plan for a public wireless internet network in the District. The second bill, the Digital Literacy Council Establishment Act of 2017, proposes the creation of a similar committee designed to research and recommend methods to improve digital literacy in education and the workforce.
The public Wi-Fi bill, currently under committee review, was introduced by D.C. Councilman Brandon Todd (D-Ward 4) and four of the council’s 13 members. The digital literacy bill is set to be marked up and amended this week.
Todd said during a press conference that a public investment in internet access and proficiency will yield outstanding results in the age of the digital economy and will close the skills gap for many of D.C.’s low-income residents.
The Wi-Fi Task Force would report policy recommendations to the Council by the end of 2018. Meanwhile, the Digital Literacy Council would create two distinct policy plans for the City Council — one intended for workforce digital literacy and the other for public school students in the District — within six months.
Joshua Fleitman, spokesman for Todd, said improving internet access is vital, as it permeates so much of daily activity.
“The world works around the internet these days. It’s not just about funny videos on YouTube. It’s about access to study materials for students, access to capital, access to resources, small businesses, large businesses, nonprofits. Really, if you don’t have access to the internet, you are at a systemic disadvantage in today’s world,” Fleitman said in an interview with The Hoya.
Fleitman also emphasized that, beyond merely having access to the internet, D.C. residents need to have the tools to use it effectively. The digital literacy bill is intended to achieve the latter.
According to Elizabeth Lindsey, the executive director of Byte Back, a nonprofit operating in D.C. that provides free technological education and computer training to residents, there is a large need for more widespread internet access in the District.
“Across this city, thousands of our neighbors wake up each morning without access to the digital tools that most of us take for granted. Reading the news on an app, paying a bill online, emailing a resume to a potential employer — for those without home internet access, these activities are not a simple part of a daily routine. They are obstacles to overcome,” Lindsey said.
Lindsey explained the importance of bringing the internet to residents who have been excluded from using it.
“One of our students would spend entire evenings in a Byte Back computer lab studying for his computer networking exam, leaving only when the office closed after tutoring hours. He didn’t have access to the internet at home. Despite this barrier, he passed his exam — but imagine what he could have accomplished if we broke that barrier down,” Lindsey said.
Though Wi-Fi access is prevalent in Georgetown and the District’s other affluent neighborhoods, it is less easily found in poorer areas — particularly neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River.
Lindsey said that, with greater access and education, low-income residents will be able to compete with more privileged residents in the digital economy.
“One of our beginner students, who used the internet for the first time at age 65, said, ‘I felt like I was being left behind. It seemed like everywhere I looked, on billboards, in magazines, recorded in the phone messages of different offices I was calling, people were telling me to go to some address called ‘www’ for more information,” Lindsey said. “It’s so important that this bill incorporates not just the expansion of Wi-Fi access but also a digital literacy component.”
According to Lindsey, these measures will also spur job growth within the District.
“With education comes opportunity, and that’s what we see every day at Byte Back. People who have faced sometimes years of unemployment and underemployment are able to attain living-wage jobs after getting the training they need to succeed in the digital economy,” Lindsey said.
Fleitman said that this legislation will likely improve conditions for both businesses and employees, especially as it relates to tourists in D.C.
“There’s research that shows when there’s free public Wi-Fi available, tourists are more likely to look up stores and spend more money. So that’ll help create retail jobs. So much of this opportunity is based around the internet and having digital literacy skills. So, it’s about job growth. It’s about quality of life. It’s about bridging the digital divide. It’s about all those things,” Fleitman said.

Protecting victims, policing illegal assets and building strong local institutions are the next steps Colombia should pursue to accomplish the objectives laid out in the Peace Accords, Liberal Party Senator and Presidential Pre-Candidate Juan Manuel Galán (GRD ’03) said at a conference held Friday in McGhee Library.
Galán, who is currently in his third term as a Colombian senator and serves as the President of the Commission on the Law of Victim’s Rights, commended last year’s deal between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The negotiation ended a civil war that had lasted for 53 years.
He said, however, that the next parts of the process — prosecuting wrongdoers, remunerating victims and integrating the FARC into the political system — will be complicated to navigate.
“One of the biggest challenges that we’re facing right now is the transitional justice. That is the heart of the Peace Accords,” Galán said. “The way we implement this transitional justice is going to ensure the success or the failure of the Peace Accords.”
Galán said that all eight million people internally displaced by the civil war have the right to know the legal implications of their respective cases and receive appropriate compensation, for which he put forth legislation that would give such powers to an appointed tribunal.
“That is going to be a big challenge for this transitional tribunal,” Galán said. “But it will ensure that every victim will be protected and will have the guarantee of accessing the truth about their own issue and have also the guarantees of non-repetition and justice.”
He added that the government would seek for compensation to come from the FARC’s own assets as part of a process to procure all the group’s physical and monetary possessions.
“The government has been very timid, very shy on chasing these assets, but it’s a crucial issue, not only to ensure that the victims have reparation, but to ensure that the FARC do not have an unjust advantage as a political party in the next elections,” Galán said. “We have to insist that the main effort of reparation has to be on the FARC to their victims with their assets.”
Looking beyond the short-term objectives, Galán said that land and tax reform would be needed to build sustainable, strong political institutions at the local level to combat corruption and instability. Through this, Colombia could achieve a more democratic political system, a more competitive economy and a more equal society, he said.
Galán also addressed the fight against drug trafficking, saying countries should focus not only on prosecuting traffickers, but also confronting the social issues of poverty and drug addiction.
“Building up this debate would give us the result of having a different approach, especially towards the weakest links of the chain of the drug issues, and the weakest links are the consumer, the addict, the problematic user of drugs and the peasant who is cultivating the coca plant,” Galán said. “We need a public health approach, a human rights approach.”
Speaking on United States-Colombia cooperation on the issue of drug trafficking, Galán said that even though U.S. President Donald Trump had recently threatened to decertify Colombia as an ally, he hoped to establish a connection with the U.S. Congress to promote a comprehensive framework for cooperation.
“We’re trying to set up a more constitutional, official framework of meeting between the Colombian Congress and the U.S. Congress, trying to build up an agenda, trying to share information, use new forms in drug policy, and not going back 30 years, starting to talk about again aerial spreading of crops,” Galán said.
For the Liberal pre-candidate, everything ties back to a broader drive for modernization. Without the FARC consuming all its focus, Galán said that Colombia can address other contentious issues.
“For 50 years, we have a level of violence and internal conflict and everybody said, ‘No, this is the priority, we have to face this menace, this challenge, we cannot think about any other thing,’” Galán said. “Now that we don’t have this conflict, there’s nothing that makes us think about other things that are more important than these reforms, especially the main causes of this conflict: the land reform and the political participation.”
