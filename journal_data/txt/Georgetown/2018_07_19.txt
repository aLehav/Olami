A kitchen fire ripped through the beloved Georgetown carryout, Wingo’s, on June 26, leaving the store shuttered for at least two months.
The fire also spread to the next-door florist shop, English Rose Garden, and hospitalized two firefighters with non-life-threatening injuries.
Nearly 80 firefighters responded to the scene at around 11 a.m., and the flames took almost three hours to get under control. The two-alarm fire, which began in Wingo’s kitchen before rapidly spreading, has been deemed an accident, according to a tweet from the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department.
The fire spread through the walls and ceiling in the one-story building, according to the D.C. fire department. Heavy smoke from the fire was visible from several blocks away, and firefighters called in additional crews from outside the city to help manage the flames.
Wingo’s has been a neighborhood staple since it first opened its doors in 1983, drawing in Georgetown residents and students alike, with its extensive list of wings and dozens of sauces. Wingo’s said in a Facebook post it plans to reopen as soon as possible. The Georgetown location is currently boarded up.
“We promise to come back stronger than ever before! It is in these moments of adversity where the Wingo’s community excels,” the eatery wrote in the Facebook post.
In a comment on the post, Wingo’s estimated that reopening will take two to three months, putting its return near the start of Georgetown University’s fall semester.
Wingo’s is adored by many Georgetown students, who often flock to the restaurant for half-price wings on Wednesday night and hours that extend until 3 a.m. on the weekend. Some students took to social media to express their feelings about the fire.
Fatima Dyfan (COL ’21) shared a story about a Wingo’s employee who helped her receive free delivery on her order during finals week, although she initially ordered pickup.
Wingos burned down… @Wingos thank you for being loyal to me freshmen year. Once I ordered Wingos on Tapingo and I wanted to save money and ordered pick-up (I was with the birds and forgot that finals week was free delivery. the man told me that if I had called… they would’ve

“It was then that I knew that someone really had my back,” she wrote.
Wingo’s recently acquired a second location at 2218 Wisconsin Avenue in nearby Glover Park, and it hopes to open its doors August 1, according to a Facebook post.
English Rose Garden is also currently closed and sustained heavy damage. An employee who was working at the time of the fire told WUSA 9 the “shop is gone.”

Harriette Hemmasi is set to take over as Georgetown University’s dean of the library August 1, replacing former Dean Artemis Kirk, who retired last fall after 16 years at the university, according to a June 19 news release.
In her new role, Hemmasi will oversee and direct all branches of the Georgetown University Library, including Lauinger Library and the Blommer Science Library, which is home to 3.5 million volumes, manuscripts and books. Prior to accepting her position at Georgetown, Hemmasi was the Joukowsky Family University Librarian at Brown University, raising over $50 million for the university’s library and bringing its services into the digital age.
Hemmasi’s experience in building Brown’s library’s digital presence will allow her to shape Georgetown’s library in its growth, as well, Provost Robert Groves said in the June 19 news release.
“Harriette Hemmasi has a breadth and depth of experience that will be crucial in guiding our Georgetown library as it redefines what it is to be a hub of learning and information in the digital age,” Groves said. “This is an exciting time at Georgetown and Dean Hemmasi’s transformative work at Brown will be especially helpful to our library system as it renews its role as an intellectual and social center for students and faculty scholars on campus.”
Hemmasi was also involved in Brown’s Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice, which, much like Georgetown’s Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation, sought to research the university’s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, Groves said in a university-wide email.
“The steering committee’s work had almost been completed once I arrived at Brown,” Hemmasi said in the June 19 news release. “But we have been able to support the ongoing teaching and research projects, as well as special events hosted across campus that address the wide range of ways in which slavery and justice continue to affect our academic and personal lives on a daily basis.”
At Georgetown, Hemmasi is set to continue her work in the research of the slave trade by helping to create a new Institute for Racial Justice and lead the way in the efforts to renovate and modernize Lauinger Library, according to Groves’ email.
“Now is the time for the library to renew its role as an intellectual and social center on campus,” Hemmasi said in the June 19 news release. “I am eager for us to find ways to support Georgetown’s interdisciplinary and collaborative culture and also contribute to the advancement of scholarship around the world.”

Georgetown University is set to divest from companies whose primary business involves the extraction of tar sands, according to a June 7 news release from the university.
At the June meeting of the university’s board of directors, the Committee on Finance and Administration supported a recommendation from the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility based on proposals from Georgetown University Fossil Free, a student group dedicated to pressuring the university to divest from fossil fuels.
CISR, which is comprised of students, faculty and administrators, met in March to consider the proposal that GUFF submitted in November 2017. CISR advised the Committee on Finance and Administration on April 30 to divest from tar sands to adhere to the university’s socially responsible investment policy, which directs the university to avoid investing in companies whose businesses harm the environment.
CISR wrote in a memo to the Committee on Finance and Administration that tar sands extraction is inconsistent with the investment policy because of its effects on the environment and surrounding communities.
“Tar sands extraction, like coal mining, is an activity that has an extremely deleterious effect on the environment,” the committee wrote. “Tar sands extraction is also inconsistent with the University’s principle of ‘protection of human life and dignity’. It negatively affects public health in communities living near extraction sites, disproportionately harming indigenous people from First Nations communities.”
The members of GUFF, the student organization that spearheaded the effort for divestment from tar sands, are proud to see to their work come to fruition, representatives wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“We are thrilled that the Board of Directors has accepted our proposal to divest the endowment from tar sands,” GUFF member Celia Buckman (SFS ’21) wrote. “Eliminating tar sands, a particularly dirty fossil fuel with disastrous health effects, from our university’s financial underpinnings is a huge step in the right direction.”
The committee’s decision marks the end of a monthslong effort from GUFF’s lobbying. Over 300 Georgetown community members signed GUFF’s petition in November, while around 2,200 have supported the petition to divest fully from fossil fuels, GUFF member Samantha Panchèvre (SFS ’19) wrote in an email to The Hoya. GUFF also successfully lobbied for the university to divest from coal mining in 2015.
Georgetown now joins several universities across the United States and United Kingdom, including the University of Oxford and the University of California system, that have divested from fossil fuels.
GUFF plans to petition for complete divestment from fossil fuels.
“We’re energized by this decision, and we hope it lays a foundation for full divestment from fossil fuels,” Buckman wrote. “We will continue to fight for a truly clean, fossil free endowment until Georgetown aligns its rhetoric of Jesuit values with action against environmental destruction.”
