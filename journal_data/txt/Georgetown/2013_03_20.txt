The Campaign for Georgetown has raised $1 billion of its $1.5 billion goal, Vice President for Advancement R. Bartley Moore announced in a university-wide email Wednesday morning.
Since fundraising began in July 2006, 86,162 donors have contributed, though the capital campaign did not officially launch until fall 2011.
A relatively modest gift from a young alumna pushed Georgetown past the $1 billion mark, according to Communications Officer Maggie Moore.
“We’re cognizant that the last part of a fundraising campaign is always harder than the first,” R. BartleyMoore wrote in the email. “But this is a shared journey, and we would be remiss as a community if we did not pause to celebrate how much we have accomplished thus far.”
The capital campaign aims to raise $500 million by July 2016.

Midnight MUG closed early Tuesday evening after workers discovered a broken water main.
The coffee shop will reopen at an indefinite time Wednesday. Midnight Mug Director Elise Mixon (COL ’15) did not know when the service would resume regular hours.
Midnight Mug had been using an espresso machine to supplement its offerings, but the machine could not sustain demand.
“The espresso machine, because we were using it so much to make up for the lack of coffee, couldn’t handle the volume of hot water,” Mixon said.
The Students of Georgetown, Inc. will be providing free coffee and bagels on the second floor ofLauinger Library tonight to make up for Midnight’s temporary closure.

Derek Parker Royal, executive director of the journal Philip Roth Studies, and Jacques Berlinerblau, director of the Program for Jewish Civilization, praised American Jewish novelist Philip Roth’s lifetime of literary work at an event March 13 that celebrated the writer’s 80th birthday March 19.
The PJC and the English department made the event a true birthday party, with a cake and a rendition of “Happy Birthday” by the Georgetown Chimes. Roth, who splits his time between New York and Connecticut, was not in attendance.
Royal and Berlinerblau focused their discussion on trying to understand who Roth is as a person. Scholars are often challenged to fully understand Roth because the author is very private.
“There is like an electrified fence perimeter and a moat with crocodiles around the castle ‘Philip Roth,’”Berlinerblau said. “If one wants to get there and figure out who he is, it’s extraordinarily difficult.”
Roth is known for incorporating his life into his books and for using alter egos in his writing, such as the character Nathan Zuckerman and even a character named Philip Roth. Royal cautioned against taking these characters to be autobiographical and reminded the audience that they are fictional.
“I think if we rely on his fiction as a way into him as a man, him as a writer in his life, it’s impossible because, as any writer does, they take the seeds of the lived experience and their lives go into their writing,” he said. “It’s not just imagining — it’s experience as well.”
According to Royal, Roth has said not to look at his books autobiographically, even though his characters seem to resemble the author so closely.
“It’s like he begs us to look for his life in his fiction while at the same time saying, ‘Don’t do it,’” Royal said. “He’s playing a little bit of Jewish mischief, and I think that, Jewish or otherwise, he is a mischief-maker, and he does like to put on a variety of masks, a variety of veneers, facades and he likes to play around.”
Berlinerblau is currently working on a book about Roth’s fiction. He’s studied Roth’s drafts, which are housed in the Library of Congress.
“I admire many things about Philip Roth, many things, but it’s just the work ethic,” Berlinerblau said. “Is that is there any writer that is more committed to the craft? The five, the six, the seven hours every single day for what must be 50-something years.”
Zoe Lillian (COL ’13) took Berlinerblau’s class on Roth in fall 2011 and served as a teaching assistant the next semester.
“I thought it was wonderful,” she said. “It was really incredible having professor Parker Royal come, especially because I feel like every single person who has been in Jacques [Berlinerblau’s] class has cited him, so its really exciting to have him talking to us. And it was a really interesting conversation to have.”

In the age of social media, friendship can often consist of little more than a wall post or click of a “like” button. Authors Amy Andrews and Jessica Mesman Griffith attempted to bring friendship back to its spiritual roots in their memoir “Love and Salt,” which they discussed at an event sponsored by the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs March 15.
“This sharing of stories is at the heart of friendships and the heart of belief,” Andrews said. “Storytelling is the way, but communion is what we hope to find.”
Andrews added that the two authors had focused on the common theme of mortality.
“We came together around a common question … of mortality,” she added. “It gave us solace to see that question being played out in another person’s life.”
The authors first met in a creative writing class at the University of Pittsburgh’s Master of Fine Arts in writing program. When Andrews decided to convert to Catholicism, she asked Mesman Griffith to be her sponsor. The friends committed to writing each other daily letters throughout Andrews’ first season of Lent. This letter writing continued for years, though never with the same frequency of the initial period.
Through collecting the letters, the friends realized they were connected by a common thread.
“We felt that there was a universal story there that could be shared with other people,” Andrews said.
Both authors stressed that they initially had no intention of publishing the letters.
“We knew we were telling stories, but we didn’t realize we were living a story,” Mesman Griffith said.
During the discussion, Andrews and Mesman Griffith shared excerpts from the book. Mesman Griffith began with a letter about her mother’s death at a young age and her rediscovery of Catholicism despite the rest of her family’s abandonment of the faith.
“I sometimes worry that my faith is nothing more than reminiscing about my childhood or rebelling against my father,” Mesman Griffith read from the letter.
Mesman Griffith wrote about her fear of being unable to hope for happiness and the need to remain strong throughout difficult times.
“Death has no sting, but suffering still hurts,” Mesman Griffith read.
Andrews read a passage about the two authors’ observation of relics at St. Anthony’s Chapel in Pittsburgh. Andrews discussed why she pictures angels to be dark and sometimes recoils from sunshine.
“The darkness of angels signifies a kind of beauty to me,” Andrews read.
Following the reading, Andrews and Mesman Griffith took questions from attendees, which included topics such as letter writing, motherhood and the intersection of their discussions in these letters with their everyday friendship.
Both authors emphasized their belief that friendship has become shallow.
“When something falls out of public discourse, people don’t have a model to raise their lives up to,” Andrews said. “Writing letters can allow your intimacy to deepen.”
Those in attendance said that they were fascinated by the book’s portrayal of friendship and spirituality.
“Storytelling is such an important way to use our own faith and experiences to deepen relationships with others in the pursuit of friendship, love and peace,” Berkley Center Assistant Director for Programs and Operations Melody Fox Ahmed said. “‘Love and Salt’ beautifully captures this experience, and the Berkley Center was proud to host an uplifting conversation on the power of faith and friendship.”
Colin Sukie (COL ’10) was inspired by the lecture to search for spiritual friendship.
“I like writing letters, and I yearned for this same sort of spiritual friendship that is hard to derive in any other media,” Sukie said.

Electronic dance musician Calvin Harris will headline the Spring Kickoff Concert in McDonough Arena on April 6, the Georgetown Program Board announced Monday.
Harris was not included in a poll measuring student preferences for artists conducted by GPB in November, despite assurances that an artist from the polling options would be chosen.
The artists in the poll were Afrojack, Alesso, Axwell, Bassnectar and Steve Aoki.
GPB Concerts Chair Jill Robinson (COL ’15) said she was unfamiliar with the results of the poll.
In past years, GPB has polled students without a guarantee that they would be able to book the winner, upsetting students who objected to what they saw as GPB’s disregard of their vote, according to former GPB Concerts Chair William Henderson (MSB ’14). However, Henderson told The Hoya in November that GPB would book the winning artist this year.
“This year, we had the opportunity where whoever won that poll was definitely going to be brought in, so I thought it was worth it to get the students involved,” Henderson said in November.
Robinson said that she was not aware of the guarantees made by her predecessor.
“I wasn’t really involved in that whole process, so I don’t know what promises were made and what they were told at the time,” Robinson said.
Tickets will go on sale online Wednesday at noon. The first 500 tickets are $20, additional presale tickets sold in Red Square will cost $25 and tickets purchased at the door will cost $30. Intern Sushi, a website for students searching for internships, is offering a $5 discount on online tickets for students who sign-up for their site.
Last year, all presale tickets for Wiz Khalifa’s performance at the spring concert cost $20 presale and $25 at the door for students, and in a November interview with The Hoya Henderson said that GPB would try to keep the cost of tickets below $20.
However, Robinson said that, unlike last year, the April 6 concert is open only to students, which contributed to higher ticket prices because non-students traditionally paid higher ticket prices.
“The company that we are working with tries to keep the ticket prices as low as possible, but we were working with them to switch up and get a better headliner, so getting a big name headliner is going to cost more money, so that’s why the ticket prices are increased,” she said.
Harris is known for mixing electronic and pop music genres. After his first album “I Created Disco,” which included such hits as “Acceptable in the ’80s” and “Colours,” the Scottish performer collaborated with such artists as Rihanna in the 10-week Billboard Hot 100 hit “We Found Love” and with Ne-Yo on “Let’s Go.”
Robinson said that she is excited Harris is coming, even though he was not one of the artists on the poll.
“He is a big name that is recognized by people who don’t just listen to [electronic dance music],” Robinson said. “He has the crossover, so I think he appeals to more of the Georgetown population than maybe some of the other DJs that we had on the list originally.”
Robinson said that she does not think that the GPB will conduct a poll again with specific artists’ names, but instead may use a poll to assess students’ genre preferences in the future.

Hamilton College professor of religion S. Brent Plate explained the role of objects and human senses in religion in his talk, “Five and a Half Objects,” Monday evening.
The event, sponsored by the theology department, was part of the Robert S. Mason lecture series, established in 2000 by Mason, a public affairs executive who studied world religions at Georgetown during his retirement.
Plate, a leading expert on religion and visual culture, studies concrete ways in which humans in the everyday world experience religion. He is also the co-founder and managing editor of “Material Religion: The Journal of Objects, Art and Belief.” The lecture was inspired by his newest book, which will be released next year.
“The crux of religion itself is our engagement of physical objects with the world,” Plate said.
Plate structured his talk around objects that humans have historically associated with religion: stones, crosses, incense, drums and bread.
“These objects are common, basic and profane,” Plate said.
Plate explained why crosses are so prevalent in religion.
“Crosses are one of the first recognizable visual forms that children are able to make,” Plate said.
Plate, however, said that the highly underrated sense of smell is most essential to human society, as shown through incense.
“There is an olfactory code that helps structure our society,” Plate said. “[Scents] are, really, social media. While it is the sense most removed from language, it is the closest to human memory and experience.”
Next, Plate said that the drum represented community, holding society together.
“In many religious cosmogonies, drums hold and sustain the universe,” Plate said. “They are sonic percussions that draw people together in space.”
In the explanation for his final object, bread, Plate cited the experience of watching his infant daughter attempt to eat everything around her as a primal means of engaging with the world.
“How do we come to know something? We taste it,” Plate said. “The proof really is in the pudding.”
Though Plate primarily focused on these objects, also emphasized the incompleteness of humans, or the “half object.”. Plate discussed Federico Fellini’s film “8 1/2,” an Italian comedic drama about a man’s attempt to deal with life’s difficulties by delving into memories and fantasies. In addition, he spoke about Aristotle’s conception of the individual as a half of a greater being. According to Aristotle, men and women were originally combined, but the gods, who were jealous of humans’ happiness, split them apart and spread them throughout the world. As a result, humans were forced to search for their “other halves.”
“Is the half something extra like a baker’s dozen?” Plate said. “The half stands as a symbol for our incomplete natures — our need for the human body to be made whole with something outside itself.”
Plate said that these five and a half religious objects — stones, crosses, incense, drums, bread and humans’ incompleteness — create the soul.
“Religion, in its deepest form, rebinds the half body to the world, thus crafting soul,” Plate said. “Soul craft is not some immutable substance, but a human production that comes and goes, ebbs and flows.”
Plate concluded by encouraging students to use all of their senses to experience the world.
“To understand soul, we would do well to listen to soul music, to eat soul food,” Plate said. “Soul comes forth when head and heart meet the world.”
Maddie Estey (COL ’16) said that she enjoyed the various connections Plate drew between religion, literature and film.
“I really liked what he said about Aristotle and the idea of the half-bodies and how he connected that to his theory of the soul,” Estey said.
