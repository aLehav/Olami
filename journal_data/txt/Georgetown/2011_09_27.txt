Combining comedy with social commentary, award-winning Arab-American comedian Dean Obeidallah spoke Friday about his mission to counter stereotypes with humor Friday.
“In America, we have a great tradition of using comedy to raise social and political issues,” he said.
Half-Palestinian, half-Sicilian and New Jersey-raised, Obeidallah has an unconventional background. He said that the Sept. 11 attacks gave him a new perspective on his own upbringing and how it relates to the world around him.
“My life changed with 9/11,” Obeidallah said. “I was a white guy before 9/11, and after, I was an Arab.”
Along with this revelation came a new take on comedy. Perceiving a growth of “Islamophobia,” or anti-Muslim sentiment, Obeidallah said he uses his shows to try to promote understanding.
“I don’t like calling it ‘Islamophobia’ — it sounds like a cute disease,” Obeidallah said. “It’s a hate movement. We have to go out and counter that hate.”
By touring the United States and the Middle East, Obeidallah said he has reached out to people of all cultural and ethnic backgrounds.
“I think what makes Dean stand out is how he takes away that veil of ignorance through a very humanizing approach,” said Cynthia Schneider, professor in the School of Foreign Service and moderator of the Q-and-A session.
Attendee Julia Tanaka (SFS ’15) said she appreciated Obeidallah’s unique take on social issues.
“Often, politicians are afraid to say what’s right because of the political capital at stake, and this is a fantastic way to truly address what needs to be addressed,” she said.
Benjamin Nickl, a graduate student pursuing his Ph.D. with the SFS and the McDonough School of Business, said Obeidallah’s talk related well to his budding dissertation on ethnic comedy.
“We have the same kind of conflict going on in Germany and all over the globe,” said Nickl.
Obeidallah has taken his brand of comedy to countries including Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, Oman, Israel, Qatar and Dubai. After performing shows for audiences in these countries, he always conducted free comedy workshops to help local comics.
Though Obeidallah recognizes the importance of countering the anti-Muslim sentiment, he also finds it difficult to quantify his success.
“People always ask if I’m making a change, and I say ‘I don’t know,'” Obeidallah said. “But I would rather take a chance and try to change something than sit back and not try at all.”
“I think with Dean, you see the combination of creativity, intelligence and humor that goes with comedy,” Schneider said. “And you see why in some ways, comedy is uniquely positioned to take on issues of anti-Muslim sentiment. I think that’s the humanizing element.”
Obeidallah said he continues his work in hope that his comedic approach encourages people from all around the world to become increasingly tolerant and willing to learn about each other.
“Some people I met in my southern tours had never met a Muslim in their lives,” Obeidallah said. “Teaching you something without trivializing it — that’s the type of comedy I aspire to.”

A Senate subcommittee voted last Thursday to keep the maximum Pell Grant award at $5,550, while cutting the National Institutes of Health budget by $190 million, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.
One part of the Pell Grant program, a six-month, post-graduation interest subsidy on undergraduate student loans, will not survive if this Senate proposal is included in the 2012 budget.
Under the proposal, the allocations for the Federal Work-Study Program and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants would be maintained at this year’s rates. At the same time, a recent release of student loan default rates reported sizable increases in the percentage of students who were unable to pay back their debts.
In terms of the NIH budget, the bill would eliminate the National Center for Research Resources. Twenty million dollars would be allocated to a new program called the “Cures Acceleration Network,” whose mission would be to speed up the process of moving research into the treatment and cure phase.
The proposal is set to be debated before the full Senate Appropriations Committee this Wednesday.

While most college seniors spend their last summer trying to network their way into a job, Nat Disston (MSB ’12) took his future into his own hands and launched VoyVoy, a clothing company with a surfer vibe.
Disston and his long-time best friend, Charlie Stanton, a senior at Wake Forest University, co-founded VoyVoy in February 2010 and have spent the past year and a half building the brand.
The clothing line touts original pocket-square polos and t-shirts that are intended to convey a fun and active lifestyle, according to Disston. The original idea for Voyvoy’s style was inspired by the surfing company Disston ran with his father while he was in high school.
“Starting my own surf business was really useful because I got to take something and make it my own and watch it grow,” Disston said.
The company’s name, Spanish for “I go, I go,” was inspired by Disston’s surfing trips to Costa Rica. The duo wanted the name to reflect the clothing’s international production, as VoyVoy’s manufacturer is housed in Peru.
Disston and Stanton have tried to incorporate their brand’s sustainable philosophy into every aspect of their business. Their Peruvian manufacturer is certified in fair labor practices and uses environmentally-friendly dyes. The corporation also donates a portion of its profits to programs that support ecological protection.
For a company so young, VoyVoy has already enjoyed an unusual amount of success.
Disston and Stanton sold their merchandise at trunk shows and retail stores beginning in June, starting in Long Island and working their way up the East Coast to Maine. Now that the academic year has resumed, the pair travels on weekends to market their apparel at college campuses.
“College students are willing and excited to try new things,” Disston said. “They are a target, concentrated group, which makes colleges an easy first route.”
VoyVoy has already found popularity at Georgetown. Jack Mohr (MSB ’12), who works with Disston at the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, spoke highly of his fellow intern and the company.
“The shirts are probably my favorite item of clothing,” Mohr said. “I think the company could really take off. It’s an awesome concept.”
According to Disston, managing a business while tackling his final year of college courses is challenging, but he is optimistic about the venture’s potential.
“Personally, my greatest challenge has been balancing everything,” he said. “But I love running VoyVoy, and it makes me really happy.”

Health Education Services kicked off its first BeWell Week Monday, featuring fitness classes and sex jeopardy, to raise awareness of health issues and on-campus resources that address them.
Tessa Telly, social norms coordinator and health promotion counselor, said students often overlook the services offered by HES.
“We’re here, we’re free and we want to make sure students [are healthy] so they can focus on academics,” she said.
Each day of BeWell Week, which is cosponsored by the Stall Seat Journal, Yates Fitness Center and The Corp, sports a different theme. Students are encouraged to be energized on Monday, relaxed on Tuesday, informed on Wednesday, proactive on Thursday, happy on Friday and connected to the community on Saturday.
“For me, from my educational background, I like the encompassing concept of wellness — not just the physical, but also the social, emotional and intellectual aspects of it,” Telly said.
Organizers said that they are most excited about the Hoya Health Hut, a mobile health office that will appear in different locations each day.
“Our office is tucked away, so this is a way for us to meet students where they are and provide health information in a fun manner,” Telly said.
The Hoya Health Hut will offer games like Georgetown versions of Plinko and Spin the Wheel, as well as free T-shirts, sports bottles, reusable bags and refreshments. Students can follow the Hoya Health Hut on Twitter to find out where to find giveaways like free drinks from The Corp and free chair massages.
“If we make it fun and more interactive and engaging, we get the students’ attention,” HES Director Carol Day said. “We’re in the process of trying to make it as interactive and entertaining as possible while still getting information across to students.”
Free yoga, meditation, cardio, water aerobics and toning classes will be offered throughout the week at Yates, along with sessions on academic success and stress relief. Free Sweetgreen frozen yogurt, a Whole Foods cooking class and a Georgetown University Grilling Society cookout will provide a culinary balance to the physical activities of the week. A volunteer event sponsored by Alpha Phi Omega on Saturday will focus on cleaning up the Potomac waterfront area.
“I think it’s great that Health Education Services is doing something like this to raise awareness about outlets on campus to live healthily,” said Jordan Megna (COL ’12), president of the Georgetown University Running Club, which is one of the 16 partners contributing to BeWell Week. The club will lead an untimed Fun Run Saturday designed to encourage students to exercise and have fun doing it.
While BeWell Week will end Saturday, Telly said she hopes students will continue to focus on health issues after the events are over.
“We wanted for all BeWell Week events to be something students could continue throughout the year,” she said.

Renowned author and columnist for The New York Times David Brooks spoke about modesty’s value for this generation in front of an overcrowded Copley Formal Lounge Monday night.
Although known as a prominent political commentator, Brooks avoided partisan remarks Monday in the talk held by the Tocqueville Forum. He spent his talk noting experiments that examine the rise of narcissism in our generation and offered an appeal to the value of humility.
“I don’t think David Brooks’ speech is going to make anyone less ambitious,” said Matthew Gorey (COL ’12). “But he can get people to take a more modest approach. [For] myself, listening to that speech is going to make me take a more humble approach to what I do.”
Sprinkling his talk with anecdotes about golf, horror movies and the impact of Katy Perry, Brooks struck a chord with many students.
“I tend to be a very confident person, but you don’t want to be that confident if that confidence is misplaced,” said Scott Hampton (SFS ’14). “In political theology, Socrates realized he was the wisest man in Athens because he knows that he doesn’t know, and I really related that anecdote to Brooks’ speech.”
Citing the example of an Auschwitz survivor, Brooks also stressed the importance of perseverance and strength.
“None of us want to lead unhappy lives, none of us want to have to go to Auschwitz,” he said. “But it seems to me that that strength of character is something we can translate to the happier times we live in … it seems to me that nobody wants to live in the 1930s, but that strength of self-effacement seems to me worth recapturing in some way.”
His answers in the Q-and-A session shifted between politics and sociology but ultimately focused on his criticism of society.
“Brooks has done a remarkable critique of young American society on the premise that there’s been a shift from the self-effacing to the self-congratulatory,” said Rev. Arne Panula, director of D.C.’s Catholic Information Center. “His argument evolves to point out an underlying fragility.”
Brooks discussed the importance of humility in learning through a reference to the movie and popular children’s book “Where the Wild Things Are.”
“Max tries to tame the wild things but fails, and that’s the way life actually is,” Brooks said. “This is a recipe for being unsure of what yourself is, a way of being — my favorite phrase — epistemological — aware of actually how little you know.”
