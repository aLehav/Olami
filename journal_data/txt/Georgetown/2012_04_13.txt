Government professor Joshua Mitchell has been tapped to serve as interim director of the Tocqueville Forum on the Roots of American Democracy and will seek to stabilize the organization after the departure of its founding director.
Mitchell, the former chair of the government department, was instrumental in hiring current director Patrick Deneen and said his academic interests align with that of the forum.
“I live, breathe Tocqueville, so I’m the obvious candidate,” Mitchell said.
As interim director, Mitchell will prioritize keeping the program afloat after Deneen leaves, a departure he characterized as a large loss to the university.
Deneen, who also serves as the Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis chair in Hellenic studies, announced in January that he will join the faculty at the University of Notre Dame next year.
“The most important thing right now is to stabilize [the Tocqueville Forum],” Mitchell said.
Mitchell and Government Department Chair George Shambaugh affirmed that that the forum will continue, though on a smaller scale. Although it is housed in the government department, the program receives no money from the university. It is therefore dependent on donations to pay its staff members and hold programming, and much of its funds are currently drawn in by Deneen.
According to Mitchell, there is a fundamental question that must be answered:
“Do donors want to continue giving without Deneen?”
Shambaugh said that the university will provide bridge funding for at least a year while the forum rebuilds.
However, contracts for the forum’s two staff members have not been renewed for the upcoming academic year. Shambaugh emphasized that the university has been pleased with the work that the staff has been doing, but is unable to maintain their salaries until funding has been secured.
“Absent financial guarantees, we won’t hire anyone,” he said. “Right now there aren’t sufficient financial guarantees.”
Mitchell, who will become interim director in June, expects to hold a year of modest programming followed by a reconfiguration of the forum. He intends for the program to retain its intellectual focus, however.
“My intellectual interest is Tocqueville. It is first and foremost Tocqueville,” he said.
According to Shambaugh, Deneen narrowed the scope on the forum, a change that may be undone as the program identifies its core mission going forward.
The search process for a permanent director has not yet begun and will most likely occur next year. Mitchell believes that it is possible that he may eventually fill the role. According to Shambaugh, Mitchell is the ideal candidate to take on the permanent directorship.
“I’m a caretaker, and I have no problem being that right now,” Mitchell said.

The Georgetown University Student Association senate will vote Sunday on a proposal to launch a game equipment rental program on Harbin Patio next fall.
The program, spearheaded by Senator Ben Weiss (COL ’15), will offer equipment for games includingcornhole and ladder ball as well as Kan Jam, a disc-throwing game.
According to Weiss, university administrators vetoed the provision of rental equipment for activities that involve a significant amount of running, such as Frisbee or Wiffle ball, in order to avoid liabilities.
Students will be able to borrow the games by leaving their GOCards with the Village C Residence Hall Office.
Weiss said that the idea for the initiative came from a call for more student space in the recently published 2012 Student Life Report.
“It was a really hot day in March and there were a ton of people on Healy [Lawn], and there was no one on Harbin Patio, and I thought, through the Student Life Report, that we could start using that space,” Weiss said.
Weiss met with Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olsen in March to propose the program. According to Weiss, administrators were very supportive of the proposal because GUSA will fund the program and equipment will be limited to stationary games.
The program will be financed by money left over after the allocation of the Student Activities Fee Endowment funds.
With the university’s backing, Weiss solicited student input through an online survey that has received more than 40 responses. He said that students were largely in favor of the program, and cornholewas the most popular game among the survey answers.
“I think that Harbin Patio is one of the most underutilized spaces on campus, so I would support any initiative to increase student use,” Luke Marrinan (COL ’15) said.
According to Weiss, if the program is a success, the administration will consider expanding rentals to other areas like the Southwest Quad.

Georgetown broke several records this admissions cycle, receiving an all-time high number of applications and recording an all-time low acceptance rate of 16.5 percent.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon, this change is good news for the university.
“The new low acceptance rate indicates that Georgetown continues to be more popular for applicants,” Deacon said. “Sixteen percent … is extremely selective. We see no value in trying to drive that down into single digits, though we could. If we did, it would leave us in a much less personal place and candidates would face an even more numbers-driven admissions process, with decreasing attention to the personal stories of each applicant.”
According to Deacon, many colleges strive for ever-lower acceptance rates in an effort to be perceived as more selective.
“[The] size of the applicant pool and admit rate … [can be] manipulated by certain policies [that] many colleges employ to try to gain the advantage of perception,” he said. “We haven’t artificially inflated the numbers by … accepting the Common Application, the primary driver of multiple and frivolous applications.”
The admitted Class of 2016 is the most diverse class in Georgetown’s history. According to Deacon, of 3,316 accepted applicants, 33.5 percent are minority students, up from 31.4 percent last year.
The admitted Class of 2016 is 15 percent Asian, 10 percent black, 8 percent Hispanic and less than 1 percent American Indian. Fifty-three percent of the admitted pool self-identified as white, 8 percent as foreign nationals and 6 percent did not specify an ethnic background.
According to Vice President of Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny, the diversity of Georgetown’s pool of admitted students is increasing, yet there is a disparity between the number of minority students who are admitted and who actually enroll.
Though Asian-Americans, blacks, Hispanics and American Indians represent about 30 percent of admitted students, they make up about 22 percent of Georgetown’s student body.
“We would certainly like the yield of minority students to be higher … [though] it is improving,” Kilkenny wrote in an email.
Yield rates, or the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university, have long been lower among minorities.
While the yield among black students has historically been about 30 percent, lower than the overall yield among accepted students of 46 percent, last year the figure rose to 40 percent.
“In my judgment, increasing the yield is a challenge, not a problem, and it is a challenge that we are tackling in a very big way,” Kilkenny said.
Geographically, at least one student was admitted from each of the 50 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, according to Deacon.
New York, home to 384 admitted students, is the state with the most acceptances. It is followed by California with 363 acceptances, New Jersey with 276, Massachusetts with 189 and Maryland with 187.

Georgetown’s most recent pair of national champions stepped into the ring last week, armed with words and hours of research, to claim victory in this year’s National Debate Tournament championship.
Andrew Arsht (COL ’14) and Andrew Markoff (SFS ’14), became the second sophomore team to win the tournament since its founding in 1947 when they defeated a team from Northwestern University.
The championship in Atlanta marked the conclusion of a year’s worth of preparation for the two victors, as well as the entire team and its coaching staff.
“Each tournament is a stepping stone leading up to nationals. In many ways, our preparation was a year-long process culminating in a few crucial debates,” Arsht said.
Throughout the year, team members spend dozens of hours each week researching the given topic, practicing speeches and evaluating prospective competitors. This year’s debate topic focused on U.S. involvement in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen.
“When we are not travelling or on break from school, we each do approximately 40 hours of research per week in addition to schoolwork,” Arsht said.
Every member of the team stayed on campus over spring break, spending 12 to 14 hours each day preparing for the national tournament.
“I think a good analogy is that it’s like going to two schools. Georgetown and debate probably have about equal work loads,” Markoff said.
According to Markoff, nerves and stress run high at the National Debate Tournament because every team who qualifies is talented and well prepared.
“We entered each debate knowing that it could be the last debate of the season,” he said. “That made us try that much harder, but no debate could have been considered easy.”
Arsht and Markoff emphasized the importance of their teammates in their victory.
“I would argue that the team is everything. Without our highly dedicated coaches and teammates, we would have no shot at winning a single debate, much less a tournament,” Markoff said.
Debate Coach Jonathan Paul recognized the importance of the entire team effort as well, crediting members who didn’t compete as integral to Arsht and Markoff’s win.
The pair said they believe that Georgetown’s debate program will only grow after the victory.
“I think that this win shows that they have brought the program back to its competitive heyday. Even if we didn’t have this victory, I still do think the team is strong and has a really bright future ahead of it,”Markoff said.

The university and neighbors will begin private conversations on the 2010 Campus Plan after the D.C. Zoning Commission approved a 60-day extension in the proceedings last week.
At the last hearing on Feb. 9, Zoning Commission Chairman Anthony Hood encouraged Georgetown and its neighbors negotiate an end to the campus plan debate, which began when the university first submitted the plan in Deccember 2010.
The granting of the extension means that parties involved will not have to file further testimony until mid June. Previously, the Zoning Commission was slated to make a decision on the case by early May.
Representatives of the university, Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, the Citizens Association of Georgetown and the Burleith Citizens Association said they welcomed the extended opportunity to communicate outside the public zoning hearings.
“We hope to come to some compromises on what the community needs and what the university needs,” Jennifer Altemus, president of the Citizens Association of Georgetown, said. “I think both of our sides are very clear on what we’ve been wanting out of the process, and hopefully if we work together we can make that happen.”
But few of the details of the conversations have been ironed out. A schedule for the discussions has not been established, and it is not clear that the issues discussed will be different from those brought up at zoning hearings.
“[Private meetings] haven’t been successful in the past, but we haven’t given up trying,” Altemus said.
The university had been meeting with neighbors to discuss the plan as it was being compiled, but those talks ceased after the plan was filed in 2010. Since then, discussion of the plan has been limited to the zoning hearings and ANC meetings, both of which are public.
The Zoning Commission has held six hearings on the plan, and this latest delay represents the third consecutive postponement of the commission’s final ruling.
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, private conversations will provide a better forum for cooperation than the zoning hearings, which often have a combative tone.
“We see [these conversations] as progress toward meeting … Hood’s request to find common ground for all involved,” Pugh said.
Chris Clements, president of the Burleith Citizens Association, echoed Pugh’s expectation.
“My hope is that we can have an honest and good discussion of the issues and come to an agreement that satisfies everyone,” he said.
According to Altemus, the Citizens Association of Georgetown plans to focus on the same concerns that surfaced at previous zoning hearings, namely the impact of the university’s long-term plans on the neighbors’ quality of life.
“[The citizens associations] have proved our case to the Zoning Commission, and the university realizes that they are going to have to mediate some of the adverse impacts that the university has had on the community,” Altemus said. “So hopefully, with both of those things going for us, we will accomplish something.”
Representatives of the university declined to comment on what issues the university hopes to discuss at the meetings. ANC Chair Ron Lewis also declined to comment.

Vanessa Correa left her post as assistant director of the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access last week, but her work will continue to shape the Community Scholars program and the lives of students after her departure.
Correa, who had worked at the CMEA since 2007, is now the retention adviser for the Pathway to the Baccalaureate program at Northern Virginia Community College, a position that helps students with the transition to a four-year institution.
According to CMEA Director Dennis Williams, several changes that Correa pushed for within the Community Scholars program — an initiative she ran — will take effect this summer. These include extending the pre-orientation program from four weeks to five weeks and adding a second course for credit.
Williams described Correa’s work as some of the most intensive in the CMEA office. Correa was actively involved in the admissions process for the Community Scholars Program, organized its summer session and supervised the students during their weeks on campus.
The scholars, who represent diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and include many first-generation college students, spend part of the summer before their freshman year taking classes to prepare for the upcoming semester.
“The intensity of the summer is one of the things that make the job difficult. It’s difficult to do that job at that level of intensity for a very long time,” Williams said.
Correa also worked as co-advisor to CMEA’s Peer Mentor and Patrick Healy Fellowship programs, but, to her students, her impact extended beyond the walls of the center.
“My relationship with Vanessa began more as a mother coming in, then a mentor and then someone who I looked up to,” Yasmin Serrato (SFS ’13), a Community Scholar, said.
Serrato previously worked as an assistant to Correa and served as a residential adviser for the program this past summer.
To other students, Correa provided a warm welcome that they did not find elsewhere upon arrival to the university.
“Because most of us are underprivileged students, we didn’t have that type of atmosphere to feel welcomed,” Justin Pinn (COL ’13) said.
Pinn said Correa provided support when he struggled with family, financial and academic hardships during his freshmen year.
While Correa also served as an academic adviser for students in partnership with their deans, Pinn noted that what set Correa apart from other faculty members was her ability to reach beyond the academic lives of students.
“When we get into higher education, we lose a sense of being personable. We forget that we are human,” Pinn said. “But Vanessa always takes into consideration who you are and your story.”
Correa played a similar role for her colleagues.
“Because she is so involved with her students, she has always been supportive of me in my relationships with my students,” CMEA Program Coordinator Jacqueline Mac said.
Mac recently made a video to honor Correa that included reflections from students and staff, many of whom described her as family.
“When you hear that from the students, it’s inspiring,” she said. “I want to be someone like Vanessa who students can go to and be comfortable sharing what’s going on in their lives.”
Correa said she is grateful for the support she received at the university and is inspired by the work CMEA has done.
“Georgetown students are driven and ambitious. It was a privilege for me to work with such an incredible group of young people,” she wrote in an email. “I will miss them the most.”
Williams said he would miss Correa but added he was certain she would continue to build a legacy of working with students in her new position.
“She’ll spend her life helping other people, and it doesn’t matter where she finds them, whether it’s here or NOVA.”

The four Georgetown professors included in “The Best 300 Professors” list released by the Princeton Review last week all expressed surprise at the honor bestowed on them.
But Hector Campos, Sam Potolicchio, Barrett Tilney and Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., all have a record of previous awards and recognition for effective teaching.
The Princeton Review partnered with ratemyprofessors.com to determine which professors would be featured in the list. Annual surveys and data were first used to determine which schools had the highest-ranked professors, and a list of 42,000 professors from those top schools was then compiled using ratemyprofessor.com rankings.
The two companies conducted their own surveys of the top 1,000 professors and reached out to administrators and students from the respective schools to finalize the list. The result was a collection of 300 professors from 122 colleges.
For Campos, associate professor of Spanish and theoretical linguistics, his selection came as a shock. Campos acknowledged that most professors maintain a love-hate relationship with ratemyprofessor.com because student reviews are often based on extreme opinions.
Students of Campos said that he was demanding, but his teaching style and passion for his subject had convinced several of them to take him more than once.
“Campos is hands down the best professor I’ve had at Georgetown,” Emely Pring (COL ’12) said. Despite having over two hours of homework per night for one of his classes, Pring chose to take a second course with Campos.
“He’s the only professor that I would ever work that hard for,” she said.
 
Carnes, a professor in the government department, said that being chosen was an affirmation of the work he does at Georgetown.
Currently on a year-long research sabbatical at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, Carnes received both the Dorothy Brown Award for Outstanding Teaching Achievement and the Edward B. Bunn, S.J., Award for Faculty Excellence last year. Both honors are determined by Georgetown student nominations and recognize a professor who has had a powerful impact on students’ experiences.
Michael Fischer (SFS ’13), a columnist for The Hoya, has taken multiple courses taught by Carnes and feels that his vocation as a priest makes him particularly effective.
“He has a firm belief in a Jesuit identity,” Fischer said. “When he teaches in the classroom and when he engages students, you know that he’s not doing it for a salary. He’s doing it because he sees the work he’s doing there as greater than himself and long lasting.”
According to Carnes, being featured on the list has allowed him to reflect on the impact of what he does at Georgetown.
“That’s maybe one of the great side effects of recognition like this … that you become aware of how much you value the things you get to do,” he said.
Potolicchio (COL ’04, GRD ’09, ’11), a visiting assistant professor and doctoral candidate in the government department, served as a teaching assistant for Carnes when he attended Georgetown as a first-time Ph.D. student. He said the number of Georgetown professors chosen reflects the strength of the faculty at the university.
“I was an undergrad at Georgetown and have had a lot of the professors. I think it really sums up just how strong the teaching faculty is,” he said.
Potolicchio, who won the K. Patricia Cross Future Leaders Award from the Association of American Colleges and Universities last year, also feels that it is a personal honor to have been chosen by students.
“That means a lot to me because the students are the ones that I walk into the classroom for. To know that I can inspire them in that way is a deep honor,” he said.
Art history professor Barrett Tilney, characterized by students as passionate and engaging, said she was also pleased that students enjoyed her classes and their relationships with her.
According to Whitney McAniff (COL ’12), Tilney emphasizes the personal lives of the artists studied in her classes — not just their artwork — and makes an effort to personally connect with her students.
“She has this ability to impart knowledge in a unique manner,” McAniff said. “She’s so personable and talks about her life outside of school and cares about students’ lives, and that’s communicated in her teaching.”

Revised plans for the new Athletic Training Facility were approved by the Old Georgetown Board last week and will now go before the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts for final approval.
“This is the third time that Georgetown has brought in a different scheme,” Secretary of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts Thomas Luebke said. “[The earlier version] was very real-estate intensive and did not have the best relationship to campus.”
Initial designs for the building, which is slated to be built adjacent to McDonough Arena, were approved by the D.C. Zoning Commission as a part of the 2000 Campus Plan process. The designs also received the approval of the Old Georgetown Board, a branch of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, in 2006, but the project was put on hold during the 2008 economic downturn.
Because the prior date set for construction had passed, plans were required to be resubmitted for approval when the university made the facility a priority again last year.
At a hearing in October, OGB members criticized plans for the ATF because the proposed facility slightly obstructed the entrance to McDonough Arena. Blueprints for the two-story, 125,000-square-foot building were modified to address those concerns.
At a meeting of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E earlier this month, members unanimously voted to not object to the modified designs, though they expressed several concerns about its lack of space for student housing. Proposed construction projects such as the ATF are reviewed by the ANC before going to the Old Georgetown Board for a vote.
The current plans include an entrance corridor connecting the ATF to McDonough Arena through a rotunda, forming what Luebke hopes will be a Hall-of-Fame-like hallway.
The ground floor of the structure will provide practice space, office suites and locker rooms for the men’s and women’s basketball teams, while the lower level will include a weight room, training room, equipment room, team meeting space and additional locker rooms for other student athletes.
The facility now faces review by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. If the commission approves the plans, however, there are still considerable steps to be taken before construction can begin. According to Luebke, minor concerns about the design remain.
“We’re not raising yellow flags. [The design] just wasn’t developed,” Luebke said.
If the ATF plans earn full approval from the commission, the university must still fundraise for the building’s construction and draft detailed blueprints.
Funds for the building, which is expected to cost about $55 million, will be raised entirely through donations. According to the university, the money will be drawn from the $125 million allocated to intercollegiate athletics in the current capital campaign.

Construction along Wisconsin Avenue that began earlier this month has some residents and businesses in the Glover Park area concerned.
Work on the Glover Park Streetscape Project, which began April 2 and is set to be completed in September, will affect the one-mile stretch of Wisconsin Avenue between 34thStreet and Massachusetts Avenue.
Planned improvements include wider sidewalks and new stoplights, in addition to lane reconfiguration.
The District Department of Transportation plans to reduce the number of car lanes from three to two during rush hours and from two to one during regular hours.
The lane changes will initially be painted on to gauge the effect on traffic. Barring any negative consequences, concrete medians will be constructed to make the lane reconfigurations permanent.
According to DDOT’s studies, the new configuration will not significantly impact congestion in the area.
However, homeowners are concerned that the lane changes will affect traffic patterns and cause drivers to use neighborhood side streets instead of the main thoroughfare.
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3B Vice Chair Jackie Blumenthal, who represents East Glover Park, explained that increased traffic on side streets could endanger local residents if those streets are not improved as well.
“It doesn’t make sense to fix one part and not the other,” she said.
Some business owners said they are skeptical about the project.
Mike Allgood, manager of Tennis Zone at 2319 Wisconsin Ave., noted that the project would only increase the pre-existing traffic issues on Wisconsin Avenue.
“Parking’s always tight,” he said. “There’s bottleneck traffic and now with construction, it exacerbates the problem.”
Others were more optimistic about the planned construction.
“They’re trying to do construction around rush hour, so we’ll see what happens,” Jennifer Ward, manager of Glover Park Hardware at 2251 Wisconsin Ave., said. “As a business, we’re just going to stay positive.”
The Glover Park Streetscape Project was one of several suggestions made in a 2006 study conducted by the District’s Office of Planning. According to Blumenthal, pedestrian safety has been an issue in Glover Park, and the neighborhood has been advocating improvements to side streets for nearly 10 years.
Residents are hopeful that other improvements, such as a crosswalk at 37th Street and Tunlaw Road, will also eventually be implemented.
ANC 3B Chairman Brian Cohen, who expressed disappointment that not all the study’s recommendations are being carried out, said he was nonetheless optimistic about the Glover Park Streetscape Project.
“Overall I think the project is a huge net gain,” he said. “It’s going to make the streets safer, it’s going to make the neighborhood commercial district more ‘walkable’ and more pedestrian friendly. It will help create more of a distinct identity for Glover Park and the Glover Park commercial district. It’s going to look better, it’s going to be safer for pedestrians and drivers.”
