An hour and a half before tip-off, Verizon Center is usually pretty quiet.
The most devoted student fans are just beginning to trickle into their seats, while maintenance crews clean the court and run checks of the sound system. But nestled into its designated area of the student section is the Georgetown Pep Band, ready to make some noise with a rousing rendition of the fight song.
Pep band President Stephanie Grice (NHS ’12) believes the group’s motto  — “Loud, raucous and out of tune since 1922” — accurately reflects the personality of the band.
“I think it fits, because we’re kind of goofy and fun,” she said.
Unlike marching bands at many larger schools, Georgetown athletics’ self-proclaimed best cheering section prides itself on being a small and accessible organization.
“There are no tryouts for our band, so for someone like me, who was a very mediocre trumpet player before I joined, I could still have all of these amazing opportunities,” Evan Cunningham (COL ’14), a co-manager of pep band, said. “I loved band, but I just thought I wasn’t good enough. But here, it’s ok if you’re not amazing at your instrument.”
It was the open nature of the 85-member group that also attracted Allison Link (SFS ’14), another co-manager, when she first arrived at Georgetown.
“Since it’s such a small band, I was able to get playing time right away. There was no sitting on the sidelines as most freshmen in other [university] bands do,” she said.
The perks that band members enjoy — including free food at events, athletic tickets and the chance to travel with the basketball teams during the postseason — are often the initial draws for new members of the band. Last year, members had the opportunity to meet former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) at a men’s basketball game. But for Student Conductor and pep band Vice President Jess Hebert (COL ’12), the true value of the group lies elsewhere.
“Once you’re in the band, it’s a lot more about being in the band community and being a part of the Georgetown athletic community,” he said.
The group plays at every home football and basketball game in addition to special campus events. If either basketball team makes it to the Big East or NCAA tournament 29 members of the band follow the squad.
The pep band must work closely with a variety of other groups throughout the basketball season.
“We do a lot of coordination with the cheerleading squad. There will be certain times when they want us to play certain songs,” Hebert said. “We also have to coordinate with athletics and with the arenaadvertisements.”
This coordination responsibility is shared between Hebert, who conducts at women’s basketball games, and professor Aaron Broadus, the director of the band.
Affectionately called “Chops” by band members, Broadus is a Washington native and well-known trumpet player and vocalist. Recently, he added several selections from D.C.’s go-go genre to the band’s repertoire to represent the city’s unique brand of funk music.
According to Grice, these latest additions have been particularly popular with local fans, who have been spotted swaying along in Verizon Center.
“If we can make people dance, our job is done,” she said.
Grice particularly enjoys when students recognize the pep band’s new songs.
“I finally convinced professor Broadus to add ‘Party Like a Rock Star,’ she said. “When I see a student go, ‘Oh! I know that song,’ it means we are doing something right.”
While the band appreciates the majesty of Verizon Center, where they once played “Hail to the Chief” for President Obama, it has a particular affinity for McDonough Arena, where the women’s basketball team plays its home games.
During a recent interview, members of the band council were anxiously checking box scores from the women’s game at Louisiana State University.
“If I could change anything [about Georgetown], I would increase awareness about the women’s team,” Hebert said.
Mara Hollander (COL ’12), band treasurer, agreed.
“We try to create an atmosphere at the women’s games that’s unique,” she said. “They’re just as much fun, but they’re fun in a different way [than the men’s basketball games].”
Hollander said that although members come from a variety of academic and extracurricular backgrounds, the group is a unifying force for participating students.
“The best decision I ever made was coming to Georgetown. The second best decision I ever made was joining the pep band,” she said. “It’s a music group, it’s a social group, it’s an athletic support group. It’s a great group of people, and it’s an amazing experience.”

Students packed The Midnight MUG to hear the recipients of The Corp’s first Midnight Writers Scholarship read their award-winning submissions Tuesday night.
Four writers — Kaylee Walsh (COL ’13), Ryan Dull (COL ’12), Ciara Foldenauer (COL’14) and Elizabeth Sinden (COL ’12) — received $1,000 for their formally submitted work.
Three others — Melissa Riggio (COL ’14), Heather Regen (SFS ’14) and an anonymous writer — won $500 each for short works written while waiting in line at The Midnight MUG.
Created by Alex Mark (MSB ’12) and Ellie DiBerardino (COL ’13), director and marketing director of The Midnight MUG, respectively, the competition asked students to submit a variety of creative writing pieces ranging from short submissions to longer poems, screenplays and stories. Winning entries received either a $500 or $1,000 prize funded by The Corp Philanthropy Committee.
“I wanted the scholarship to be something that reflected our role as the campus’s library coffee shop, and I wanted it to encourage people to get creative,” DiBerardino wrote in an email. “We agreed in designing it that we wanted to allow people to maximize their creativity in this process, so we didn’t specify many limits.”
A committee comprised of 20 students reviewed the 107 entries submitted during the month of October.
Foldenauer opened the reading with her piece, “An Aging Philanthropist,” a short story in which the narrator finds release from his monotonous life through art. For Foldenauer, the competition allowed her to explore her passion and talent.
“I submitted a piece … because I am always looking for reasons to write,” she said. “Someday I’d like to be a writer or an editor, so every writing challenge strengthens my understanding of the English language.”
Several of the submissions were re-cognized for their wit or humor.
Dull’s reading of “Ghost,” a humorous story of how a young boy discovers that a fearful phantom is actually a woodpecker, elicited laughter from the audience.
The comedic anonymous submission, “Who Dat Barista, Who Dat Barista,” written while in line at The Midnight MUG, relates the innocent actions of a young man who is people-watching while waiting in line for a midnight snack.
On behalf of the anonymous winner, The Midnight MUG donated a $500 prize and an extra $100 to the D.C. Creative Writing Workshop, a charity that teaches the power of self-expression to D.C. public school students.
Other students used the competition to experiment with their writing.
Regen’s submission, a short poem written in Spanish, presents an abstract message, allowing the narrator to express herself freely.
In her one-act script, “The Cleaners,” Walsh described the mysterious actions of cleaners Frank and Joe, using different voices and gestures to bring her play to life.
Riggio’s submission was a short piece about young love that she scribbled on an advertisement slip before handing it to a cashier at The Midnight MUG.
The event ended with Sinden’s reading of her story, “Recipe Writer,” a stylistic piece that uses short, blunt sentences to chronicle the tumultuous dynamics of a young family and the conflicts that arise as the main character pursues his love of food.
Organizers of the event said they felt that the scholarship allowed The Midnight MUG to engage with its customers in a unique way.
“I really enjoyed getting into the minds of my peers. It was interesting to see the subject matter they chose,” Jen Leahey (COL ’14), middle marketing manager of The Midnight MUG, wrote in an email. “There is such an amazing creativity flowing on this campus, and I loved giving people the opportunity to get creative and contribute their work to something other than class.”

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate District Reconciliation Committee finalized legislation Wednesday evening that will redraw the boundaries of some senate seats.
The bill, which will go to a vote before the senate Sunday, aims to address freshmen and off-campus student underrepresentation as well as disproportionate representation among dorms. The bill must receive a two-thirds majority to pass.
The proposed changes would reduce the number of at-large seats from six to four, increase off-campus seats from three to five and add one on-campus seat. Overall, the proposal would increase the number of senate seats from 27 to 28.
According to Election Commissioner Ethan Chess (COL ’14), one of the members of the committee that drafted the bill, the new system would resolve several problems with the current districting formula.
“The first thing we had to do was to keep the senate seats about the same number and [then, based] on that number, determine the best way to make sure that everyone’s vote counted,” Chess said. “Our target was to get every student equally represented, on or off campus, upperclassmen or freshmen, large dorms or small dorms.”
The redistricting committee also included senate Vice Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), Senior Counselor to the Student Body President Sam Ungar (COL ’12), the three members of the Georgetown University Election Commission and three senators.
To boost the presence of freshmen in the senate, the bill would create two blocks of first-year students. Three senators would represent a grouping comprised of New South Hall and Village C West, and another three would represent Darnall and Harbin Halls. Currently, Harbin has two senators while all other freshman dorms have one.
In 2009, GUSA reduced the number of senate seats from 35 to 25, but due to increased interest from freshmen during the most recent Student Activities Committee fair, two at-large seats were added just before this year’s elections to increase freshman representation.
“The new blocking provides freshmen with a more certain and increased number of [representatives], which eliminates the primary need of the at-large seats added in the beginning of the semester,” at-large senator Ben Weiss (COL ’15) said.
Three students would also represent the Southwest Quadrangle as a whole if the bill passes. Under the present system, Kennedy, Reynolds and McCarthy Halls are each represented by their own senator. The change would allow the best candidates living in the Quadrangle a greater chance to be elected, according to Copley Hall Senator Sheila Walsh (COL ’14).
“Previously, Kennedy, Reynolds and McCarthy Halls each had one seat,” Walsh said. “Under certain situations, for example, three great candidates campaigning might all live in Kennedy, but only one of them could be elected. But under the new blocking system … all of them could be elected.”
In an effort to reduce the variance of the size of the geographic districts, the bill would also bring the number of students in each region closer to a target number of 277.
According to Chess, the committee worked to create a system in which senators would be more accountable and more closely tied to the students they represent.
“We wanted direct representation along with geographic representation,” he said. “We wanted to make sure the system would not only be user friendly in the way that students will be able to identify with their geographic and class location, but also democratically sound.”

Chinese fervor for American education is growing rapidly.
In the past year, the number of Chinese undergraduate and graduate students at Georgetown has jumped 35 percent to a new high of 342.
Coming from a country where education is highly prized, many students hope a Georgetown degree will gave them an edge in the competitive Chinese economy.
“There is definitely this talk in China that American education is better than Chinese education,” said Yongle Xue (COL ’14), who graduated from a Chinese high school.
“If you graduate from an American university, especially a prestigious American university, you will have more job opportunities.”
But for these students, the road to the Hilltop and their time on campus are strewn with unique difficulties. Whether they are struggling with immigration concerns or navigating a new social scene, these students face challenges that are both strikingly familiar and utterly foreign.
 
GETTING IN
In the last five years, the number of Chinese students applying to Georgetown as undergraduates has jumped from fewer than 100 in 2006 to more than 350 in the admissions cycle for the Class of 2015, according to James Colman, senior associate director at the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
In recent years, admission rates for students applying from Chinese high schools have ranged from the single digits to 20 percent, Colman said. But the overall trend is towards increasingly competitive rates as the applicant pool expands while the number of spots for Chinese applicants remains roughly the same.
“Although the number of applicants from China continues to grow, we are not seeking to change the mix of students admitted and enrolling at Georgetown,” he wrote in an email.
Language difficulties can be a major barrier to Georgetown hopefuls applying from high schools in China, who often have to compete with peers who attended English-language schools in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
“For those whose English language skills are sufficiently strong, I suspect that the admit rate has not changed dramatically,” Colman wrote. “The larger number of applicants coming from China often do not yet have the language skills needed to thrive at Georgetown. This may change over time, but there remains much headway to be made in English language instruction on the mainland.”
In addition to language issues, the idiosyncrasies of the application process may also present challenges.
The application’s personal statement can be difficult for Chinese students who may never have written such essays in school.
“Writing the essay is difficult because it’s different from the way we are used to writing,” Xue said.
Diana Bao (SFS ’15) re-wrote her statement seven or eight times before she felt comfortable submitting it. Bao turned to an agency for guidance in the application and essay-writing process.
“The agent that helped me is mostly like a college counselor at a U.S. high school,” she said.
But Xue said that for other students, there is a stigma associated with using outside resources to get help with applications.
“I don’t want other people to control my decisions,” she said. “Students who do their applications themselves don’t like those agencies.”
Applying to Georgetown from overseas poses logistical challenges, as well.
Letters take about two extra weeks to go through the international postal system, so even after Xue had been notified by schools via email, she was still waiting to hear whether she was accepted to Georgetown.
When her acceptance letter finally arrived, Bao wrote on the Chinese equivalent of Facebook, “I feel closer to my dreams.”
 
FINDING THEIR WAY
Accepted Chinese students lack many of the resources Americans take for granted. They can’t log on to their class Facebook page to connect with peers before the year begins, for example, because the social networking site is blocked by the Chinese government.
But they often have more pressing matters on their minds.
“They’re always worried about being stopped at the border and not being allowed in [to the U.S.],” said Helene Robertson, director of the International Scholars Division at the Office of International Programs. “Immigration status is a huge concern.”
Though this issue is beyond the scope of what the typical Georgetown student deals with, other challenges facing Chinese students are more familiar.
Many applicants struggle to pay Georgetown’s tuition, especially because the university does not provide substantial financial aid to international students.
According to Xue, many Chinese parents will spend a great deal of their savings to allow their children to come to America.
“Most Chinese parents are willing to give everything to their children,” Xue said. “But then you still have the psychological stress that you’re taking their money. It’s very unsettling.”
Bao had a similar experience. When another university offered her money, she almost gave up on her dream of going to Georgetown.
“[Financial issues] are the biggest thing for me and my family,” she said.
Students continue to struggle with finances even after they’ve made the decision to attend Georgetown.
“I know of some Chinese students who live multiple people to an apartment,” Robertson said. “It used to be they really struggled with the cost of living [in D.C.]”
Some Chinese students seek employment in the United States to ease the financial burden.
According to Robertson, a number of scholarship programs created by the Chinese government in recent years can help alleviate students’ financial concerns, and may help explain the recent enrollment spike.
“There is a huge official push to create partnerships with American universities,” she said.
MAKING A HOME ON THE HILLTOP
Once students arrive at Georgetown, the university provides a number of resources to help international students, including international pre-orientation and global living communities.
“We try to match them up with international ambassadors [and] that has become one of the best things that we offer,” Robertson said. “Even before they come here they have a chance to connect.”
Xue said these programs make a difference.
“The OIP definitely provides a lot of help,” she said. “They introduced us to American life and … resources on campus that we can use.”
Given that the number of Chinese students studying at Georgetown is larger than ever, the OIP is also considering developing a program to meet their specific needs, according to Robertson.
“It’s something that different offices on campus have started talking about to see what challenges we’re facing and how we can best help some students…fit more smoothly into the GU community,” she said.
But Robertson is concerned that many Chinese students don’t take advantage of the resources the university already offers.
“When they run into difficulty they don’t reach out for help,” she said.
Roberston also hoped that additional programs could help Chinese students adjust to the American style of teaching — a hard transition for some students.
“The way of education is really different,” Bao said, recalling how difficult it was to transition to Georgetown from Chinese classrooms, where students are not expected to voice their opinions.
“One reason more kids apply to study abroad … is because we don’t like the Chinese education,” she said. “But suddenly, when you are encouraged to talk, you don’t know what to say.”
The altered expectations can be difficult for many.
“Because participation counted in the grade, I had to raise my hand and talk. So for my English class, I always had my hand up and I just didn’t know what to say, but I knew I had to talk or I [would] have a bad grade,” Xue said.
Chinese students also face considerable challenges in adjusting to social differences across the cultures. While some mix easily with American students, other Chinese students find it easier to befriend others from China.
“There are a lot of cultural differences that need to be unpacked,” Robertson said.
“It’s easier for us to make friends with American students who are interested in Chinese culture,” Xue said. “Some of my best American friends speak fluent Chinese or are really into Chinese culture.”
Bao agreed.
“It is natural for us to have closer Chinese friends. We are from the same background. We can easily makes jokes to each other that nobody else understands,” she said.
But Robertson expressed concern about this phenomenon.
“They are an amazingly supportive community. They take care of each other … which is a way of finding a bit of home here, but it also keeps them from interacting with others.”
Yet in many ways, Chinese students face the same obstacles as their American peers.
“They struggle with the same things any Georgetown student struggles with,” Robertson said. “They’re a long way from home. They have the expectations of their families.”

Pending the approval of several neighborhood and city organizations, Wisconsin Avenue might become home to a monthly Georgetown street festival within the coming year.
Wisconsin Avenue business owner John Hays, who first pitched the idea, envisions roping off the road from Q through M Streets once a month from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The plan would allow businesses and neighborhood groups to hold a monthly festival in the open space.
Hays is a co-owner of The Phoenix, a clothing store that has been run by his family for more than 50 years. At a forum organized by the Georgetown Business Association last week, he suggested blocking off sections of Wisconsin to all vehicular traffic in an effort to increase business revenue and strengthen community ties.
“Many cities have walking streets,” he said. “This creates a sense of community and is a wonderful way for neighbors and visitors [to explore Georgetown].”
Hays said he hoped that the proposal could be implemented within the next year, but first it must be approved by the City Council, Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, the District Department of Transportation and other city agencies along with several business and neighborhood groups.
Democratic City Councilmember for Ward 2 Jack Evans said that city planners would need to find a way to redirect Wisconsin Avenue’s regular traffic before the proposal could be considered.
“An event like this would take a lot of planning, and we couldn’t just close down the street. We would need to offer [alternative routes],” he told The Hoya.
James Bracco, executive director of the Georgetown Business Improvement District, echoed Evans’ views of the proposal, emphasizing the need to reroute bus lines that usually run on Wisconsin.
“Wisconsin Avenue is a major way in and out of the city,” Bracco said. “It will really depend on the residents more than us [as to whether this idea will be approved] since traffic will have to be rerouted through the neighborhoods.”
Students who frequent the street on weekends expressed enthusiasm about the idea.
“I’m all for outdoor markets,” Lina Jamis (COL ’12) said.  “I think that if they defined boundaries, rezoned places and made alternate routes [for traffic] clearly marked, the idea could work well.”
But according to Bracco, the plan is still a long way from becoming a reality.
“This is not a high priority, but it is on our to-do list,” he said.

Students from a variety of religious backgrounds gathered for the Student Interfaith Council and the Office of Campus Ministry’s annual Interfaith Thanksgiving Prayer Service in McShain Lounge Tuesday night.
Jordan Denari (SFS ’13), president of the council, and Lisa Pannucci, interreligious coordinator, organized the event, which aimed to recognize the diversity of beliefs on campus.
“I hope [students are] able to think a little bit deeper, not only about their own spirituality and where they stand in their faith journies, but about the other [beliefs] that they see every day,” Pannucci said.
Denari challenged the audience to focus on and give thanks for the positive influences in their lives.
“Gratitude helps us to achieve better perspective about what’s important in our lives, and I charge all of you to give yourselves these moments of reflection during these busy days at Georgetown,” she said.
Denari also emphasized the importance of an interfaith community.
“Though we may go about the practice of our faith in different ways, we all are searching, and that is one commonality that we will always share,” she said.
Participating groups included the Catholic Student Association, the Latter-Day Saints Student Association, Buddhist Meditation Sangha, Muslim Student Association, the Protestant Student Forum, the Hindu Student Association, Jewish Student Association and the Orthodox Christian Fellowship. Prayers included readings of a Buddhist meditation, selections from the Book of Mormon and Hindu prayers.
Students emphasized the need for peace during this time of Thanksgiving and the importance of expressing one’s faith.
“Thanksgiving to God is not a passive thing; it’s something we take and live with,” Ivan Plis (SFS ’12), a member of the Orthodox Christian Fellowship, said.
The service also included the perspective of an agnostic, Jesse Milzman (COL ’15). He admitted that in past years he was unsure of how to celebrate Thanksgiving. He now focuses, however, on the relationships he has formed as a source of gratitude.
“I realize I am thankful every day, not to God, but to those in my life who are meaningful,” he said. “The love of friends is something that all people experience regardless of their faith.”
Interfaith Council Outreach Chair Aamir Hussain (COL ’14) concluded the service by explaining the significance of the bag of cracked corn that was placed on every attendee’s chair, a tradition that symbolizes hardships suffered by the Pilgrims during their first winter. Hussain entreated the audience to give thanks for everything, both big and small.
“As you gather around your Thanksgiving table to give thanks, place five kernels of corn at each place as a reminder of how far we have come and how far we have yet to go until all our brothers and sisters can take their rightful place at the table,” he said.

The Center for Student Programs will soon interview three candidates for assistant director of student programs, a position that has been vacant since August.
Former Associate Director Bill McCoy left the university last summer to become director of LGBT awareness at Bucknell University.
“A successful candidate for this job will demonstrate an understanding of the priorities and complexities of supporting a highly engaged student population in creating a vibrant co-curricular experience in a Catholic and Jesuit higher educational context,” Erika Cohen-Derr, director of student programs, wrote in an email.
The Center for Student Programs will conduct the interviews in the next few weeks, with the goal of choosing a new assistant director in time for the spring semester. The new hire will also serve as adviser to the Student Activities Commission, as McCoy did during his tenure.
In accordance with standard CSP protocol, students are invited to contribute to the process as part of a search committee. According to Cohen-Derr, interested students will have the opportunity to meet with candidates in both formal and informal settings.
According to SAC Chairman-elect Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), dates for two interviews are currently finalized, while the last is still tentative.
Appelbaum hopes that the new assistant director will aid in SAC’s transition to the new comprehensive budget funding system this winter.
“We’re looking for someone that’s open to hearing student opinions, open to working with students collaboratively and finding a way to solve issues that is compatible with student wants and university policy,” he said.

Though it may be only a small group of protesters based out of a tent city in McPherson Square, the Occupy DC movement has a newspaper. At a modest length of four pages, the first issue of The Occupied Washington Times was published on Nov. 8. The newspaper reports on the happenings of the Occupy DC movement and provides a venue for participants to voice their opinions on the movement and political happenings. The Occupied Washington Times is not to be confused with The Occupied Washington Post, a similar publication created by another Occupy movement going on in Freedom Plaza.
“The main goal of the Times is to show people the issues with our current government, show them what’s really happening,” says Sam Jewler, a member of the publication’s editorial board.  While not authorized by the general assembly of the movement to give official opinions, the newspaper does have the support of the group, as it is occupiers who write the articles published in the paper.
One quality that sets the Times apart from most other, more traditional publications is its “bottom-up” nature. Instead of having control of the newspaper and its content concentrated at the top, the power over the publication lies in its Occupy DC base. Only 25 percent of the articles in each issue may be written by editors, and editorial board membership rotates, meaning that no member may be on the board for more than three consecutive issues. This keeps articles focused on the issues that really engage the Occupy population and the board’s perspective diverse.
As a concrete manifestation of the Occupy movement, an important use of the paper is to involve the public. To do this, occupiers have been passing out newspapers at Metro stops and distributing them on the streets near McPherson Square. Because the paper is completely independent in terms of funding, the paper also involves the general public by inviting them to financially support the paper.
For the first edition, a company in New York printed 10,000 copies of the paper for $12,000. The vast majority of that money came from individuals outside of the Occupy DC base but sympathetic to the cause.
Just as the Occupy movement seems to be around for the long haul, so does The Occupied Washington Times. The paper’s goal is to release a new edition every two weeks with more and more papers being printed every time.
Many of the paper’s goals for its growth have been set following strong reception from other Occupy movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Baltimore. Both movements received several hundred papers and are eager for more.
Whether or not one agrees with the Occupy movement, the ability of the occupiers at McPherson Square to create a publication out of a city of tents is remarkable. If you would like to see an online version of the paper, check out the website at owt.occupydc.org.

Study abroad programs nationwide have now begun to rebound following the 2008 financial crisis, but the number of Georgetown students studying abroad never dropped during the downturn.
According to the Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange released last week, study abroad participation dropped 0.8 percent in 2008-2009, the first time in the report’s 25-year history that the numbers decreased.
During the recession, many colleges cut funding for study abroad programs and financial aid for students studying abroad, while others were forced to forgo all but a few program offerings, the report said.
But recent polls indicate that study abroad programs are once again on the rise. According to the Open Doors Report, 270,604 students earned academic credit for studying abroad during the 2009-2010 academic year. This marked a 4 percent increase from the 260,327 students who participated in the previous academic year.
Throughout this turbulence, Georgetown students’ participation in study abroad programs has remained consistently high, according to Director of Overseas Studies Laura Monarch.
According to Monarch, about 57 percent of Georgetown students will go abroad at some point during their academic career. In contrast, 14 percent of American undergraduates studied abroad during the 2009-2010 school year.
“Here at the Office of International Programs, we continue to see large numbers of students coming to our open houses, information sessions and individual advising appointments,” she said.
In the past four years, over 900 Georgetown students have studied abroad each year through semester-long, full-year and summer programs.
Monarch added that Georgetown’s strong financial aid offerings helped maintain the university’s overseas presence during the recession.
“Since Georgetown ensures that financial aid is transportable to semester and academic year study abroad programs, studying overseas continues to be a viable option,” she said.
Currently, a financial aid package for a student participating in a university-approved study abroad program takes into consideration tuition, rooming and boarding fees, textbook costs and flight expenses. The university also provides small fellowships to supplement traditional aid offerings.
Representatives of the Office of Student Financial Services declined to give statistics about students receiving financial aid for overseas study.

Donna Rose, a transsexual who champions the right of self-expression, spoke Tuesday about her personal experiences and challenged traditional views of gender roles as part of Gender Liberation Week.
An author and advocate for the transgender community, Rose acknowledged that although transsexuality is an uncomfortable subject for many, it is one that must be addressed.
“If you don’t put a face to it, things will never change,” she said.
Born as a male, Rose knew by the age of 6 that her body did not express her sense of self. Without an outlet for discussion of transgender issues, she hid her insecurities.
Rose realized in her mid-40s that she could not hide her true self any longer. In her lecture, she said that witnessing a successful surgery was the impetus for beginning her own physical transformation.
Rose described both the physical pain of the procedure and the emotional pain of rejection by her son and wife. She documented the experience of moving away from her family through letters and journal entries that she eventually compiled into a book, “Wrapped in Blue.”
Describing how her new femininity affected various aspects of her life after her transformation, Rose said that the privileges she received as a white, middle-aged man disappeared after the surgery. Rose told her audience that she makes $10,000 less as a woman than she did as a man.
She added that her sister worries because she is not conscientious about her personal safety as a woman.
“I don’t know what it’s like to feel vulnerable,” Rose said. “My life experience didn’t give me that fear.”
Rose is currently training for the freestyle women’s wrestling event in the 2012 Olympics. Although her transition was difficult, she now speaks nationwide about her experiences and about issues affecting the transgender community, always attempting to leave her audience with a positive message.
“You are more than the sum of your parts,” Rose said.
Her talk, which was sponsored by the LGBTQ Resource Center, Diversity Action Council, The Lecture Fund, GU Pride, Men of Strength, GU Minority Association of Pre-Health Students and the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action, opened Gender Liberation Week.
The week will conclude with a vigil in Red Square Friday afternoon in honor of Transgender Day of Remembrance.

Creators of independent film production company Wong FuProductions spoke to more than 300 students Thursday about establishing both a name and an identity within the entertainment industry.
Phillip Wong, Wesley Chan and Ted Fu, who started producing videos in 2003 while attending the University of California, San Diego, drew a crowd from Georgetown, Johns Hopkins University, The George Washington University and the University of Maryland in the Intercultural Center Auditorium.
The speakers began the talk with a recollection of their humble beginnings.
“I met these guys at our third year of college. All of us were visual arts majors taking the same class,” Wong said. “Initially, we were making videos and uploading them online just for fun, and that’s how our video started to spread around.”
The group felt that UCSD was not the best place to major in film, but Wong said the lack of resources trained the friends to produce videos under all circumstances.
“We had friends who went to actual film schools,” he said. “They told us they needed $15,000 to produce a film that required huge crews, insurance and permits. A few years go by, and they haven’t produced any movies yet.”
After graduating from UCSD found themselves unemployed and unable to pay their rent, but they continued to make videos.
“A lot of people think we had specific goals when we started Wong Fu or we just decided to try to become famous on the internet,” Wong said. “There wasn’t any plan, but things just naturally fell into place as we [tried] our best to adapt.”
Though Wong Fu’s films tend to address Asian stereotypes, the founders insist that their productions can and should appeal to a broader audience.
“A lot of people told us, you are representing Asian Americans, but we never thought of that and didn’t start Wong Fu to represent Asians at all,” Wong said. “But we do have a lot of Asian merits in our films, which may be a shock to a society that doesn’t usually see a lot of Asian faces on the bigscreen.”
Taiwanese American Student Association President Wei-In Lin (COL ’13) said in the past, the group has largely held lectures on political issues, like Chinese-Taiwanese relations.
“The topics were mainly on politics, but not so much on culture and identity,” Lin said. “I thought it’d be a good idea to lighten up a bit by bringing a group that a lot of people can identify with.”
The event was sponsored by TASA, along with the Chinese Student Alliance, Asian American Students Association, Japan Network, Korean Students Association and Vietnamese Students Association.
“This is the first time that this many Asian clubs came together to support an event,” Lin said. “With all the clubs backing up the event, we were able to get the funding not only from the Lecture Fund, but also the Students of Colored Alliance, Georgetown University Student Association, Diversity Action Council, Georgetown Program Board and [the Department of] Asian Studies.”
CSA Treasurer Kevin Fong (SFS ’13) and Lin said that the goal of inviting Wong Fu Productions to campus was to create an awareness of the Asian American identity.
“It’s a very understated subject that isn’t ever touched upon, here at Georgetown,” Fong said. “WongFu presents and deals with Asian stereotypes in a way that is humorous, yet truthful.”

Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) discussed the current Arab-Israeli conflict and potential solutions to the problem Tuesday.
The event was sponsored by the Georgetown University College Democrats, Georgetown Israel Alliance, GU Pride and J Street U Georgetown, As a part of Israel Issues Week, the discussion was designed to increase awareness about the situation in the Middle East.
In his talk, Polis stressed the need for a peaceful two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. He proposed the restoration of Israel’s 1967 borders and a series of land swaps to formally establish boundaries between Israel and Palestine.
“The land is really one of the easy impediments,” Polis said.
According to Polis, the more serious barriers are irresolvable claims to power within the region, because both Palestine and Israel feel entitled to the land.
He also discussed the need to continue providing American aid to Israel.
“This would be a very dangerous time to zero out foreign aid,” Polis said. “It’s the job of many of us Democrats in the room to hold the Republican’s feet to the fire on their sensibly pro-Israel policies when they talk about zeroing out foreign aid to Israel.”
He added that the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran — which would further disrupt the unstable forces in the area and threaten international security — is a primary concern for the United States and Israel.
The lecture was also an opportunity to raise awareness about Georgetown’s recently established chapter of J Street U, a national organization that seeks to increase understanding of Israeli issues and promote a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Jason Gerson (SFS ’14), co-president of the university’s chapter of J Street U, believes that support for this organization is particularly important for Georgetown.
“I think that particularly Georgetown has a very strong interest and investment in what happens in regions outside of our own, which include the Middle East,” he said. “[There is a general] consensus that concessions on both sides are needed and that a peaceful resolution in this conflict is imperative.”
