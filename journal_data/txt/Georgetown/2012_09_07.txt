One year after a magnitude-5.8 earthquake shook the District last August, causing substantial damage to the Washington National Cathedral, the church has received a $5 million donation for repairs from the Indianapolis-based Lilly Endowment, a private philanthropic foundation that supports community development, religion and education.
The donation covers a quarter of the estimated $20 million in damage to the cathedral, a sum that officials say will facilitate the first substantial repair to the cathedral’s limestone edifice.
“The Lilly Endowment’s generous gift of $5 million … really is transformative in our ability to officially begin the restoration phase, which started with laying the first repaired stone in the tower a couple of weeks ago,” Richard Weinberg, director of communications for the cathedral, said.
Though millions of dollars have already been spent on repairs caused by the earthquake, most of the funds have been funneled toward strengthening the building’s structure.
“Over the first year, we were doing stabilization work. We were removing damaged stonework from the building and were able to safely reopen after being closed for 10 weeks after the earthquake,” Weinberg said. “Future work is really dependent on funding.”
Weinberg added that the prioritization of future repairs will be determined by a volunteer task force, which is due to produce a report in October.
“We have a host of experts that are volunteering their time in the fields of construction, engineering [and] architecture. … As we go about restoring the cathedral, we have to consider how to best steward the funds,” Weinberg said.
The Washington Monument, the other main D.C. landmark to be damaged by the earthquake, has also benefited from major philanthropic gifts. According to the National Park Service, which runs the monument’s website, philanthropist David Rubenstein made a $7.5 million donation in mid-January. Combined with funds from Congress, Rubenstein’s grant is sufficient to complete the full repairs to the monument.

Renovations to Dahlgren Chapel are well under way as the fall semester ushers the community back into the worship space.
The two-year, $8 million restoration of the chapel began in 2011 with a leadership gift of $6.2 million dollars from L. Francis (CAS ’75, LAW ’78) and Kathleen (SFS ’77) Rooney.
This summer, the Manhattan Construction Group drilled 110 micropiles which will balance the chapel on bedrock, providing better foundational support. Once the foundation is repaired, attention will turn toward the chapel’s interior, where the university hopes to paint, update seating and move the organ.
Gina Bleck, Georgetown’s assistant vice president for planning and project management, expressed surprise that the Rooneys were willing to donate to the project.
“We’re amazed that the Rooney foundation [was] willing to donate to something that will largely go unseen,” Bleck said. “Nevertheless, the work is so important to maintaining this structure for hundreds of years to come.”
Students who attend mass at Dahlgren said that signs of the construction are noticeable but not entirely disruptive.
“The chapel is still being renovated, so I haven’t really noticed anything new. I’m sure it will look great when they finish, but for now, it pretty much looks the same as last year,” Michelle Mohr (COL ’15) said.
While the heavy construction period came to an end as classes began last week, work on the exterior of the chapel will continue throughout the fall semester.
According to Manhattan Construction Group Project Manager Greg Davis, the chapel’s stained glass windows were removed for cleaning and will be reinstalled after the building’s foundation settles.
The windows’ historical glass has been preserved entirely, and Davis expects the windows to be reinstalled by the beginning of November.
The majority of the interior work will focus on the relocation of the organ, whose pipes will stand along the Sacred Heart windows on the west facade of the chapel.
“The relocation of the organ will place it directly behind the altar and near to where the choir stands, which will be much better for sound,” Bleck said.
In an article last winter (“Dahlgren’s Interior Plan Unveiled,” The Hoya, A4, Feb. 10, 2012), students, faculty and priests voiced concerns about the location of the tabernacle, which is currently situated on the right side of the chapel.
“I am particularly disappointed by the failure to restore the tabernacle to its proper place in the center of the church,” Kieran Raval (COL ’13) said. “In initial discussions about the renovation, this was seen as a goal, but that has been revised.”
According to Bleck, the tabernacle will remain on the right but will be more visible when visitors enter the chapel, and the Paschal candle will also be moved to a more obvious location.
“People who want to come into the chapel for private prayer will now be able to see the tabernacle more easily,” Bleck said.
But the deadline for the restoration is still unclear because the progress of construction is dependent on raising the remaining necessary funds.
According to Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (CAS ’88), alumni and couples who were married in the chapel have aided the renovation process by making both large and small donations.
“A $200 gift from an alumnus means just as much to me as a $20,000 gift because it shows thatDahlgren Chapel means something to them,” he said.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Gina Bleck was the project manager for Manhattan Construction Group. She is actually the assistant vice president for planning and project Management at Georgetown. The correct version was posted at 5:39 p.m. Sept. 7.

The Georgetown University Student Association urged Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson to approve changes to the Code of Student Conduct’s evidentiary standard in an open letter sent Sept. 5.
Last spring, the Disciplinary Review Committee, which is composed of students, student affairs administrators and university faculty, passed a resolution recommending that the burden of proof for all disciplinary actions be raised from the current standard of “more likely than not” to “clear andconvincing.”
“The [student conduct] system appears unpredictable and opaque, and few students view their interactions with the Office of Student Conduct as a learning experience. More specifically, many students have noted that the ‘more likely than not’ standard is inherently arbitrary in that it allows for a significant degree of uncertainty and individual error in the Code of [Student] Conduct judicial process,” the letter read.
Current policy rules that a student will be found responsible for a disciplinary violation if the arbitrator believes the student was “more likely than not” responsible for the transgression. The new standard would demand a higher level of certainty from the adjudicator and would apply to all violations of the Code of Student Conduct, except incidents of sexual assault, for which the U.S. Department of Education mandates a “more likely than not” burden of proof.
After the DRC passed the recommendation, GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) posted an idea on the h.Roundtables IdeaScale site, urging students to support the recommendation.
The idea garnered 346 votes and elicited a response from Olson.
He said that the issue required careful consideration because the DoE requires a “preponderance of evidence” standard for sexual assault cases.
“I appreciate everyone’s comments on this important issue. I want you to know that this is a complex issue, on which the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights has recently issued guidance,” Olson wrote in response to Gustafson’s IdeaScale post last year.
In response to Olson’s concern, the open letter stressed that the DRC’s recommendation would still maintain the “preponderance of evidence” standard for sexual assault cases.
According to GUSA Chief of Staff Jake Sticka (COL ’13), GUSA and Olson maintained ongoing conversations throughout the summer.
“[In] the initial weeks, he said that he was doing fact-finding, trying to figure out what peer universities were doing and whether or not this would be a good move for Georgetown,” Sticka said. “From May through July, we had several conversations with [Olson] about it. Throughout that time, he said he was considering it and still was personally conflicted and didn’t know how he felt about it.”
Gustafson said that in the end of July, the Office of Student Conduct decided to invite other universities to conduct an external review of the office to take place at the end of September. The review will include the examination of the Division of Student Affairs and its staff and the Code of Student Conduct.
Gustafson said she was not sure if the external review was prompted by the DRC’s recommendation or if it was merely routine. However, she indicated that the review will likely delay Olson’s decision.
“Now Dr. Olson is talking about how he will wait until after the review is over and … the reviewers have turned in their report, which we suspect won’t be until January or the end of December,” Gustafson said.
Sticka explained that Olson believes a review of the entire office will allow him to examine the change of the burden of proof standard in a more holistic manner. But Sticka pointed out that the DRC has already conducted extensive research and undergone rigorous discussion on the change.
“I think some elements of the conduct office certainly could benefit from a holistic review, but clearly, this standard isn’t one of those things that is necessary for a review,” Sticka said.
Olson said he wants to have the standard addressed during the external review.
“I take the recommendations of the Disciplinary Review Committee seriously and am thoughtfully reviewing this issue. As we are holding an external review of the Office of Student Conduct and related policies later this month, I have decided to add this issue to the set of issues on which the reviewers will advise us,” Olson wrote in an email.
Both Gustafson and Sticka expressed disappointment about Olson’s delayed decision, especially when compared to the speed at which the Code of Student Conduct was changed this summer as a result of 2010 Campus Plan negotiations.
“We saw a lot of changes made to the … Code of [Student] Conduct coming out of the campus plan in a process that students were not involved in,” Sticka said. “It’s discouraging to see that ad hoc process take precedence over a longstanding committee that has looked at this issue for a long time, especially considering [that] there were no students involved and there were students involved in the DRC.”
According to Sticka, students and faculty expressed concerns about the lack of movement on the issue since the recommendation was first made in April.
“I think it’s our hope that the letter will convey to [Olson] the seriousness with which the students have looked at this issue and also convey to him the degree to which [GUSA] and other campus organizations are really willing to push for this,” Sticka said.
Olson said he will wait until after the review to make his decision.

With its growth potential thwarted by space restrictions in Georgetown and limitations imposed by the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, the university has begun to look beyond its main campus for a place to expand.
Georgetown has operated satellite campuses for its Law Center and School of Continuing Studies for a century, but administrators have suggested that this new location would relocate a wider variety of programs, including graduate programs, away from main campus.
SCS recently announced plans to consolidate its three locations into a new 91,000-square-foot facility, dubbed Georgetown Downtown, in Mount Vernon Square, and the university has hired developer Forest City Enterprises to develop a strategy for further long-term expansion in D.C.
While an Aug. 26 report in The Washington Post said that Georgetown is eyeing a tract of land of about 100 acres either next to RFK Stadium or on park land in Ward 8, Chief Operating Officer ChrisAugostini said that the university’s master plan for expansion will shift and develop based on input from students, faculty, Forest City and neighborhood groups.
“The [plan for 100 acres] is just a proxy. We don’t know what that will mean actually,” Augostini said. “We have to take information from the process we engage our students and faculty in and determine where would be the best place to grow going forward.”
Augostini’s office has helped facilitate Hoya Roundtables, which gather feedback from students and faculty to determine necessary changes to main campus and generate input on possible expansions.
Augostini said that the university will primarily look to expand into less desirable parts of the city that are set to be gentrified in the coming decades. He cited Forest City’s track record of helping transform run-down areas such as the Navy Yard in southeast D.C. as a main reason the university selected the developer.
“Because of our constraints, particularly financially, we want to have someone here [who] is able to take very interesting sites that might today be unappealing but would have really strong future value,” he said. “Georgetown is an institution that with a very small endowment, competes with the very wealthiest institutions. We need to be creative [and] energetic.”
Gary McManus, spokesman for the Washington office of Forest City, said that the firm’s wealth of experience in D.C. made it a good fit for the project.
“Georgetown recognizes that it is a challenge in a metropolitan area like … D.C. to find a large plot of free land open for development,” McManus said. “Forest City has taken on many large-scale D.C. projects in the past … so we have the insider knowledge on how to make the most out of the area.”
University administrators said that Georgetown’s intent to situate further expansions outside zip code 20007 was pivotal in bringing about the compromise with neighbors that ended the 2010 Campus Plan negotiations. But Augostini insisted that his office has been compelled to explore new sites for a host of reasons, not just backlash from neighbors.
“We began the conversation last fall, and then as we began to have larger conversations it became clear … that [hiring a development consultant] was something we needed,” he said. “It actually far preceded the discussions with the community in terms of the neighborhood settlement. … We’ve tried to divorce this process from the campus plan.”
Augostini added that this master plan, which spans 20 or more years in scope, ends an era of short-term thinking that has afflicted town-gown relations in the past.

Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dennis Ross spoke about the Arab Spring and its implications for the Middle East in an event sponsored by the Program for Jewish Civilization on Thursday.
Ross, who has served as an advisor to Presidents Bush, Clinton and Obama, joked about his bipartisan career.
“I spent a long time working with Arabs and Israelis; I figured I might as well work with Republicans and Democrats,” he said.
His lecture, titled “The Arab Awakening and Its Implications,” focused on the events in the Middle East, describing them as an ongoing awakening rather than a fleeting spring, and the future of Iran and Israeli-Palestinian relations.
“It may not have been easily predictable when this would take place, but it was predictable that if change came, Islamists were going to have all the advantages in the early going,” he said.
Ross explained that the environment created by rulers like Hosni Mubarak, former Egyptian politician and military leader, resulted in all organized resistance occurring in mosques, separate from the secular arena.
Ross also discussed steps that Israel and Palestine both must take in order to achieve peace, relating the conflict to events in the broader Arab world.
“Both on the Arab Awakening and the issue of peace, the circumstances are dramatically different than they have been, but there is always something to be done. And only when you decide there is nothing to be done do you make that a self-fulfilling prophecy,” he said.
Students who attended the lecture were pleased by Ross’s foreign policy expertise.
“I’m a total standard SFS nerd and I followed Ross before I came here, so I was very excited,” CharlyJaffe (SFS ’13) said.
Ross currently teaches a course entitled “Statecraft and Negotiation” in the International Affairs program.

As election day approaches, the Georgetown University Students Association, College Democrats and College Republicans are teaming up to register students to vote.
Registration drives will be held throughout the fall leading up to election day on November 6, with a planned drive every day during the last week of September and the first week of October, according to GUCR President Maggie Cleary (COL ’14). The drives will allow students to register for a specific political party or remain independent.
“Any group that wishes to be involved can be,” GUCR President Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) said. “This is a forward push to register no matter the party affiliation.”
College Democrats Director of Communications Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) echoed this sentiment.
“Voter registration is a very bipartisan thing. It is something we have joined with [College Republicans] in the past and will continue to do so in the future,” he said.
To speed the registration process, GUSA has provided software called Turbovote that allows students to vote at their local polling locations or have a mail-in absentee ballot sent to their university address.
“We’re working with College Dems and College Republicans, … to incorporate Turbovote becauseTurbovote works with everything,” GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) said about the new technology.
In conjunction with the student-led registration efforts, University Registrar John Pierce sent out an email last week encouraging students to vote and providing information on the registration process.
“The university encourages all students who are eligible to vote in this season’s elections to do so,” he wrote.

The District Department of Transportation is developing plans for a 37-mile streetcar system that may bring streetcars back to Georgetown for the first time in over 50 years, pending approval by neighborhood groups.
DDOT has already begun construction on a track along H Street and Benning Road, which it plans to open by next summer.
This 2.2-mile track, which includes a stop at Union Station, is a small fraction of the planned 37-mile streetcar system that will eventually link all eight wards of the District. DDOT plans to complete the construction in phases and has outlined a 22-mile priority track.
The 22-mile priority track includes a “One City Line” that will run from Union Station to an unspecified location in Georgetown. According to John Lisle, a DDOT spokesman, this could have many benefits for the area.
“It means more transit options for the residents of Georgetown, the students there, people who visit Georgetown, people who shop there, people who work there,” he said.
Lisle also cited the new system as a way to address the limited parking space in the neighborhood and surrounding area.
The system could have drawbacks, however. According to Bill Starrels, commissioner on Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, there is a possibility that neighborhood groups will not approve the new plan.
“A concern was the potential of an overhead wire, which would be a conflict for the historical nature [of the area], but overall we’d pretty much like to see streetcars as part of the transportation plan for Georgetown,” he said. “We’re a historic district and that would have to be approved … not just [by] the commission but also the Old Georgetown Board and Commission for Fine Arts.”
Overall, Starrels was supportive of the new transportation opportunities, and said that hopefully new technology would eliminate the need for aboveground wires.
“I think streetcars would be wonderful for Georgetown,” he said
While a timeline for the future tracks has not been set, DDOT issued a request for information on June 26 asking the private sector for feedback on the prospect of privatizing the streetcar system to accelerate the construction process. They have since received 20 responses to the request and plan to begin reviewing them over the next two months.
According to Lisle, responses came from around the world.
“We received 20 responses from some of the biggest names in the industry,” he said. “We have plans for the streetcar system, but we don’t have concrete plans for what this scenario or arrangement would look like if we did a public-private partnership with an outside firm or team of firms. … I would imagine that with 20 submissions there’s probably a wide variety of ideas put forward.”
As its next step, DDOT will begin reviewing information submitted by industry experts and considering the best options for the streetcar system.
“We would take that information and … put it out there for bid to say, ‘This is exactly what we’re looking for; who can provide it?’” Lisle said.

Amid the chaos of freshman year, Ignatius Seminars offer a comfortable setting in which students can acclimate to the rigors of collegiate academic life.
Designed exclusively for first-year students in the College, Ignatius Seminars were instituted in 2006 by former Dean Jane McAuliffe. Since then, the program has expanded from six seminar offerings to 11 this year.
According to Dean Chester Gillis, the seminars’ main objective is to introduce first-year students to intellectual life at Georgetown.
“The idea of these courses is for first-year students to have someone they can look to as a mentor … and have someone to introduce them to university life during their first year and hopefully in the future as well,” he said.
Gillis personally selects all Ignatius Seminar professors, who then teach a seminar for the next three years.
“I want someone who will invest himself or herself in this seminar in a personal way. This is not just another course. It means developing a relationship with 15 other students, and I am looking for people who are good at that and want to do it,” Gillis said. “If you take this seminar, these students will know you really well.”
The group of professors chosen to lead the seminars spans nine university departments and includes University President John J. DeGioia.
For the past three years, DeGioia has taught “Working on Ourselves: Imagination, Interior Freedom and the Academy,” which explores the opportunities that are available in the context of the university as they relate to establishing one’s own sense of self.
According to DeGioia, the course encourages students to scrutinize the meaning of authenticity.
“Part of [the course] is an exploration of what it means to decide and act on our most deeply held values and the obstacles we confront that prevent us from doing that,” DeGioia said.
According to DeGioia, freshman fall is a perfect time to take the course, since it serves as a period of exploration and experimentation for new students.
“The most powerful thing is watching the trajectories of students. … We were all first-years once. We all had different expectations … and this material requires a certain kind of approach that has to be learned,” he said. “Watching the material come alive is the most powerful experience that you can have.”
Department of English professor John Pfordresher, who teaches “Italy and Imagination,” said that the small, discussion-based nature of the seminars also helps acclimate students to a potentially overwhelming university teaching style that consists mostly of lectures.
“Many faculty members have been concerned about how some incoming first-year students find themselves in several large enrollment classes and feel enmity and may get turned off [because they] feel like one of many,” Pfordresher said.
According to Peter Jorgensen (COL ’15), a student in department of government professor JamesLengle’s seminar, “Following in the Framers’ Footsteps: Rewriting the Constitution for the 21stCentury,” the class eased his transition to campus life during his freshman fall.
“Everyone was in the same place — transitioning to college — so being with a small group of people who were in the same position and who held, to some degree, the same interests you did was a great way to get acclimated,” Jorgensen said.
Capped at 15 students, the seminars encourage students to work closely with their classmates and professors. According to department of Slavic languages professor Marcia Morris, many students form strong bonds during the first semester.
“There is something about this particular seminar where everyone really wanted to be there — isn’t doing it for some particularly practical purpose — that brings them all very much together,” Morris said. “[My students] learned to respect each other. … There gets to be a camaraderie.”
Students praised the intimate setting of Morris’s class, “Shifting Selves: Changelings and Doubles,” which they said facilitated the formation of friendships.
“My favorite part was how supportive professor Morris was. … She offered so much advice on things not even related to the class and genuinely cared about how we were all doing,” Gianna Maita (COL ’15), who took Morris’s seminar last year, wrote in an email. “I miss the rest of the class. We all became friends.”
Professors say they also benefit from the close-knit community formed in the seminars.
“It’s been a joy for me, getting back with a small class of first-year students,” Lengle said. “It has reinvigorated my enthusiasm for teaching because of that one-on-one relationship you can have with the students in this setting.”
Gillis encourages Ignatius Seminar professors to bolster their courses with unusual approaches to the material of their choice.
“It’s a perk for the professors as well as the students because the professors get to teach anything they want. And it doesn’t have to be anything in their field,” department of Spanish and Portuguese professor Barbara Mujica, who teaches the seminar “Faith, Fiction and Film,” said.
The seminars are also unique because the university grants each professor a $2,000 stipend to fund activities outside the classroom.
“The best part about [the seminar] is the chance to extend our interaction beyond the classroom,” department of psychology professor Jennifer Woolard said regarding her course “Creating and Sustaining Community.”
According to students, time spent outside the classroom is often the most enjoyable aspect of the seminars.
“My favorite part was the times when we went out to dinner as a class and got to talk about what we were reading at [The] Tombs instead of a classroom in the ICC,” said Bo Julie Kim Crowley (COL ’15), a student in Morris’s seminar.
Although the Ignatius Seminars do not fulfill any College general education requirements, many professors said they believe this makes the courses more appealing.
“It doesn’t count for anything. Everyone is there because they choose to be there. It’s small, personal,” department of history professor John Tutino said of his seminar, “Us and Them: The United States and Mexico in Film, Literature and History.” “I have historically … thought that the best [students] to teach [are] first-semester freshman. They are engaged, interested and have not yet learned from upperclassmen to take their education for granted.”

University administrators and student leaders elaborated on plans for the New South Student Center at a Georgetown University Student Association forum Thursday evening.
The 16,500 square foot center will include a general common room, separated by casual, formal and dining areas. Dining facilities will run a pub-style restaurant and Students of Georgetown, Inc. plans to open a new food service operation, a made-to-order salad and smoothie shop, which was recently approved by the university.
Although the university aims for the space to serve as a hub for student life on campus, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said that office space for student clubs and organizations will not be incorporated into the center.
“[Incorporating club spaces into NSSC] would squelch the living room atmosphere,” he said.
GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) echoed Olson’s statement.
“We don’t want it to be another Leavey Center,” she said.
According to Students of Georgetown, Inc. CEO and President Michael West, the university administration asked The Corp to brainstorm a new food service operation for the NSSC earlier this year.
Joseph Tattoni, an architect with ikon.5 who attended the forum, said the space will include individual study and meeting rooms and an arts component. Tattoni also said the design will incorporate as many environmentally friendly features as possible.
According to Tattoni, the design stage will continue through spring 2013 and the final price of the project will be announced in February. Construction will commence in spring 2013, and last until fall 2014.
Gustafson praised the NSSC design process, saying that it has allowed students to share their input on the future of the university.
“I think this has been a really great process in which the architects have been very interactive with the students,” Gustafson said.
Olson added that the university will be organizing further discussions between students and university administrators throughout the year to brainstorm other ways to foster a more engaging social environment on campus.

The first few weeks of fall semester are always a whirl of activity for student groups; club leaders rush around campus, attempting to establish their organizations’ appeal to wide-eyed freshmen and uncommitted upperclassmen.
This is especially true for Sigma Alpha Epsilon, a fraternity founded in February by a group of 24 then-freshmen, which is now trying to recruit its second-ever class of pledges.
SAE leaders say that operating as an upstart fraternity on a campus that does not recognize Greek organizations comes with a unique set of challenges.
Though fraternities’ primary appeal is usually the opportunity to be a part of a historic organization,SAE’s founders must find a way to raise awareness and recruit new members without the benefit of long-standing traditions and institutional memory.
“One thing that distinguishes us from [other Greek organizations] is the fact that we’re new and building this from the ground up,” Recruitment Chair Nick Baker (COL ’15) said. “They’ve settled into their ways, and we’re hitting our stride and figuring out what this group’s going to become.”
But before new fraternities can focus on what they aim to become, they must first find a way to establish themselves on campus.
Due to the university’s dissociation between the university and Greek life, students who lead fraternities and sororities at Georgetown rely on assistance from their respective national organizations.
“Since last fall, when I started making phone calls, we haven’t gone through the university at any [time],” Christian Keenum (MSB ’15), founder of Georgetown’s SAE colony, said. “We’ve tried our best to see what other fraternities and nonrecognized groups are doing so we don’t push any boundaries.”
According to Keenum, SAE sought advice from Adelfi, a female group on campus that was founded in a similar manner in 2004, during the beginning stages of its venture last year. “We’ve had help fromAdelfi, asking them how you deal with [different topics] … so we don’t make Georgetown angry.”
Similarly, unofficial faculty advisors and local brothers helped the founding members of Phi Iota Alpha, a local chapter of a national Latino fraternity, establish a presence on campus last spring.
“We’ve experienced a ton of alumni support in the area,” the PIA President Christian Veliz (COL ’14) said. “They provide resources for us that we hope to expand to campus.”
Veliz said he decided to launch the fraternity at Georgetown in an effort to provide more institutional support for Latino students.
“We all felt a bit of discontent with the [Latino] community here,” he said. “Our organization prides itself on preservation and promotion of Latin American culture, and it’s based on the idea of pan-Americanism.”
Meanwhile, Keenum’s goal of establishing a chapter of SAE at Georgetown arose from a personal connection.
“My brother was [in] SAE at the University of Michigan, and when I looked around for fraternities, I really liked what SAE modeled: the true gentleman,” he said. “The ‘true gentleman’ is basically the ideal that SAE lives and dies by. It defines the characteristics that every SAE brother must uphold.”
Last fall, Keenum first began the process of fostering an SAE presence on campus by gauging his peers’ level of interest in the project.
“I started a Facebook thread among all my friends to see if they were interested in helping me startSAE at Georgetown,” Keenum said.
Keenum initiated a conversation with the SAE national advisers in response to enthusiastic feedback about his idea, and SAE Eminent Supreme Archon — the national president of SAE — Ken Tracey later visited campus.
While still only a colony, SAE plans to gain charter status in the spring of 2013. According to Keenum, becoming chartered is an 18- to 24-month process; however, the colony believes it can attain its goal within 12 months.
“[The national organization] provides us with goals that we have to meet for each month,” Keenumsaid. “Currently, for the next three to four weeks, our goal is to get good quality men to join our colony and educate them on the rules and values of SAE.”
Though SAE is mainly a social fraternity, the members participate in community service and organize philanthropy events. The group plans to partner with the Children’s Miracle Network and the Wounded Warrior Project, a program that provides services to injured soldiers as they transition to civilian life.
According to Keenum, maintaining the national traditions of the fraternity while beginning new traditions at a non-Greek school will serve as both a challenge and an advantage.
“We want to be unique, and we still want to follow the SAEtraditions and have our own identity,” Keenum said. “This environment allows us to be ourselves within a national organization.”
SAE has come under scrutiny in the last year because of its hazing habits at other colleges. The brothers at Georgetown said they believe that this is where Georgetown’s unusual atmosphere could be an advantage.
“At a traditionally Greek school, you have certain expectations. Here, since we don’t have that … we [have] the ability to do all the good stuff without doing all the bad stuff,” Baker said.
With a turnout of over 100 people at the Student Activities Fair, SAE will likely expand greatly from its current 39 members.
Meanwhile, PIA, which is the oldest Latino fraternity in existence, appeals to a more specific community at Georgetown.
Veliz said he believes that Phi Iota Alpha offers a unique way for members to embrace Latin culture.
“[PIA’s] goal is to cultivate young Latinos into men with high moral values who are leaders and professionals in their communities,” Veliz wrote in an email.
Throughout the semester, PIA’s six brothers will focus on celebrating and sharing Latino culture and history with other Georgetown students. They plan to fundraise for nonprofit organizations, host celebrations for Latino events and educate the campus about Latino history on a weekly basis though Twitter and Facebook.
They did not set up a table at the Student Activities Fair and do not plan to actively recruit new members.
“Recruitment is largely internal. The group hasn’t come to a decision about what we should do. Membership is open to everyone, but the process itself is intended to be self-selective,” Veliz said. “We think that for new students coming here [who] would be first-semester freshmen, it would be a huge commitment — one they might not be ready for.”
As the two groups continue to grow, Zack Hubbard (MSB ’13), president of Sigma Phi Epsilon, said he is happy to see other Greek organizations on campus.
“We love to see more fraternities starting at Georgetown, because having more students in Greek life gives the university and administration the opportunity to see that there are a lot of positives that come with fraternities and sororities,” Hubbard said.
