Tuesday marked the 10th anniversary of the Georgetown Scholarship Program, which provides financial aid and a robust support system to 625 students from all 50 states and nine countries, particularly those who come from low-income backgrounds or are first generation college students.
According to GSP Program Director Missy Foy (COL ’03), GSP celebrated its 10th anniversary with a party for donors, university administrators and alumni mentors in October. Students and alumni of the program shared stories of their experiences with the hashtag #GSProud on the program’s anniversary Tuesday.
“Saxbys at 6 a.m. to do homework and realizing how fortunate I am to have the privilege of education, thanks to @GSPhoyas
#GSProud ‬#ClassatGU‬,” Anthony Do (NHS ’15) wrote in a tweet.
“Getting too emotional reading these #GSProud tweets. Feel so humbled to be in the presence of incredible peers,” Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15) wrote in a tweet.
GSP scholar Bserat Ghebremicael (MSB ’17) from Las Vegas, Nev., said that she has found community and mentorship through the program.
“Last year, GSP was there for me when I struggled in homesickness, struggled in my pre-med classes and struggled financially,” Ghebremicael wrote in an email. “The struggle was so real. But it was comforting just being able to talk about these things and get them off my chest. That’s when I realized that GSP was my home away from home. That’s when I realized, that I was in a network of incredible people with incredible stories — people I can relate to and people I can mentor and get mentored by.”
When GSP Scholar Andrea Jaime (NHS ’17) died from bacterial meningitis in September, Ghebremicael said that GSP hosted a Sophomore Strong Summit to bring the group together.
“They brought all these GSPers together as a community in support of one another and re-energize each other, and it just goes to show how invested they are in the success of every individual, no matter their background and socioeconomic status,” Ghebremicael said. “They saw potential in us when we were at our low points and continue to see our potential at our high points, and that’s why I have succeeded at Georgetown thus far.”
GSP scholar Stephanie Estévez (COL ’16) from New York said that the program has helped her develop an individual identity.
“GSP has helped me in the journey toward becoming acclimated to an environment and culture so drastically different from my hometown of Harlem, offered endless emotional support and provided a community with which I’m able to closely identify,” Estévez wrote in an email. “Most importantly, they continue to remind me that being of a low socioeconomic status shouldn’t be something I intentionally try to conceal. It’s an integral aspect of my identity that has shaped my experiences, fostered my resilience and made me who I am today.”
GSP Scholar Isaiah Jones (COL ’16) from Virginia said that the community has been an invaluable source of many forms of support during his time at Georgetown, helping him find a job and intern in New York over the summer.
“GSP is my second family on campus because the staff gets to know every student individually and is there for us no matter what we need, whether it is advice, money, food, winter coats, a laptop or just someone to vent to about a terrible grade we got on a test,” Jones wrote. “GSP is my conversation starter, my social and professional network, my best friend but most importantly, my village.”
As GSP has supported students on campus over the past 10 years, GSP scholars have also contributed to campus life in a number of ways, Foy said.
“I think our students make Georgetown a better place, a more relevant place, because they come with so many diverse experiences,” Foy said. “They literally come from all over the country: rural, urban, suburban. … I think they each bring a pretty unique and diverse set of experiences, life experiences to our campus and then hopefully into the classrooms and their dorm rooms.”
According to Foy, the program has plans to grow in the future and find a larger office space to accommodate more students.
“We’re extremely grateful to be in Healy, to feel like right here at the center of the university,” Foy said. “I think the fact that we’re even here in Healy is a recognition that the university prioritizes us as a program and our students and values and hopefully our student’s contributions. But we are a little strangled for space, so we’re thinking down the road about how we can expand physically to match the growth of our program.”
Foy also said that she hopes to expand professional development services, offer more skill building classes and push for further donations to grow the program after its first 10 years.
“In the world of access and first-generation college attendance there’s been just a lot of bad news and negativity,” Foy said. “And this is a great opportunity to highlight that it isn’t all doom and gloom, that there is hope if schools do the right thing. And we have a model that that really seems to be working.”

The Smithsonian Institution will renovate museums and gardens on the South Mall campus to improve infrastructure, visitor services and accessibility in a multiyear project that will begin in 2016, the institution announced Nov. 12.
The $2 billion redesign and restoration of the world’s largest museum and research complex will affect museums located between the National Mall and Independence Avenue SW, notably the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Arts and Industries Building, the Smithsonian Castle, the National Museum of African Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, the Freer Gallery of Art and the S. Dillon Ripley Center. The other Smithsonian museums and galleries on the National Mall — the Air and Space Museum, the American Art Museum Portrait Gallery, the American History Museum, the National History Museum, the Postal Museum, and the Renwick Gallery — will remain untouched.
The proposed South Mall Campus Master Plan will be implemented over a 10- to 20-year period, combining major projects that will improve infrastructure of the Smithsonian museums and galleries, reinvent the style of the South Mall campus and ensure the energy efficiency of the complex. The cost of the master plan will be split between federal funding and privately raised funds, though fundraising has not begun yet.
Smithsonian Public Affairs Specialist Becky Haberacker explained that the renovations will focus on the oldest part of the Smithsonian campus.
“The proposed plan makes these museums more accessible to our visitors and better connects them to one another. It enables us to provide visitors with a better experience when they come to visit,” Haberacker said.
Haberacker confirmed that, despite the renovations of the South Mall campus, the respective identities and goals of each museum would remain the same.
“The mission and focus of each of the museums won’t change. The proposed South Mall Master Plan increases the usable space for the museums and helps all of the spaces — both above and below ground — flow together better. It also provides more space for public programs and educational activates,” Haberacker said.
The master plan was designed by a Denmark-based architectural firm, Bjarke Ingels Group, which has worked closely with the Smithsonian Institution to develop the redesign ever since the group’s proposal was chosen in March 2013.
“The design has a modern aesthetic that works in harmony with the classic architecture of the buildings that already exist in the South Mall Campus,” Haberacker said.
BIG founding partner and Master Plan architect Bjarke Ingels expressed his excitement regarding the redesign of the South Mall campus.
“It’s a great honor and a humbling challenge to reimagine one of the most significant American institutions on the front lawn of the nation’s capital,” Ingels said in a press release from the Smithsonian Institution. “We have created a new landscape of connectivity and possibility. We believe this plan holds the potential to guide the Smithsonian South Mall campus into the future while remaining firmly rooted in its heritage.”
The centerpiece of the master plan is the restoration is the Smithsonian Castle, which was built in 1855 and is the oldest structure of The Smithsonian Institution. Currently used as an information center and as headquarters for the institution, the castle will add two underground floors for visitor services, a cafe and a shop that will have direct access to the Enid A. Haupt Garden and the Ripley Center.
The redesign will also construct pathways to connect the museums and gardens on the South Mall campus.
“Currently, the museums are not connected to each other if you are traveling east to west or west to east on the campus. The proposed plan will link the museums together both above and below ground to enable visitors to move from one to another more easily,” Haberacker said.
The proposed master plan still awaits review by the National Capital Planning Commission, which will work with The Smithsonian Institution to ensure the renovations fulfill the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and Section 106 of the Historical Preservation Act. An updated master plan will be issued in a formal meeting in December.
Dan Corry (COL ’15) was excited by the changes, hoping it would inspire more students to visit the museums.
“[The Smithsonian is] a really important resource that is right at your fingertips. You have all these specialized museums basically in one place, and because of the Georgetown bubble, they are really underutilized by Georgetown students. How many people do you know who have gone to the National Museum of the American Indian?” Corry said. “I am excited to see how the renovations turn out.”
Andrea Roos (SFS ’17) agreed that the renovations would be a positive change.
“I’m excited that it seems the government is putting a higher priority on educating its public through methods other than the schooling system. It’s a move in the right direction,” she wrote in an email.

The Georgetown University Student Association’s new Office of the Student Worker Advocate, which aims to address any concerns of student workers in a confidential, peer-to-peer setting, held its first series of office hours last week.
GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said the idea stemmed from student feedback. In order to maintain confidentiality, he did not elaborate on specific grievances, but touched on a range of issues, heard both from individual complaints and from survey data.
“We identified that there was a need for student workers to be able to have other students they could talk to about employment concerns, perhaps before they went to the student employment office and started entering the university bureaucracy,” Tezel said.
GUSA Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) said OSWA provides an extra resource for students who may need guidance navigating employment conflicts.
“It’s much more about disseminating information and really helping students through the process. It’s not necessarily providing them with the information that the actual offices are providing them with,” Jikaria said. “It’s more about helping them through the process and feeling like they can actually go to a confidential resource and understand how to approach their problem in the first place.”
Tezel said that the new advocacy group was modeled after the Student Advocacy Office, which addresses students’ judicial concerns. Julia Hubbell (COL ’15) serves as a student worker advocate and, as OSWA grows, will appoint other students to various positions. Hubbell received training from the Student Employment Office regarding intricacies of student workers at Georgetown. She also meets with the Student Employment Office biweekly to discuss both individual and broader issues raised by OSWA.
Hubbell said that both the university and Dean of Student Financial Services Patricia McWade have been supportive throughout the development of OSWA.
“We’re looking forward to a relationship where we can talk honestly about student experiences in being employed at Georgetown,” Hubbell said.
According to Hubbell, one main problem that student workers face is late paychecks with regards to Georgetown Management System.
“There are huge numbers of student workers on campus, many of who feel disrespected or confused about their rights on the job and these sorts of complaints would generally float around Georgetown,” Hubbell said.
Hubbell said a large part of this issue lies in the fact that student workers are simultaneously employees and students, which can lead to a destructive workplace culture. Additionally, student workers know that there are always other students in need of a job that can replace them if they do quit.
“Students also experience the dynamic of being a student, which feels much more powerless. It feels like there is less recourse, and it fosters a defeatist attitude,” Hubbell said.
In light of the recent anonymous confessions of resident assistants in the Georgetown Voice about mistreatment from the university, the GUSA Senate passed “A Resolution Addressing the Mistreatment of Residential Assistants of Georgetown University” at its Nov. 16 meeting. The resolution calls for the university to conduct an internal review of allegations brought forth by the RAs.
Hubbell said OSWA is a resource for any RAs who want assistance in navigating this campus-wide issue.
“OSWA is absolutely beginning a larger campus conversation about what life is like as an RA for our students,” Hubbell said.
Hubbell added that the office has already reached out to student working locations, such as Residence Hall Offices, in a publicity campaign that ran last week. Additionally, OSWA has its own Facebook page to reach student workers and bring awareness to this new resource.
Sinead Schenk (COL ’17), who works as a student guard, one of the most popular on-campus jobs, noted that her experience working for the university has been relatively easy. She added that one time she was paid late, but after a quick email to her supervisor, the problem was corrected immediately.
“I don’t know how it is for other student workers, but I’ve never heard anyone complaining about their work in a negative way, that they would need extra help,” Schenk said. “But maybe it’s a good idea for some people. I just don’t think its 100 percent necessary.”

Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich., CAS ’49, LAW ’52), the longest-serving member of Congress, will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a ceremony at the White House on Nov. 24.
Dingell, who has served in the House of Representatives since 1955 and represents Michigan’s 12th Congressional District, announced his retirement earlier this year. He succeeded his father, John Dingell Sr., in office and will be followed by his wife, Deborah Dingell (SFS ’75, GRD ’98), who won the seat Nov. 4, making her the first woman to be elected to the seat of a living, retired husband in Congress. Dingell holds the record for the longest uninterrupted tenure in Congressional history.
“There are few words that could accurately describe my thoughts and feelings in receiving this wonderful honor,” Dingell said in a statement.“It is especially meaningful to me to receive this recognition alongside such a distinguished and diverse group of individuals that truly represents the ideals and values that have made this nation great. I am most humbled by this recognition, and I thank President Obama for his kindness in awarding me this prestigious honor.”
President John F. Kennedy established the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963 as the United States’ highest civilian award. Over 500 people have previously received the award, and 19 civilians will join their ranks on Monday, including Meryl Streep, Stevie Wonder and Tom Brokaw. Last year’s awardees included President Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.
Dingell joins the three of members of the Georgetown community to recently win the award. Jan Karski (G ’52, H ’83), a World War Two resistance fighter and Georgetown scholar, and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the Mortara Distinguished Professor of Diplomacy at Georgetown, won the award in April 2012. Former senator Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), a Georgetown public policy professor, won in 2013.
“I look forward to presenting these 19 bold, inspiring Americans with our nation’s highest civilian honor,” Obama said in a statement released by the White House. “From activists who fought for change to artists who explored the furthest reaches of our imagination; from scientists who kept America on the cutting edge to public servants who help write new chapters in our American story, these citizens have made extraordinary contributions to our country and the world.”
On Monday, Dingell was also awarded the LBJ Liberty and Justice for All Award from the Lyndon B. Johnson Foundation, along with Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.). Dingell stood next to Johnson when the then-president signed the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law after he fought vigorously for the bill, and Dingell has since advocated for environmental regulation and health care legislation.
The 88-year-old representative will leave office at the end of his term in December.

The Georgetown University Police Department will expand its self-defense class offerings, which have been limited to courses for women, to include a class for LGBTQ individuals and a class open to all students regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity next semester.
The university has offered self-defense courses for women for about four years and is offering two new courses after receiving criticism for restricting these offerings to female students.
The courses are designed to teach students basic self-defense in case of assault and are offered in four hour standalone sessions open to a maximum of 20 people in Reiss Science Building classrooms.
The classes, taught by a certified self-defense instructor with training in krav maga, a popular self-defense system that blends elements of various fighting styles, will consist of general safety presentations concerning possible risks, as well as a variety of self-defense tactics and lessons on how to handle physical confrontations.
They follow the same general model as previous classes, but techniques taught will differ depending on the gender identity of participants.
The classes were initially only offered to women because they are more likely to face sexual violence. Additionally, some female students indicated that they would feel more comfortable in a class that was tailored to women.
After hearing student complaints about the restrictive nature of these self-defense classes, the Georgetown University Student Association Student Health and Safety cabinet staff sent out a campus-wide survey last week asking students if they would be interested in taking a self-defense class, and if they were, if they would prefer a class limited to their gender, specifically for LGBTQ individuals or with people of all identities.
“Some people were interested in gender specific classes, some were interested in LGBTQ specific classes, and most people were interested in classes available to everyone,” GUSA Student Health and Safety Secretary and Sexual Assault Peer Educator Nora West (SFS ’15) said. “We just wanted to look to see if students outside of women would be interested in these classes and we found out that they were.”
The survey’s results convinced Georgetown University Police Department Chief of Police Jay Gruber to expand beyond women-only self-defense classes.
“It’s a wonderful class, and we got great feedback,” Gruber said. “I’m really excited to offer classes to a different audience this spring semester. I hope the classes are packed.”
Sexual Assault Peer Educators will be present at each course to discuss risk prevention, according to West.
Take Back the Night President Sarah Rabon (COL ’16) said that while the classes are a good first step, they will not solve the problem of sexual assault on college campuses.
“For some people, self-defense classes can be incredibly empowering,” Rabon said. “However, these classes do not address the deeper is
sues of rape culture that play a role in letting perpetrators of sexual assault to continue to do harm.”
Rabon warned against placing the onus on women and using self-defense classes as an excuse to justify victim blaming.
“It is never the responsibility of survivors to engage in attempt to prevent their assault,” Rabon said. “Survivors of assault that did not elect to take a self-defense class made no error and cannot and should not be judged or blamed for that choice.”
Additionally, Rabon emphasized the importance of self-defense classes restricted by gender identity or other factors in creating a comfortable atmosphere for participants.
“For the students that do want to take these classes, I think it is important to make sure they are offered in a format that makes the students feel safe and comfortable,” Rabon said. “That may mean limiting some individual sections to students that identify with certain genders or sexual orientations.”
Self-defense classes have recently seen a growing increase in popularity, particularly among college students.
A national self-defense curriculum called the Rape Aggression Defense Systems program, or RAD, is taught at over 1,200 universities and colleges around the country. At some schools, these classes can be taken for credit.
This class was previously taught at Georgetown in 2009, but the large time commitment of 12 hours of training led the university to abandon the program after three years. In D.C., the RAD program is offered at American University, the Catholic University of America and Howard University.

Over a year after the discontinuation of the “ReImagine Georgetown Grant” program, Students of Georgetown, Inc. and the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union will distribute remaining funds to painting murals on campus, bringing “Starry Night Over Georgetown” back to campus.
The project plan currently includes two murals, one along the wall in front of Yates Field House facing the street and the other on the wall in the stairway between the second and third floors of Lauinger Library.
The combined cost for the murals will be $3,000 — most of which is from leftover funds from previous ReImagine Georgetown projects, which include the Georgetown Farmers Market and the Winter Hoyaland that furnished Healy Circle with Christmas decorations. According to Students of Georgetown, Inc. CEO Sam Rodman (MSB ’15), students had plans for a similar art project that received RIG funding in 2012 but graduated before the project came to fruition.
Rodman said that GUAFSCU tapped into unused RIG funding, while The Corp funded the difference to reach $3,000.
“The way we see it is that we wouldn’t exist without the Georgetown community, we wouldn’t exist without students who patronize our services,” Rodman said. “We want to make sure that we’re consistently challenging ourselves to find the most high-impact voices to grant some scholarships or even more creative outlets.”
The Lauinger mural will be a remake of the “Starry Night Over Georgetown” that was chalked in Red Square last winter, while the Yates mural, whose official design is yet to be determined, will be more school-spirit oriented. The artists must hear back from the athletics department before finalizing plans for the mural in Yates.
Georgetown University Student Association Senator Mandy Lee (SFS ’17) learned of leftover RIG funds and asked The Corp and GUAFSCU for monetary support to revitalize the mural project. Lee said she decided to revamp the mural project to bring art to campus because she thought that the arts presence was lacking.
“There’s really not a huge presence in terms of the arts community, and living in the city, we’re surrounded by gorgeous murals,” Lee said. “I thought this would be an extremely cool idea, especially since I found out it had been attempted in the past.”
RIG, which was discontinued last fall due to logistical problems with continuing the projects, was created in 2007 as a partnership between GUASFCU, The Corp and The Hoya that aimed to better the community. The Corp and GUASFCU provided funding, while The Hoya provided marketing.
GUSA Senator Meredith Cheney (COL ’16) helped develop plans for the project and said that she received over 20 submissions for mural ideas from students. Agree Ahmed (SFS ’15), who chalked an interpretation of Vincent Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” in Red Square in December, will recreate the piece in paint on Lauinger’s wall.
“From all the hype that it got when it was chalked in Red Square last February, we thought it would be a more perfect piece of art to highlight somewhere around campus,” Cheney said.
Lee said she is eager to develop more concrete plans for the Yates mural since its designs will involve student input.
“We’re actually working with athletics to try and come up with something that revolves a little bit more around school spirit,” Lee said. “We haven’t come up with a design or anything yet; we have designs that were submitted by students last year which we’re looking at, as well as the design team over at athletics is working on a few different designs.”
Although Vice President for Planning and Facilities Robin Morey has approved the Lauinger mural, the library’s administrators have not yet approved it. Cheney said she hopes the Lauinger mural will be finished by February but that the Yates mural may take longer.
“We really need to wait ’til the end of basketball season to hear feedback from athletics,” Cheney said. “Their designers are quite busy.”
According to Cheney, GUSA is looking to paint murals in other locations on campus in the future.
“We don’t have any other locations as of yet but we’re definitely looking for proposals,” Cheney said. “The criterion that we have stuck with for determining a location is high visibility and somewhere central on campus. According to Lau [aministrators], on a given day Lau receives about 4,000 people. “
Justin Chen (COL ’17) said he was a fan of last year’s Starry Night but was hesitant about how the money was being used.
“Honestly, there might be better uses of resources than doing murals like that,” Chen said. “I think they’re nice to look at, but I don’t see them adding a lot to the campus community.”
Chen said he hopes that the Yates mural will acknowledge the pluralistic Georgetown experience.
“[I want] something that reflects diversity on campus, something that reflects the amount of different cultural groups that we have on campus,” Chen said. “I think that would be really cool to capture in a mural.”

Georgetown’s Kennedy Institute of Ethics received a $3.6 million donation from Kathleen McNamara Hugin (COL ’82) and her husband, Robert, this week to fund a faculty chair in ethics and help develop Georgetown’s Ethics Lab.
The donation will be split with $3 million going toward endowing the faculty chair in ethics and the remaining $600,000 being used for phase two of Ethics Lab, according to a news release put out by the university.
“The gift is truly transformative for the Kennedy Institute of Ethics,” KIE Head of Communications Kelly Heuer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It represents both a commitment [to] the continued stre`ngth of its faculty — historically a great strength — as well as an investment in the future of the institute and its experiments in what engaged ethics can be and do here at Georgetown and in the world at large.”
The gift was given in honor of Hugin’s father, Francis J. McNamara Jr. (C ’49, LAW ’51).
The Kennedy Institute of Ethics was founded in 1971 and is a center for “practically engaged ethics” with a scope that spans all areas of applied ethics, according to Heuer. Ethics Lab began its second phase last year and gives students hands-on experience with solving complex ethical dilemmas.
One of the projects undertaken by Ethics Lab this year is led by Spencer Wells, the founder of the National Geographic Genographic Project and a current Ethics Lab Scholar in Residence. Wells’ class is exploring the ethical dilemmas of testing individual genomes. After discussion, students are allowed the chance to test their genomes or the opportunity to refrain from testing. The students’ findings will be shared with National Geographic at the end of the semester.
Blake Meza (NHS ’15) participated in an Ethics Lab class last year.
“I didn’t realize how much of an impact it had on me until it was all over. My creative thinking, participation in ethical discussions and confidence in presenting material all skyrocketed. It’s amazing how much one class can change how you view so many things,” Meza said in a university news release about Hugin’s gift.
The donation will help to ensure that Georgetown is at the forefront of ethical debates in the world as well as help develop a strong foundation of ethics in Georgetown students, according to Heuer.
“I believe that the work we are doing with Ethics Lab has the potential to change how moral issues are addressed in a fundamental way, and we are so grateful for the vision and generosity of Kathy Hugin and her husband Bob for investing in this potential,” Heuer said.
The university’s Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said that the university appreciates the donation. as it makes bioethics research possible.
“We are grateful that members of our community support the academic work of the university, and especially the important and groundbreaking bioethics research taking place at our Kennedy Institute of Ethics,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Supporting the research of our faculty is an institutional priority for us and we support that work with university funding and resources. Philanthropy advances this work even further, and makes transformative research possible.”

After receiving authorization from Congress in January 2014, the Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation will move forward with its plan to construct a commemorative sculpture in Washington, D.C., to celebrate the 53-year history of the service organization.
Roger Lewis, chairman and president of the Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation, explained that the idea for a commemorative sculpture originated in 2008 in anticipation of the organization’s 50th anniversary in 2011, fitting well within the restrictions of the Commemorative Works Act of 1986, which limits the creation of commemorative works in the District to honoring events at least 25 years in the past.
“The notion was that the creation of the Peace Corps in 1961 was a very significant moment in American history. We believed, as did Congress, that the ideas in its creation were now a part of American history,” he said.
The Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation was established with the sole purpose of creating the memorial. Although the design has not yet been finalized, Lewis noted that a Peace Corps commemorative work would serve as a positive addition to the District.
“We have a city full of commemorative works, monuments and memorials, mostly honoring the generals and admirals in wars. And wouldn’t it be nice to add something to that archipelago of monuments, memorials and commemoratives, something that was about making peace, America doing things for the cause of peace and goodwill?” Lewis said.
Erica Burman, director of communications for the National Peace Corps Association, a nonprofit for returned Peace Corps volunteers, echoed Lewis’ sentiments and added that the Peace Corps will fill a void in the current makeup of the city’s monuments, memorials and commemoratives.
“When you look over the monuments, over the Mall, when you take the trolley tour of Washington, there’s a lot of war and dead presidents,” she said. “There’s nowhere where you can see other elements of our national narrative sort of written on the typical landscape.”
She emphasized the project’s characterization as a commemorative, not a monument, to reflect the modesty of the Peace Corps.
“It would not be a large statue or something grandiose, because that’s just not in keeping with what the Peace Corps represents,” Burman said.
The Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation is currently in the process of securing a specific site for the project and will conduct environmental and historical assessments on four possible locations. One site that is preferred at this time, but not yet confirmed, is a quarter-acre space near the Capitol at the intersection of Louisiana Avenue, First and C streets. None of the sites lie on the National Mall itself, which is currently closed to the construction of any new structures.
As the foundation moves forward with design plans, it plans on holding a national design competition in 2015.
After the design is picked, the foundation will work with the National Capital Planning Commission to approve the design. NCPC Senior Urban Planner Lucy Kempf said NCPC will be a source of guidance but will not dictate any specifics.
“It’s generally in the staff evaluation of any site — we’ll talk about the goals for the site, but we wouldn’t be descriptive about what the design has to be,” she said. “I think the related dialogue, the memorial sponsor will propose a design concept and then we will ultimately approve that concept.”
Once a site and specific design is finalized — an end most likely over a year away — the National Park Service will oversee the actual construction and future maintenance of the commemorative. Glenn DeMarr of the National Park Service said that the NPS would follow the guidance of Congress in constructing the memorial.
“Congress considered the legislation, and when they enact the legislation, they are providing us direction that we are supposed to work with the sponsor to see that the commemoration is established. Congress, in its role, established [the commemorative’s] importance,” he said.

Swipe Against Hunger, an initiative started by a group of freshmen to combat hunger, collected more than 210 meals for homeless shelters from meal swipes donated by students at Grab ‘n’ Go stations on Friday.
The group set up donation boxes at the three Grab ‘n’ Go locations on campus during the lunch meal period. Of the 210 meals given by students, 140 were donated to Community for Creative Non-Violence, a local homeless shelter. The rest were distributed by volunteers to homeless individuals on the streets on Friday night.
Antonia Liu (MSB ’18), one of the initiative’s founders, said that the donation was a practical solution that benefited both students and the homeless.
“[We] initially planned on helping the hungry and homeless by buying food and giving them out during the holiday season,” Liu said. “Georgetown students feel frustrated about all the unused meal swipes they have, and that’s a great resource that we could use to help those who need the food the most.”
According to Jawad Pullin (COL ’18), a co-organizer of the initiative, the Grab ‘n’ Go stations at both O’Donovan Hall and Einstein Bros Bagels in Regents Hall ran out of food by the time the donation boxes were packed up.
Frankie Capers, a cashier at the Einstein Bros Bagels Grab ‘n’ Go station, said that there were noticeably more students using meal swipes on Friday than usual.
“We ran out of food at around 3:30. We usually run out on Mondays, but not like we did on Friday,” Capers said. “We usually have a few bagels left — we had zero bagels left on Friday.”
Later that evening, the group brought 15 volunteers to distribute the meals to the homeless shelter. Liu said that she encouraged student volunteers to distribute the meals to allow them to engage with the D.C. community.
“The idea behind the project was to make the delivering process as personal as possible, to connect with people in need and to make them feel cared for and included in the community,” Liu said. “So we made sure to talk to everyone and show that there are people out there who actually care a lot.”
Indra Acharya (COL ’18), a co-organizer, said that he was able to relate to the cause from personal experience.
“I have been in a situation where I struggled for food, clothes and shelter. So I know how it feels to get some food to eat,” Acharya said. “I was so excited to see the homeless brothers and sisters smiling and blessing us. We were able to represent the Georgetown community as one that cares about everyone in the world equally.”
After the event on Friday, Liu and her co-organizers have begun the process of legitimizing Swipe Against Hunger as an organization on campus.
Grab ‘n’ Give, which allows students to donate money through one meal swipe a week, was redesigned in 2013. The money from student meal swipes goes to Martha’s Table, an organization that provides food and clothing for homeless families in D.C.
“Right now, we are working on making Swipe Against Hunger an official organization,” Liu said. “Until then, we hope we’ll be able to conduct events like that on Friday.”
Liu said she also hopes to expand the initiative to more homeless shelters in D.C.
“We’re also working on establishing partnerships with D.C. community centers and shelters,” Liu said. “Our ultimate goal for now is to work in southeast D.C. where help like that is needed the most.”
Pullin said that he would also like to see Swipe Against Hunger become a regular event on campus.
“Since coming to Georgetown, one thing I’ve noticed about the school is that tradition really matters here,” Pullin said. “I feel like Swipe Against Hunger is something that doesn’t just have the potential to impact the people we helped, but also the potential to really become an endemic part of the university’s culture, tradition and mission.”

I wish I had known about this – I have about 50 swipes left for the semester right now, and at this point it seems likely that Aramark will end up stealing them (unless I start waking up early for breakfast…). I would easily donate 20 or 30 to charity if I could.

Georgetown students and alumni are now able to submit their business plans through the university for the Hult Prize, the world’s largest student competition and startup platform for social good, and will be able to skip past an applicant pool of 10,000 and go straight to regional competitions by competing through the university.
Six finalists worldwide will be chosen from the regional competitions, with one eventually winning the coveted prize.
This year’s competition will focus on addressing issues in education.
“[The proposals] have to address the problem of early childhood education while including a mechanism to be self-sustainable,” Hult Prize campus director Erin Leonard (SFS ’16) said.
Leonard added that she was motivated to bring the Hult Prize to Georgetown because she noticed a lack of social entrepreneurship on campus despite the growth of broader entrepreneurship ventures.
“I think there’s a lack of social entrepreneurship specifically, and I think there’s a lot of talent at Georgetown that would be interested in the social entrepreneurship route rather than traditional entrepreneurship route, so I wanted to create a place where students can explore that a little more,” she said.
Currently, there are 10 Georgetown teams involved in the competition, with each team consisting of three to five people.
One of the team captains, Sohayle Sizar (COL ’14), said he was inspired to get involved in the Hult Prize after eight years of working in education.
“I’m on the train of going after my vision and making my dream come true so part of that is providing education for students, so part of the Hult Prize is allowing my dream to be a reality,” he said.
Sizar said that his team’s business plan focuses on the emotional growth of children.
“Many people focus on the academic growth of a child, which is very important, but focusing on the emotional growth of the child is also very critical to the development of the child,” he said. “So we’re focused on the emotional well-being …  of children and providing a mechanism that can increase the emotional health of a child.”
Apple Li (MSB ’15), another team captain, said that while her team has not yet developed an idea, she’s competing in this year’s Hult Prize because of the theme of her interest in a class on early childhood education she is taking as a psychology minor.
“I learned in class is that early childhood education has a huge impact on a person’s future life in terms of IQ development, future social and economic status, so it’s definitely very important area that there aren’t many resources that are devoted to that right now in many countries,” Li said.
Georgetown will host an Innovation Lab to help applicants this Saturday. Leonard said the lab will include lectures from professors who are experts in early childhood education, global development and human-centered design thinking. After the lecture, applicants will split into teams to start brainstorming and developing their team’s idea.
Leonard said the Innovation Lab is useful for applicants moving forward in the competition.
“We’ll have guided questions and activities and workshops to help them through this whole process so they come away with a really good idea of direction for the next month before the competition,” she said.
She added that the Innovation Lab is open to all interested participants and to students who do not plan on competing.
“It’s still a great way to learn a lot more about early childhood education and the links that business could have in that field,” she said.
Li said she hopes the Innovation Lab will help her team come up with a self-sustainable business model.
“Our biggest challenge is to be self-sustainable, because we invest in the children age zero to five, it’ll be hard to find a source of income,” she said. “So we’re going to get advice on this through that. We also want a better understanding on what early education entails.”

Lauinger Library’s Gelardin New Media Center purchased a 3D printer earlier last month and has plans to purchase another one for next semester.
The MakerBot Replicator 5th Generation printers have the capacity to print objects up to 10” x 7.5” x 6” using PLA plastic filaments and cost $2,900 each.
According to Gelardin Department Head Beth Marhanka, the first printer was purchased with library-technology funds, while the second will be purchased through an Initiative for Technology-Enhanced Learning grant received by professor Robert Thomas.
Marhanka said that the 3D printers will further enhance student research and innovation while propelling Lauinger into the future.
“Libraries have always provided free and equitable access to tools and resources that facilitate the production of knowledge, from the parchment scrolls of centuries past to electronic resources like e-books, computer software, video cameras and now 3D printing,” Marhanka wrote in an email. “One of our missions as a library has always been to house and archive print resources, but now we also nurture creativity and discovery of emerging technologies through access to state-of-the-art tools.”
Currently, access to the printer is restricted to Gelardin staff members, who have been testing it with a variety of projects.
“After that first test file, we started printing objects we thought would be most interesting to Georgetown faculty, like a double helix DNA molecule, a replica of a cuneiform tablet and a chemical molecule,” Marhanka wrote.
Lauinger Library’s Coordinator of Communications, Outreach and Programming Jennifer Smith said that services will soon be open to students and faculty.
“We ran a survey maybe a month ago to figure out what people want to use a 3D printer for at the university, and we had a lot of responses from faculty, especially our science faculty, that there are projects that they could use it for — I think creating models of molecules and organs and different structures,” Smith said.
According to Smith, the printers can be used for class projects, as well as student requests in the spring. Gelardin staff has not yet created a pricing model, but printing currently costs $50 per spool.
“First, we will be working with faculty who have class uses for it, and then we are anticipating at some point in the spring semester that it will be opened up for other academic uses and people will be able to submit a request,” Smith said. “It will have probably a two-week turnaround to get those done, and they will be priced because it is expensive.”
In addition to providing printing services, Gelardin will also offer 3D printing classes.
“We are really excited to have the opportunity to do this, and it seems like a strange fit for the library, but libraries have always been about providing technology and resources that people can’t afford on their own, so we are super excited to see where it goes,” Smith said.
Peer institutions including the University of Notre Dame, Johns Hopkins University and Northwestern University have 3D printers in their libraries.
Nico Cuevas (MSB ’18) said he hopes to be able to make use of the 3D printer to further his research and academics.
“I hope I will eventually have access to the 3D printer to better understand the concepts I’m learning in class, especially in chemistry where we can possibly develop models for different atoms and molecules,” Cuevas said. “It would be great if students will be able to have some type of access to these printers even if it’s through a class. If I have any research ideas, I believe the 3D printer will allow me to advance those ideas.”

Georgetown’s congested sidewalks may see some relief in the near future, as the Georgetown Business Improvement District will now regularly widen sidewalks in the Georgetown neighborhood during times of heavy pedestrian traffic.
According to BID Transportation Director Will Handsfield, the decision comes after a successful test program during Georgetown University’s Parents’ Weekend, which took place from Oct. 17 to 19. According to Handsfield, there was a 9.6 percent increase in foot traffic during the weekend.
“[Georgetown’s sidewalks] are narrower than usual for a commercial district, and especially for an internationally famous destination … like Georgetown. When we have busy weekends, sidewalks are not sufficiently wide to move people comfortably,” Handsfield wrote.
Another sidewalk expansion is already planned for commencement weekend in May. The BID will also select four to six additional high-pedestrian-traffic weekends when Georgetown would benefit from widened sidewalks.
The average sidewalk in Georgetown is only eight feet wide, according to an article Handsfield wrote on the blog Greater Greater Washington. Although this is much narrower than other neighborhoods in Washington, D.C., upwards of 4,000 people per hour use the M Street sidewalks during the busiest weekends.
Street traffic was unaffected by the sidewalk expansion during Parents’ Weekend, as the additional room for pedestrians was gained by eliminating street-side parking spaces. The District Department of Transportation set up barricades adjacent to the parking spaces to separate the pedestrian traffic from cars.
In his blog post, Handsfield said that some customers raised concerns when they were unable to load furniture or other bulky items into their cars from stores on M Street because of the barriers.
Temporary sidewalk expansions are listed as a priority effort in the Georgetown 2028 Action Agenda, which is the “to-do list” component of the 15-year plan put out by the BID in April 2013.
“Red-brick sidewalks are a primary element of Georgetown’s historic streetscape,” a statement in the 2028 Plan reads. “But these sidewalks are often a source of frustration and inconvenience to pedestrians as large light poles reduce usable sidewalk space, uncovered tree boxes make for tricky footing and bricks that need replacing go untended.”
Despite comments on Handsfield’s article calling for permanent sidewalk widening in Georgetown, Handsfield said that the District Department of Transportation is not considering any permanent changes because of their potential impact on the already heavy traffic congestion in the neighborhood. DDOT could not be reached for comment.
“We do not control the permanent configuration of sidewalks; that is DDOT, and at present they are not considering any permanent changes,” Handsfield wrote.
Tiffany Lam (NHS ’17) said that she thought that congestion of the sidewalks was only primarily a problem during high-impact weekends but that the cobblestone sidewalks are difficult to walk on year-round.
“I think that the only times that really are congested are mainly during the holiday seasons or in the beginning when you have parents everywhere. But personally I really haven’t seen a problem during the school year,” Lam said. “And I don’t see [congestion] as that bad. I think the main issue is the way [the sidewalks are] made. It’s pretty difficult to walk on cobblestones and uneven bricks.”
Cindy Hassan (COL ’17) said that she did not think that expanding the sidewalks would be necessary in Georgetown.
“I think it’s a bustling town, but I don’t think it’s as crowded as New York City or a bigger city. I think sidewalk expansions would take a while and cause a lot of traffic, so I don’t think it would be necessary,” Hassan said.

The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History recently launched an online project to transcribe thousands of certified currency proofs from Washington, D.C., from 1863 to 1935.
The Smithsonian has uploaded 139 pages of scanned currency proofs, given to the museum by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in the early 1970s, onto its online transcription center. The high-resolution digitization of the proofs allows virtual visitors to closely examine the engraving of the plates from which the proofs were made.
According to the Smithsonian Institution, the proofs contain significant evidence on the history of American currency.
“Hopefully, these images will allow research to begin or will bring a new understanding to the history of our nation, as seen through the multitude of banks across America that were chartered by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to create currency,” the Smithsonian wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
The currency proofs contain information about banks, bonds, securities and treasuries in different states during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The engravings on some notes also depict political scenes and allegories.
One of the transcribed currency proofs issued by the National Bank of the Republic of Washington has been identified as depicting an allegorical scene with Christopher Columbus.
According to the statement from the Smithsonian, any visitor to the online collection can volunteer for the project.
“The digitization and transcription of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing proof-sheet collection will allow people around the world to look into the Smithsonian’s collections and become a virtual volunteer,” it said. “For numismatists around the world, this opens up a new collection, in its entirety, for the first time.”
At press time, there were 17 listed volunteers on the transcription project’s website, with 130 out of 139 pages of currency proofs transcribed.
Previous transcription projects from the National Museum of American History, which have enlisted up to 2,800 volunteers, include field notebooks, diaries and revenue stamps.
After a volunteer transcribes a note, Smithsonian staff members evaluate the transcription for accuracy.
Zackary Gardner, who teaches a course in American history of the 19th century, said that the transcription project would be a good opportunity for Georgetown students interested in American history.
“If students want to help the Smithsonian, then this is a fairly straightforward way they can do so from the comfort of their dorm room,” Gardner said.
However, Gardner said that the openness of the volunteer opportunity may result in unreliable transcription and would likely only interest die-hard history fanatics.
“The idea of using online crowd-sourcing for historical transcription is interesting and novel,” he said. “As the opportunity could be taken by undergraduates with no experience at the Smithsonian, with Smithsonian staff or working with museum collections, I am unsure what the students would get out of it other than the satisfaction of volunteering in transcription work.”
Marco Lam (MSB ’18), who is currently enrolled in an American history course, expressed interest in the transcription project but thought the job would be better suited to those who have thoroughly studied American history.
“Although I think it is cool to see what these bills can tell us about the currency system in the 18th century, I don’t think I know enough about American history to help the museum. I think this job should be left to experts,” Lam said.

The United States Agency for International Development awarded the Georgetown University Initiative on Innovation, Development and Evaluation, known as gui2de, a $3 million grant to expand a road safety intervention project in East Africa.
The USAID’s Development Innovation Ventures offered the grants to support Stage 3 of the Zusha study in Kenya conducted by economics professor Billy Jack and public policy professor James Habyarimana.
The project is called Zusha, which means “protest” in Kiswahili, and mobilized participants to put up stickers on mini-buses across Kenya in order to encourage passengers to speak up in protest against reckless drivers. With a successful first-phase pilot in 2007 that reduced traffic accidents by about 25 percent in a sample of 2,400 mini-buses and an equally successful second phase, the project proved to be effective with a low-cost innovation.
“We have run two successful trials,” Habyarimana wrote in an email. “A randomized evaluation of the messages in a sample of 2,400 vehicles revealed a halving of accident rates. This is a very large impact given the presumed difficulty of improving safety and relative to the very low cost of the intervention. The second evaluation was considerably larger: In a sample of 12,000 vehicles we found reductions in accident rates of between a quarter and a third​. The results from this larger trial give us confidence that this intervention represents a powerful constraint on driver behavior.”
Convinced by the quantitative social impact from the first two phases in saving lives, USAID decided to fund the project’s expansion across Kenya and into Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda, according to the DIV.
“Each year, the number of deaths caused by road accidents is on par with those caused by AIDS, TB and malaria combined,” representatives from the DIV wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown University proved, through their Stage 2 randomized control trial, that the simple innovation of putting stickers in buses in Kenya that empower passengers to speak up about reckless driving reduces road accidents by 25 percent.”
USAID awards grants on an individual basis and evaluated Zusha based on the three core principles of evidence, cost effectiveness and pathways to scale. Zusha is DIV’s second-ever Stage 3 award and the first award to be transitioned from a former Stage 2 grant.
The grant money will mostly go to East Africa in supporting local personnel and printing the stickers. Some of it will be used to fund a new program at Georgetown and support research assistants helping with data analysis and business solutions, according to Jack.
Jack pointed out that the Stage 3 expansion would start on an experimental basis and scale up with other possible components such as TV, radio, billboard and social media to send the empowering message to passengers. He pointed out the challenge and the value in exporting an effective measure into another cultural context.
“We decided that we would continue this trend of research, both because we are not sure if the research can be easily exported to another cultural context. And also because we find a good thing and we want to do it. No one else is going to do it,” Jack said.
Habyarimana said that the project has many real-life policy implications.
“The ultimate goal of this research is to uncover messages and other low cost strategies to generate safer transport services in the developing world, where 90 percent of all fatalities and injuries occur,” Habyarimana wrote. “This research has immediate policy implications as it provides policy-makers, transport providers and insurance companies with a low-cost strategy to reduce fatalities, injuries and property damage.​”
Jack added that this project had the potential to make a difference in all developing countries.
“Every developing country, without exception, has a public road safety problem. It’s ubiquitous. So we feel that if we can make it work in Kenya, we can probably make it work somewhere else,” Jack said.
Jack said that despite the project’s initial success, he predicts challenges in local resistance, including hostility from bus drivers.
“The future is full of challenges,” Jack said. “It was really hard work; how simple the idea was but how difficult it was to carry out. It takes years and years and years of frustration and persistence.”
Jack also pointed to the inevitably uncertain results of expanding a public policy project because of different cultural norms.
“We need to be ambitious, but we also need to be realistic,” Jack said. “The result of the two studies has indicated that a very simple intervention, which is nearly laughably easy, appears to have the potential to have very large effects on people’s life. … [But] in this context, this is about the cultural norms and specific ways that evolve over time, so we have to maintain a certain amount of humility in thinking that we can change the world. I’m very excited to try but I’m also slightly nervous.”

The George Washington University partnered with 2014 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai and Little, Brown and Company publishing house to release a free online companion to Yousafzai’s memoir Nov. 13, aiming to help educators integrate her teachings on women’s education into university classrooms.
An initiative of GWU’s Global Women’s Institute, the classroom-resource guide was announced at an event that included a speech from Yousafzai’s father, Ziauddin Yousafzai.
“It is our hope that Malala’s story will inspire the next generation of leaders in the global fight for education for all girls and boys,” Yousafzai’s father said in a press release.
The guide expands on themes in Yousafzai’s memoir, “I Am Malala,” which was released in 2013. GWI Director Mary Ellsberg explained that the institute brought together faculty members to expand on the themes from multiple perspectives.
“It was important to us that the resource guide be interdisciplinary, making Malala’s message relevant to students and faculty across multiple areas of study,” Ellsberg said in a statement to The Hoya. “Each faculty member brought his or her unique perspective to the common goal of expanding on the message of an extraordinary young activist.”
The partnership originated when the GWI, which aims to promote the position of women and girls around the world, contacted Yousafzai after the announcement of her memoir, inspired by the 17-year-old’s efforts to draw attention to children’s education in Pakistan and her subsequent targeting by the Taliban.
“When we heard about the creation of the Malala Fund and her forthcoming memoir last year, we contacted them to see how we could support their efforts. Together we came up with the idea of developing a resource guide that would help educators use the memoir in both college and high school courses,” Ellsberg said.
GWU professors have used the resource guide in classes to supplement course material with positive effects.
“Students have been very enthusiastic about the memoir, as well as the essays and activities included in the guide,” Ellsberg said.
The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security declined to comment on whether it would be interested in implementing something similar, but Assistant Director of the GIWPS Mayesha Alam praised the guide as an effective means to stress the importance of education for girls worldwide.
“This resource guide will be a great tool to reinforce the importance of girls’ education to peace and prosperity around the world,” Alam said in a statement to The Hoya.
The resource guide, which is available for free download, is available to other universities, and faculty members are currently working to create a new guide for high school students by 2015.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority introduced new faregates that allow users to pay with credit cards and smartphones at the Gallery Place Station on Thursday. The move comes in advance of Metro’s payment pilot program that will operate at 10 stations and six bus routes in January.
Together with a demonstration of new payment methods during Thursday’s launch, WMATA announced the expanded payment options in a press release, detailing the new ways commuters will be able to utilize the faregates, including mobile payment options and credit or debit cards.
“The new fare system will allow riders to pay for their trip using a variety of new methods, without the need to convert U.S. currency to Metro fare value,” the press release said. “For example, visitors to the region will be able to enter and exit the rail system and pay for their trip using many types of [Near Field Communications]-equipped or contactless credit or debit cards and mobile devices, all without stopping at a fare machine or purchasing a SmarTrip card. Federal workers eventually will be able to use their workplace ID card.”
The 10 metro stops selected for the January launch are Shady Grove, Eisenhower Avenue, Bethesda, Pentagon City, Pentagon, Ballston, Farragut West, Navy Yard, Suitland and Gallery Place.
Depending on the success of the three-month pilot in January, the payment system may expand to the rest of the transportation system in Washington, D.C. as early as 2017.
“If the pilot is successful, Metro plans to replace the now decades-old faregates and vending machines at station entrances across the system and add new payment targets onboard buses and at parking facilities, starting in 2017,” WMATA wrote.
Additionally, the D.C. Metro board of directors approved a decision last May to phase out paper farecards over the next 18 months in favor of SmarTrip cards.
Olivia Gasser (NHS ’18) frequently uses the Metro and said these new changes will have a positive effect on her commuting experience.
“It really helps because I don’t carry cash around that often, and that’s been an issue for me before with the Metro. But I always have a credit card on me, so this sounds like a great idea,” she said.

JULIA HENNRIKUS/THE HOYARelationship counselor Marissa Nelson spoke about healthy sexual relationships on Tuesday evening.
United Feminists, H*yas for Choice and the Black Student Alliance presented “Sex in the Dark: A Conversation on Healthy Relationships” on Tuesday evening to create a forum for students to discuss sex and relationships.
The conversation was facilitated by Marissa Nelson, a licensed marriage and family therapist specializing in individual, couples and sex therapy. Her fellow panelists were United Feminists Co-Chair Kimberly Blair (COL ’15), H*yas for Choice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) and BSA President Shauntell Pinckney (COL ’15). The event was not affiliated with the university. The event was set up to be interactive, and participants anonymously texted questions and answered polls in real time. Nelson began the discussion by talking about her career path, hoping to help serve others.
“Being a couple’s therapist is my second field. Originally, I did do sociology undergrad and then I moved to Los Angeles and became a publicist and I really enjoyed that for a little bit, but something was missing for me,” Nelson said. “People always used to say you’re really sensitive and I didn’t think that was a bad thing. … I really wanted to go down an avenue where I would be helping and serving others.”
While doing family therapy, Nelson noticed that many of the issues of children came from unresolved problems between their parents. Her interest in couple’s therapy stemmed from there, and she began to speak with couples, which eventually led to her to begin practicing in sex therapy.
Nelson also spoke about her experiences with race and interracial couples, and said that it is problematic that she often hears from clients say, “I don’t see color.”
Ad:
“I say if you don’t see color you are missing the essence of who I am,” Nelson said. “You have to be able to name it, you have to be able to express it and share it and understand each other, and sometimes you are going to have blind spots and sometimes you are not going to get it.”
As the discussion continued, the panel opened up the use of word cloud to poll the audience’s feelings about topics such as casual sex, oral sex and female sexuality. Members of the crowd could anonymously send in words or phrases that came to mind after reading the topic.
“I do think that especially at this age exploration is very important,” Nelson said. “It shapes your whole sexual identity for the rest of your life and it gives you great tools and a great way to hopefully try to communicate your needs to a partner and to try understand what it is you like about sex, what are the things you enjoy about sex and how to guide your partner through that process.”
Zoey Krulick (SFS ’15), who attended the event, said that she enjoyed learning about topics that Georgetown generally avoids when choosing speakers.
“I always love having events like this on the Georgetown campus because I feel like due to Georgetown’s Jesuit identity, we do not have a lot of events that address sex and sexuality,” Krulick said. “It was really interesting to hear the perspective of a sex therapist, and I learned a lot of cool stuff about addressing issues that may come up in a relationship.”
Blair said she enjoyed the discussion because it explored a diversity of topics.
“Nobody really gets the opportunity to talk about these intersecting issues of healthy relationships and how sex plays into those healthy relationships on campus,” Blair said. “I was really happy that we had a lot of questions that were not in the heteronormative realm because when we’ve brought in sex educators in the past there was that common critique so we really wanted to address that this time. We thought that bringing in a therapist this time would be a different take so that we as college students can understand what toll or what affects these topics have on ourselves and on our psyches.”

The event was not affiliated with the university. The event was set up to be interactive, and participants anonymously texted questions and answered polls in real time. Nelson began the discussion by talking about her career path, hoping to help serve others.
“Being a couple’s therapist is my second field. Originally, I did do sociology undergrad and then I moved to Los Angeles and became a publicist and I really enjoyed that for a little bit, but something was missing for me,” Nelson said. “People always used to say you’re really sensitive and I didn’t think that was a bad thing. … I really wanted to go down an avenue where I would be helping and serving others.”
While doing family therapy, Nelson noticed that many of the issues of children came from unresolved problems between their parents. Her interest in couple’s therapy stemmed from there, and she began to speak with couples, which eventually led to her to begin practicing in sex therapy.
Nelson also spoke about her experiences with race and interracial couples, and said that it is problematic that she often hears from clients say, “I don’t see color.”
“I say if you don’t see color you are missing the essence of who I am,” Nelson said. “You have to be able to name it, you have to be able to express it and share it and understand each other, and sometimes you are going to have blind spots and sometimes you are not going to get it.”
As the discussion continued, the panel opened up the use of word cloud to poll the audience’s feelings about topics such as casual sex, oral sex and female sexuality. Members of the crowd could anonymously send in words or phrases that came to mind after reading the topic.
“I do think that especially at this age exploration is very important,” Nelson said. “It shapes your whole sexual identity for the rest of your life and it gives you great tools and a great way to hopefully try to communicate your needs to a partner and to try understand what it is you like about sex, what are the things you enjoy about sex and how to guide your partner through that process.”
Zoey Krulick (SFS ’15), who attended the event, said that she enjoyed learning about topics that Georgetown generally avoids when choosing speakers.
“I always love having events like this on the Georgetown campus because I feel like due to Georgetown’s Jesuit identity, we do not have a lot of events that address sex and sexuality,” Krulick said. “It was really interesting to hear the perspective of a sex therapist, and I learned a lot of cool stuff about addressing issues that may come up in a relationship.”
Blair said she enjoyed the discussion because it explored a diversity of topics.
“Nobody really gets the opportunity to talk about these intersecting issues of healthy relationships and how sex plays into those healthy relationships on campus,” Blair said. “I was really happy that we had a lot of questions that were not in the heteronormative realm because when we’ve brought in sex educators in the past there was that common critique so we really wanted to address that this time. We thought that bringing in a therapist this time would be a different take so that we as college students can understand what toll or what affects these topics have on ourselves and on our psyches.”
