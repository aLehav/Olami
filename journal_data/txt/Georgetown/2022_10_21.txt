Georgetown students ran 24 miles in 24 hours through Georgetown, helping the Asian American Student Association (AASA) raise over $1,300 to support Asian American youth organizations.
The Oct. 15 to 16 fundraiser was coordinated in collaboration with the Georgetown Running Club (GRC) and GU Triathlon and accompanied other fundraising activities including a bake sale and ramen eating contest Oct. 15 on Healy Lawn. Proceeds of the fundraiser were donated to the Asian American Youth Leadership Empowerment and Development (AALEAD), a non-profit organization that supports low-income and underserved Asian Pacific American youth with empowerment and leadership opportunities, and the Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA). Three-quarters of the proceeds were sent to AALEAD, with the remainder sent to MOCA. 
Ed Shen (MSB ’23), co-president of AASA, said AASA picked these organizations to donate to support Asian American children on a grassroots level.
“We really loved AALEAD’s mission to support Asian American youth from low-income backgrounds through educational empowerment, identity development, and leadership opportunities,” Shen wrote to The Hoya. “We felt that their work was crucial to the development of Asian American youth in the area and wanted to be a part of their mission.”
Yingqi Liu (MSB ’25), who helped plan the fundraiser and participated, said he suggested a portion of the proceeds be directed to MOCA as a part of a larger personal fundraising effort, in which he aims to raise $3,000 for the museum by the end of the year through his participation in the New York City Marathon as a charity runner. 
“They are a museum that preserves a Chinese narrative, an immigrant narrative, in New York City,” Liu told The Hoya. “And they are fighting against racial discrimination. They’re fighting against Asian hate. So I think that’s a really great opportunity for me to do something great, while also having an opportunity to run the New York City Marathon.” 
Data from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism found that the rate anti-Asian hate crime increased by 339% in 2021, following an increase by 124% in 2020. 23% of Asian Americans and 29% of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders report experiencing a hate incident at some point in their life, with 14% of Asian Americans and 16% of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders saying they experienced such an incident in 2021 or 2022.
According to Margaret Lin (COL ’23), AASA co-president, said the event exceeded its fundraising target of $1,000, partially because of the support family members visiting campus during Family Weekend, the same weekend of the fundraiser. 
“It was really impressive of the runners, and representative of the combined personal efforts of AASA Board and members of GRC, Running Club, and Georgetown Bubble to have raised $1300!” Lin wrote to The Hoya. “We were very lucky to have the support of a lot of parents and Georgetown University relatives, since it happened during family weekend!”
Shen said that in coordinating this event, AASA drew inspiration from previous fundraisers that challenged participants while supporting efforts to raise money for charitable causes.
“In Spring 2021, I participated in a somewhat similar fundraiser called Run 24. A few of my friends began the fundraiser as a group project for a class and I decided to join last minute because it sounded like an interesting challenge,” Chen wrote. “The experience was quite tough, but also very fulfilling. I wanted to bring it back this year, build it bigger, and share the challenge with more members of the community!”
Four runners completed the entire 24 mile challenge, but according to Shen, the general public came out to support the runners, and even participated in certain stretches.
“Some of the highlights were the public runs, we had quite a few people join us and it was really nice to see the community come out and support us,” Shen wrote.
According to Anika Tsai (SFS ’26), a runner who participated in the entire 24 mile stretch, said it was empowering to see people come together in support of the fundraiser and its cause.
“I didn’t have a strong reason not to do it, and I didn’t know if I would have that opportunity again to do something like it with people,” Tsai wrote to The Hoya. “I felt like I got to see a different side of the Georgetown student community last weekend, not just in terms of their willingness to support a cause but also to support each other, including the people involved in running the fundraiser.”
Liu said the run was rewarding, not only because of the accomplishment of running a total of 24 miles, but also for fundraising for an important cause.
“I think it’s really fun in the fundraising process itself outside of running as being able to extend the mission of AASA,” Liu said. “Being able to finish the whole thing, pulling through for ourselves, that’s something that a lot of us didn’t think we could do, and being able to achieve that is just an amazing feeling.

A team of students at the Georgetown University School of Medicine created a program aimed at decreasing barriers to healthcare access for refugees who have recently arrived in the United States.
The Health Navigator Program initiative directs refugees to critical healthcare services and pairs them with a trained volunteer, who checks in with them weekly to help them make medical appointments, communicate with physicians and address other health needs. The program’s co-founders, Emily Phelps (MED ’24), Ruba Omeira (MED ’24), Thu Dao (MED ’24) and Mohamad Almasri (MED ’24), met through a community-based learning course they took through NOVA Friends of Refugees, an interfaith refugee support network.
During the course, Omeira said they were inspired to create the program after learning about the challenges refugees face while accessing medical resources. 
“There are so many convoluted layers that one must pass through before the ‘patient meets doctor’ event occurs,” Omeira wrote to The Hoya. “I personally find it all so daunting, so I can only imagine how difficult it is for someone new to this country, particularly a refugee who has likely experienced loss and trauma.” 
From understanding qualifications for and limitations of insurance to following up on specialist referrals from primary care doctors, Omeira said the many components of the healthcare system can be confusing to navigate.
When developing the program, the team prioritized volunteer recruitment from a wide variety of backgrounds to create sustainable long-term support for refugees, Phelps said.
“We thought it would be really cool if we could make this program interdisciplinary and we recruited volunteers from the medical school, nursing school, post-bacc pre-med students, SMP and GEMS students,” Phelps told The Hoya. 
In total, over 100 volunteers worked with 60 refugee families, primarily from Afghanistan, during the 2021-22 cycle after the Health Navigator Program launched last September, according to a Sept. 29 press release from the School of Medicine.
“We ended up having too many interested student volunteers than there were families ready to be matched,” Phelps said. “This was exciting that there was so much interest, but we know it was disappointing some of the volunteers were not able to participate.” 
Sarah Kureshi, a professor in the School of Medicine’s family medicine department and the teacher of the NOVA community-based learning course, said she is encouraged by the local impact her former students are making.
“As I’ve gone through my career, I’ve found there are so many different ways to do global health and it’s really rewarding to do local global health,” Kureshi told The Hoya. “It’s not like you have to fly overseas, there is such a need for care in our populations just in our backyards. It’s even more meaningful to live in a community and provide care, because you have more context.” 
Dao said the co-founders are planning to expand the program and improve its quality to ensure it not only serves the needs of refugees, but also creates meaningful experiences for volunteers.
Sarah Wong (GRD ’22), whose mother emigrated from Myanmar to escape religious persecution, said she volunteered with the Health Navigator Program because of her family’s past experiences and a desire to give back to those less fortunate than herself.
“I empathize with those who sought out America for greater opportunities and have overcome barriers I could probably never imagine,” Wong wrote to The Hoya. “The Health Navigator Program offered a channel to support these refugees, as so often conflicts taking place across the world can otherwise feel so removed from our daily lives.” 
Wong said her experiences with the refugee families she worked with through the program have given her more clarity on existing disparities in healthcare as well as her own future plans.
“The current healthcare system places those who are not primarily English-speaking and U.S.-born at a disadvantage, and the perspectives I’ve gained through this program fuels a desire to give back to these communities and better understand these social determinants that pose barriers to health as a future physician,” Wong said.
Looking ahead, Phelps said she hopes the Health Navigator Program can serve even more refugee families through new partnerships with various grassroots organizations in the community.
“Once the operations have become more solidified and routine, I hope we can expand our volunteer base to accommodate the needs of newly arrived refugees resettled in the DMV area, as well as provide the experience and garnered knowledge for our future leaders in the healthcare field about the barriers refugees face in accessing care,” Phelps said.

Faculty and students organized a virtual panel with journalism experts from across the nation to discuss the evolving role of the media in strengthening democratic institutions and upholding traditional journalistic values.
The Oct. 17 event, titled “Can Local Media Help Save Democracy?” was co-hosted by ​​the Free Speech Project at Georgetown University (FSP), a student- and faculty-run initiative that works to assess the condition of free speech in the United States today, and the Future of the Humanities Project at Georgetown University, a collaborative effort between the Georgetown University Humanities Initiative and the Las Casas Institute at the University of Oxford, a research institute examining social issues related to the Dominican intellectual tradition, to address issues at the intersection of the humanities and public life. 
The panel included Stuart Allen, professor of journalism and communication at Cardiff University; Jim Brady, former executive editor of the online version of the Washington Post; and Maria Power, a senior research fellow studying human dignity at the Las Casas Institute. 
The event was moderated by the director of the Future of the Humanities Project, Michael Scott, and the director of the FSP, Sanford Ungar. The event is the latest installment of the FSP’s ongoing series, “Free Speech at the Crossroads: International Dialogues,” which aims to facilitate conversations among interdisciplinary experts regarding issues of free expression.
Panelists discussed the shifting priorities of national media outlets, something Brady said has led to the deterioration of the quality of their journalism.
“National media is incentivized to anger people,” Brady said at the event. “It is driven by ratings and page viewership, and until the incentives of national media change to producing quality content, we won’t see change.”
Power said that the deteriorating reputations of media companies are partly because of the constant influx of bad news.
“Actual news is exhausting and depressing, and people are consequently looking to journalism for entertainment,” Power said at the event. “I have lost count of how many people I can actually have a conversation with about politics and economics because of the decline in the academic sphere.”
Panelists also discussed the ways local media can fill the gap left by the national media’s shortcomings, something Brady said can unite communities without focusing as much on politically polarizing topics.
“Regardless of if you’re a Democrat or Republican, you share the same emotion of hating traffic and favoring the local sports team,” Brady said. “Local news can be boring at times, but there are lots of things that go around in your community which are important. I do think if we give more of a supply of information that is useful and necessary in a community, it can help to short circuit the corrosive effect national news has on people right now.”
Despite the ideological strengths of local media, Brady said many local news outlets are struggling to stay afloat financially.
A report from Northwestern University on the state of local news in America found that newspapers have been vanishing at increasing rates in recent years. One-fifth of the nation’s citizens live in news deserts, or communities that are no longer covered by daily or non-daily newspapers, and surviving newspapers have cut their staff and production following declines in profits.
Power pointed to the efforts of U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss, who announced on Oct. 20 that she intends to resign from her role following a contentious parliamentary vote, as an example of the threat a strong local media can pose to undemocratic leaders.
Power said Truss attempted to bankrupt local media and keep outlets from being able to produce content.
“The local media in the U.K., which is publicly funded by the BBC, were viewed as idiots by Prime Minister Liz Truss when she entered office,” Power said. “She has since worked hard to defund the BBC, but the local media have continued to run rings around her and hold her accountable.”
Ungar said that local media is particularly hurt in times of financial crisis, as these publications’ profits are largely dependent on voluntary user subscriptions and donations rather than advertisements.
“Simply asking people to donate to local media amid a time of inflation is a ‘tough sell,’” Ungar told The Hoya in an interview after the event.
Brady said that by prioritizing their readers’ interests, local news outlets can increase their donations.
“You have to address your audience, you have to cover things they care about,” Brady said. “Now we’re focusing on things that actually get people to give money to the organizations because they like the work, which means for the first time really in the history of digital, the business model and the editorial model thrive the same way.”

Former Vice President Mike Pence took center stage to discuss the Biden-Harris administration’s performance, the role of youth in politics and the upcoming midterm elections amid a student walkout and protest at an event in Gaston Hall.
A few days after GU Politics announced the event, students organized a meeting Oct. 15 to discuss ways to protest Pence’s visit. Led by Sanchi Rohira (SFS ’24) and Carrie McDonald (COL ’24), the group decided to organize a walkout in the middle of Pence’s speech and a subsequent protest outside of Healy Hall. 
Full Disclosure: Rohira previously served as a staff writer, while McDonald currently serves as Deputy Sports Editor for The Hoya.
The Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics) and the Young America’s Foundation (YAF), a conservative youth organization, co-hosted the Oct. 19 event, titled “The Future of the Conservative Movement.” Executive director and founder of GU Politics Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) moderated the event. 
At the event, Pence praised Generation Z and said the students in the audience should work to uphold the foundations of freedom in the United States outlined in the Constitution. 
“The truth is, what we need is a debate and a government as good as our people,” Pence said at the event. “I am confident that we will soon, and very soon, because I have confidence in your generation. I know you’ll be the ones to stand on the ramparts of freedom, you’ll be the ones who stand proudly on the legacy of liberty enshrined in our founding documents.” 
Rohira said she and other protesters were angered by the university’s decision to invite Pence to speak because of his outspoken opposition to various identity groups, namely LGBTQ+ people. 
“Our problem was that they invited someone who fundamentally believed that so many Georgetown students have invalid identities and therefore should not exist,” Rohira told The Hoya. 
On his 2000 congressional campaign website, Pence signaled his support for conversion therapy, a debunked form of therapy that aims to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Various medical organizations such as the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Psychological Association (APA) have rejected the practice for its harmful effects on mental and physical health.
Marc Lotter, a spokesperson for Pence, told The New York Times in 2016 that the former vice president never supported the practice. 
Rohira gave the cue for the walkout — two successive claps — about 10 minutes into the event, after which Pence began speaking on the existence of a “woke” agenda that threatens American freedoms. Approximately 50 students stood up and walked out of the room, waving pride flags as students participating in the demonstration unfurled a banner reading “LGBTQ+, Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights” across the second-floor balcony.
As students made their exit, Pence quipped about the walkout in his speech, which was met with applause from a number of audience members. 
“It seems to me that leaders in this nation’s capital have never been more out of touch or more intent on imposing their agenda or walking out on people who might have a different point of view,” Pence said.
Mike Pence did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment in time for publication. 
Students participating in the walkout handed out over 800 flyers detailing Pence’s policies that have harmed LGBTQ+ people, BIPOC people and other marginalized communities, such as his support for anti-abortion bills and legislation that attacks LGBTQ+ rights, to remind attendees of Pence’s history, according to Rohira.
“We anticipated that he would use this event to try to sanitize his image and escape his record, which is exactly what he did,” Rohira said.
After walking out of the event, protestors gathered on the steps of Healy Hall, holding signs, banners and LGBTQ+ pride flags. While on the steps, the protestors chanted messages like “hate has no home” and “this is what America looks like,” while Georgetown community members walked past, many of whom stopped to watch the protests.
Kayla Barnes (SFS ’26), who attended the event and participated in the walkout, said she wanted to respectfully protest Pence’s speech.
“I went to the scheming session, and I decided to participate because I felt like this was the best way to make people see my feelings on this issue,” Barnes told The Hoya. “Based on the previous administration’s actions, I just don’t feel like I can support this man at all.”
Other students like Meghan Shah (NHS ’26) do not support Pence, but chose not to participate in the walkout in order to listen to what he had to say at the event.
“I personally am not doing it because I just want to hear what he has to say,” Shah told The Hoya. “He’s not exactly someone I agree with at all, but the topic of the talk — the future of conservatism — is interesting. I want to know how he’s gonna present that, just because they’re such controversial opinions.”
Elleithee, who has spent over two decades working in the Democratic Party as a communications strategist for the Democratic National Committee and several elected officials, said he thinks it is necessary to engage with conservatives like Pence to create the open dialogue that drives democracy.
“One of the biggest challenges facing our democracy today is hyperpolarization,” Elleithee said at the event. “​​We want to put people from different perspectives together to have the hard conversations, sometimes to find common ground and oftentimes not, but to see if we can at least find common motivation.”
Rohira said she and other protesters hope to continue the momentum from the walkout by crafting a statement with demands for the university, from hiring an assistant director for the LGBTQ Resource Center and better funding for Counseling and Psychiatric Service (CAPS). 
“In order to channel all the momentum that we gathered last night into tangible change for the queer community on this campus, in the next day or two, we will be sending an official statement to the university with a bunch of actionable rules that they can follow in order to attempt to make up for the damage that they did to our community last night,” Rohira told The Hoya. “The statement is basically going to say, ‘Hey, who messed up last night by making us feel unsafe?’”

A U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a federal program allowing international students to live and work in the United States for up to three years after graduating from an undergraduate university program, a position for which Georgetown University expressed support in an amicus brief.
On Oct. 4, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) 2016 Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, a one-year employment authorization for F-1 visa students with the option of a two-year extension for students working in STEM fields.
The OPT program was originally challenged in 2016 when the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers (WashTech), a union representing workers in the STEM labor market, filed a suit against the DHS. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in January 2021 ruled in favor of the OPT program as well as the two-year STEM extension. After an appeal, WashTech argued the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last November. On Oct. 4, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed the validity of the OPT program in a two to one decision.
Groups including the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, an alliance of leaders in American higher education that focuses on raising awareness about immigration policies and practices on higher education, and NAFSA: Association of International Educators, a non-profit organization centered around international education, organized 118 public and private colleges and universities in an amicus curiae brief. Amici curiae briefs present relevant facts and arguments from the perspective of groups with strong interests in the court decision. Georgetown contributed to the amicus curiae brief in support of the OPT program.
The brief argues that the OPT is a government program that not only provides benefits for international students but also allows American higher education institutions to attract the most outstanding students from around the world.
“If WashTech has its way, OPT will cease to exist,” the brief reads. “And if it ends, so too will the myriad benefits of OPT to international students, American colleges and universities, and the national economy. If OPT is eliminated, international students will have fewer opportunities to continue their education beyond the walls of the classroom — something that research shows is often required to master complex fields such as those in the STEM area.” 
Mark Karthik (SFS ’26), who is from Hong Kong, said he looks forward to taking full advantage of the work opportunities the decision has provided.
“I think it’s a great move to uphold the program, and I’m glad to see Georgetown’s support for international students,” Karthik told The Hoya. “I plan on taking advantage of the OPT program and the extension because I intend to major in econ. I look forward to gaining work experience and learning from this opportunity.”
A university spokesperson said being able to work in the U.S. after graduation is a crucial part of the university experience.
“Georgetown applauds the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “Applying the knowledge gained through academic study in a practical setting is an indispensable part of the higher education experience.”
Victor Cha, vice dean for faculty and graduate affairs in the department of government and the School of Foreign Service (SFS), said it is important for students to gain work experience in the U.S.
“Even our best students can only learn so much from the classroom; they must then test and further these lessons in the real world,” Cha wrote in a statement in the brief. “The opportunity to undertake internships, employment, or research is critical to their development as future leaders in a more globalized world community for generations forward.” 
Madeline Lee (SFS ’25), who is from South Korea, said that while she sees the program as a success, she hopes in the future it will extend to students that major in fields other than STEM. 
Full disclosure: Lee is a Social Media Assistant at The Hoya.
“I think it’s good because the process of getting a work visa can be difficult, and it provides more flexibility for international students after graduation,” Lee told The Hoya. “It would be better if non-STEM students also got to work three years.”

The Hoya sat down with the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) President Kole Wolfe (SFS ’24) and Vice President Zeke Ume-Ukeje (COL ’24) to discuss their administration’s progress two months into the fall semester, following a contentious election last spring.
Students elected Wolfe and Ume-Ukeje to office in February 2022 amid allegations that the pair committed campaign violations, including bribing students with alcohol for votes, which Wolfe and Ume-Ukeje denied and a GUSA investigative committee could not confirm.
The Hoya sat down with Wolfe and Ume-Ukeje on Oct. 19 to discuss how they overcame difficulties, including the aftermath of these allegations, their administration’s journey so far and how the two have worked alongside members of the GUSA Senate and Executive to serve students.
The following has been edited for length and clarity.
What was it like adjusting to GUSA given that neither of you had prior experience with the organization?
Wolfe: It was a lot of us having to educate ourselves on what was going on and what we really needed to do. Building out our staff took a little bit of time, just in terms of that outreach, and I think one of the things that we really prioritized was keeping people from the previous administration involved, especially in terms of some of the advocacy work they were doing. I think a lot of the reason why we were elected in the first place isn’t because GUSA doesn’t do great things, it’s just because people really are unaware of them, and I think we too were also unaware of it. 
Ume-Ukeje: We already had a lot of people who were skeptical about our office appointment. We definitely felt the special need to really try to educate ourselves as much as possible. We wanted to spend the time speaking with different groups and different people who run different areas of campus and making sure that we were at least doing our part to represent students in the best way possible as a sign of commitment to not only this office, but also to the people who elected us and even to the people who didn’t elect us because we will really do feel like we want to be representative not just for the people who voted for us.
How have you listened to the demands of students, and do you feel you have been able to represent them?
Ume-Ukeje: I think a lot of what we realized was that our position doesn’t necessarily always grant us direct power to get things done. So that was a little bit of a challenge, and it caused us to need to work with the administrators a lot more. 
Wolfe: There was so much sensationalist commentary surrounding our election or our ascendancy into this position, but at the end of the day, it really is just student government. The most we can do is ask the administration to do something or pressure them to do something or work with them to get something done, because at the end of the day, they control the funding and they control the policy that they want to implement on this campus.
What has been your administration’s biggest accomplishment? What was the biggest challenge you faced in accomplishing this, and how did you overcome it? 
Wolfe: I’d probably say the biggest thing that we’ve done is the changes that have been made to Epicurean, expanding to meal exchange and going back to its original pre-COVID hours. A lot of conversations that we would have with students always circled back to the lack of available dining options on campus, especially late at night and during breaks when a lot of students who are on vacation and are dependent on the meal plan couldn’t get access to meals. There was a general lack of trust in the community and an expectation that we intended to disenfranchise people or that we had some sort of ulterior motive or agenda in running for this position, and I think the biggest challenge has been slowly trying to overcome that and show people that we really care about what we’re doing.
In April, following a decision by the GUSA Senate to reject holding another student referendum to restructure GUSA, you said that you are still committed to the goal of restructuring. How have you made progress on that goal this fall? 
Wolfe: I think a lot of the reasons why we pursued the second referendum was because we thought that GUSA was functioning inefficiently. But I think in the most current iteration of the senate, people have been working really well together, the environment is much more conducive and friendly and the atmosphere really isn’t one of hate and contempt. I think originally the goal of the restructure was to make the atmosphere a better place and something that more younger people wanted to be a part of.
How have you worked with members of the Senate and other members of GUSA who may have shown initial resistance or distrust?
Ume-Ukeje: I think one of our biggest things was that we didn’t want to hold any grudges. The campaign was really challenging for us just on a lot of fronts, what people were saying about us and that being publicized on a campuswide platform. But we had multiple complicated conversations with the previous administration during our transition into office. We extended multiple offers to people who are working in the cabinet to come and continue to work with us because we know that these are people who really care about what they do.
What have you yet to accomplish that you hope to do before the end of your term? 
Wolfe: The reputation that our organization has, even before we came in, is just unfortunate, and I think, although some of the things that were said about us in the press and in general are sort of unfortunate and negative, I think that GUSA provides a great platform for people to advocate and enact positive change on campus. I would really like for people to be excited about doing the work and in large numbers to come in again and make GUSA a really formidable organization that can work with the administration and put pressure on them when need be, to get things done.
Ume-Ukeje: We want students to continue to care about GUSA and the work that they do. At the end of the day, that’s what we’re doing it for — we’re not doing it for ourselves. We’re doing it for our peers and our colleagues.

Georgetown University students competed at the 2022 D.C. Public Health Case Challenge, an annual competition where teams from universities in the Washington, D.C. area create and present policy proposals aimed at solving a public health problem in the District.
Hosted by the National Academy of Medicine, this year’s competition, which took place Oct. 10, challenged teams to address youth intimate partner violence (IPV) in D.C. After receiving the case information, teams had two weeks to prepare a comprehensive five-year policy intervention plan with a hypothetical million-dollar budget. 
The Georgetown team consisted of four students from the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law At Georgetown Law — Alyaa Chace (LAW ’23), Bailey Smith (LAW ’23), Guillermina Pappier (LAW ’23) and Uttara Jhaveri (LAW ’23) — as well as Harrison Tandy (GRD ’23) and Carrigan Rice (NHS ’24). 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 16 million women and 11 million men who reported experiencing sexual violence, physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime said they first experienced these forms of violence before they turned 18, a statistic Chace said is not widely discussed or known.
“I was surprised when I read the case because you normally don’t think about this issue from the perspective of youth,” Chace told The Hoya. “We can really make a tangible difference by focusing on education at an early age and increasing awareness to overcome the existing stigma around IPV.” 
The Georgetown team created a solution titled “ICAN: IPV Counseling for Adolescents Now,” with the goal of helping at-risk high school students understand healthy relationships, according to Jhaveri. The proposal takes a two-part approach to intervention using peer-to-peer advisory and a youth theater drama program. 
Jhaveri said the team chose peer counseling to mitigate the social stigma surrounding IPV through support groups led by mentors and facilitators who have experienced such violence firsthand. 
“We wanted it to be a safe space like a support group that understands what you have gone through and can help you deal with the issue through their own personal experiences,” Jhaveri said. “Sometimes you just want someone who can talk and empathize with you.”
The team also proposed that the District collaborate with The Theater Lab, a school for dramatic arts in D.C., and use their youth programs to reach at-risk groups and spread awareness about IPV, according to Jhaveri.
“Drama programs have been conducted in many places to help spread awareness and understanding of what youth intimate partner violence is,” Jhaveri said. “The Theater Lab is a local NGO that promotes awareness through drama and shows and we thought this was a very unique and different way of reaching our target audience.”
Teams were judged based on four criteria: the interdisciplinary nature of their response, feasibility of implementation, creativity and practicality. The Georgetown team won the Wildcard Award for integrating the arts in their solution.
Chace said one of the team’s goals was to identify, research and consider all the groups affected by youth IPV across socioeconomic statuses, racial and ethnic backgrounds and more. 
“For a policy to be effective, you must take into account diverse perspectives and interests,” Chace said. “Our fear is that we give a presentation that is not diverse and fails to address certain demographics or at-risk populations.”
Given that the members of the team came from varied backgrounds and schools at Georgetown, Jhaveri said the team collaborated across disciplines to create a comprehensive solution.
“Everyone chose a particular aspect of research they were most interested in,” Jhaveri told The Hoya. “For example, I wanted to focus on counseling for our solution and someone else wanted to find ways to use social media.”
Leading up to the competition, Chace said the team focused on testing the strength and feasibility of their policies.
“We are working every free minute to make sure we are asking questions and pressing on each other the same way we know the judges will,” Chace said before the event. “We are confident that we’ve created something that will make a real difference because we’ve looked at all the facets of the issue.” 
Jhaveri said she enjoyed hearing and learning from other teams’ proposals, which included suggestions from youth leadership development to policy changes that support survivors.
“It was a great experience,” Jhaveri told The Hoya. “My biggest takeaway was learning how people from disciplines can come together and work to produce a creative solution. I loved hearing everyone’s thoughts and different approaches to the same problem.”
