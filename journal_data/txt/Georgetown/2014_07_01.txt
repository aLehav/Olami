President Barack Obama called upon House Republicans to rally around a new “economic patriotism” with him Tuesday afternoon at the Georgetown Waterfront Park.
Although he began on a light note, mentioning the U.S. Men’s National Team’s upcoming World Cup match, and striking an upbeat tone with the importance of infrastructure funding, his demeanor changed over the course of the 20-minute speech. Expressing emotions that ranged from disbelief to disdain toward House Republicans, Obama maintained that their inaction was holding back middle class families.
A focal point of the speech was the call for Congress to renew the Highway Trust Fund, a program established in 1956 that finances federal roadways.
“It seems like a sensible thing to do,” Obama said of renewing the fund. “It’s not crazy. It’s not socialism. It’s not the imperial presidency. No laws are broken. We’re just building bridges like we have for the last 150 or so years.”
He said if Congress fails to renew the fund this summer, 700,000 jobs would be jeopardized, which he likened to “Congress laying off the entire population of Denver, Seattle or Boston.”
Invoking the image of the Francis Scott Key Bridge behind him, Obama noted that the bridge was deemed structurally inefficient by Transportation for America in June 2011, and that work would begin on it soon so everybody, “even members of Congress,” can travel safely.
He alluded to a perception that some Republicans oppose renewed infrastructure spending to deny him political capital, though he made clear that he does not believe taking infrastructure action constitutes a personal political win.
“This isn’t Obama Bridge,” he said. “This is Key Bridge.”
He made reference to the recent lawsuit launched by House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) last week, which alleges that Obama has engaged in unconstitutional overreaches of executive authority to work without congressional approval. Listing his past unilateral actions and plans to act alone in the future, Obama clearly articulated that he was unfazed by what he has characterized as “a stunt.”
Flanked by construction trucks bearing American flags, he derided House Republicans for what he views as intentional obstruction.
“I’m not sure why they haven’t acted [on infrastructure spending],” he said to the crowd. “It’s not like they are busy with other stuff.”
Obama drew his largest applause from the audience, which consisted of primarily government officials from relevant agencies and employees of infrastructure-related firms, when he adopted campaign-like rhetoric in describing his motivations to act.
“Let’s tell everybody they’re worth something,” he said. “No matter who you are, what you look like, who you love, this is America. You can make it. That’s why I ran for office.”

The minimum wage in the District of Columbia rose from $8.25 to $9.50 today, the first in a series of rate hikes leading to a minimum wage of $11.50 by 2016.
Mayor Vincent Gray affixed his signature to the Minimum Wage Amendment Act of 2013 this January, after the D.C. Council passed the bill unanimously. In a statement on the Executive Office of the Mayor’s website, Gray explained the reasoning behind the law. “
I am proud of the role we played in bringing this minimum-wage increase about, because it will enable all District workers to earn a decent living as well as boost average family incomes,” Gray said. “I am also confident that this measure will help stimulate economic growth in our city, as more money in families’ pockets will allow our residents to spend more money on goods and services.”
In anticipation of the increase, the university began integrating the projected wage hikes into departmental budgets so as to not detrimentally impact on-campus student employment. Many student positions paid below the new minimum wage line, including summer positions. Summer Residence Hall Office employees, for example, started with an $8.25 hourly rate. The university will adjust wages accordingly.
“Departments have worked to incorporate these changes into their departmental budgets. Students who were making less than $9.50 an hour before July 1 will see their wages increase effective July 1,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh wrote in an email.
The law, which is estimated to affect 40,000 workers in the District, stipulates an annual increase of one dollar, concluding on July 1, 2016. Following the establishment of the $11.50 rate, the minimum wage will inflate every July 1 per the annual average increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers in the Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Georgetown Day marks the end of the academic year, but its commencement has long been bereft of a singular tradition. Students of Georgetown Inc. aims to change that with Kickback, a daylong celebration of students’ return to campus.
“We’re looking to plan a day for students in the fall to come back to campus and have something to be excited about,” Patrick Moore (MSB ’15), chief operating officer of The Corp, said.
The organization publicized a new website on June 30, currently adorned with a countdown to a detailed announcement and full website launch. While specifics are sparse in advance of the July 8 reveal, the day will be arts-focused.
“The goal, broadly, is to further arts and music at Georgetown and strengthen our campus’s connection to the outside community,” Corp CEO Sam Rodman (MSB ’15) said.
To that end, the organization, which started planning in April, has targeted partnerships within campus and in the greater Georgetown community.
“One of the things we’re really trying to do is partner with some other student organizations, whether that be WGTB or whether it be Art Aficionados … or even different student groups that aren’t formalized clubs under [the Student Activities Commission]. We’re also partnering with some off-campus community vendors,” Moore said. “We haven’t fully reached out to everyone we’re planning on involving in this event, so those are some next steps for us.”
Rodman, Moore, and Corp Chief Financial Officer Gene Ball (MSB ’16) took office in early March. Expanding The Corp’s on-campus impact and effect on students ranked highly on the leadership team’s agenda.
“We have these great scholarships that impact certain specific organizations or a few individuals at a time and we’re really proud to be able to affect different students in different ways. So one of the questions we wanted to put on the table for our year was ‘How do we affect the campus in a big way?’” Moore said.
The impending fall opening of the salad-and-smoothie storefront Hilltoss, stocking local vendors and the creation of a mobile app serve to increase the company’s profile, but Kickback helps bring their wider goal into fruition.
“We realized that this day, getting everyone together, was a void we saw on campus and a way we could, as The Corp, broaden our on-campus effect,” Rodman said.
The all-day event will take place prior to the start of classes, a timeframe traditionally associated with the freshman-targeted New Student Orientation and Welcome Week.
“Welcome Week does a fantastic job of getting incoming freshmen excited about the upcoming year and college that they have ahead of them. Our goal with Kickback is getting every student that is returning to campus extremely excited,” Rodman said.
Kickback will be ticketed, but the company aims to price low, in contrast to November’s Corp Gala benefit, with the intention of recouping costs while fostering inclusiveness.
“The problem with [Corp Gala] is that the ticket prices are extremely high, and they’re there for a reason; it is a gala event and one that gives back to charity,” Rodman said. “We wanted to find a way to lower that cost-of-entry to students, so a goal is to provide a very low-cost event that pretty much any student can purchase a ticket for without thinking twice, which is an exciting way for us to give back as an organization.”
After conversations with the Georgetown University Police Department, Moore does not currently anticipate ticket limitation, but the development of a new event means that details are yet to be finalized.
“This is our first-time ever planning something like this, so it’s a work-in-progress with us, a work-in-progress with communicating with the university, work-in-progress with dealing with off-campus providers as well,” Moore said.
Next week’s announcement will include the event’s focus, mission and tentative schedule, but the organization will continue to release new details in the weeks leading up the event.
Above all, The Corp intends Kickback to bring students together for a day of community and celebration — an emphasis reflected in the event’s name.
“We did a lot of name generation for the event and this was kind of the one that just stuck. We tried out combining a bunch of Greek and Latin words at first but they all just seemed somewhat forced,” Moore said. “It’s sort of a play on words of ‘welcome back’ and ‘kick-off’ and ‘kick back, relax, and enjoy the show.’”
