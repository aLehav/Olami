GU Fossil Free announced Tuesday that the Georgetown University Student Association will consider holding a student-wide referendum on whether the university should fully divest its holdings from the top 200 fossil fuel companies on the executive ballot vote in February, marking its first proposal for a referendum since 2013.
GUSA will include the vote on the ballot if GU Fossil Free delivers a proposal with at least 300 student signatures, which must then be passed by a two-thirds vote in the senate. The group released a video Tuesday urging students to vote in favor of divestment in the referendum.
GU Fossil Free received more than 2,500 signatures on a petition from Georgetown students, alumni, faculty and students from other universities in favor of divestment at Georgetown. The group began circulating the petition in January 2013 and will present it to the GUSA senate during a meeting Nov. 15.
The senate must review the proposal 48 hours in advance before the Ways and Means Committee approves a vote on it.
In 2013, the group gathered 1,400 signatures on a petition to hold a student-wide referendum through GUSA. However, GU Fossil Free ultimately decided to postpone the referendum until students were more educated on the issue of divestment. The senate passed a resolution in support of divestment in place of the referendum.
Former GU Fossil Free member Patricia Cipollitti (SFS ’15), who was involved in the group during the 2013 referendum proposal, said that the group should focus on furthering the divestment movement on campus.
“I think GU Fossil Free’s strategy should be educating students and really building a base for a student movement and a community movement,” Elena said. “That building of power within the community will be very effective.”
According to Grady Willard (SFS ’18), GUSA Election Commission vice-chair and GU Fossil Free member, the group hopes a large demonstration of student support will pressure the university to divest.
“It’s a way to show … a high percentage [of students] support Georgetown divesting from fossil fuels,” Willard said.
Willard also said that he will separate his responsibilities in GUSA and GU Fossil Free during the process.
“The only thing the election commission has to do is run the referendum,” Willard said. “The senate is the one that approves the language. If anything is needed of the election commission, it will be handled by the other election commissioners.”
If the senate approves GU Fossil Free’s proposal, students will be able to vote on whether they think the university should divest on the GUSA executive election ballot. In June, the board of directors voted unanimously to divest the university’s endowment from direct coal investment, a decision that GU Fossil Free criticized as inadequate in a statement on its website. The university announced Sept. 23 that it has followed through on its agreement to end direct investments in coal companies.
Throughout the past academic year, GU Fossil Free has demonstrated multiple times in support of full divestment, including storming the Gaston Hall stage during a speech by World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim in March.
According to estimates from GU Fossil Free, 2 percent of the university’s $1.5 billion endowment is invested directly in fossil fuels. Since 2011, 32 colleges and universities, including Stanford University, the University of Maine and the University of Washington, have pulled their investments from fossil fuels.
GUSA Senate Vice Speaker and GU Fossil Free member Theo Montgomery (SFS ’18) said although the university has made progress in terms of divestment, GU Fossil Free members felt they could achieve more through the referendum.
“That [vote] left us with some sort of uncertainty,” Montgomery said. “How do we proceed in the future? What the university has done so far is insufficient. What the referendum does is give us a way to quantify the support we have.”
According to the promotional video released by GU Fossil Free on Tuesday, the group also hopes that the referendum will expand the scope of the university’s commitment to clean energy.
“It is wrong for us to profit from catastrophic climate change,” GU Fossil Free member Samantha Panchèvre (SFS ’19) said in the video. “We have a chance to make our university better.”
GUSA Senate Speaker Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said she and her colleagues will likely support the referendum.
“I will vote based on what my constituents feel, so I will be voting in favor,” Khan said. “I assume that based on precedent we will also be in favor of this proposal to bring it to the ballot.”
Khan cited the 2,000 petition signatures as proof of the referendum’s relevance to the university community. According to Montgomery, the majority of the signatures are from students.
“That’s almost a third of the student body,” Khan said. “That definitely qualifies that this issue is taken to the student body for a vote as a whole.”
According to GU Fossil Free member Sabrina Fields (SFS ’18), the majority of the university community is supportive of divestment. She said that educating students on the meaning of divestment and getting feedback is a priority.
“We think it’s important … to get feedback from every direction to see how we can make our position stronger,” Field said. “I think that it’s going to go over really well.”
Field said she feels confident the referendum can pass if presented to the student body.
“The majority of the student body that I’ve talked to, that I’ve had interactions with on behalf GU Fossil Free … is very sympathetic to this cause,” Field said.
GUSA Secretary of Campus Planning Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said this marks another important step in GU Fossil Free’s multiyear campaign.
“Although the vote will be largely symbolic, a strong showing from the student body will send a clear message,” Goldstein wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It will be incumbent upon GU Fossil Free and all of us who care about climate justice to spend the next few months educating Hoyas about the issue.”

Maybe the Hoya should actually bother looking for students who aren’t in favor instead of writing a load of puffery from the economically illiterate

Georgetown received top scores in two separate studies analyzing the expected career earnings of university graduates released by The Economist and Brookings Institute last week.
Both rankings measured the difference between students’ expected earnings when matriculating into an institution and their projected median earnings after college. Georgetown placed 16th out of 1,275 tertiary institutions in the United States in The Economist ranking and received a score of 99/100 in the Brookings Institute’s study.
The Economist’s list, the first college ranking in the publication’s history, ranked colleges based on the difference between expected earnings and median earnings 10 years after a student enters the university.
According to The Economist’s metrics, a Georgetown student’s projected median annual earnings is $83,300, which is $9,198 higher than their expected annual earnings of $74,102. The study used the projected median earnings from the college scorecard report released by the Department of Education in October, and derived the expected earnings figure by combing data such as SAT scores, sex ratio and college size to predict the earnings of future alumni.
The Brookings Institute ranking ranked colleges out of 100 by measuring the percent change between figure by combining data such as SAT scores, sex ratio and college size to predict the earnings of future alumni.
The Brookings Institution ranking ranked colleges out of 100 by measuring the percent change between actual median earnings and predicted earnings. The former figure was also taken from the college scorecard, while the latter was derived using metrics such as race and ethnicity, academic preparation and family income.
According to the study, Georgetown students are predicted to earn $57,076 compared to their actual projected median earnings of $87,669, which results in a 42.9 percent value-added total for students. This garnered the university a 99/100 rating.
Many other peer institutions also received top scores. Harvard University received a 100/100 rating, while Yale University received 88/100 and the University of Pennslyvania received 97/100.
While both studies used the scorecard for their figures, The Economist used figures from students who matriculated in 2001 and Brookings used earning figures from three different years of matriculation: 1997 to 1998, 2001 to 2002 and 2005 to 2006.
Both The Economist and Brookings rankings only included students who receive federal aid, which was the only demographic of students studied by the college scorecard report. According to Rothwell, this exclusion significantly impacted the results.
“The College Scorecard database is limited to students who receive federal aid. I estimate that federal aid recipients typically earn about 85 cents for every dollar earned by nonrecipients, so the earnings data are significantly affected by this,” Rothwell wrote.
According to Cawley Career Education Center Executive Director Mike Schaub, The Economist’s study shows the value of a Georgetown education, but does not fully encompass further qualitative benefits of studying at Georgetown.
“I am pleased that the Georgetown education translates to a strong earning potential,” Schaub wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, I believe that the value of the Georgetown education extends far beyond what can be determined by the regression analysis utilized by The Economist. The value of a Georgetown education reflects learning experiences obtained by students both in and out of the classroom.”
Fellow at Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program Jonathan Rothwell, who authored the Brookings Institution report, said a Georgetown education is beneficial toward a student’s future career earnings. However, the score may be impeded by the fact that students’ incomes are already expected to be high when they matriculate.
“Georgetown ranks even higher on the median salary of alumni in the same cohort, but falls slightly on the value-added ranking because predicted earnings are also very high for Georgetown students, given their high scores on admission exams and the high family income of the average student,” Rothwell wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Rothwell also said the value added by Georgetown to graduates’ income is increasing over time.
“I also found that Georgetown has increased the value it adds to alumni earnings more than all but eight other four-year colleges,” Rothwell wrote. “These results suggest that if I were to redo the main analysis for more recent students once they have had some work experience, Georgetown would likely rate even higher than it does now.”
The Economist’s rankings center on the assumption that a student values the economic value of a university above other qualitative factors such as appropriate fit, location and curriculum choice.
“The Economist’s first-ever college rankings are based on a simple, if debatable, premise: the economic value of a university is equal to the gap between how much money its students subsequently earn, and how much they might have made had they studied elsewhere,” the report reads.
Dan Rosenheck, editor of The Economist’s data team, was not available to comment at press time.
The No. 1 college on The Economist’s rankings is Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., which sees alumni earning $22,377 more than their expected earnings.
Other colleges in the top 20 include Harvard University in fourth place and the University of Pennsylvania at 15th place, with alumni earnings above expectation by $12,734 and $9,387, respectively. In contrast, the report shows that Yale University alumni earn $-9,590 less than expected, which results in a ranking of 1,270 out of 1,275 colleges.
Rothwell’s report includes an analysis of earnings data from Payscale, an online salary information database that used a smaller sample size of students but did not limit the sample of aid-recipients. According to Rothwell, Georgetown’s score is lower when nonrecipients are considered.
“Georgetown does less well by this measure — 85th [per]centile of value-added using Payscale compared to the 99th [per]centile using the Scorecard,” Rothwell wrote.
Schaub also stressed that Georgetown graduates provide positive impact in all careers that they choose to pursue, regardless of income.
“Even if graduates are earning below the median salary point derived from this study, I believe that they are making meaningful contributions to their work, family and community,” Schaub wrote. “Based on my interactions with alumni, the Georgetown education is valuable regardless of the job or the salary range.”
Diane Lowitt (COL ’19) said the rankings neglect other factors of success, such as happiness, after graduation.
“I’ve learned a lot with how income doesn’t necessarily correlate with happiness after graduation, and I think it’d probably be different if they looked at the overall well-being of graduates,” Lowitt said.
Payaum Sanatkar (SFS ’18) said that The Economist’s rankings focus very narrowly on economic value while ignoring important aspects of college such as research and service.
“I find The Economist’s college rankings based off of economic value perfectly fine if you think the goal of a university is to produce economic advantages for its students,” Sanatkar said. “I, however, find the role of a university is to produce research and promote service for the general good, and in that case, while I find the Economist’s ranking system fair, I do not put much value in it.”

As part of Domestic Violence Awareness Month in October, the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity hosted its second annual Halloween 5K Against Domestic Violence on Copley Lawn on Friday, which saw 20 more participants than did last year’s event.
The event raised funds for Doorways for Women and Families, a Virginia-based nonprofit dedicated to supporting victims and families affected by domestic violence and homelessness. Participants were encouraged to make a $15 donation.
This year, 195 students and community members signed up as runners, walkers or volunteers for the event, an increase from the 175 that signed up last year. SigEp members do not yet have a number for how much money they raised this year, but they are hopeful it will surpass the $8,357 raised last year.
Other organizations, including Take Back the Night, Georgetown University Women in Leadership, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Hilltop Microfinance Institute and Club Swimming supported the event by coordinating outreach initiatives to increase the number of participants.
In addition to the race, the event included an opportunity for students to interact with representatives from Doorways and a performance by a cappella group Georgetown Superfood.
President of SigEp Chris Tiede (COL ’16) said that the race is one way the fraternity strives to incorporate philanthropic values into its initiatives.
“Within the framework of being men and women for others, philanthropy is really important to us,” Tiede said. “This was an organization that we decided to partner with and we thought that the 5K was a good way to raise money, raise knowledge, raise awareness and address all of those things.”
SigEp was supported with $93 from the Georgetown University Student Association’s budget for unrecognized groups and received help reserving Copley Lawn to host the event.
According to Vice President of Philanthropy for SigEp Charlie Brown (MSB ’17), SigEp faced difficulties securing Copley Lawn for the event, as the fraternity is not recognized and receives no funding or support from the university. Last year, the group booked the lawn through WGTB Georgetown Radio.
Brown said that he was grateful for GUSA’s support.
“I understand the different reasons why the university might not want to recognize us but obviously, when we’re doing something like this, we only have good intentions,” Brown said. “So it’s good that we can have GUSA to support us and help make this possible.”
Brown also said this year’s event was more organized than the one last year.
“Last year, it was kind of thrown together last minute. We definitely didn’t give ourselves enough time to do it. This year, the event went a lot more smoothly and was overall just more fun for everyone,” Brown said.
However, Brown said the fraternity will continue to make improvements to the event in its future iterations.
“There’s also still room for improvement for next year and the year after that. And the goal is that we’re just going to keep building and improving so that this can really stay and become a staple of Georgetown Halloween every year,” Brown said.
President and CEO of Doorways for Women and Families Caroline Jones said the race was successful in raising awareness on the issue of domestic violence.
“Domestic violence is not a women’s issue, it’s a human issue. It will truly take all of us really raising our awareness and changing our behavior to eradicate it from our society,” Jones said. “So having this group, at this particular time in our national history and culture, take a stand through this 5K, not to mention the extraordinary fundraising that they’re doing to help fuel the programs that we’re trying to deliver here, it’s just really, really amazing to see.”
Jones added that the event helps to break the stigma of Greek life and young adult activism in general.
“I think it’s a really effective way to put different images in people’s minds about what our young adults look like and what their true potential is as compassionate human beings. So I couldn’t applaud this more loudly. It’s exactly what we need,” Jones said. “I wish that this type of effort would catch on and be even more widespread across other Greek life or just college campuses as a whole.”
Brown agreed that SigEp tries to break the stereotypes of social fraternities through its philanthropic initiatives.
“Georgetown is about men and women for others and I think that this event is a really good example of how we really do encapsulate a lot of the values that Georgetown tries to teach us as students,” Brown said. “Even if we’re not recognized, we’re still able to provide value to the Georgetown experience with this 5K.”
Bella Gerard (COL ’17), who attended the event, praised the event for its charitable aspect.
“The brothers of SigEp make a point to create an event that is both entertaining while still beneficial to others,” Gerard wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The time SigEp puts into their philanthropy work is evident in both the success of the event and the gratitude Doorways For Women and Children no doubt has toward the fraternity.”

The McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center on Education and the Workforce found that over the last quarter century, around 70 percent of U.S. college students worked a paid job at some point in their college careers in a study released Oct. 28.
According to the report, called “Learning While Earning: The New Normal,” 30 percent of all working learners are aged 30 and older, and 50 percent of the demographic group work at least 40 hours per week. For undergraduates and graduate students overall, 40 percent work at least 30 hours per week. However, 34 percent of those working learners still have at least $25,000 in student loan debt.
Additionally, the report calls for new policies to assist students in balancing their educational ambitions with their employment.
Authors Anthony Carnevale, Nicole Smith, Michelle Melton and Eric Price have conducted research for this project for the last two years using data from five different databases, including the American Community Survey and National Postsecondary Study Aid Study. With help from the Gates Foundation and the Lumina Foundation, the authors set out to measure and capture the day-to-day struggles of today’s typical working learner.
“While we know that students work during their years in college, much of our perspectives are anecdotal,” Smith said. “We wanted to be able to add to that discussion by quantifying who’s working, the extent they’re working and how trends have changed over time, trying to find what the new student looks like.”
The report delves into a variety of trends, ranging from the types of jobs students work to their overall levels of income based on age. For Smith, one of the most surprising findings was the proportion of women -— around 60 percent of working learners — who are earning while enrolled in school.
“We have all of these really burdened students … and the way our society is structured is that great child-rearing responsibilities fall on mothers,” Smith said. “The idea that the highest fraction of working-learners population is female came as a big surprise.”
According to Smith, another area of surprise is the relationship between working learners and parenthood. At least 19 percent of all working learners have children, a point of significance when it comes to discussing the issues faced by students struggling to balance academic, professional and personal lives.
“Given that it is true that most [students] have to work, we must ask ourselves what can be done to make this process streamlined while making sure [working students] have the opportunities available that they would certainly have if they aren’t working,” Smith said.
The study also sets forth policies that the authors believe will assist our nation’s learning earners. The proposed policies center around helping students develop stronger ties with the worlds of work and education as well as incentivizing institutions to have a direct hand in aiding students balance their academic and professional lives.
“When the momentum builds on a topic like this, you start to realize that change can be effective,” Price said. “The community as a whole, from students to faculty to businesses, should recognize that there must be room for working and learning, and policy discussions should reflect this.”
Price is also a working learner himself, currently completing his masters in the McCourt School while also working part-time. Price highlighted his personal experience with many of the observations raised in the report.
“I worked full-time for about eight years following the conclusion of my undergraduate degree, and going back to school was difficult,” Price said. “You face time constraints, constraints on personal relationships … even with these struggles, I recognize the importance of continuing my education and lifelong learning.”
For Samuel French (COL ’17), working off-campus at a local bicycle shop is both frustrating and valuable.
“I began working to have some basic income to utilize,” French said. “But I don’t see it so much as simple work. I get to build on my skills and improve my time-management. It’s not all positive, but I’m improving my own situation as a student and as a prospective employee for the future.”
Jonathan Ulmer (COL ’18), a Georgetown library employee, said earning learners need support from the university and community if they are to find success not just in their academic lives, but also in their experiences after university.
“As someone working 14 hours a week, it would be more than a stretch to maintain a full class load,” Ulmer said. “The more our community as a whole understands and chooses to address the needs of learning earners, than our situation would only improve, and improvement is something that most of us are looking for.”

The Institute of Politics and Public Service launched a mentorship program to connect Georgetown students with working professionals from fields including government, advocacy, consulting, journalism and public relations Oct. 29.
According to IPPS Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), the mentorship program falls under the institute’s greater mission of increasing the accessibility of these disciplines.
“If we can create a lot of personal connections and a direct pipeline between Georgetown students and practicing professionals, that will benefit students and the university and further cement the university’s ties with D.C.,” Elleithee said. “People are excited to help cultivate the next generation of practitioners in these fields.”
Developing these personal relationships is the main objective behind the IPPS mentorship program. Although the program is still in its initial stages of development, the IPPS has started accepting applications in the form of a basic interest questionnaire on its website. Both undergraduate and graduate students are able to request a mentor, and partnerships will be set up on a rolling basis.
The interest form asks students to discuss the type of political or public service professional with whom they are most interested in connecting, the types of skills they would most like to develop and their general interests and extracurricular activities.
Once a student is paired with a mentor, they will meet no less than three times a semester in casual settings, such as for coffee or lunch.
Elleithee explained the goal of the mentorship program is for the mentor and mentee to develop a close relationship that helps the mentee gain access to opportunities in his fields of interest.
“It’s about giving you that close-up look and having somebody that you can lean on as you figure out your path,” Elleithee said. “As we were trying to figure out what we wanted the IPPS to be, there was a general recognition that internships are great but you don’t always get one-on-one interaction with the principal.”
The program is open to both undergraduate and graduate students, and mentors range from D.C. councilmembers and reporters to Capitol Hill aides and pollsters.
“Some are the big names, but there are also folks that may not be the name in the headlines but they are still the people that make things work,” Elleithee said. “They are the people who actually get stuff done in politics and government and journalism.”
D.C. Councilmember and IPPS mentor David Grosso (LAW ’01) emphasized the importance of mentorship and expressed enthusiasm about the program.
“Mentees will definitely gain from the experiences of the mentors, but the program mentors will also gain so much from the creativity and perspective of the young people involved,” Grosso wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Some of the greatest political movements were born of the innovation of young leaders. This program is positioned to be the catalyst for an exciting exchange of ideas.”
Grosso said he intends to share his experiences as a former student and current public servant with his mentee.
“I plan to fully engage in the program by offering my time and experiences to the program and its participants,” Grosso wrote. “With my mentee, I plan to work with that individual to determine the best course of action to achieve their short term and long term goals. I also plan to involve my mentee in the work that I do on behalf of the District of Columbia.”
Annie O’Brien (COL ’19), who plans on majoring in American Studies and Government, signed up to be a mentee.
“I wanted to be a part of the mentorship program in order to gain an inside perspective of an aspect of the political system,” O’Brien wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The mentorship program seemed like a fun way to get to know a professional while also learning invaluable knowledge through shadowing the work the professional does.”
O’Brien explained that although she has yet to be paired, she is hoping her mentor will be a Hill staffer, campaign manager or journalist who is excited about sharing his knowledge and experience with her.
“I think programs like this are important in order to engage students and professionals in a way that is related to work, but not in the traditional employer-employee hierarchy that comes with internships,” O’Brien wrote. “It’s a unique way for students to get involved in what lies outside the Georgetown bubble. I think this program will integrate Georgetown more into the political sphere and widen students’ perspectives of what happens in D.C.”
Blake Atherton (SFS ’16) previously participated in the Hoya Gateway program and is interested in a mentor who has experience in both law and policy. Atherton stressed the value of the program as a professional resource for students.
“Initiatives that allow students to better capitalize on the wealth of knowledge and expertise of alumni are extremely worthwhile,” Atherton wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I believe that being better informed about professional opportunities and how to seize them will allow Georgetown students to more fully realize their potential.”

Senior Adviser to President Barack Obama Valerie Jarrett discussed her 24-year-long career, the White House’s top priorities and her daily life in Copley Formal Lounge on Tuesday.
The Institute of Politics and Public Service organized the event, moderated by IPPS Fellow Buffy Wicks, who was a strategist on both Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns. Wicks worked directly with Jarrett prior to joining the IPPS’ inaugural group of fellows. Wicks along with four other fellows has been leading IPPS events throughout the institute’s first semester on campus.
Wicks and Jarrett discussed the adviser’s views on the state of the White House and whether the administration is on track to resolve major policy issues in the president’s last year in office.
“I think we’re feeling pretty good. The reports of him being a lame duck were probably a little exaggerated,” Jarrett said. “This summer was tremendous. Congress gave the president trade promotion authority for his trade deals and the Supreme Court upheld marriage equality, which was a pretty historic moment.”
According to Jarrett, the idea to light up the White House in rainbow colors to celebrate the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize gay marriage came from a junior staffer.
“I think it’s going to be an iconic photograph that will go down in history that I will always remember, that we actually did move the arc of the moral universe towards justice,” Jarrett said.
Jarrett also said the administration’s next targets are criminal justice reform, gun control legislation, climate initiatives and immigration reform. Jarrett expressed the expectation of bipartisan support on the first issue, but anticipated that progress in the other issues will be a greater challenge.
However, Jarrett also stressed her frustration with the federal government’s inability to agree on comprehensive gun control legislation, saying her worst day at the White House was Dec. 14, 2012, the day of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
“I think it was the only time when I’ve looked around and seen Secret Service agents with tears streaming down their faces,” Jarrett said. “That’s a day I will never forget.”
On the other hand, Jarrett’s best experience at the White House was the day the Affordable Care Act passed in Congress.
“That night was about celebrating all the hard work we’d put in,” Jarrett said. “Now, it’s gone from being the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, a political football, into saving lives.”
Alexander Coopersmith (COL ’19) said he appreciated Jarrett’s advice.
“I really liked how she told her personal story about having her life all planned out, then following that plan and realizing how she hated what she was doing,” Coopersmith said. “That stuck with me. Here I was — a 19-year-old receiving advice from an advisor to the president that I don’t need a plan for the future, and I don’t need to worry about having one.”
Amanda Holloway (COL ’19) highlighted how she was inspired by Jarrett’s overall demeanor.
“I was motivated by her upbeat and down-to-earth nature. I don’t know exactly how she phrased it, but she said that certain situations have been very revealing and she had a deeper understanding of the president,” Holloway said.

The McDonough School of Business Dean’s Office will launch the Undergraduate Women in Business Group, an initiative that provides academic and pre-professional support for women in the MSB, in January.
The group will host events, workshops and mentorship programs for its initial cohort of around 60 selected students, though it also plans on organizing events for all MSB students. Applications will open in January to female freshmen, sophomores and juniors in the MSB.
The group is co-chaired by MSB Associate Dean Patricia Grant and Associate Director of the MSB Dean’s Office Michelle Sheahan. Bridget Morton (MSB ’16) and Caroline Murphy (MSB ’17) will serve as the student co-chairs.
According to Morton, the group will invite former alumnae to speak to current students and hold resume and interview workshops and tutoring sessions.
“[Being part of the cohort] is going to be a great chance to make some friends and work on project skills,” Morton said. “Women are certainly the minority as far as demographics go, so we’re looking to create a vibrant community of [women].”
Female students compose around 40 percent of the MSB.
Morton said that she initially conceptualized the idea of forming a group after she transferred to Georgetown from Babson College, where she was involved in a similar group called the Women’s Leadership Program. In August, Morton began working with Sheahan and Grant to create the group.
“I was looking for more opportunities to engage more thoughtfully with mentorship and with leadership opportunities,” Morton said. “I was able to connect with some of the deans of the business school … [and] combine some of my efforts with theirs.”
Currently, Morton and Murphy are in the process of interviewing candidates for their inaugural student board, which will supervise aspects of the group like marketing and outreach.
According to Morton, the group will not focus solely on an applicant’s GPA or major, but rather seek to accept a wide range of undergraduate women looking to develop leadership skills.
“[I] am very passionate about gender equality and I know that when there is a sisterhood among students in an academic environment, women thrive,” Sheahan said. “[Women should] support one another in their success while they are here and when they are out in the workforce.”
According to Sheahan, other similar organizations such as The George Washington University’s Women’s Leadership Program and Harvard University’s Undergraduate Women in Business have been created in the past few years.
Sheahan said the MSB should also establish an association to help its female students.
“There has been a need for some time for there to be a undergraduate women in business group here at McDonough School of Business,” Sheahan said. “We would like to make sure … [our students] have that student group.”
Sheahan explained that the group will partner with other groups in support of female leadership on campus, such as Georgetown University Women in Leadership.
According to Sheahan, these partnerships will help strengthen the group by providing a greater range of potential activities than business-related matters.
“We will make sure to partner with … the other women student groups on campus,” Sheahan said. “[We need women] who are committed to the cause [of] supporting the success of the student group.”
Morton also said the group will not seek to replace the efforts of other women’s groups on campus, but rather grow alongside them. She said she hopes the group will provide female students with more opportunities than before.
“I’m really excited about [the group]. It’s a program that we should be really proud of,” Morton said. “This is creating a more vibrant community for women on campus.”
Katherine Cole (MSB ’18) said the MSB could benefit from the establishment of the group.
“I think it’s definitely needed,” Cole said. “Even though Georgetown is 55 percent female, the business school is definitely not 55 percent female, so we are definitely less represented.”
Cole also said that the group partners well with existing groups such as Georgetown University Women in Leadership to create a resource for female students.
“We have [GUWIL], but I think it’d be good to have something specifically focused on the business school,” Cole said. “I think it’s beneficial and would help us. We would have a backbone of support.”

The Global Business Fellows program, a joint initiative between the McDonough School of Business and the School of Foreign Service, accepted 40 percent of applicants from the SFS and 60 percent of applicants from the MSB to join its second cohort this fall.
The cohort is composed of 15 sophomores from the SFS and 15 from the MSB. The SFS received a total 43 applications, in which 38 students indicated their interest in the fellows program and five in the global business major, which is only offered through the SFS. SFS applicants were notified of their acceptance Oct. 20. The MSB received 25 applicants.
According to Senior Associate Director Laura Soerensson, the MSB fellows had an average GPA of 3.72. SFS Assistant Dean Samuel Aronson, who serves as the Global Business fellows curricular chair, did not reply to a request for the average GPA of SFS fellows.
The fellows program launched in conjunction with the global business major in spring 2015. The program allows participants in both schools to enroll in political and economic courses in the SFS and business courses in the MSB. Fellows receive a certificate in global business upon completion of the courses.
Rosaelena O’Neil, the deputy director of the Landegger Program in International Business Diplomacy and SFS coordinator of the Global Business Fellows program, said the fellows will gain valuable experience through the program.
“This experience is very unique and special because it does simulate more of the work environment that they will enter,” O’Neil said. “This is a team-based class and the other thing that’s interesting is that the big project that they do is presented to a group of outside professional practitioners.”
The academic requirements include core courses in the MSB such as accounting and marketing, as well as classes in the SFS on economics. Participants are also required to take foreign language courses in the program.
In addition to coursework requirements, the program offers opportunities for professional development to fellows. Students will participate in global business experience in their junior and senior years in order to intersect their studies with an international business and public policy focus. This year’s program will organize a boot camp designed for students considering careers in finance, which includes the conducting of mock interviews. Each participant will also work with a professor from the MSB in his senior year.
According to O’Neil, students in the pilot program have responded positively to these initiatives.
“Now, as we are moving forward, we are planning some more networking experiences,” O’Neil said. “The students that are participating in these events find them very complementary and applied in conjunction with their academic work.”
MSB Senior Associate Dean Norean Sharpe said that students in the program engage in a rigorous yet rewarding set of courses.
“This program requires the cohort of McDonough and SFS students to enroll in a series of challenging courses in business, international affairs and economics,” Sharpe wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to O’Neil, the incoming cohort has a greater distribution of majors than the first group.
“One of the goals we had for this cohort was to get a broader distribution in majors within the fellows, as opposed to creating a lot of overlap with the major,” O’Neil said. “One of the things we were looking for was distinctively different students that were coming in with different major interests.”
Andrea Moneton (SFS ’18), who was recently accepted into the program, said she looks forward to participating in the program.
“I’m excited to gain some technical business skills to round out my Georgetown education,” Moneton wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think it’s going to be a great way to make my education over the next few years even more interdisciplinary.”
Shaked Atia (SFS ‘17), who joined the fellows program last year, said that student interest in the program has increased since its launch.
“I believe the popularity of the program grew since I applied last year, especially because other students can now see its benefits,” Atia said. “You see more and more SFS students taking business classes because they want to gain some hard skills to complement their majors. The program is constantly changing because we are its first cohort, so naturally there will be adjustments.”
Caroline Ritter (SFS ’17) also said she enjoyed the program as it hones her interest in the intersection of politics and economy.
“This program is valuable to Georgetown because it not only equips students with the necessary skills to approach challenges that could arise in future careers in international affairs and in business, but also because it connects students to professionals who are already successful in these fields through networking opportunities,” Ritter said.

School of Foreign Service professor Keir Lieber received a $500,000 grant from the Carnegie Corporation to conduct a two-year research project on the impact of technology on nuclear warfare with professors from three other universities.
The study will focus on the intersections of technology and strategic stability, which is a belief in nuclear warfare philosophy that conflicting nations will not use nuclear weapons due to the risk of mutual destruction.
Lieber will conduct the study with professors Daryl Press at Dartmouth College, Austin Long at Columbia University and Brendan Green at the University of Cincinnati. All of the professors specialize in political science and international affairs.
Lieber said he hopes to correct misconceptions surrounding nuclear warfare in the United States with the research study.
“We think that there is a general ignorance of the development that technology has brought,” Lieber said. “We fear that the United States in particular, but other states, might find themselves in a conflict, which could escalate to nuclear use if they’re not aware of how technology has changed pretty dramatically.”
The group expects to use the grant to produce a report and host a conference to present their findings by late September 2017. In addition, the researchers will host a series of workshops throughout the next two years to receive ongoing feedback on their findings.
According to Lieber, the grant will allow the team to gather more perspectives from an international community of researchers.
“Much of the grant activity is centered around holding a series of workshops: international workshops where we’ll bring in local regional experts and paid consultant experts. … We wanted to get international perspectives on these developments,” Lieber said. 
According to Lieber, he initially conceptualized the study with Press after they spent years on multiple projects on nuclear deterrence issues. The two have collaborated on more than 10 articles on the topic over the past decade.
Lieber said all four researchers are interested in educating students, policymakers and political analysts on the evolving threat of nuclear weapons.
“It’s public education, so all of us can be aware of what’s happening. It’s policy advocacy for better nuclear policies. … A big part of the grant involves teaching the next generation of nuclear analysts modeling techniques and techniques for understanding the impact of technology on strategic stability,” Lieber said.
Lieber also said research on nuclear deterrence has become particularly important since the end of the Cold War.
“We’ve fought half a dozen wars since the end of the Cold War, and the possibility that we will face in a conventional war a nuclear armed adversary is becoming increasingly likely,” Lieber said. “There hasn’t been a lot of thought since the end of the Cold War about how to fight conventional conflict without it escalating to the nuclear level.”
Government professor Matthew Kroenig, who has written two books on nuclear policy, said the research project is particularly important in light of the increased threat of nuclear conflict.
“The risk of nuclear war in Europe is higher now than at any time since the 1980s,” Kroenig wrote in an email to The Hoya. “If Russia were to replay its hybrid warfare playbook from Ukraine against a [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] country, there would be a real risk of nuclear escalation.”
SFS Senior Associate Dean for Faculty and Graduate Affairs Anthony Arend said that Lieber’s research will help to further progress the school’s goals.
“We want people who advance our understanding of real life problems so that we can prepare students to better enter a very complex, and in some respects, confusing world,” Arend said. “Faculty members like Keir Lieber are doing cutting edge research that are helping all of us better understand the world.”
Austin Baker (SFS ’16), who is a student in Lieber’s course entitled “Nuclear Weapons: History, Strategy and Technology,” believes it is important for all students to have an understanding of Lieber’s work. 
“For Georgetown students especially … [it is important to have] this kind of foundation of knowledge in terms of what these weapons are, what they can do, what they can’t do and how that plays into potential scenarios of which a state might want to escalate with nuclear weapons and the [United States] would be forced to respond,” Baker said.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency and Center for Resource Solutions presented Washington, D.C., a Green Power Leadership Award for its use of renewable energy resources.
The district was honored at the annual Renewable Energy Markets Conference on Oct. 19, recognizing Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration for implementing a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement with Iberdrola Renewables, LLC in July.
As part of this agreement, the city’s Department of General Services effectively replaces 30 to 35 percent of government buildings’ electricity with wind energy from a wind farm in southwestern Pennsylvania.
The DGS maintains more than 400 buildings that are points of access to the city government for the public, such as schools and recreation centers. The DGS Energy and Sustainability Division is responsible for promoting conservation in its power and utilities usage, as well as for maintaining a sustainable district portfolio of green building.
DGS Energy and Sustainability Director Mark Chambers highlighted solar power usage as a potential expansion for its program.
“We’re actively pursuing solar,” Chambers said. “The idea is that we can use the portfolio of buildings to leverage their being more renewable. … We’re getting to a place now where we’re almost ready to engage and start that process.”
According to Georgetown University Student Association Secretary of Sustainability Caroline James (COL ’16), solar provides people with a visual on-site source of power that they can directly interact with, as opposed to purchased power.
“In my ideal world, they would use the combination of purchased power more for base-load power as well as installed on-site renewables in D.C.,” James said. “Say that they launched a project to have a whole bunch of solar on a whole bunch of houses, maybe city-subsidized housing … and say that the sun isn’t shining, the remainder of that power purchased through a PPA.”
The DGS currently uses a block-and-index strategy for its power blend, meaning it purchases a base load of ground power and then buys any more power necessary on the spot, maximizing dependence on the intermittent load of how much power the wind can provide at a given time.
Chambers emphasized this as a helpful strategy to keep sustainable energy interactive and cost-effective for the public. Additionally, it will supplement the long-term investment assumption that fossil fuel prices will rise and carbon taxes will be enacted.
“You’re really looking at ‘What are the projections of the wind?’ and ‘How much are we going to buy?’” Chambers said. “The more control you take over your power supply, the more opportunity for cost saving and I think the more you get a handle on how you can reduce your overall demand.”
Leader of the College Democrats Environmental Activism Team Madison Thomas (COL ’19) said she considers awareness and expenses to be some of the main issues facing environmentalism.
“There [are] so many different important issues that need to be funded,” Thomas said. “I personally think the environment is one of the most important things that we need to be conscious of when we’re choosing where we’re funding because that’s our entire future, but a lot of people don’t agree.”
James also stressed awareness as a crucial component in the energy-sourcing process.
“When you turn on your light, most people don’t take a lot of time to think about where that energy is coming from,” James said. “It’s certainly Georgetown’s responsibility and the city’s responsibility to publicize to people where that energy is coming from so people understand the underground importance of what’s going on.”
Chambers added that other major obstacles for going green in the city are potentially bureaucratic.
“I think in theory, everyone is supportive of it. I think in practice, you just have to get everyone used to new models of whether it’s procurement, where you find things, or new models of managing things,” Chambers said. “There’s a lot between us wanting to have wind power and actually getting it; there’s a lot of new things that our District government has to do.”
