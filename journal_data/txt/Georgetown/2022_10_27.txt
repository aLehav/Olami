CW: This article references violence and sexual violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The Georgetown University Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS) held a discussion with activists and global policymakers from Myanmar to address human rights violations, especially those that women face, following a military coup in the country last year.
The Oct. 21 webinar took place one day after the 2022 United Nations Open Debate on Women, Peace and Security, an annual deliberation with a theme focused on “Strengthening women’s resilience and leadership as a path to peace in regions plagued by armed groups” this year. At the webinar, panelists discussed the international community’s responsibility to intervene in Myanmar following a military coup in February 2021 during which an authoritarian military junta replaced the parliamentary republic government. 
Since the coup, the country has been in a state of unrest that has caused the poverty rate to double to nearly 50%, according to an April 2021 United Nations report. The unrest has also caused the displacement of 700,000 people.
Mass violence committed by the new military administration since assuming power, particularly against women and children, inspired the urgent need for the event, said GIWPS Executive Director Melanne Verveer, the former U.S. ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues and moderator of the discussion.
“The situation in Myanmar grows more grave by the day. Myanmar’s security forces have only intensified massive human rights abuses, engaged in systematic attacks on peaceful protests, committing arbitrary detentions, torture and killings,” Verveer said at the event. “In short, some of the most egregious violations of human rights that amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes.” 
Since the junta seized control of the government, the military has used sexual assault as a systematic weapon to punish detained pro-democracy protesters. According to a March 2022 report by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, authoritarian rule in Myanmar has decreased state spending on health and welfare services, limiting support services for survivors of this violence. 
Under the military rule of General Min Aung Hlaing, more than 2,398 civilians have been killed during military crackdowns and 12,785 activists are currently in detention, according to an Oct. 27 briefing from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.
Despite the violence the people of Myanmar have faced, Verveer said women activists protesting the military regime have shown strength and resilience.
“Burmese women and girls are on the frontlines of the pro-democracy movement,” Verveer said. “They are courageously leading peaceful demonstrations, standing up for their rights and driving the struggle for a democratic and secure future for Burma, often at great risk to themselves.”
Esther Ze Naw Bamvo, an activist from Myanmar who led the first anti-military protest in the city of Yangon, Myanmar, five days after the coup in 2021, recorded a video statement for the conference as she remains in hiding from the government.
Bamvo said the Myanmar people are dealing with multifaceted emergencies that each require humanitarian relief.
“Mothers deliver babies in the jungle without medical assistance. Many infants do not receive their needed lifesaving vaccinations. Little children were killed by targeted airstrikes on schools. And moreover, as a result of weaponizing conflict related sexual violence as an instrument of war, many girls and women are suffering serious physical, mental and sexual health outcomes,” Bamvo said at the event. 
Naw Susanna Hla Hla Soe is the minister of Women, Youths and Children Affairs in the National Unity Government, the organization that the European Parliament recognizes as the legitimate government of Myanmar. She said the military junta carried out an airstrike on the town of Kawkareik, Myanmar, the morning of the conference in response to rebel forces freeing political protesters from the local prison.
The attack was not an unusual occurrence, according to Hla Hla Soe. 
“Every day we hear that the junta are fighting, killing, hanging,” Hla Hla Soe said at the event. “Our hearts are broken every day that our relatives, our friends, young people are giving their lives.”
Thinzar Shunlei Yi, founder of Sisters2Sisters, an online solidarity movement launched to raise awareness for the use of excessive force by Myanmar’s military, said progress against gender-based violence can be made through the recognition of Myanmar’s history of violence against women, which stems from even before the coup.
“The time is right for passionate criticism that will uproot discriminatory practices and norms that have poisoned our society for generations,” Shunlei said at the event. “Only when misogynists and patriarchal ideologies are subdued can Myanmar women live in peace and security.” 
Bamvo warned that if the people of Myanmar do not receive international support soon, authoritarian leaders around the world will be emboldened to escalate their crimes against humanity.
“It is likely that a series of catastrophes will follow if we do not get timely international support and intervention,” Bamvo said. “Failure to give attention to Myanmar will lead to the rise of other authoritarian regimes. It will threaten our rule-based world order.”

Students in the McDonough School of Business presented their original ideas for potential startup ventures to receive grant money at the Fall 2022 Rocket Pitch Competition.
Georgetown Entrepreneurship, a McDonough School of Business initiative to support students interested in business foundation and management, hosted the event, in which 33 teams presented their venture ideas to a panel of seven judges. The judges consisted of business experts and executives, including Chris Comparato, CEO of restaurant management company Toast and the event’s keynote speaker. In total, judges awarded $4,500 in prize money across five teams for overall excellence, commitment to advancing the common good and audience votes. 
Macromush, a protein bar company founded by Alexander McCarthy (MSB ’23), won first place for a white mushroom-based product that does not contain any of the eight major food allergens. 
McCarthy said the idea for Macromush came from his personal frustration with searching for an allergy-friendly, healthy snack while working out.
“Trying to find quick snacks to fit into my busy days that were high in protein but did not source that protein from peanuts, tree nuts, or milk is a constant challenge,” McCarthy wrote to The Hoya. “I feel that the market does not address my pain point and that there must be many others that share in a similar struggle.” 
McCarthy said he hopes to use the $1,500 grant he won from Rocket Pitch to start trying to make Macromush a reality. 
“I felt vindicated in that a genuine problem I experience in my life resonated with the judges and audience,” McCarthy wrote. “I hope to use the funds to build a prototype protein bar and test product market fit. If it has legs, I will be looking to raise additional funding down the road to bring it to market.”
The Entrepreneurship for the Common Good Prize, a prize that goes to the pitch that best advances the public interest, went to Mason Kane (GRD ’23), Hussen Haikal Alhadar (GRD ’23) and Nehemia Abel (GRD ’23) for their app Bridger, a platform that connects migrant job seekers, particularly displaced refugees in Europe, to hiring companies. 
According to Kane, the team’s venture was inspired, like McCarthy’s, by life experiences. 
Kane said his empathy for immigrants who face information gaps when searching for jobs in their new countries sparked his desire to address this problem through entrepreneurship.
“Although I have been an exchange student several times, I cannot relate to those who seek asylum,” Kane wrote to The Hoya. “Still, I can understand trying to integrate and assimilate into European society. My inspiration for this project was the opportunity to apply my background in a practical, real-world scenario to effectuate change.”
Campfire Music Foundation, a nonprofit public-benefit music streaming platform founded by Johannes Larson (COL ’23) and Sophia Kloncz (COL ’23), won the People’s Choice Award through votes by attendees. 
According to Larson, Campfire Music fills the gap left by a largely exploitative music industry that deprives artists of the majority of streaming revenue. 
“To solve these problems, I founded Campfire Music Foundation, a nonprofit streaming startup founded to reduce issues of labor insecurity in the music industry and build public-benefit streaming infrastructure that pays artists fairly and transparently for their work at large scale,” Larson wrote to The Hoya. “My inspiration is to build a long-term solution to the issues facing today’s music industry, a solution that works for all stakeholders, and not just a few.”
Larson said the creativity and imagination required when developing a pitch like Campfire Music was a highlight of the experience.
“While writing a pitch, you realize that no one can tell your story better than you,” Larson said. “Writing a pitch almost feels like writing a song, more artistic than scientific at times.”
Beyond the field of business, McCarthy said the most important lesson he’ll take away from the competition is the importance of taking a chance on yourself. 
“I prepped like I was competing for first but had no expectation that I would place and was just happy to have the platform to share my idea with like-minded classmates interested in solving problems,” McCarthy said. “If you have an idea, that’s enough to go out and compete.”

While India struggles with data access, improved journalistic practices may offer a solution, author and data journalist Rukmini Shrinivasan said at a book talk.
Shrinivasan spoke at an Oct. 21 event titled “Data, Politics and Public Policy in Modern India,” hosted by Georgetown University’s Asian Studies Program. The event featured a discussion with Shrinivasan on the political implications of her research, which ranged from personal interviews with Indian locals to expert statisticians. McCourt School of Public Policy Professor Jishnu Das moderated the book talk, which was also organized by Asian Studies Teaching Professor Cecilia Van Hollen and Economics Associate Professor Shareen Joshi. The optimization of political data analysis is the central focus of Shrinivasan’s book “Whole Numbers and Half Truths: What Data Can and Cannot Tell Us About Modern India,” which was published in December 2021.
According to Van Hollen, Shrinivasan’s work exemplifies the essential role of data collection in effective governance and strengthened democracy. Van Hollen said data can provide leaders with accurate information on how to best lead.
“She also pointed to the dangers of inaccurate, incomplete data during the COVID-19 pandemic when data dramatically under-reported COVID-related deaths, leading to a false sense of public health security,” Van Hollen wrote to The Hoya. “Good data can help guide political action and strategy and Shrinivasan’s talk was also a call to action for developing global networks to build up good, reliable data on India for Indians.”
Van Hollen said Shrinivasan also noted the prevalence of incorrect stereotypes about the political views of the Indian people that could be dispelled by paying more attention to statistical findings.
“In her talk at Georgetown, she demonstrated the importance of looking at reliable data as a way to counter assumptions that people may have about Indian society,” Van Hollen wrote. “For example, people who live in liberal bubbles, often assert that most Indians believe in the importance of secular democracy and that inter-caste and inter-religious marriages have been increasing over time, whereas the data does not bear this out at all.”
According to Das, Shrinivasan’s mission to integrate data analysis into Indian journalism was inspired by the work of American publications like The New York Times. Das said it is important to stress Shrinivasan’s insight that journalism can act as a medium to simplify often complex data and language to the general public.
“She was saying we really need to use the media to democratize an understanding of data, and I thought that is absolutely fascinating,” Das told The Hoya. “It’s not the experts or the technocrats that need to figure out how to use and work with data. You need to explain to the polity in general what the data is, what its uses are, where the problems are and be honest about them.”
The problem of complex data analysis that is not easily accessible for most people is a global issue, according to Joshi.
“This is actually one of the challenges of our time: the rapid spread of digital technologies across the world, together with the advances in computing power have created a huge volume of data, but for citizens much of that data remains inaccessible and incomprehensible,” Joshi wrote to The Hoya.
Joshi said it is essential to remain critical of data, warning that a lack of transparency and openness in data collection may lead to profit-based exploitation of vulnerable populations who are unaware of phenomena such as data mining.
“In the U.S. right now, those who own data typically have more power and influence than the people in their datasets –– think of social media companies,” Joshi said. “They have more incentive to use that data for their own interests rather than the improvement of public policy.”
Unless data is conveyed in more simplified, accessible ways, the majority of people will be unable to engage with and benefit from the massive influx of research in the digital age, according to Das.
“My sense is we’re at this weird juncture where the world is now full of more data than ever before, but somehow it feels like we have less information than ever before,” Das said.
According to Das, journalism must also work to teach the public how to properly interpret data to avoid misinformation.
Das said the future of data analysis is inherently tied to politics, which will dictate what kinds of information are prioritized in research.
“All data is political. What data do you actually choose to collect? What precise question do you ask?” Das said. “These are all going to be informed by a broader discussion that hopefully is taking place within a democratic debate.”
