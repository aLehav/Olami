Congressional limitations on D.C. autonomy in the past week have sparked protest from Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) and the arrest of Mayor Vincent Gray.
Norton, D.C.’s nonvoting delegate in Congress, testified Tuesday before the House Rules Committee regarding the budget deal reached late last week.
The deal included an anti-home rule provision, denied the District the ability to spend local funds on abortions for low-income women and funded a school voucher program that is unpopular among D.C. politicians.
“The budget deal was struck by throwing District residents under the bus,” Norton said.
She also criticized Congress for using D.C. issues as negotiating tools.
“District residents are not bargaining chips. All I ask is that you treat my constituents with the respect you demand for your own residents,” Norton said. “If you do, you will not support legislation that strips the power of a local government to spend its own money and determine its policies.”
Despite Norton’s testimony, the deal was passed by the House of Representatives Thursday afternoon by a vote of 260 to 167. Fifty-nine House Republicans and more than half the chamber’s Democratic minority voted against the legislation.
In contrast, the bill passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote of 81 to 19. President Obama must sign the bill by midnight on Friday to avert a federal government shutdown.
On Monday, Gray and several members of the D.C. Council were arrested for blocking traffic while protesting for D.C. voting rights. He was released from Capitol Police headquarters after 1 a.m. on Tuesday morning.
“If this isn’t taxation without representation, I don’t know what is,” Gray said to The Associated Press before being arrested.
“It was worth being arrested,” Gray said in a press conference on Tuesday. “Enough is enough. We’re tired of being dictated to by people who don’t have a clue about the District of Columbia.”
Gray’s arrest made him the second D.C. mayor to go to jail for protesting for the District’s rights. Sharon Pratt Kelly, mayor from 1991 to 1994, was arrested during a similar protest in 1993.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney justified the controversial provisions in the budget by saying hard choices needed to be made, according to The Associated Press.
But Gray’s arrest won support from other D.C. politicians, including Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans, whose constituency includes Georgetown.
“The recent arrest of Mayor Gray and several council members should serve as a call to action for all of the District’s residents to get involved in the statehood movement and help put an end to taxation without representation,” Evans’ spokesman Andrew Huff said on behalf of the councilmember.
Norton also applauded the efforts of Monday’s protesters, saying she hoped that they would be able to sway Congress.
“This Congress may not have heard my pleas to respect home rule, but you have now heard from District residents,” she said about the protests. “This is a response that Americans would expect when Congress tries to invade the local self-governing authority of any U.S. jurisdiction.”

The School of Continuing Studies has instituted a new senior level position to coordinate veterans’ affairs and recruitment efforts.
The step follows a decision last month to fund a part-time position to work with student veterans on the main campus, after a year-long push by students and community members.
“SCS is exploring a range of options, including establishing a new position, to meet the needs of student veterans, many of whom take advantage of Yellow Ribbon benefits in SCS programs,” said Margaret Moore, a spokeswoman for the university.
The position has already been posted online and a search committee has begun meeting to review applications.
The committee — which consists of School of Continuing Studies Dean Robert Manuel, other administrators from both SCS and the main campus along with Georgetown University Student Veterans of America Vice President Colby Howard (SFS ’12) — will recommend the most qualified applications to the university. They hope to have the position filled by the beginning of the fall semester.
Howard said the group has already received several applications. However, the position remains open and they are still looking to receive more applications.
The new post will focus on the SCS, which has a large student-veteran enrollment. Barbara Mujica, a professor of Spanish and the faculty adviser for GUSVA, said that it is important to continue the push to ensure that the current main campus position — which is part-time — becomes a full-time post.
“I see this as a positive thing because anything for veterans is a positive thing,” Mujica said of the SCS decision. “But we can’t just rest now and think that’s done, because we still need a full-time position.”
David Shearman (SFS ’11) has had his hands full since he was hired as the first part-time veterans’ affairs coordinator last month. Howard said that the office has already helped more than 30 incoming veterans.
“The phone is ringing off the hook,” he said.
Howard said the amount that Shearman has been asked to handle is a testament not only to strides made for student veterans but also the previous neglect of these needs.
“Our number one priority is still to create a full-time position here on the main campus,” he said.

The Arizona House of Representatives passed a bill last Thursday requiring public universities to allow students to carry concealed weapons on campus.
Though the bill does not permit weapons in buildings or classrooms, students would be able to carry guns on all “public rights of way,” which would include public roads and sidewalks.
The bill must now be approved by Gov. Jan Brewer, who has offered past support for more liberal gun laws. Utah is the only other state to have approved a similar measure on college campuses.
Supporters of the bill said that permitting guns on campus would allow students to protect themselves against mass shootings, like the Virginia Tech murders of 2007. Some representatives argued that prohibiting gun possession on college campuses is a violation of the Second Amendment right to bear arms.
“We’re allowing people to defend themselves,” Rep. David Gowan Sr. (R-Ariz.), who voted for the bill, told Reuters.
The legislation faces resistance from the Arizona public, however. According to a February poll conducted by American Viewpoint, 69 percent of Arizonians were opposed to the proposal.
Robert Shelton, president of the University of Arizona, also came out strongly against the bill.
“The notion that having faculty, staff or students toting weapons across campus would somehow make everyone safer is staggeringly naïve,” he wrote in a statement on his website.
“The danger posed by guns is real and well documented. Bringing guns into classrooms simply increases the threat to those on campus. That is unacceptable.”
University of Arizona freshman Alexandra Schultz said that allowing guns on campus would make her feel less safe.
“If there is a shootout, I know someone with a gun isn’t going to help protect people.” she said.
“I don’t know why we would need to have guns on campus.”
“College students are already unstable as it is. The last thing we need is the added stress of having students be armed,” said Elliot Hanson, a freshman at Arizona State University.
Some on the Hilltop disagree with these sentiments.
Sam Dulik, director of communications for the Georgetown University College Republicans, said that permitting students to carry guns on campus can protect them in an emergency.
“If an individual wants to cause harm, he will do so with or without a gun, and it is important to acknowledge that well trained and responsible citizens exercising their Second Amendment rights can save lives when a crisis erupts,” Dulik said.
However, the president of Georgetown’s constitutional law group On the Docket, Sharanbir Grewal (SFS ’13), disagreed with this argument.
“The Second Amendment, as most recently interpreted, is limited to self-defense within the home and not on university campuses,” Grewal said. “I believe the Arizona law is excessive and goes beyond what the Second Amendment permits.”
According to Joseph Smith, the associate director of the Department of Public Safety at Georgetown, allowing guns on campus does not necessarily make students safer.
“The students of Georgetown have been living and learning peacefully here on the Hilltop for over 200 years,” Smith said. “Why add firearms to the equation?”

This week DC Reads brought its mission from Wards 7 and 8 to Georgetown’s front gates with its first annual Education Week.
Through Education Week, DC Reads hoped to translate the necessary connection between D.C. public schools and their neighboring communities to the relationship between the same schools and Georgetown. These bonds will be the foundation for education reform and greater awareness according to Hannah Klusendorf (COL ’12), a DC Reads coordinator and Campus Enrichment Committee member.
“You need to invest in the community if you want to invest in education,” she said.
The week’s events featured a series of panels and parties that included the campus in the discussions about education reform, the social issues surrounding the District’s public schools and other opportunities in the field of education. Approximately 400 Georgetown students work with 220 first to third graders each week in a classroom or one-on-one tutoring format through DC Reads.
Education Week was developed by the DC Reads’ Campus Enrichment Committee, which was established this academic year to increase the visibility of the Districts’ education problems on the Hilltop and unify those student organizations dedicated to tutoring.
“Our mission is not something that only DC Reads hopes to fix,” said Nancy Oduro (NHS ’13), the Campus Enrichment Committee chair. “We all have a common goal, which is to defy the statistics which are plaguing our schools … to close the achievement gap.”
Through this week, DC Reads hopes to serve as an advocate for other university groups and spread of awareness of the issues surrounding education to Georgetown students who cannot commit to a rigorous tutoring schedule. The group opened its panels — normally reserved for tutors — to all Georgetown students and faculty in a desire to reach out to the campus community.
“I hope that education can be that outlet for us all to get together,” Oduro said.
The week opened Monday with a roundtable of student leaders from groups including the After School Kids Program, DC School Project, community service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega, Black Student Alliance, NAACP, Georgetown Outreach for Learning and Education and Corp Philanthropy.
Led by Dean Tad Howard, visiting assistant professor of philosophy Heather Voke and assistant professor of sociology Leslie Hinkson, a panel about a possible education minor in the College filled Tuesday’s time slot.
The Ward 7 community member panel Wednesday reinforced the themes of community involvement and the opportunity for education to solve rampant social problems.
“Going to work to break the stigma … is one of my big pushes,” said panelist Marcus Clark, a community center director in the ward. “We need to empower our students to see how important a free education is.”
Education Week also held a post-graduate teaching opportunities panel Thursday and will close with another roundtable discussion today in Reiss 112 at 1 p.m.
Oduro and Klusendorf plan to make Education Week an annual tradition linking DC Reads’ push for education issues awareness with Georgetown’s greater mission.
“We have the time and resources that not everyone else has to make a difference, and I think that it’s about time that, as men and women for others, we recognize that,” Klusendorf said.

The Office of Campus Ministry will expand on-campus worship space in an attempt to meet the growing needs of the university’s religious communities.
Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., the executive director of Campus Ministry, said Thursday that his office is preparing to build a centralized worship area in the Leavey Center. The space will include a Muslim prayer room, a Jewish sacred space, an interfaith prayer room, a welcoming area and a Kosher/Hillel kitchen.
According to O’Brien, the plans are designed to compensate for a lack of worship space, a perennial problem for the Jewish and Muslim communities on campus.
“One of the reasons why the need is more pressing is because the numbers of Jewish and Muslim students who practice their faith is increasing,” he said. “So, the spaces are becoming more crowded.”
Though the renovation of the Leavey Center is a long-term project, O’Brien said that some changes will be made quickly.
For next fall, the administration has agreed to incorporate a Jewish prayer space into the floor plan of the Leavey Center between Capital One bank and Cosi. The Jewish Student Association will then drop the lease on the group’s current location, a townhouse on 36th Street.
To reconcile the more immediate needs of Muslim students, Campus Ministry and the Office of Student Affairs are teaming up to refurbish Bulldog Alley. The Muslim community will continue to utilize the prayer room in Copley Hall.
The university examined the status of campus worship space as part of the Student Space Report, a general review of space on campus that was released in the spring of 2010. Ideas for the renovation were drafted over the past year and a half through discussions with on-campus organizations, students and religious leaders.
“With the addition of the science building, the Leavey Center will become even more of a hub of student activity,” O’Brien said. “To have sacred spaces in that center emphasizes how important our religious mission is at this university.”
In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, the Jewish Student Association Board expressed its excitement about the congregation’s relocation.
“We are looking forward to working closely with Campus Ministry and other university offices to build a strong Jewish community at Georgetown,” the organization said.
For a number of years, the Jewish Chaplaincy has rented a townhouse on 36th Street to provide Jewish students a place for prayer. Until the current academic year, the group had rented this residence without financial support from the university.
Georgetown’s Muslim Ministry currently finds its home in a sub-basement room of Copley Hall, where five congregational prayers are offered every day. Friday prayer is available to Muslim students in Leavey Center’s Bulldog Alley, which usually serves as a recreational area for students.
Jeff Morshed (SFS ’11), a Muslim student, said that he thinks the future move to the Leavey Center is a step in the right direction for the university and for its Muslim community.
“At the minimum, it indicates from the university that they are interested in pluralism. It really shows the multi-religious feeling that Georgetown wants to provide,” Morshed said. “It definitely will add exposure to the Muslim community at Georgetown.”
According to O’Brien, Campus Ministry hopes that these new accommodations and amenities will inspire more widespread religious involvement on the Hilltop.
“Our job is, for those who identify with a religion, to encourage and to attract them to practice their faith more,” he said. “And having suitable, attractive prayer space is what we need.”

Researchers at the Georgetown University Medical Center are facing the highest funding pressures in recent years.
GUMC researchers said that recent federal budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health have hindered their ability to conduct desired research and have put the careers of junior researchers in jeopardy.
Rebecca Riggins, assistant professor of oncology at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, said that while the NIH saw their funding double in 2003, the budget has not grown in tandem with the increased number of researchers or grant applications since that time.
“When one factors in inflation, the NIH budget has been reduced to the point where fewer than one in 10 grants will be funded,” she said.
GUMC researchers are almost entirely dependent upon external funding for their research, which is the norm at academic medical centers according to Riggins.
“This money is needed to cover everything from faculty, staff and student salaries to research supplies to travel in order to present our work at scientific conferences,” she wrote in an email.
Some researchers at Georgetown consider it their responsibility to ensure there is enough funding for their students. While the university guarantees the salaries of tenured faculty even if they lose all funding, students and other faculty would still fall out of work. R. Scott Turner, a professor of neurology and director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown, said that this uncertainty is a source of discouragement for many students and a turnoff for prospective ones.
“We’re losing a generation of new investigators in biomedical research because of funding pressures,” he said.
William Rebeck, professor of neuroscience and director of the interdisciplinary program in neuroscience, added that the GUMC also lacks funds for basic upkeep and the purchase of new equipment. He noted that the hallways in his building have not been painted in eight years.
Turner is also suffering from funding shortages. He said that federal funding for Alzheimer’s disease has dropped from $600 million per year to about $425 million in the past two years nationwide.
“Unfortunately the trends are going in the wrong direction,” he said. “There’s a huge underinvestment in research funding, particularly since Alzheimer’s disease has such a huge economic impact on medical costs.”
Although a reduction in the availability of federal funds has forced researchers to turn to other foundations, such as the American Health Assistance Foundation, Rebeck said that these sources are less reliable because of the economic downturn.
Turner added that the lack of money leads to a great deal of wasted time writing applications that are not funded.
Rebeck and Riggins agreed that funding is the foremost preoccupation of medical researchers today.
“It’s not an exaggeration to say that this is the number one topic of discussion among scientists. When you see people at meetings, it seems to be the first thing we say to each other. People don’t ask about each other’s most recent exciting discoveries but instead ‘how’s your funding?'” he said.
Rebeck said that Georgetown has gotten better at soliciting philanthropic donations for science in recent years, however.
“There have been a couple of prominent gifts to help science here, so hopefully we will see concrete evidence of the use of those gifts in terms of help for individual labs,” he said.
Nonetheless, researchers agree that it is primarily the responsibility of the federal government to provide research funds.
“Federally funded medical research allows scientists to dig deeply into a problem, exploring all angles of it with the goal of finding a way to contribute to its solution. There are private sources, but these are more limited and couldn’t possibly support the volume of research required to fully address major public health concerns like cancer,” Riggins said.

Major renovations to the Nevils apartment complex this summer will include the removal of asbestos from the building, according to Vice President for Facilities and Student Housing Karen Frank.
“It’s going to be quite an extensive renovation,” Frank said.
Asbestos that remains in the building will be removed during the project, Frank said. A fiber that was commonly used as insulation until the 1980s, asbestos can cause serious health problems to individuals who are exposed to it for a prolonged period of time. Residents of Nevils are not currently exposed to asbestos, according to Frank.
“The only time that asbestos is a problem is when it is cracked or disintegrating,” she said, adding that much of the asbestos has already been removed from the building in recent years.
“But obviously, when we go in to do renovation, we will take all of it out, whether it’s in good shape or not,” she said.
The last major campus housing renovation project included the removal of asbestos from rooms in Darnall Hall last summer.
Nevils resident Vania Reyes (SFS ’11), said that while most Nevils residents weren’t aware that the building has asbestos, the fact did not come as a shock.
“Does it surprise me?” she said. “Not entirely.”
Andrew Sugrue (COL ’12), also a Nevils resident, said he too did not know about the asbestos.
“Us Nevils residents have had a pretty bad semester and year,” he said.
Nevils is the final residence hall to be renovated in recent years and has lately experienced problems with plumbing, as well as a power failure in January.
“Nevils has not been renovated for 20-some years now — it’s the last of the residence halls to be renovated,” Frank said. “It’s almost time to start the renovation cycle over again, but right now, Nevils is in the worst shape.”
The university first announced the project to Nevils residents in an email last month, stating that the project would consist of new heating and cooling systems, lighting and windows, complete renovations to bathrooms and kitchens and updates to the fire alarm system as well as the replacement of furniture.
Frank added that once interior work is completed, renovations will also include work on the exterior of the building.
“Exterior work on the brick and cornices, as well as work in the courtyard, particularly the patio, will continue through the fall semester,” she said.
As one of 54 seniors who live in Nevils, Reyes will be asked to move out of Nevils and into another residence hall before graduation.
“It’s just slightly inconvenient,” she said.
But overall, Reyes said she is glad the building is finally being renovated.
“It’s nice that it’s getting a makeover,” she said. “I love that building.”
Sugrue said that he was jealous when he heard about the renovations, which will be completed after he leaves the building.
“Hopefully the people living in Nevils next year will have a better living experience,” he said.

The university presented its revised 2010 Campus Plan Thursday night to five D.C. Zoning Commissioners, as well as students and residents of the Georgetown, Burleith and Foxhall neighborhoods. The hearing represented the final stage of a two-year process.
University President John J. DeGioia, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, University Provost James O’Donnell and several other members of the university committee outlined the details of the plan to an audience of about 50 listeners at the Office of Zoning Hearing Room.
University representatives highlighted a voluntary enrollment cap of 15,000 undergraduate students, the addition of 250 beds and the relocation of 1,000 School of Continuing Studies students. The plan also features a loop road on campus for Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle buses, which serve two million people annually.
DeGioia opened and closed the university’s presentation of the plan.
“The Campus Plan was created with rigorous care with over two years of planning,” he said.
DeGioia noted that the plan was created with the concerns of Georgetown’s neighbors in mind, adding that the efforts made to construct the proposal demonstrate the administration’s commitment to working with its neighbors.
“The goal is to reaffirm Georgetown’s commitment to partnership,” DeGioia said in his testimony. “The 2011-2020 Campus Plan is a modest and responsible plan for the university’s future with substantial commitments that respond to community and city concerns.”
After the presentation of the new plan, the commissioners were allotted time to ask questions about different aspects of the plan.
Although all portions of the plan faced scrutiny, the zoning commissioners and ANC commissioners aimed most of their questions at the possible expansion of the Georgetown University Hospital.
The hospital has been run by MedStar Health, a nonprofit healthcare provider, for the past 11 years.
“We can’t assess a plan when we don’t know what’s going to be there,” Lewis said.
The possibility of hospital expansion is still under consideration by the MedStar board as well as the university. The exact place and dimensions of the building have yet to be released.
DeGioia also faced questioning about the expansion of student housing. Critics of the Campus Plan argued that Georgetown should make an effort to house 100 percent of students on campus.
DeGioia responded that while the university is able to meet full demand for on-campus housing, there is no room on campus to add additional beds.
Georgetown provides 5,053 beds on campus, housing about 79 percent of its undergraduate population.
“We don’t have as many financial resources as our peers,” DeGioia said to the Zoning Commission. “[But] we do believe we are coming very close to providing for the demand for on campus housing.”
Wearing a pin saying “Oppose the Campus Plan,” Burleith resident Glen Harrison — whose signs against the Campus Plan were burned on his doorstep in February — explained his reasons for criticizing the proposal.
“I oppose the Campus Plan, mostly because of the lack of on-campus housing,” he said. “There is also a lack of a conclusive community strategy to address off-campus student issues.”
Jake Sticka (COL ’13), an ANC commisioner, said that the university presented itself well at the hearing. Still, he thought that the approval process was likely to be prolonged given the extensive community opposition to the plan.
“I think that appeals are likely regarding the outcome,” he said. “I think that community members have raised a variety of different issues. I’m not confident that any of those individually will hold up the plan.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) were also present, expressing optimism about the future of the campus plan.
“Both sides throw around a lot of empty rhetoric to make their point, and it’s important that we get beyond that and talk about these issues seriously,” Laverriere said. “It’s important to remember that while neighborhood associations and the administration go back and forth, students are trapped in the middle.”
The D.C. Zoning Commission will allow continued examination from neighborhood committees at a meeting slated to take place May 12. If needed, the hearing will continue to May 16, June 2 or June 6.
In an interview with The Hoya, DeGioia said that this hearing would be the first step in the path toward cooperation with the university’s neighbors.
“We recognize how valuable it is for us to be in the neighborhood we are in,” DeGioia said. “We are all in this together, and we share in responsibility in responding to these concerns.”

A group of Georgetown Law Center students and faculty released a report this week on human rights violations associated with the deportation of persons with mental disabilities by the United States.
The group focused on the unique case of Jamaica, which they discovered receives a significant amount of deportees from the United States but lacks the resources to aid and protect them. After almost seven months of legal research, fact-finding trips in the United States and Jamaica and conversations with a broad range of individuals involved with deportations, the Georgetown Human Rights Action group reported the culmination of its findings.
The group concluded that the most vulnerable refugees, the mentally disabled, are sent to countries unprepared for the obstacles that await them, with many of them ending up homeless, unemployed and marginalized. Almost all suffer from the lack of adequate medical care as well.
“I was very surprised,” said Katie Shay (LAW ’12), another Georgetown Law student. “We had heard about the problems before we went, all the immigration attorneys had said we had to go to Jamaica because it was so bad, but hearing the stories from the people themselves — it was heartbreaking.”
After leaving the United States, most deportees whom the group interviewed lost access to the medication and quality health care they required. Back in their home countries, they also faced chronic abuse and exploitation by a society in which mental disabilities are misunderstood and those who suffer from them are stigmatized.
“Looking at the issue from a human rights perspective, countries have an obligation not to return people to places where they face great harm,” said Sarnata Reynolds, one of the group’s faculty advisers and policy director for migrant rights at Amnesty International. “A lot of issues explored by the students centered on access to justice, and the truth is there is none for people with mental issues.”
The report offers suggestions on how to reform this flawed process, including transferring medical records to healthcare providers in the return country and helping deportees find housing and jobs to rectify some major problems in this area.
The idea for the study grew out of a Law Center student group’s experiences studying the impact of U.S. policy on Latin American refugees.
“The team chose Jamaica after learning that a disproportional number of people deported there suffered from serious mental disabilities and after hearing of the pervasive stigma in Jamaica against both deported persons and the mentally disabled,” said Sara Kane (LAW ’12), one of the nine law students who authored the report.
“During our week in Jamaica, we conducted 56 interviews with deported persons, their families, service providers, human rights advocates, academics and Jamaican and British government officials,” Kane said.
As part of the study, students examined the largely successful re-adaptation programs of other countries, notably Great Britain.
“The U.K. has funded programs in over 25 nations that help deportees get back on their feet,” Shay said. “We’re hoping U.S. policy makers will consider the success of the British model in deciding to implement re-integration programs in more countries, including Jamaica.”
Members of the Georgetown group have scheduled meetings with government officials from Congress, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice’s Executive Office of Immigration Review to further advocate reforms in U.S. deportation policy.
