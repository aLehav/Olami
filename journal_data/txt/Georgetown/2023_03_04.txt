The Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service (CSJ) announced the appointment of Arjun Shankar as its new faculty and research director Feb. 22.
Shankar, a culture and politics (CULP) professor in the School of Foreign Service (SFS), researches neocolonial politics and racial capitalism. Shankar’s appointment to the CSJ — a social justice hub that connects Georgetown students and staff with volunteering, research and advocacy opportunities in Washington, D.C. — will enable him to expand his impact beyond current academic responsibilities.
In his new role, Shankar will lead the CSJ’s research efforts, which include organizing social change efforts, influencing public policy and meeting community-based needs. Shankar will remain a professor in the SFS. 
Shankar said his classes have always maintained a strong focus on race, capitalism, caste and labor, and that his advocacy efforts align with these academic interests.
“At CULP and the SFS, I’ve been really eager to help in the global anti-racism movements that have been happening, and I’ve been part of the facility committee on global anti-racism,” Shankar told The Hoya. “I’m excited about the SFS’s move to take seriously DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — and hire more faculty of color, more faculty to work on race, gender and sexuality.” 
Shankar plans to bring his existing advocacy to the CSJ in hopes of making the center a more diverse space. Shankar said one of his top priorities as the new faculty and research director will be to facilitate more inclusive collaboration among community members interested in the CSJ.
“One of the things about Georgetown is that a lot of incredible work in these areas is happening, but we don’t oftentimes talk to one another,” Shankar said. “I really see this new position as an opportunity to bring together all those faculty from across the university who are ready to lead really exciting work, studying inequality both historically and in the contemporary moment.”
Shankar said he also wants to research mental health at universities, particularly focusing on the experiences of Georgetown students. 
“For a number of years, I’ve been extremely interested in student mental health on university campuses and the epidemics of suicidal ideation, depression and stress that seem to be increasing in the student body,” Shankar said. “I’m hoping that as a member of CSJ, I’ll be able to work with students to really start to study how this phenomenon is impacting Georgetown students, and how it might be specific to this palace versus other campuses.” 
Andria Wisler, the CSJ’s executive director and a teaching professor in the justice and peace studies program at Georgetown, said she is delighted to have Shankar join the CSJ because of his expertise on social justice, which ranges from the classroom to his involvements outside of academia.
“He is a dynamic educator, an exemplar as researcher for advocacy and activism, and a community builder,” Wisler wrote to The Hoya. “His commitments to decolonial pedagogies, multimodal ways of knowing, and the interrogation of capitalism align strongly with CSJ’s values and work.”
Anthony Pirrotti, an SFS associate dean, said he is excited about what Shankar’s commitment to advancing community service can bring to the CSJ. 
“Not only is Professor Shankar a formidable scholar who complicates and challenges how we think about race, economics and globalization, but a dedicated teacher and mentor,” Pirrotti wrote to The Hoya. “This new role will provide Professor Shankar with a unique opportunity to merge scholarship with community engagement and make a significant impact on our community.”
Shiloh Krupar, an associate professor in the SFS, said that she has worked alongside Shankar to further develop curriculum and faculty knowledge about DEI principles and accessibility practices in the CULP program.
“He offers key CULP courses on global inequality, colonialism, humanitarianism, development and race, that empower students to question the universality of categories and position those categories within unequal power relations and hierarchy,” Krupar wrote to The Hoya. “The third CULP core faculty member to receive the School of Foreign Service Faculty Award for Excellence in Teaching, Professor Shankar’s pedagogy beautifully extends the abolitionist approach to education—of ‘unlearning’ the structures of inequality that define the status quo and our relations by evoking care and concern over what exists and what could exist or be otherwise.”
Shankar said that he hopes students and faculty will begin to learn more about the CSJ’s work, identifying it as a place on campus that focuses on supporting students. 
“I just want to make sure that students know to take advantage of those opportunities. I believe many students don’t know that it’s one of the few safe spaces on campus, especially for students of color, who don’t have that many spaces to go in the first place,” Shankar said. “They can talk about a lot of the issues that I know continue to circulate, continue to be part of what they’re trying to grapple with.”

Georgetown University’s department of performing arts hosted three professional musicians in its “Jazz Combos” and “Jazz Ensemble” classes to workshop performance techniques with students.
All three guests — Donny Albrecht, Kelton Norris and Leigh Pilzer — specialize in jazz. Albrecht, a freelance trumpet player, performs at venues across the United States, including the Boston Symphony Hall and the Louis Armstrong Museum; the Washington City Paper awarded Norris, a percussion specialist, the title of “Best Drummer” in 2016; and Pilzer, a saxophonist, plays regularly with the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.
Paul Bratcher, an adjunct lecturer in the department of performing arts who teaches the “Jazz Combos” and “Jazz Ensemble” classes, invited the three musicians to come work with his students. During the class, students formed four groups — saxophone, trumpet, trombone and percussion — and the invited guests conducted master classes, or advanced seminar-style workshops, with each section.
Bratcher said the master classes focused on instructing students about a variety of different aspects of musical performance, from piece selection to stylistic interpretation.
“They worked on the music but also discussed more broadly how to approach playing different types of music,” Bratcher wrote to The Hoya. “After the master classes we got together and played the music and the look on the students’ faces said everything you needed to know about the impact these musicians had on our students.”
Lana Aguon (CAS ’24), a trombone player, said although she has played her instrument for over 15 years, the workshop taught her new techniques.
“Every musician is different and there’s always something new to learn. It’s very rare that one gets to learn from and play with people who have 30+ years of experience, and it’s always a great time to just listen to them play their instrument,” Aguon wrote to The Hoya.
Jaron Berman (CAS ’23), also a trombone player, said the specifics that Albrecht, Norris and Pilzer focused on during the sessions improved his eye for detail and helped refine his performance.
“It’s always great to be able to work with talented music professionals because they have such a wealth of experience,” Berman wrote to The Hoya. “For myself and the other brass players we focused on a lot of articulation techniques as well as how to develop the right style of play. We also got help emphasizing dynamics to better punctuate the piece.”
Grace Nuri (CAS ’26), a baritone saxophone player, said she tries to stay involved in music outside of Bratcher’s jazz classes because music plays an important role in her life. 
“I have had a great experience with the Department of Performing arts as a part of Georgetown’s jazz ensemble,” Nuri wrote to The Hoya. “I regularly jam with some of my friends and play sax, piano, and guitar with them. Music has played a major role in my life. I use music as my release and break from the busyness of everyday life at Georgetown.”
The professional musicians’ stories inspired her to continue pursuing her love of playing baritone saxophone in and out of class, she said.
Bratcher said he appreciated his students’ engagement with the musicians and is grateful to have had the opportunity to host Albrecht, Norris and Pilzer at Georgetown.
“We are lucky to live in an area with such a vibrant music scene,” Bratcher wrote. “People in the jazz community are always happy to come and work with our students.”

Georgetown Vibe_, a student dance group that specializes in Korean pop (K-pop) dance, hosted two open sessions to teach students of all experience levels new choreography Feb. 25 and Feb. 26.
The group, which was founded in 2018, serves as a social space for people enthusiastic about Korean dance and culture. Since its inception, Vibe_ has expanded its reach to the Georgetown community, and it now boasts multiple running dance crews and its own media production team. 
Co-Presidents Becks Truong (CAS ’24) and Jimin Lee (CAS ’24) said they prioritize making all interested participants feel welcome. Truong said the club includes dancers of all levels in open sessions and embraces the diverse backgrounds of its members.
“I think the beauty of Vibe_ is that it doesn’t matter how into K-Pop you are, how good of a dancer or how involved you’ve been with us in the past – we always have a place for new members who are enthusiastic about good music and creating community,” Truong wrote to The Hoya.
Quaylin Dang (SFS ’25), a Vibe_ performance director who helps lead the club’s open sessions, said the club designs open sessions as a way for prospective members to get involved with the club without a lot of pressure.
“Our open sessions provide a low-commitment, low-stakes way for people to learn more about the dance side of our club and gain some experience dancing to K-Pop choreographies,” Dang wrote to The Hoya.
In the open sessions, experienced members taught participants K-pop choreography step-by-step, practiced with them and then let participants showcase their routines and socialize with one another, according to Dang.  
“At the end of each open session, we divide participants into smaller groups to give them an opportunity to get to know one another and spotlight their hard work while the rest of the participants cheer them on,” Dang wrote. “In this way, not only are our participants able to interact with other members of the K-pop community, but it also provides a way for our board members to interact with our general body members in a more intimate setting.”
Besides hosting open instructional sessions, the club produces official Vibe_ dance covers that are edited by the club’s media team. 
“Every semester, we organize at least two different semester-long group projects where members of the group will learn an entire choreography together,” Dang wrote. 
Vibe_’s covers have received hundreds of views on their social channels, and Dang said the covers help bridge Georgetown Vibe_ with the larger K-pop community across the world.
“Dance covers are a huge part of the fan culture of K-Pop, so these projects serve as a way to engage with K-Pop enthusiasts both inside and outside of the K-Pop community,” Dang wrote.
Zoe Bushman (CAS ’25), the club’s director of marketing, said she found community at Georgetown through participating in Vibe_ after joining the summer before the pandemic started. 
“I’ve never participated in dance groups and wasn’t looking for that in a K-Pop community, so when I got to Georgetown, I was drawn to the social aspect of Vibe_,” Bushman wrote to The Hoya. “Being part of a club devoted to K-Pop is a new experience and one that I’ve deeply appreciated.”
Truong said the club’s name reinforces its focus on inclusion because Vibe_’s founders intentionally named it to reflect the members’ diverse values.
“A common misconception about Vibe_ is that we’re only a dance crew and that you can’t join if you don’t dance, which is the opposite of our values,” Truong wrote. “The underscore in our name is similar to a ‘fill in the blank’ line to represent the spectrum of K-Pop enthusiasts and dancers who join our community.”
Truong said she plans to work toward building an even more inclusive environment and a stronger community at Vibe_.
“We want to create a safe and inclusive environment for people to express their passion for K-Pop however they want to express it, whether that be through fun games, finding someone to attend concerts with or doing dance covers,” Truong wrote. “I hope that Vibe_ can continue to be a welcoming community on Georgetown campus for all K-Pop enthusiasts and newbies for years to come.”
