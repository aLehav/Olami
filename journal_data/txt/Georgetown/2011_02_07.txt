The United States Tennis Association filmed a commercial in Yates Field House today starring first lady Michelle Obama and tennis star couple Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf. The crew also filmed on the first floor of Healy Hall today.
According to an email from Obama’s press office, the commercial was sponsored by the USTA, though the commercial will also aid the first lady’s new Let’s Move! campaign, which aims to combat childhood obesity.
“Georgetown is providing a venue to the USTA for tapings that include first lady Michelle Obama,” Press Secretary to the first lady Katie Lelyveld (COL ’01) said in an email.
The USTA has partnered with the Obama family in the past. Former USTA President Lucy Garvin and her husband Bob visited the White House during the holiday season and last August, when they helped coordinate a tennis clinic on the South Lawn for 100 children.
Mrs. Obama and her daughters also frequently play tennis at Yates.
According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, commercial filming is allowed on campus after approval by the office. The university has seen several other film sessions in recent years.
“Examples of commercial filming that was permitted on campus in recent years include scenes for the television series ‘The West Wing’ and episodes of ‘Doha Debates’ and ESPN’s ‘Homecoming,'” Pugh said in an email.
According to Lelyveld, more information regarding the commercial will be released at the end of the month.
The USTA could not be reached for comment.

A former Georgetown University Hospital employee was sentenced to five months in jail on Thursday after pleading guilty to stealing $86,286 from a hospital-based nonprofit organization, according to a U.S. Department of Justice press release.
In December 2005, Frankie Renee Kennedy began writing checks to herself from the bank account of Georgetown’s Transplant Institute Foundation, a nonprofit that helps transplant patients in need of financial assistance pay for medication, housing and other necessities after surgery. By December 2009, she had written and deposited 69 checks into her personal bank account, using a doctor’s signature stamp without permission.
Georgetown University Hospital declined to comment on how the crime was discovered.
Kennedy pled guilty and agreed to pay full restitution on Nov. 8. Sentenced on Thursday, she will serve a jail term of five months and then be placed on three years of supervised release, according to the press release.
A resident of Largo, Md., Kennedy, worked at the hospital from 1998 until 2010. Kennedy’s attorney, Michelle Peterson, could not be reached for comment.
