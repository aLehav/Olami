Georgetown students are calling on the university to condemn alumni and honored guests facing accusations of sexual assault and misconduct as the national wave of allegations against public figures prominent in politics and news media grows.
Alleged perpetrators with ties to Georgetown include journalist Charlie Rose, who received an honorary doctorate from the university in 2015, and actor Kevin Spacey, who was invited by the government department to an event about politics and ethics in 2013. Former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68), who has received renewed criticism over multiple misconduct allegations since serving as president, was also recently honored with a three-day symposium by the Georgetown Institute for Politics and Public Service.
Since an Oct. 5 New York Times article and an Oct. 10 New Yorker piece revealed the numerous instances in which film producer Harvey Weinstein engaged in sexual misconduct, several high-profile men, including Rose and Spacey, have also been accused of improper sexual conduct and assault. Many of these men have been fired after organizational and journalistic investigations.
Georgetown has yet to release any official or public response to these events, despite previously honoring Rose and hosting Spacey. Since the news of Rose’s allegations broke, both Arizona State University and the University of Kansas revoked honorary degrees Rose received. Montclair State University in New Jersey is considering a similar decision.
Rose served as a morning news anchor for CBS and a newsmagazine host on PBS and delivered the College’s commencement address in 2015. In 2013, the government department invited Spacey to discuss politics and ethics with Ron Klain (CAS ’83), former chief of staff to former Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden.
Both Rose and Spacey urged students to prioritize living ethical lives. In recent weeks, 16 men have accused Spacey of inappropriate conduct according to Business Insider, while eight women have accused Rose of sexual misconduct according to The Washington Post.
The new national scrutiny on sexual misconduct has also raised criticism of how allegations are handled in the political realm. Both Clinton and President Donald Trump have been accused of multiple cases of sexual assault. Regardless, the university celebrated Clinton’s legacy Nov. 4 to 6 at GU Politics’ “Clinton 25” symposium, which lacked any scrutiny of Clinton’s alleged misconduct.
Both Georgetown University College Republicans and Georgetown University College Democrats reiterated their opposition to sexual assault and perpetrators, emphasizing efforts on their parts such as creating survivor-centric spaces and working with SAPE for training sessions on sexual assault prevention.
Allie Williams (SFS ’19), president of GUCR, said students must make active efforts to speak out against sexual assault even if the university does not condemn alleged assaulters like Spacey and Clinton.
“It is now on us, as Georgetown students and future leaders, to ensure that this abhorrent behavior is not tolerated and that we create a supportive community for survivors on the Hilltop and beyond,” Williams wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is concerning that the university has not been more vocal in condemning prominent alumni, honorary degree recipients or honored speakers.”
Maria Cornell (SFS ’20), the incoming chair of GUCD, acknowledged that despite efforts by the university, GUCD believes more improvements could be made, such as beginning to provide rape kits at the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital.
“We hope the administration will become more vocal on issues of sexual assault, and we hope that as a Catholic university, Georgetown will also use its position to elevate dialogue within the Catholic Church about sexual assault and abuses of power,” Cornell said in an interview with The Hoya. “It is not enough to simply take down the picture of Kevin Spacey that used to be on the second floor of Healy Hall.”
Avery Moje (COL ’19), special projects chair for Sexual Assault Peer Educators said she has seen more students want to speak about sexual assault on campus following recent allegations against prominent men. According to Moje, SAPE has been responding to the desire from students for SAPE to address the allegations by hosting a discussion on #MeToo, a Twitter campaign aimed at raising the awareness about the pervasiveness of sexual assault and an event on how to support survivors of sexual assault earlier this semester.
“Between myself and my other co-board members, we heard a lot of people requesting a space to have a conversation about what they were feeling, what they were seeing, and just some of the things they’d also been hearing, and so we thought to create that space, and, fortunately, we were able to,” Moje said.
Rachel Pugh, senior director for strategic communications, said the university is dedicated to preventing sexual misconduct.
“Georgetown stands against any form of sexual misconduct and remains committed to comprehensively preventing and responding to sexual harassment, sexual assault, and relationship violence,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The university implemented mandatory bystander training this fall for all entering undergraduate students. The Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force also published its report Sept. 12 outlining bystander education recommendations. The university is now working on implementing those recommendations, including mandatory bystander training for all students and updated training for faculty and staff.
Moje said many students are looking to SAPE to build on the foundation provided by bystander training and other university initiatives.
“We’re seeing that SAPE’s role is shifting into a space where we can really do more to get into these deeper conversations and to really look to what the community is asking for,” Moje said.
Professor You-me Park of the women’s and gender studies program at Georgetown said she observed a change in the attitude of her students in recent months.
“This is one of those moments when students really begin to feel that all this ‘legislative’ debates or mainstream discourse actually is about their own lives and intimate lives,” Park said.
Moje hopes that SAPE can continue to capitalize on students’ motivation to continue its efforts in the coming months.
“We’re hoping that going forward and into next semester, we can continue the momentum of looking to students for what they’re hoping to hear and what they’re expecting from SAPE and to have more events along the lines of the Me Too event and the supporting survivors event,” Moje said.
Leanna Syrimis (SFS ’18), president of mental health awareness group Project Lighthouse, said she hopes to have a more open climate and more dialogue on sexual assault in the coming months.
“With the current increase in media discourse about sexual assault, I sincerely hope that those who have experienced sexual assault will feel increasingly comfortable and believed when reaching out and seeking support,” Syrimis said.

The Cawley Career Education Center plans to launch a pilot program granting 10 students a $1,500 stipend for working unpaid internships this spring.
The pilot program is the first major development in an affordability campaign initiated by Georgetown University Student Association President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18). GUSA collaborated on the proposal with the Provost’s Office, the Cawley Center, the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, the Center for Social Justice and the Georgetown Scholarship Program.
Applications for the program, which ask about applicants’ part-time spring internships and how they contribute to students’ professional goals, are open until Dec. 6. The Cawley Center sent an email containing the application form to students Nov. 26. Juniors and seniors with demonstrated financial need are eligible.
According to Vice Provost for Education Randall Bass, a committee is slated to meet Dec. 12 to select the students who will be awarded stipends.
The program is funded by private philanthropy, the Provost’s Office and the Cawley Center.
The university plans to use use data collected from the pilot program to assess demand. Mack and Andino hope to provide stipends to more low- and middle-income students in the future, possibly through the establishment of an endowment.
Mack and Andino campaigned on a platform that promised to make student life more accessible for students from all income backgrounds. Mack said many unpaid internships offer valuable opportunities, but students often cannot afford to accept the internships over paid jobs.
“There are hundreds upon hundreds of nonprofits and government organizations in D.C. which provide opportunities for networking and professional development, but the ones that are unpaid often come at a huge opportunity cost for students,” Mack said in an interview with The Hoya.
Mack and Andino developed the idea for the program at the end of the summer after researching similar programs available at other universities, including The George Washington University and Columbia University. They introduced the idea to the Provost’s Office and began planning its implementation this fall.
Mack and Andino have also been working with the Office of Student Financial Services, which is set to help determine applicant’s financial need.
One of the main challenges of implementing the program was acquiring adequate funding, according to Bass.
“Everyone deeply believes in the need for the program,” Bass wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The primary challenge was finding the resources—which includes not just the stipends but support for the staff resources to deliver it.”
Mack said it was also important that the program would not inflict any additional costs on students.
“We didn’t want to raise tuition as a result of this initiative,” Mack said. “We were looking to secure funding for the program in which we approached the Office of Advancement to find a funding mechanism that wouldn’t incur a direct cost to students.”
Another challenge involved with implementing the program was ensuring its sustainability. According to Mack, the program is housed in the Cawley Center to make it more sustainable, a structure that mirrors that of similar programs in other universities, as the center is the first stop for many students who are looking to pursue career development.
Missy Foy, Director of the Georgetown Scholarship Program said an additional benefit of the Cawley Center running the program is that it is a sign of offices on campus getting more involved in assessing their efforts to support low-income students.
Bass said the program is one way the university is working to promote affordability.
“It is important to see this project as part of a ‘whole institution’ approach to affordability that is being addressed by many units and leaders on campus,” Bass wrote. “As a campus, we are trying to do everything we can to level the playing field for all Georgetown students, believing that ‘equity’ means not just equity of access to a Georgetown education, but equity of experience and outcomes.”

GUHereToStay, a weeklong Georgetown University Student Association campaign launched Monday, engaging students and administrators to urge Congress to pass the Dream Act of 2017.
The campaign marks GUSA’s latest and most aggressive efforts to push for a law protecting undocumented students from deportation after the Trump administration rescinded the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The campaign parallels months of university lobbying efforts led by University President John J. DeGioia.
The week consisted of events and social media initiatives including a phone bank, letter writing to members of Congress and a video, which raised awareness about the Dream Act and pressed Congress to pass the bill. GUSA worked with the Office of Federal Relations and Arelis Palacios, the associate director for Undocumented Student Services, to organize the week.
“They have helped us identify the needs of undocumented students on campus and target particular members of Congress who will be key in passing the DREAM Act,” Aaron Bennett (COL ’19), GUSA executive press secretary wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The GUHereToStay week also fetatured students signing cutouts of almost 500 butterflies, a symbol representing DACA recipients or “Dreamers.” The GUSA Federal and D.C. Relations Committee plans to turn these butterflies, signed Thursday, into a chain and deliver them to Capitol Hill today along with student letters to their representatives.
GUSA Cosecretary of Congressional Relations Chas Newman (MSB ’18) said the butterflies represent the depth of support for “Dreamers” on campus and demonstrate the effect that advocacy campaigns on campus can have on the federal government.
Introduced by Democratic Senator Dick Durbin (SFS ’66, LAW ’69) of Illinois and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Dream Act would extend and enhance the protections provided by the Obama-era DACA program rescinded by the Trump administration in September.
The bipartisan bill would offer protection from deportation and the potential for permanent residence to immigrants and DACA recipients who do not have a criminal record, have high school diplomas, are currently attending school and have lived in the United States continuously for at least four years.
Members of Congress who support the Dream Act plan to vote on the bill in the coming week to establish a permanent replacement for DACA, which is set to expire March 5.
Rebecca Hinkhouse (SFS ’19), director of the GUSA Federal and D.C. Relations Committee, said the GUHereToStay campaign is more aggressive than previous efforts by GUSA to encourage Congress to pass the Dream Act.
“Now that there’s a potential for the Dream Act to be passed in December, we wanted a big huge push,” Hinkhouse said. “We wanted something bigger and better than just letter writing, and we wanted to educate students and engage students so we came up with this week of activities.”
The advocacy week came after months of working to advocate for protecting undocumented students through DACA and now the Dream Act, according to Hinkhouse.
In September, GUSA partnered with the Office of Federal Relations and UndocuHoyas to hold an ongoing letter-writing campaign called “Friends of Dreamers” in support of the Dream Act.
The university administration has shown its support of undocumented students by establishing a role for a full-time associate director for undocumented student services in September 2017. DeGioia has also expressed his support for “Dreamers,” condemning the termination of DACA and leading the administration’s push for legislation to protect undocumented students.
GUSA Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18), who has advocated for undocumented students, said this campaign highlights the importance of passing the Dream Act in the face of the fast-approaching end of DACA protections.
“It’s bringing light to how important the issue is,” Andino said. “Since the deadline to renew DACA has passed, now we’re in a limited time frame to try to find a solution, and it’s just increased advocacy so people who receive DACA can receive those protections again.”
DACA currently protects about 800,000 undocumented immigrants from deportation. No new applications for protection under DACA were accepted after Sept. 5, and renewal applications for DACA status were not accepted after Oct. 5. Unless Congress passes a replacement bill, previous DACA recipients are expected to lose their protection over the next two years.
Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations at Georgetown, said if the Dream Act does not pass, Georgetown’s advocacy efforts would continue.
“If, by some chance, the legislation isn’t final by the time Congress adjourns in December, we will, of course, continue vigorous advocacy after the first of the year as the March 5 deadline approaches,” Fleming wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Four hundred Washington, D.C. residents experiencing homelessness are set to receive temporary housing during the holiday season following a citywide campaign that Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) unveiled Nov. 20.
Dubbed “Home for the Holidays,” the initiative is aimed at assisting the District’s homeless population, which is currently proportionally larger than other similarly sized cities across the United States. According to the 2017 Point-in-Time Count, a marker of the number of homeless residents on a given day, nearly 7,000 D.C. residents were without a permanent residence on January 25, 2017.
Home for the Holidays falls under a larger District-wide initiative, “Homeward D.C.,” a five-year plan launched in 2015 to end the chronic challenge of homelessness affecting D.C. residents.
Bowser unveiled the initiative with Laura Zeilinger, director of the Department of Human Services, at a lease-agreement signing between a District resident and her landlord on Nov. 20. The resident, who had previously been homeless, was the
72nd District resident to be matched with a landlord through the Home for the Holidays campaign.
“We are so excited about this effort because every resident of the District deserves a place to call home,” Zeilinger said at the unveiling. “During this holiday season, we are sounding the alarm for our landlords and our good neighbors to help make this happen for as many households as possible.”
Though the initiative was officially announced on Nov. 20, Bowser began promoting the campaign on social media and placing individuals in housing since Nov. 15.
The DHS will work to find safe, affordable and stable homes for families and individuals experiencing homelessness through Jan. 15, 2018, when the campaign concludes. Bowser emphasized the importance of making effective matches between landlords and stakeholders to ensure that the housing placements are mutually beneficial and last beyond the holiday season.
“Through this campaign, we are calling on landlords across the city to work with us to get families in D.C. home for the holidays,” Bowser said at the event. “We have the right resources in place to find permanent homes for our most vulnerable houses, but now we need available, affordable units.”
To help encourage landlords to rent homes to homeless families after families receive a subsidy from the government, the DHS launched the Landlord Partnership Fund in October, a privately operated fund landlords can draw from to subsidize the costs of potential property damage that might be difficult for the new residents to cover. This initiative is crucial for individuals who have been searching for affordable housing units, Zeilinger said
“Our goal is really to promote access to housing that exists in our community for people who have subsidies and are working hard to exit homelessness, but are just being turned away from unit after unit,” Zeilinger said in an interview with the DCist Oct. 6.
In addition to looking for matches between landlords and stakeholders, the DHS is collecting donations of household items to assist the new residents in starting their homes.
Bowser announced her goals in 2015 as part of her Homeward D.C. plan.
“Together, we will end long-term homelessness in the District of Columbia,” Bowser said when she unveilled her plan in 2015. “By 2020, homelessness in the District will be a rare, brief and non-recurring experience.”
From 2016 through 2017, the first full year of the implementation of the Homeward D.C. plan, the District’s overall rate of homelessness decreased by 10.5 percent. There was also a 22 percent decrease in homelessness among families and a 15 percent reduction in the number of veterans experiencing homelessness.
Bowser and the DHS are using these city-wide programs to work towards managing a problem that the District has struggled with for years. For Zeilinger, the new programs can be the necessary step to getting the D.C. homeless population into permanent residences.
“It is really rough on folks to be continuously rejected from housing opportunity after housing opportunity after housing opportunity when they’re trying really hard to get to a place of stability,” Zeilinger said. “We really want people to have a second chance. They need a second chance.”

Iceland is the best country for women’s well-being, according to a new Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security index that measures women’s well-being around the globe.
The United States ranks 22nd overall, after Iceland the remaining countries in the top 10 are: Norway, Switzerland, Slovenia, Spain, Finland, Canada, Sweden, Netherlands and Singapore.
Launched at the United Nations on Oct. 26, the eve of the annual Security Council debate on women, peace and security, the Women Peace and Security Index draws on recognized international data sources such as representation in parliament and workforce participation to rank
153 countries on the condition of women and their empowerment in homes, communities and societies more broadly.
The United States’ score is depressed by high rates of intimate partner violence, more than 10 percent higher than the average for developed countries.
Founded in 2011, GIWPS examines and highlights the roles and experiences of women in peace and security worldwide through cutting-edge research. The index is a collaboration with the government of Norway and the Peace Research Institute of Oslo.
The Hoya sat down with Melanne Verveer (SLL’ 66, GRD’ 69), executive director of GIWPS to discuss the recent launch of the global index. Verveer served as the first ever ambassador of global women’s issues under former President Barack Obama. Dedicating her public service career to women’s rights and advocacy, Verveer said that the launch of this global index will radically change how women’s well-being around the world is calculated.
What was it like serving as ambassador under both the Obama and Clinton administrations?
I have been privileged to engage in public service in significant positions, as Chief of Staff to Hillary Clinton when she was first lady and later as the first U.S. Ambassador for Global Women’s Issues. Both positions provided an opportunity to advance the United States commitment to progress for women and girls around the world. [My White House position] was a life-changing post in terms of propelling me to be more deeply engaged on women’s rights.
As the inaugural U.S. Ambassador for Global Women’s Issues, my charge was to integrate a gender perspective and women’s participation into all aspects of U.S. foreign policy, recognizing that no country could get ahead if it left half its people behind. We cannot make progress on some of the most challenging global issues—from growing economies to sustaining peace, addressing climate change and supporting democratic governance—if women are constrained from full participation.
As a Georgetown alumna, what is something you learned from your time as a student that you carried with you in your career in public service? 
My days as both an undergraduate and graduate student at Georgetown were a time to develop my interest in public service. I was excited, as were many of my generation, by the call of President Kennedy at the time, “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” I wanted to be in Washington, where there was so much interest in government and in how we could contribute. Georgetown was a magnet for many leaders coming to campus to discuss the big issues of our time, and Georgetown’s ethos of “women and men for others” enhanced this interest and commitment.
What was the vision behind the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security’s creation, and what are its main goals today? 
The call for women’s engagement in peace and security was recognized by the U.N. Security Council more than 15 years ago, but progress has been less than robust. When I was Ambassador, we formulated a U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security. Many other countries had already done so, including the EU and NATO. Out of the experience of implementing the NAP, we recognized that far more needed to be done to illustrate the evidence based case for women’s engagement in peace and security through rigorous research, global leadership and developing the next generation of leaders.
GIWPS recently launched a new index that measures women’s well-being globally. What sets this new index apart from other comparable indexes out there?
The index captures a more comprehensive picture of the women’s well-being. Gender indices are typically limited to indicators as whether women complete secondary education or are in paid work. These aspects of inclusion are undoubtedly important but they are incomplete in the absence of justice and security. For example, if girls are enrolled in school but not safe in their homes or in school, we get an incomplete picture of well being. Similarly traditional measures of security include an array of conflict indicators but ignore systematic bias and discrimination against women. This index brings together the dimensions of inclusion, justice and security into a single number and ranking. It therefore represents a major innovation in how we think about and measure women’s well-being bringing achievements in; for example, schooling and access to cell phones, together with data on violence against women.
Would you explain how the index takes the various factors into account when calculating the condition of women in a specific country? 
The index captures three dimensions—inclusion, justice, and security—that are measured using publicly available data. Inclusion is measured by women’s achievements in education, employment and parliamentary representation, as well as access to cell phones and financial services. Justice is captured in both formal and informal aspects—extent of discrimination in the legal system, alongside a bias in favor of sons and exposure to discriminatory norms. Security is measured by intimate partner violence, perception of community safety and organized violence (number of battle deaths.)
What do you believe is the most pressing issue globally that women face today? 
Women continue to make progress globally but the progress is uneven. Violence against women is a pervasive scourge. We focused on the three dimensions because they best capture the well being of women. As one can see from the index, there is much work that remains to be done for women to have their rights protected and for them to participate fully in all aspects of their societies. Sustainable Development Goal 5 calls for gender equality and the empowerment of women. It is important in its own right and central to the achievement of the other goals. Clearly there is still a long road to go to achieve gender equality.

Five cases of mumps, a contagious disease preventable by vaccination, have been reported to the Student Health Center this semester.
Three of those cases occurred this month, leading Assistant Vice President for Student Health Vince WinklerPrins to send a public health alert to the university community Thursday. All five cases have affected undergraduate students.
“These cases have been contained, and as we have learned about each new case, we have coordinated with the D.C. Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control,” WinklerPrins wrote in the email.
Other local universities have also reported mumps cases. On Nov. 6, The Washington Post reported that Catholic University had four confirmed and three suspected cases while American University had two confirmed and four suspected cases.
Mumps is a viral disease transmitted by coughing, sharing items or other forms of close contact, according to the CDC. It causes swollen cheeks, fever, headache, tiredness and muscle aches, and complications can occasionally result.
The illness is preventable. The MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, is required for new Georgetown students under the age of 26.
The vaccine is typically administered in two doses, with the first dose around the age of one and the second dose at age four. For mumps, the vaccine is nearly 88 percent effective with both doses and 78 percent effective with just the first dose.
Cases of mumps rose nationwide in both 2016 and this year, with nearly 5,000 cases so far. The past two years have seen the largest mumps outbreaks since 2006, which saw over 6,500 cases nationwide.
Outbreaks are frequently tied to college settings, where students often live in close contact. Nearly half of the outbreaks from January 2016 to June 2017 occurred in college settings, according to the Washington Post.
Due to the sharp rise in mumps cases in recent years, a federal expert panel recommended in October an increase to three vaccine doses . The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices suggested the increase because many of the recent outbreaks have occurred in populations that are vaccinated at high rates.
Aside from vaccination, good health practices are beneficial for preventing mumps, as well as other illnesses. Avoiding sharing items, regularly washing hands and covering coughs and sneezes are all methods to prevent spreading disease.
The Student Health Center urges students who suspect they have mumps to call the center as soon as possible and to self-isolate to prevent spreading the illness to others.

Deirdre Collins (COL ’17) was named the 2018 Rhodes Scholar for Bermuda, where she will work to promote environmental preservation and sustainable development after studying at Oxford University.
Collins, a native of Bermuda, was the only recipient of the Rhodes Scholarship from the island this year.
Rhodes Scholarships are the oldest international fellowships, Rhodes Scholarships and are awarded annually to 32 students from the United States, after an extensive application process. Collins’ award reflects her commitment to her academics and advocacy, Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia said.
“On behalf of our entire Georgetown community, I wish to congratulate Deirdre on this extraordinary achievement,” DeGioia wrote in a Nov. 30 news release. “We look forward to the many contributions she will make to our global community as she engages more deeply in her studies in environmental science at Oxford.”
Rhodes Scholars are chosen based on academic achievements, character, commitment to others and leadership potential, according to the Rhodes Trust website. Collins joins the list of 26 Georgetown Rhodes scholars, including former President Bill Clinton (SFS’ 68). There were four other Georgetown finalists, all of whom were women.
After graduating from Georgetown last spring, Collins returned to Bermuda, where she became a certified scientific diver. She is currently working as an investment analyst for the New York Green Bank, a state-sponsored fund that invests in clean energy.
Collins’ academic excellence and determination stood out according to her Georgetown professors.
Biology professor Heidi Elmendorf wrote a letter of recommendation for Collins’ Rhodes candidacy, commenting on her work ethic and intellect.
“She tackled every aspect of the [Foundations of Biology] course with intellectual vigor, mastered the work at hand, and then pushed of her own accord to reach a level of understanding far beyond what we expected,” Elmendorf wrote in her recommendation.
While at Georgetown, Collins served as business and technology editor for The Hoya, held leadership positions at GlobeMed, a student organization devoted to carrying out public health projects and volunteered with Georgetown’s Afterschool Kids Program. Collins attributed her extracurricular involvement to making her a well-rounded student.
In addition to exceling in the classroom, Collins served as a research assistant in the Johnson Biosignatures Lab at Georgetown, which was led by Professor Sarah Stewart Johnson, a former Rhodes scholar, and assistant professor of planetary science with the biology department and the Science, Technology and International Affairs program.
Collins also interned with the Juneau Icefield Research Program, an education program located in Alaska and British Columbia, which she said reminded her of her passion for environmental advocacy.
“I find myself forlorn with nostalgia for a time when coral reefs and glaciers functioned imperviously to human impact – a time I have never experienced,” Collins wrote in her personal statement for the scholarship. “In each of these instances, I am unfailingly reminded of a time before the Anthropocene, when the Earth’s condition was not contingent on human activity.”
Collins, who has been interested in the environment since a young age, attributed her Georgetown academic experience to further inspiring her interest in biology and the environmental advocacy.
“The classes I took and the faculty I met at Georgetown were instrumental in helping me to engage in scientific field research,” Collins said in a university news release. “They inspired me to wholeheartedly dedicate myself to a career in fighting climate change.”
Collins said she is looking forward to her Oxford education, where she hopes to study climate change to prepare herself to confront one of the world’s most pressing issues.
“I am driven to study climate change as it relates to politics, business economics and climate science because it poses an enormous threat to every continent on the planet,” Collins said in the release. “We have never seen a global issue quite like climate change. The decisions we make today will impact us decades down the line.”
Through her commitment to academics, service and her extracurricular life, Collins embodied the attributes of a Rhodes scholar while at Georgetown, her professors acknowledged.
“She embraced Georgetown’s mantra of ‘men and women for others,’” Elmendorf wrote. “Deirdre is a modern-day Renaissance woman.”

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is responding to safety concerns following an injury sustained by a Metro worker performing a repair on the Washington, D.C. transit’s electrical rail system Oct. 31.
The worker suffered an electrical burn when coming into contact with a rail that was still electrified as a result of improper adherence to safety procedures by the maintenance crew, as previously reported by WTOP Nov. 24.
The rail worker’s injuries were not life-threatening, and the worker was released from the hospital after a few days.
The electrical burns raised general concerns about Metro’s repair safety procedures and worker protections, despite the injury being a result of worker error.
Bob Lauby, Federal Railroad Administration chief safety officer said that closely following safety procedures is crucial to avoiding incidents such as this one in a Nov. 24 interview with WTOP.
“If there’s one frustration that we’ve all seen with Washington Metro [it’s that] there’s many, many instances of failures to follow the procedures that are put in place to protect both the public and the workers, and this is yet another example,” Lauby said.
D.C. Metro workers do not have insulated mats or tools to protect them from touching the rail, which had not been checked to ensure the power had been turned off. The workers had attempted to turn off the rail using a controller at the rail’s control center, following regular procedure, according to Lauby. However, due to other rail work taking place in the area, more steps were necessary to turn the rail’s electricity off.
In response to the most recent injury, Metro will be adding warning logos to the computer screens in the Rail Operations Control Center, as well as stopping the use of the type of tool used in the incident, which allowed electricity to flow from the rail and burn the rail worker.
This incident is similar to one that took place in January, when two Metro employees sustained electrical shocks when a metal rod came in contact with an electrified rail.
Part of Metro’s ongoing safety efforts include strengthening the Roadway Worker Protection program, which provides “on-track safety to provide employees working along the railroad with protection from the hazards of being struck by a train or other on-track equipment,” according to the Federal Railroad Administration.
“A comprehensive RWP program is part of the safety defenses designed to keep all roadway workers from harm while on the right-of-way,” a WMATA Safety Committee Report released Nov. 16 said.
The Federal Railroad Administration took control of D.C.’s Metro safety in 2015, stepping into the oversight role in response to Metro not adequately addressing safety problems for its workers and passengers.
Two weeks before the worker was injured, Metro completed a safety review at the request of the local Amalgamated Transit Union.
Metro Chief Safety Officer Pat Lavin said it is important to address worker safety concerns as soon as they arise.
“Part of creating a safety culture means taking immediate action to address concerns raised by employees,” Lavin said in a Sept. 21 WMATA press release concerning metro safety reviews.
The Metro has also had a number of “safety stand downs,” a voluntary event for employers to talk directly to employees about safety, since this event occurred, which are “consistent with Metro’s position that ‘safety trumps service,’” according to the Sept. 21 WMATA press release.
Lavin also said that unannounced safety audits on the Metro will begin in the coming months.
In addition to last month’s Metro safety review, two Congressmen, Reps. Anthony G. Brown (D-Md.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and the ATU Local 689 have introduced legislation which includes establishing new safety procedures on the D.C. Metro.
The legislation would create a new task force to review safety in Metro operations and would name this task force for train operators killed while on the job.
