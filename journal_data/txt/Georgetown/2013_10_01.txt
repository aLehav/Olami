Approximately 4,000 alumni returned to the Hilltop for Homecoming Weekend this year, an increase in participation from past years.
“I think this [increase] is due to the fact that we are continuing to look for new opportunities to expand our programming to be able to engage more students and alumni,” Director of Class Programs and Reunion Campaigns Vanessa Otarola (NHS ’08) said.
Last year, 6,500 students and alumni participated in Homecoming. Otarola said that they were still working to calculate the total number of participants this year, including the student tally.
In addition to traditional activities like the football game and tailgate, student organizations also created new events. The Georgetown University Running Club reintroduced the Saturday morning Homecoming 5k run, and the Traditions Day committee added an all-class movie night on Thursday.
“This year, the focus was on celebrating the rich history of Georgetown and of our student organizations,” Otarola said.
Planning for Homecoming is a yearlong process, which starts when the Office of Advancement works with the athletics department to select the weekend during which the homecoming football game will take place.
That planning culminated in this weekend’s events, which provided a link between alumni and current students.
“This is the first time I’ve come back for Homecoming, and part of the reason I’m here is because my son is here,” Chris Donovan (SFS ’78) said. “It’s awesome to be back on campus. We took my son and seven of his friends out for dinner. It was nice to meet his peers and friends.”
Sharon Day (MED ’88) agreed.
“We come back to Homecoming every so often,” Day said. “We’re here actually today because my youngest son is going to go on the tour because he’s interested in coming to Georgetown.”
For many alumni, campus looks markedly different.
“Buildings have changed, as there are all these new buildings everywhere you look, but the atmosphere stays the same,” Day said.
However, alumni recalled their old haunts from their days at Georgetown.
“I look forward to going to Rhino, going to our old stomping ground,” Maggie Koch (COL ’07) said. “We walked to Burleith, which is where we used to live, and down on M Street, The Tombs and the bookstore.”
For current students as well, the weekend served as a memorable experience.
“As a freshman, I’ve never experienced Homecoming before, so it was really great to just experience it for the first time,” Emma Dee Spikol (COL ’17) said. “There was a lot of energy on campus, and there were so many alumni walking around with their kids, and it was obvious that they were really excited to be returning.”

For its commitment to renewable energy, Georgetown was named a Green Power Partner of the Year by the Environmental Protection Agency last week.
The distinction was given to the university for its commitment to purchasing approximately 113 million kilowatt hours of renewable energy, moving to 100 percent green power and establishing the Solar Street on-site renewable energy project, which constructed solar panels on the roofs of six university-owned townhouses in January.
Three other organizations — Cisco Systems, Inc., the Microsoft Corporation and Ohio State University — received the award this year.
In order to qualify for the award, organizations must demonstrate a substantial commitment to green energy, which the EPA cites as electricity generated from renewable resources that produce no fossil fuel-based pollution.
“Our 2013 Green Power Leadership Award winners are driving new renewable energy generation and providing clear examples of organizations thriving on innovation and sustainability,” EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said in a press release.
Georgetown has participated in the EPA’s Green Power Partnership program for the past several years.
“Participating in this program is a way to advance the development of green power sources, both through our use of green power and also by serving as a leader in communicating to the marketplace about the value of sustainable energy,” Audrey Stewart, director of Georgetown’s Office of Sustainability, said.
Blaine Collison, director of the Green Power Partner Program at the EPA, commended the effort required by Georgetown to implement these innovations.
“It’s a large and complex institution,” Collison said. “Georgetown’s green power purchase is the fifth largest nationally in the higher education sector, and that matters. We need to have schools like Georgetown and Ohio State take the action they are. It provides an incredible set of examples for other schools to take a look at and consider for their own climate policy.”
Gabriel Pincus (SFS ’14), Georgetown University Student Association’s secretary of sustainability, expressed excitement about the award and encouraged the university to continue to implement new green projects.
“I think it’s great that Georgetown is getting recognition,” Pincus said. “We’re taking a lot of steps across the board on sustainability issues. To get national recognition is pretty awesome.”
Pincus described a variety of sustainable projects that GUSA is currently working on with the administration, including changes to the recycling program, making Georgetown a more bike-friendly campus, ensuring the preservation of green spaces on campus and developing methods to use electricity more efficiently.
“[The award] is great, but there’s more to be done for sure,” Pincus said. “There’s a ton of issues we have on our radar.”

The Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life will launch tonight in Gaston Hall with an event examining Pope Francis’ impact on American public life during his first six months as the leader of the Catholic Church.
The initiative’s major goals are to promote Catholic social teaching as it relates to current economic, social and political issues, and to prepare students, community leaders and public officials to advance the Catholic tradition of social justice.
“What is needed is informed, active lay leadership in questions of justice and peace, life and dignity,” John Carr, director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, said.
Carr previously served as the executive director of the Department of Justice, Peace and Human Development at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops for 25 years and was a fellow of religion and politics at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, archbishop emeritus of Washington, will lead a distinguished advisory group to help guide the work of the initiative, actively supported by current archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.
The initiative originated from the Office of University President John J. DeGioia.
“I am grateful to John Carr for his willingness to lead this new initiative, which seeks to increase the connection between public life and the advancement of the common good,” DeGioia said. “The Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life is deeply aligned with that mission as well as the mission of Georgetown as a Catholic, Jesuit university.”
Although the preliminary stages of the founding of the initiative occurred before the elevation of Pope Francis, the initiative’s focus fits with Francis’ goals.
“When we started talking about this center at Georgetown, Francis hadn’t come on the scene yet, but it seems as if this center is a perfect response to his papacy because he is clearly moving Catholic teaching about the poor and about justice to the center of the Church’s mission,” said E.J. Dionne, a columnist for The Washington Post and a senior research fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs. “The timing here is not intentional but it surely is providential.”
Carr said Pope Francis’ papacy was a fitting context to talk about Catholic social thought at Georgetown.
“These ideas have been at the heart of Georgetown for a long time, but at this moment with Pope Francis’ leadership, we have a great opportunity to dialogue about how we can work together to preserve the common good and protect the life and dignity of the poor,” he said.
A large objective of the initiative is outreach to young Catholics in public life as well as non-Catholics.
“We are encouraging leaders, especially young leaders, to bring the mission of Catholic social teaching into public life,” Carr said. “We will hold regular gatherings of people who are in public service to remind them that their faith has ideas and values that can be useful to them as they serve the common good.”
The initiative’s first event this evening will feature New York Times columnist David Brooks, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops spokesperson Kim Daniels, Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities President Alexia Kelley and PBS “NewsHour” political analyst Mark Shields. Wuerl, who participated in the elevation of Francis, will deliver the opening address.
The initiative’s second forum, “Poverty, Policy, and Pope Francis: Addressing the Silence and Stalemate on Poverty in the United States,” will be held Dec. 2. Participants will include Dionne, McCarrick and The Washington Post columnist and former Bush Administration speechwriter Michael Gerson.
Tonight’s event was moved from Copley Hall to Gaston to account for the more than 600 expected attendees.
“The credit goes to Pope Francis,” Carr said.

The eighth session of the Georgetown University Student Association senate, inaugurated Sunday afternoon, was elected last Thursday with record voter turnout.
Approximately 47 percent of the student body, or 2,966 undergraduates, cast ballots, an increase from last year’s 34 percent, or 2,631 students.
GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) attributed part of the high turnout to the satellite housing referendum that was on the same ballot as the senate election. However, Tisa said that students are also increasingly interested in GUSA’s work.
“As GUSA continues to work on more projects in more areas of student life, students are more and more looking to GUSA for advocacy and assistance in a wide variety of areas,” Tisa said. “We’re more diverse and more representative of the student body than ever before.”
Overall, 77 students competed for 28 seats in the senate. Nine out of 14 GUSA senators running for reelection from the previous session were successful.
Competitiveness across districts was uneven, with nearly half of the 77 candidates competing for six seats in the two freshman-only districts, while candidates in LXR Hall and townhouses ran uncontested.
Sunday’s inauguration inducted a record number of 10 female senators to GUSA. Female representation this year is a slight increase from the nine women who held seats last year. Women accounted for slightly more than 50 percent of this years’ candidates for the senate, another record.
Incumbent GUSA senator Abby Cooner (SFS ’16) helped coordinate the ElectHer conference aimed to increase female representation among student leaders prior to the election.
“I’m really pleased to see an increase of female senators once again,” Cooner said. “I think GUSA is moving toward a new and exciting direction. With the increasing number of young women, it will be able to represent the student body more equally.”
GUSA’s effort in engaging the off-campus student population also showed results in the election. Six candidates, an increase from last year’s three candidates, competed for the five spots for the off-campus district. Three hundred and forty-seven votes were cast in the off-campus race, more than double the number cast in last year’s election.
Tisa pointed out that the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, which aims to centralize student activities back on campus, has led off-campus students to seek greater representation.
“It makes sense — neighborhood relations issues have cut to the core of almost everything the university has done since the campus plan. Off-campus students are most directly affected,” he said.
GUSA senators Cannon Warren (SFS ’14) and Andrew Logerfo (COL ’14), who ran unsuccessfully on a ticket for the GUSA executive in the spring, were both elected as representatives in the off-campus districts.
Warren and Logerfo together received a total of 179 first round votes, higher than the 175 votes the pair received from the executive election.
Logerfo described the results as interesting, noting that the two together garnered more votes in the off-campus senate race, which consists of a voting population of approximately one-sixth of the undergraduate student body.
“I think it’s just interesting. We were running in a much smaller pool but receiving more votes. I would say that we’re probably more established off campus,” Logerfo said.
“This is also less of a joking campaign,” he added, referring to the pair’s executive campaign’s focus on a campus-wide rat attack challenge.
Tisa, who served as a three-time senator before becoming GUSA president, expressed confidence in the growing presence of the student government.
“It’s been incredible to see the ways GUSA’s off-campus engagement has surged in the past few years,” he said.

One month after the original deadline for D.C. taxi cabs to install credit card readers, GPS and a driver verification system, drivers are protesting consequences for failure to meet the deadline, which they say is not their fault.
Nearly 200 cab drivers protested problems installing the Modern Taximeter System in Freedom Square on Wednesday. The final deadline for MTS installation was yesterday.
Drivers have faced backlogged service from the eight Payment Service Providers responsible for MTSinstallation, which include Creative Mobile Technologies, Gleike Taxi Inc., Hitch, D.C. VIP, Transco, USA Motors, Yellow Cab of D.C. and United Ventures Consortium.
D.C. Drivers United for Equal Rights and the Excluded Worker Project, which organized the protest, reported that five of these eight PSPs are currently backlogged and that credit card readers that have been installed have often malfunctioned. The groups also complained about fees tacked on by thesePSPs that go beyond the expected monthly service charge.
Additionally, the taxi driver organizations said that drivers have been turned away from their pre-assigned installation appointments. Cab meters have sometimes taken days to sync to the credit card reader, and the installation procedure requires drivers to return to the PSP multiple times.
District of Columbia Taxicab Commission spokesperson Neville Waters attributed the current PSPbacklog to the looming deadline, as drivers attempt to catch up for lost time. In fact, Waters said that many drivers had not contacted a PSP by Aug. 15 when the original deadline for installation was Aug. 30.
“Many drivers tried to shop around or find other PSPs and missed the deadline,” Waters said. “PSPsare overwhelmed by installation demands from drivers in the past few weeks.”
Waters said that PSPs should have the capacity to continue installation throughout the week.
Regardless, as much as 20 percent of D.C.’s taxicab fleet will not yet have the MTS installed by today,DCTC estimated, leaving them in danger of towing, impoundment and $1,000 in fees, which will be the responsibility of drivers.
D.C. Drivers United for Equal Rights has also called into question the DCTC’s handling of the issues with PSPs, which the group claimed the commission refused to address. Rather, the DCTC has said that these problems are private contract disputes between drivers and PSPs.
In August, only 2,000 out of D.C.’s 6,500 taxis had complied with the MTS requirement, so cabs were permitted to apply for an extension, but this responsibility was placed on the PSP rather than the driver, leading to delays and missed deadlines.
Waters said that this method was to ensure that taxicab drivers had already established a contract for installation with one of the PSPs — a requirement to be granted an extension.
DCTC will not extend its Sept. 30 deadline, but the commission will evaluate claims on a case-by-case basis to address legitimate grievances.
“There will be no further extensions. Drivers have had over 120 days since June 1 to have the devices installed,” Waters said. “It’s unfortunate, but the deadline is necessary.”
Waters added that, rather than risk impoundment, some drivers would potentially switch vehicles; sedans or black cars are not required to install the MTS.
Others, Waters said, might leave the business altogether.
“I also expect we will see some part-time drivers retire, especially those who are older and simply enjoy driving, because they are unwilling to deal with the expense or hassle of installation,” Waters said.
D.C. Drivers United for Equal Rights did not respond to requests for comment.

The District of Columbia, which has historically had the highest rate of HIV/AIDS in the United States, has seen a 46 percent drop in the rate of infection between 2007 and 2011 from 3.2 percent to 2.4 percent, the Department of Health announced last week.
HIV cases in the District decreased from more than 1,300 in 2007 to 718 in 2011, and 80 percent of identified cases were treated within three months of diagnosis. Nevertheless, the 2.4 percent rate is still far above the national average of 0.4 percent.
In 2009, NPR reported that D.C.’s HIV/AIDS 2007 rate of 3.2 percent was higher than some West African countries. If the District were considered a country, it would have been placed on former President George W. Bush’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief list, which contained the 15 countries in the world with the worst HIV/AIDS rate.
On the list, D.C. would have ranked above four PEPFAR countries: Democratic Republic of Congo (1.3 percent), Ethiopia (1.4 percent), Sierra Leone (1.5 percent) and Rwanda (2.9 percent). On the higher end of the scale were South Africa (17.8 percent) and Zimbabwe (15 percent).
In particular, NPR found that black and Hispanic men in the District were especially at risk, and over 50 percent of HIV positive cases were fatal.
Michael Kharfen, interim senior director of the HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD and Tuberculosis administration at the DOH, attributed the results to support from Mayor Vincent Gray since his 2010 election. Gray has supported a citywide recovery program that provides testing, education and medical resources.
“The DOH has benefitted from good community and political leadership, including from the mayor, city council and important health officials,” Kharfen said. “Together, we’ve made a push to talk about HIV prevention, promoting safe sexual behavior and effectively responding to this epidemic.”
Through this program, the DOH has focused on providing annual, convenient HIV/AIDS testing in an attempt to diagnose cases earlier.
“Our department has seen that after being diagnosed, people change their sexual behavior and are much less likely to transmit the disease to others,” Kharfen said. “Also, under the proper medication, the virus can be reduced to almost undetectable levels, which also reduces transmission rates.”
The DOH has also distributed 10 times more free condoms since 2007 and prioritized cooperation with local medical organizations and community awareness groups to provide prevention and treatment education.
Despite the District’s success with HIV/AIDS, more than 15,000 D.C. residents were still living with HIV in 2011. In addition, the DOH reported that rates of other sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis have increased in the last few years, with over 9,300 total new cases between 2010 and 2011. According to Kharfen, not all of this increase reflects an actual increase in case numbers. Rather, because of the increase in testing, more cases are being found and reported.
“We’re simply testing more people here in the District than in most other places,” Kharfen said. “Our high schools have a system of STI testing, which is rare. This testing is vital, because these infections, and chlamydia especially, are prevalent in the adolescent community, and symptoms can at times be hard to spot. Syphilis is more an issue with gay and bisexual men, so we’ve ramped up our efforts of testing and prevention in that demographic.”
Kharfen added that the current political struggle on Capitol Hill could threaten the District’s HIV/AIDS prevention plan and other programs. According to Kharfen, more than 93 percent of District residents utilize expanded Medicaid services that would be provided under the Affordable Care Act.
“The District was one of the first places in the country to begin using the Affordable Care Act to give full medical coverage to residents, which is especially vital in ensuring that people get tested and can get treatment, no matter their socioeconomic status,” Kharfen said. “The possible repeal of the act would really strike a blow to our efforts for HIV/AIDS prevention in the city.”
Georgetown also participates heavily in dealing with the STI rate in the District through the Student Health Center, the Health Education Services Offices and Counseling and Psychiatric Services.
According to Assistant Vice President for Student Health Services James Welsh, the university focuses particularly on screening students and educating them about sexual health.
“STI screening, including for HIV, is offered regularly at the Student Health Center,” Welsh said. “Health Education Services, working with offices like the LGBTQ Resource Center and the Women’s Center, offer periodic free HIV screening opportunities here on campus.”
Georgetown played host to the 2012 International AIDS Conference, where university representatives highlighted the District’s battle against STIs.

Although university administrators assured students and alumni that the mascot tradition would continue after the departure of mascot-in-training Jack Jr. this summer, one aspect of the next bulldog’s role on campus will be different: his caretaker.
Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., will not care for the new mascot, despite doing so for last 10 years, including the year and a half when Jack Jr., or J.J., was on campus.
In August, the university announced the selection of a new bulldog, born June 29. The Bulldog Advisory Committee has regularly met to discuss the approach to be taken with the new dog. The question of a timeframe for the arrival of the bulldog remains unclear. After J.J.’s abrupt removal from campus, the committee is trying to ensure a smooth transition for the new mascot.
“My initial suggestion was that the puppy be housed in New South with me, and that a senior, chosen competitively, be given a paid, intern-like role in which he or she would take on significant responsibility for the new mascot,” Steck wrote in an email. “I would need help if I were to take on the role of caretaker again, and I thought that a responsible, dog-loving senior would be ideal.”
These suggestions were rejected by the university.
“The university felt that it would be better to find a more permanent person — seniors would change every year — who would be able to take on all of the responsibility for the role of mascot caretaker,”Steck said. “Doing so would simplify the position.”
It is unclear exactly to whom the application would be open, though Steck suggested the caretaker need not necessarily be a Jesuit or a faculty member.
“I don’t think there are any constraints on what role the person will have at the university, if any,”Steck said. “I believe the ideal would be that the person has some sort of employment at Georgetown so that they could bring the new mascot to their offices, and allow him to be seen regularly on campus. It would also be important that the caretaker be committed to living near campus for the duration of the dog’s life as a mascot and having a permanent position at Georgetown would facilitate that.”
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said that a new caretaker will be selected in the next few weeks.
“I think that the thing is we’re really still working on how we will be evaluating that person,” Pugh said. “I think we’ll know when we meet that person and they’re the right fit.”
The new mascot’s caretaker would be offered a townhouse on 36th Street with a backyard for the dog, according to Pugh. If the caretaker already lives on campus, it could be possible for the mascot to live in a dorm, as Jack does with Steck.
The BAC has developed a formalized application but has yet to complete a job description. Once that is complete, the committee will post the job and solicit applications, with an interview to follow.
Though aspects of the caretaker role remain undecided, the mascot’s role is clear.
“As far as the mascot tradition goes, we’re not planning anything new in the mascot’s specific responsibilities,” said Neve Schadler (COL ’15), head of the Jack Crew. “We’re making sure anything new is an improvement, so the responsibilities as far as right now will be the same. He’ll have walks around campus, and as he grows we’ll be doing public appearances.”
The Jack Crew works closely with Steck, and crew members would need to transition to working with the new caretaker.
No one on the BAC has met the bulldog, which comes from the same breeders who donated J.J.: Janice and Marcus Hochstetler, parents of former Georgetown students.
The new mascot will be named Jack, but a nickname has yet to be determined.
While the breeders have already begun to train the new dog, training will continue on campus, according to Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), who serves on the BAC.
“I would love to have him immediately,” Ramadan said, “but for the sake of tradition, the puppy himself and making sure he’s comfortable, we’re just taking it step by step and making sure we’re not doing anything to jeopardize the process.”

The McDonough School of Business is awaiting approval to extend its MBA programs to the Tysons Corner Center in Vienna, Va., for what would be the MSB’s first expansion outside the immediate Washington, D.C. area.
Space limitations and the desire to reach a new pool of applicants are the main motivating factors behind the potential addition, with business opportunities in TysonsCorner identified by a committee of adjunct faculty, students, staff and alumni contributing to the choice of location.
“Tysons Corner quickly emerged as the right location … as a booming business community experiencing tremendous growth, and it is in close proximity to the Dulles technology corridor,” MSB Dean David Thomas said. “It is also an area where high-scoring GMAT test-takers live and work, and many of those individuals have expressed interest in our program.”
Although the MSB originally considered constructing a new building in response to the MBA program’s popularity, The Tower Club Tysons Corner building, located at 8000 Towers Crescent Drive, in the Tysons Corner mall emerged as a viable option. The Tower Club includes a private dining room, a lounge, a library and conference rooms.
“This was just the right collection of amenities that also allowed us, just from an accounting standpoint, not to have to invest in bricks and mortar right now,” Senior Associate Dean for MBA Programs Elaine Romanelli said.
Although the MSB does not yet have an official contract with The Tower Club, it has offered to enhance the building’s A/V equipment and provide furniture to meet possible classroom needs.
MSB professors who would have to commute to the new location gave input on the proposal, and Georgetown is now waiting on the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools for approval. In addition, Georgetown is working with the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors to obtain a special exemption to expand The Tower Club’s zoning permit to include educational use.
Expansion Committee student representative Selman Altun (GRD ’13) said he was originally apprehensive of the plan.
“My first concern was that the quality of the program and students be maintained,” Altun said. “My second concern was related to maintaining a campus atmosphere that allows networking among students. And last, because it is related to my profession, potential challenges with respect to the faculty getting to and from the new location were an area of concern.”
Altun said that he also recognized the benefits of the expansion, which would further the Georgetown brand beyond Washington, D.C.
“It will introduce us to new students that cannot be with us due to traffic, commute time, job and home location reasons but that are just as good as the current Georgetown students in a rapidly developing area in the heart of Northern Virginia,” Altun said.
Others have shared Altun’s concerns about the loss of prestige due to the increased number of applicants, Romanelli said, but she believes that the expansion would have the opposite effect. The MBA program itself would see no changes; both the curriculum and the professors that teach it would remain.
“There is a highly qualified market that, for a variety of reasons, we’re not tapping into,” Romanellisaid. “I don’t think exclusivity is about numbers — exclusivity is about the caliber of students who are here, and we think that they will be absolutely equal.”

Construction of the Healey Family Student Center in New South has left some student groups in the lurch. While many have found temporary accommodations sufficient, dance groups have struggled to make do in spaces not designed for performance.
HFSC is scheduled to open in fall 2014, at which point space in New South’s Riverside Lounge will still be limited. Though some storage and rehearsal accommodations are temporary, other groups can expect the search for space to continue through next year.
The Georgetown University Dance Company was granted space at certain times of day in Yates Field House, forcing the group to rework the rehearsal schedule it has kept for years. The times available at Yates, mostly in the morning, conflict with more members’ academic and employment commitments.
“The consistent shifting in rehearsal and class times is hard for dancers who want to plan ahead for their lives,” said Nora Rosengarten (COL ’14), GUDC production director and Georgetown University Student Association undersecretary of the arts.
“For choreography, there are always people missing now,” GUDC President Cara Davis (COL ’14) added. “We are happy with the physical space, but the scheduling was definitely rough.”
Scheduling space for the group during business hours has affected the degree to which GUDC can collaborate with the surrounding community.
“We lost a couple of guest choreographers and guest teachers because they’re professional local artists that work 9-to-5. We haven’t been able to get some of the ones that we really love,” GUDC member Emma Murphy (SFS ’16) said.
Murphy also noted problems with the floor space in Walsh Black Box Theater, where GUDC holds some supplemental practices. Dancers must dance on a sprung floor, often referred to as a marley floor, to reduce the risk of injury.
“The Yates studio is a lot bigger, but we have the same amount of marley. Black Box is like dancing on concrete; it’s really poorly sprung marley,” Murphy said.
Groove Theory practices in both the Walsh Black Box Theater and the Center Grill space in Leavey Center, located between Makom and Cosi. The group traditionally practices after 10 p.m., rendering Yates, with its midnight closing time, an unfeasible option.
Katie Shannon (NHS ’15), a Groove Theory manager, expressed concerns over flooring.
“They are using the old New South dance studio floor, and it is chipped and very worn so people tend to get splinters on their hands and knees while stretching,” Shannon said.
However, Shannon said that the temporary lodging adequately meets the group’s needs.
“We just really miss the convenience of being able to find a spot to practice if we needed an additional rehearsal,” Shannon said.
The Georgetown Fencing Club also uses the Center Grill for its practice space. Fencing Captain Jonathan McClure (SFS ’15) described a space and booking crunch.
“Any problems are pretty much just a short-run thing but they are definitely noticeable at the moment,” McClure said.
The Center for Student Engagement has worked with groups on these problems throughout the semester, to varying degrees of success. Student groups gave input on location and scheduling when the CSE was working to figure out new accommodations last year in conjunction with the department of performing arts.
“I know there were a couple of groups assigned to interim spaces and the space wasn’t big enough for them, so we worked with the groups to try to accommodate their needs in other spaces,” CSE Director Erika Cohen Derr wrote in an email.
Many groups have transitioned without complaint into temporary locations that will remain in place until the construction ends next year, according to GUSA Director of Student Space Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14).
“I haven’t heard any concerns,” he said. “I’m sure there are a lot of kinks that are being worked out.”
The Center Grill is guaranteed to the CSE for only this year, as it is under the jurisdiction of Auxiliary Services and the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center, not the university. It is not yet clear what will make up for the Center Grill space next year.
“I know there are other needs for space that they are foregoing because the space is in use by student groups this year,” Cohen Derr wrote.
According to a memorandum regarding space relocation that Cohen Derr wrote in April, groups that require equipment for practice were to use the LXR Multipurpose room.
Ron Lignelli, administrative director for the department of performing arts, reflected on the success of the temporary dance studios. He said that a lot of planning happened over the summer, especially for small but crucial factors needed to create temporary dance studios, such as buying mirrors and bars. His biggest concern is that temporary spaces might not be kept in the long term even though the addition of Healey Family Student Center will result in a net loss of practice space for student groups after construction is completed, too.
Additionally, the crunch on space for dance groups has affected theater groups that traditionally rehearse in the Black Box Theater.
“It’s been a challenge, but I wouldn’t say a problem,” Lignelli said. “It’s kind of a domino effect, in terms of rehearsals and auditions.”
Student groups that had been housed in New South that do not involve physical activity were mainly affected by a switch in storage space to the Center for Social Justice and the mezzanine level of Regents Hall, which is inaccessible by ramp or elevator. The Department of Planning and Facilities Management and CSE are looking to remedy this over the next two years and are offering a golf cart to aid student groups in transporting some materials.
“The CSJ has actually more space than we need. We are potentially giving space to other advisory boards that need it,” Advisory Board for Student Associations Chair Charlotte Cherry (SFS ’16) said.
The precise allocation of space and rehearsal time for the completed HFSC has not yet been determined, although need and history will be factored in.
“The scheduling will be done by the staff who run the Healey Family Student Center, and they have not been hired yet,” Cohen Derr wrote. “An advisory committee will be formed in October to provide input into the plan for the Healey Family Student Center, and this will be one of the aspects addressed by the committee. Students will comprise a big part of the committee and will have an important role in planning for these questions.”

With only seven months before the Democratic primary in April, Mayor Vincent Gray, still entrenched in an ongoing corruption investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, has yet to announce plans to run for re-election.
Three high-level officials involved in Gray’s 2010 Democratic Primary victory over incumbent Adrian Fenty have pled guilty to felony charges, which involve a $650,000 off-the-book donation to Gray’s campaign. Campaign aides have also admitted to bribing a minor candidate to stay in the race in order to make the race more difficult for Fenty.
Although Gray has not yet been personally implicated, the investigation is still ongoing and additional charges are expected, NBC Washington reported, although the timeline is still uncertain. The investigation originally began in 2011.
Gray announced his plans to run 19 months before the 2010 Democratic primary, held in September 2010. Registration for the next mayoral race begins in November.
“The mayor is focused on running the city and not on the election,” Gray’s Senior Communications Manager Doxie McCoy wrote in an email.
Government professor Jonathan Ladd said that Gray would most likely have to make his re-election decision without knowing if any formal charges will be brought against him.
“It could be that the U.S. Attorney won’t close the investigation or announce any new charges until after the election is over, so the possibility of new things coming out will hang over the whole campaign,” Ladd said. “It’s surprising to me that the investigation has taken so long to resolve.”
If the investigation remains inconclusive, government professor Michael Bailey said that it would be possible for Gray to launch a re-election campaign.
“Even though he does have this terrible political burden, he still could be viable,” Bailey said.
If Gray were to be formally charged with a crime, however, Bailey said he believed it would be difficult for Gray to run, perhaps even impossible.
Nevertheless, government professor Daniel Hopkins pointed to Washington, D.C. politicians’ history of recovering from unsavory pasts. For example, Marion Barry (D-Ward 8), former mayor and current councilmember, won re-election for both mayor and councilmember after serving time in federal prison for drug-related offenses.
“For many voters, a scandal in and of itself doesn’t disqualify you from running for office,” Hopkins said. “In urban politics, generally, the scandal is more threatening from the point of view of prosecution than it is from the point of view of voters ousting you.”
Apart from these concerns, Ladd thought Gray would secure an easy victory, pointing to his strong support among African American and low-income voters as well as higher-income sections of the city, thanks to recent economic advancements.
“This is really the only thing that would make you worry,” Ladd said. “[Otherwise,] he would seem to have a pretty easy path to re-election.”
If Gray were to run, he would face opposition from four declared candidates: councilmembers Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) and Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), in addition to former State Department official Reta Jo Lewis.
A poll commissioned in July by Wells’ campaign showed a Gray re-election bid winning by a slight lead.
Wells pointed to the investigation into Gray as testament to the District’s problems with ethical politics.
“The District has witnessed the greatest crises of ethics since the beginning of home rule,” Wells wrote in an email. “I am fighting to bring integrity to our government and to make D.C. a great place for everyone in every part of the city to live, work and raise a family.”
Other candidates declined to comment.
“I have no view on this at all,” Evans said on the topic of a Gray re-election campaign.
Bowser and Jo Lewis did not respond to requests for comment.

To preview the Center for Social Impact and Innovation, which is set to launch in the spring, students and alumni gathered Friday afternoon to stimulate creative problem-solving and generate innovative ideas about social change.
The workshop, “Ignite Georgetown,” was held in the Rafik B. Hariri Building as part of Homecoming’s Alumni College Day. Representatives from Atlas Corps, Teach for America and Food Recovery Network gave five-minute presentations outlining the goals of their organizations and identifying problems. Participants then broke into four groups and attempted to forge creative solutions to these problems.
“It’s too easy to think that we don’t know the answer, but when we push ourselves we find ways to think about those answers. We find ways to test those ideas and not get caught up in the fear that we might fail,” event organizer Sonal Shah, a professor of the practice in the Office of the Provost, said.
The event brought together individuals with diverse professional backgrounds and varying levels of experience in order to approach problems from many different perspectives.
For Ramona Dragomir, an Atlas Corps fellow from Romania, and Eduardo Salazar, an Atlas Corps fellow from Peru, the heterogeneity in viewpoints was especially valuable. Atlas Corps is a nonprofit that offers fellowships to promote innovation and develop leaders.
“We’re used to speaking to people that already work in the nonprofit sector and we’re just preaching to the choir when we talk about the program and our initiatives,” Dragomir said. “But here it was a little bit different because the people saw the problem from a different perspective than how people in our sector would see it.”
Ben Simon, founder and executive director of Food Recovery Network, also found the ideas discussed among participants to be extremely helpful. Food Recovery Network is a nonprofit that aims to fight both food waste and hunger by redistributing leftover food from college cafeterias to community members who need it.
“It’s not so often that we get a sounding board of 30 people to just bounce ideas off of and get brand new ideas,” Simon, who leads a staff of 12 members, said.
The seminar room in which the workshop was held was decorated to encourage creativity. Desks were covered with white paper on which participants were encouraged to doodle, take notes or jot down ideas using colorful markers.
Sean Lamont (MSB ’11) saw this exercise in creative problem-solving as a learning experience. Lamont recently founded a company that sells nutrition bars and was interested in learning how he could become more socially responsible, as well as hearing about the problems that other companies are facing.
“The vulnerability was huge for the companies to come here and to talk about their problems,” Lamont said. “It was a two-way street. We gave and they gave.”
Alejandro González (SFS ’12), a participant in the workshop, thought that this deviation from a more customary classroom experience was a step in the right direction for Georgetown.
“I think we [at Georgetown] are very good at traditional education, but we’re not good at these types of things,” González said. “We need to have more events like these that really push the envelope, take it to the edge, ignite, cause people to be dynamic and really change their ideas. This is the type of thinking that we need to bring to this college.”

While his colleagues in Congress spent the evening negotiating the looming government shutdown, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) spent Monday night in the Mortara Center addressing student questions on the same issue.
The event was sponsored by the Georgetown University College Democrats and the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association.
Tester took several audience questions pertaining to the fiscal crisis that caused federal government operations to discontinue at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday.
Responding to a question posed by Joseph Laposata (COL ’16) regarding whether the government would be able to avert the crisis before the midnight deadline, Tester said,
“If that’s the goal of the House or dozen folks here in the Senate, to shut the government down without addressing the debt, those people should be run out of town.”
Tester also addressed the national debt, criticizing House Republicans who have pledged to oppose the law unless the Affordable Care Act is delayed by one year.
“This is not a good thing to do, to play with the full faith and credit of this country,” Tester said. “And I tell you that there’s a lot of things that I can overlook with people who do stupid things, but when you do stupid things, and you’ve been told that they’re stupid … that’s total irresponsibility and you should not be in the United States Senate or in Congress at all.”
Gun control has also been a key issue on Tester’s plate this term. After the school shooting in Newtown, Conn. that took 26 lives in December 2012, Tester met with the families of the victims. While a supporter of the Manchin-Toomey gun control bill, Tester said that he did not believe it would prevent another tragedy like Newtown.
“Sandy Hook will happen again,” Tester said. “I want guns to be hard to get for the people who should not be able to get them.”
Tester also addressed questions about the influence of money in politics, stating that after the Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Committee, the only means of keeping big money out of politics would be either a constitutional amendment, which he has proposed, or a change on the Supreme Court bench.
“Until we get money out of politics … they can throw $20 million bucks in an election, and they can make a difference,” Tester said.
Tester did not always have political aspirations. Originally a music teacher at a small school in Montana, Tester was elected to the Montana State Senate in 1998 and ultimately to the U.S. Senate in 2006.
The senator concluded by urging students to participate in public service, describing his own ambitions to run for elected office while in high school.
“Anybody can have an influence — don’t think that just because you’re in college you don’t have the right to be able to influence a situation,” he said. “You absolutely do.”
Audience members were both pleased and inspired by the content of the speech.
“It’s not often that the title of senator and the word humility are used in the same sentence unless they’re in conflict with each other,” Chris Fisk (COL ’17) said. “But Senator Tester is an example of just the contrary.”
College Democrats President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’14) valued the varied perspective that Tester brought to the table.
“He provides an interesting perspective, from our party, of someone from a rural state, who understands the issues that affect a lot of frontier Americans,” Tezel said. “I thought it was a different conversation but an important one to be had.”

The MARC Train Service, run by the Maryland Transit Administration, will begin offering weekend train service between Washington and Baltimore on Dec. 7.
This weekend service will expand the existing Penn Line, which connects Union Station to Baltimore Penn Station and Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.
According to MARC Riders Advisory Council Chair Rafi Guroian, tourists, BWI travelers and weekend workers have been demanding a weekend service, and the Penn Line was specifically targeted because of its greater ridership than that of the other two MARC train lines.
The weekend expansion of the Penn line, which is subsidized by Maryland taxes, was originally slated for 2008 but was cancelled at the last minute when Maryland had a budgetary crisis during the recession. A recent increase in Maryland’s state gas tax allowed MARC to expand the line.
“Weekend service on MARC has been discussed for decades, and it’s always been a matter of funding,” Guroian wrote in an email. “[It is] a very affordable option for getting to BWI Airport and Baltimore on weekends.”
According to MARC Riders Advisory Council Vice Chair Steve Chan, the expanded MARC service will be a “subcontract employment” with Amtrak because Amtrak owns the physical rail on the Penn line. As a result, MARC will pay Amtrak to help set up the expanded service, and employees working the expanded service will work for Amtrak.
Although Amtrak itself already runs a weekend service between the District and Baltimore, the company charges $16 to $60 per single trip, depending on the time and date of the trip and the class of the purchased seat.
On the other hand, the MARC weekend service would cost about $6 to BWI and $7 to Baltimore; students with a Student Advantage membership will also receive a discount.
Despite the cheaper prices, Chan said that not all riders would convert from Amtrak to MARC. MARC generally caters to commuters, while Amtrak is popular for longer trips.
MARC riders use a monthly pass, often leading a shortage of seats.
“It depends on where you want to go and on scheduling,” Chan said. “If you simply need to go from D.C. Union Station to BWI, MARC generally charges a lower price. But if your goal is to go from BWI [to] elsewhere, it’s quite possible that Amtrak can give you choices that you would prefer.”
The expanded weekend service could allow some students to fly in and out of Baltimore on the weekend, which is often less expensive than flying from D.C. airports.
The MARC train would also make Baltimore entertainment options more accessible to students. From Baltimore Penn Station, students can take light rail to Camden Yards, home of the Baltimore Orioles. Camden Yards is also close to M&T Bank Stadium, where the Baltimore Ravens play. There is also a free Circulator bus from Penn Station to the Inner Harbor and Fort McHenry.
Guroian said the MTA is looking to add additional weekday service on the Camden line next year and hopes to expand the Brunswick line as well.
