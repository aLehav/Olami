Former speechwriter and personal advisor to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Clarence Jones reflected on King’s legacy and his personal activism in the civil rights movement during a talk held in the Intercultural Center auditorium Monday. The event, which filled the auditorium, was moderated by Chris Wadibia (COL ’16) and hosted by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund.
Jones opened his talk by stressing how the work and legacy of King makes him one of the largest contributors to racial equality in U.S. history, asserting that King’s accomplishments cannot be matched by any other historical figure.
“With the exception of the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 and the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr. may have done more to achieve social justice, racial equality and the creation of economic opportunity in the 20th century than any other person or event in the previous 400-year history of the United States of America,” Jones said.
Jones first met King in California during the 1960s when King came to his house and asked him personally to join his cause.
Jones initially joined King’s team to help defend him in his 1960 tax fraud case, which eventually was ruled in King’s favor, after the state of Alabama specifically targeted King on faulty charges. After the trial, Jones served multiple roles for King in addition to legal counsel, including speechwriting.
“Friday evening, doorbell rings, there standing outside of my door was Martin Luther King Jr. In 1960, he was in 2016 terms, a celebrity. He had been on the cover of Time and Life magazine,” Jones said.
Jones noted the current implications of the civil rights movement in America today, focusing particularly on the Supreme Court case of Shelby County vs. Holder, which weakened voting rights in 1965.
Jones said the implications of low minority voter turnouts is a striking example of racial inequality, citing Ferguson, Mo., where the shooting of black male Michael Brown in August of 2014 garnered nationwide attention.
“In Ferguson, Mo. for example, where the shooting of Michael Brown occurred, 67 percent of the population was black, but in 2013 only six percent of the eligible black voters cast their ballot in the municipal elections,” Jones said.
According to Jones the United States needs to come to grips with the legacy of slavery and its impact on American society since it threatens the progress of racial equality every day.
“The impact of this legacy of slavery upon current descendants of slaves and slave holders must be forthrightly acknowledged and addressed,” Jones said.
Jones emphasized the prevalent issue of gun violence around the U.S. and its disproportionate impact on youth and minorities. He also advocated for increased focus on the widening socio-economic gap within the country and questioned how the U.S. could still have so many living in poverty.
“There are people sleeping on the sidewalks in the richest country in the world. That is your ethical and moral challenge. That is the challenge of the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement,” Jones said.
As the event opened to audience questions, Jones outlined his two primary influences during childhood: his parents and schooling at a Catholic boarding school.
Jones said he is grateful for his parents and for the lengths to which King went to make his future better.
“There is an African proverb that is always in the forefront of my mind whenever I travel around and speak and the proverb says, ‘If the surviving lions don’t tell their stories, the hunters will get all the credit.’ And I am a surviving lion and I use the providential longevity I have to tell the world about that most extraordinary lion we had in our pride, Martin Luther King Jr.,” Jones said.
When asked what advice he would give to younger generations, Jones said current power structures still strongly favor white men. He addressed the audience and asked that the new generations participate in politics to change the status quo.
“They’re not going to give it to you. The way you got to get it is to take it. And the only way you take it is by registering to vote, and to vote. Because the ultimate source for the creation of power is the exercise of the vote,” Jones said.
Skylar Luke (SFS ’19), who attended the event, said she appreciated the extent of the discussion and applauded Jones for sharing his insights into present day struggles concerning race and prejudice.
“Being in the presence of someone who was a near and dear friend of Dr. Martin Luther King is just amazing,” Luke said. “I mean there aren’t too many people that are alive today that can say that they’ve walked hand in hand with Dr. King.”

Georgetown University’s recently launched India Initiative aims to promote dialogue and collaboration between Georgetown University and Indian universities, businesses and political organizations.
Established in December by the School of Foreign Service, the India Initiative has since hosted several high-profile events, including the visit of former Pakistani Ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani on Jan. 27.
Spearheading the program is associate professor Irfan Nooruddin, the initiative’s first director, Vice President of Global Engagement Tom Banchoff and SFS Dean Joel Hellman.
The initiative aims to engage the subcontinent at an academic level while creating opportunities for students and faculty to conduct research.
Hellman traveled to India to formally launch the initiative last December, meeting former Indian Minister of State and U.N. Under-Secretary-General Shashi Tharoor and Indian members of parliament, senior government officials and businessmen.
Faculty members have sought to engage India in the Georgetown academic community in the years prior to the initiative’s launch. Their endeavors consisted of attempts to encourage both student and faculty research of India while also working to connect internship and exchange programs with the Georgetown community as a whole.
Nooruddin emphasized the importance of research in the initiative and outlined a plan for how students and faculty would conduct research together.
“What we’re working on right now is to figure out models that connect faculty and students in ongoing, long-term research projects, such that students could plug in during a given semester and do something that’s already active,” Nooruddin said. “Faculty could dictate a research agenda that would be broadly consistent with the goals of the initiative, and find ways for students to engage in that process.”
In the future, leaders of the initiative will seek the development and expansion of curriculum concerning Indian culture, history, language and politics. Georgetown only has five classes about India, two of which focus on the South Asian region as a whole. Georgetown does not currently offer Hindi, although attempts have been made in past years to offer the class.
Nooruddin projected that the initiative will immediately address the relative lack of South Asian languages at Georgetown compared to other regions.
“My most optimistic view is that by fall 2016 we could have something on the books to teach Hindi at Georgetown,” Nooruddin said. “We don’t want one [Hindi] course, we want it to be possible for a student to start learning Hindi at Georgetown, and leave Georgetown being proficient.”
Many of Georgetown’s peer universities already have initiatives and programs focused on India, including Yale University, Harvard University and the University of California at Berkeley. In the spring of 2014, the University of Chicago opened a large academic and research center in Delhi.
Nooruddin believes the university holds an advantage over other schools, highlighting its location in Washington, D.C., and its proximity to numerous think tanks and research centers.
“None of those programs are in D.C. We see that as a really major comparative advantage for us. We want to use our D.C. location to facilitate a set of conversations that bring in policy makers, public intellectuals and thinkers into contact with their U.S. counterparts,” Nooruddin said. “And then use the think tank and government and the international multilateral organizations to facilitate those conversations.”
The student-led Georgetown-India Dialogue helped lay the groundwork for the initiative. Undergraduates Jeh Tirodkar (SFS ’16) and Yash Johri (SFS ’17) founded the dialogue in August 2014, with Nooruddin serving as the organization’s faculty advisor. Tirodkar expressed that the dialogue began with a commitment to bringing Georgetown and India closer together.
“The reason we started is being from SFS and coming from India and being politically inclined, when we look at the SFS with a presence all across the world and engaging all across the world, we found that lacking in India,” Tirodkar said. “It’s wrong for Georgetown to not have a presence in India and not engage India better.”
The dialogue brought several Indian speakers to campus last year, including government officials and businessmen. In April 2015, the group hosted an all-day conference with former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah as a keynote speaker on political and security developments in the Kashmir region and its effects for India.
Even with the development of the new India Initiative, Tirodkar asserted that the Georgetown-India Dialogue will continue its activity, citing the need for more student involvement in Indian affairs.
“While the university has launched the official India Initiative to engage professors, we think for us in the Georgetown-India Dialogue it’s important to make sure the community stays engaged with the political and social issues concerning India,” Tirodkar said.
Nooruddin said the ultimate success of the initiative will depend on fundraising and expressed his hopes for the future of the program in study abroad and curriculum opportunities.
“Much of the success will be our success in fundraising, so we have an independent, large enough endowment to support student enrollment in India,” Nooruddin said. “I’d like to see a much more robust exchange of people, both from Indian institutions coming to Georgetown and people going to India.”
Gaurav Premnath (COL ’19), who is a member of the Georgetown-India Dialogue, believes the initiative has great potential to attract people from diverse backgrounds across campus due to the events and opportunities it will generate.
“I think the initiative has great scope and can engage a lot of students who aren’t only from India, because the initiative creates a lot of dialogues and events that pertain to international affairs,” Premnath said. “It will increase awareness of the dynamics between India and other South Asian countries as well.”

A proposed new medical wing at the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, part of the 2017 campus plan, faced criticism from the Old Georgetown Board regarding its potential conflict with planning principles in a design review meeting Feb. 4.
In accordance with the Old Georgetown Act of 1950, all proposed building projects must be reviewed by the Old Georgetown Board, an advisory committee of architects appointed by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, a federal entity. The board conducts monthly reviews on all construction proposals in the Georgetown district.
The design proposes moving the hospital emergency unit to the new 477,000 square-foot wing and making Reservoir Road a grander entrance to the campus. The facility, designed by D.C.-based architecture firm Shalom Baranes Associates, would replace Kober-Cogan Building and one of St. Mary’s Hall’s wings with three levels of underground parking and increased lawn space.
The plans for the wing include more room for patients as well as a central entrance point with more user-friendly walkways, which seek to make the hospital easier to navigate.
The board criticized the large proposed size of the wing, stating that this will limit the potential for more green space on campus and increase traffic on the university’s north side.
Secretary of the Commission of Fine Arts Thomas Luebke said the board found significant problems in the new hospital wing’s potential effects on campus layout.
“The concerns about the building are fairly fundamental in terms of how the building is being planned, balanced against the long-term public spaces for the Georgetown University campus,” Luebke said.
Medstar Georgetown University Hospital President Michael Sachtleben declined to comment until the plans progress through the regulatory stage, which currently has no set timeline.
According to Luebke, the placement of the emergency suite at the southern end of the proposed building next to the Leavey Center will increase ambulance traffic near Darnall Hall, Henle Village apartments and the new Northeast Triangle residence hall.
“Why would you locate most of this disruptive, emergency activity so close to what is supposed to be a new undergraduate residential community?” Luebke said. “It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to have ambulances and lights coming hundreds and hundreds of feet into the campus for emergencies. It’s strange.”
Luebke said the board also raised concerns regarding the new wing’s alignment with the university’s goal of fostering an undergraduate community on the north side of campus.
“So much about this has to do with what is the concept for that space and how can this new hospital pavilion work with that idea, help define it and make it possible,” Luebke said. “That’s the kernel of the issue. So far, it seems the programming of this enormous medical building is defining the project. The space, which is the most important thing for the university’s long-term objective, seems to be treated as a leftover rather than in the foreground.”
Vice President of the Citizens Association of Georgetown Jennifer Altemus, who also serves as the CAG representative on the Georgetown Community Partnership, of which MedStar is a component, stressed the improved facilities offered in the proposed pavilion.
“The new, modern facility will have enough beds for everybody, a special room for sexual assault victims and all the latest technology,” Altemus said. “Everybody’s health will be better. It will be more comfortable, more efficient and safer. A lot of great things can come out of it, and we’re excited for it. We just want to make sure, while we have the chance, to make it as good as it can be.”
At the review meeting, Shalom Baranes architect Mark Gilliand similarly emphasized the potential benefits of the new wing.
“We have a great opportunity to make this a new front door, an inviting front door, for the hospital and for the university,” Gilliand said, according to the Georgetown Current. “Obviously it’s a new pavilion that will be modern and efficient and right-sized for the hospital. It will also create a new green space for Georgetown University.”
However, Altemus also cited concerns about a lack of greenery and increased traffic.
“They are missing out an opportunity for more green space in Georgetown and on campus. It’s such a short commodity on the campus that you don’t want to miss the opportunity for that when you have it,” Altemus said. “Also, part of their transportation plan is problematic, both in terms of losing green space and in terms of trucks crossing campus where there are pedestrians and other drivers. It just seems like a recipe for disaster.”
Each proposal submitted to the Old Georgetown Board is first reviewed by the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, a D.C. office composed of elected representatives from the local community. The ANC then gives its recommendations to the Old Georgetown Board ten days before the official review meeting, but the board has the final say in proposal approvals.
Kendyl Clausen (SFS ’16), commissioner of ANC2E, which represents Georgetown, said that the commission made suggestions based on its disagreement with the lack of green space proposed in the plans. Clausen stressed that MedStar should make maximizing open lawn space a larger priority.
“The big contention is whether or not they’ll have two driveways in the middle of our new lawn,” Clausen said. “We want it to be a grassy lawn for pedestrians so that it can maximize the amount of space students and neighbors have. MedStar seems to want that too, but they’ve put two driveways in the middle of it, which is frustrating.”
Clausen also highlighted the potential safety issues in the area surrounding the wing.
“We’ve been working with MedStar and the Old Georgetown Board to make the hospital more of a pedestrian friendly part of campus,” Clausen said. “The fear is that cars and delivery vehicles will cause safety issues.”

Why in the world would they make a special room for sexual assault victims when Georgetown Hospital is NOT where they perform forensic exams??? I 100% support trauma-informed care, and I absolutely agree that sexual assault victims deserve privacy and a safe space, but I’m unsure of why they would include that in a plan for Georgetown Hospital as opposed to Washington Hospital Center.

Dizzy says 
March 4, 2016 at 2:35 pm
Haley, if I had to guess, I would say that it’s meant to be a private/secure triage room.  So if someone comes in reporting they’ve been assaulted and would like to receive a forensic exam, they can remain in that room until their transportation arrives to take them to Washington Hospital Center.  Alternatively, if a person indicates that they do not wish to be subject to a forensic exam – which is their choice and must be respected – then there’s the possibility that they could receive other forms of treatment in that room.
[…] MedStar Pavilion Proposal Faces Backlash The facility, designed by D.C.-based architecture firm Shalom Baranes Associates, would replace Kober-Cogan Building and one of St. Mary's Hall's wings with three levels of underground parking and increased lawn space.

A software bug in the Georgetown University firewall caused its Wi-Fi network to experience widespread and sporadic service interruptions on campus starting Feb. 22. Cisco, the manufacturer of the University’s Wi-Fi system was able to identify the source of the connectivity issues and resolved it Feb. 25.
Interim Vice President and Chief Information Officer of the University Information Services Judd Nicholson said the root of the issue was a bug found in the firewalls used by the university to protect against cyber attacks. According to Nicholson, the university has two high-performance firewalls that protect the campus from over one billion cyberattacks a month.
Nicholson said that the Wi-Fi issues occurred twice, first on Monday morning and later during the week on Wednesday afternoon, before being resolved.
“No issues have been reported on Thursday or Friday this week,” Nicholson said in an interview with The Hoya.
Nicholson added as of last Saturday UIS is still working with Cisco to fully address the issue and prevent future occurrences.
Nicholson stated that the university’s cyber security did not sustain any breaches as only outward Internet traffic was impacted. The issues affected the entire campus, but were mostly limited to webpage rendering.
“The issues were intermittent and not limited to any one location. Some Wi-Fi users experienced no problems, others noticed a slowdown in loading web pages,” Nicholson said.
The GUSA chair of the student technology advisory board, Taylor Wan (COL ’16), said that she was not informed on the Wi-Fi issues that UIS was facing.
Georgetown primarily has three Wi-Fi networks. SaxaNet is the secured network and is the recommended network by UIS for optimal security and performance. GuestNet, while lower in performance, can be used by visitors to campus. Eduroam is the third network that is used by visiting students and faculty from other institutions.
UIS revamped the Wi-Fi in Lauinger Library in an approximately $189,000 overhaul in January, and it plans to add more upgrades to the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, particularly in classrooms.
Students on campus were affected to varying degrees by the internet issues, and some reported heavy issues while others experienced little to none.
Margaret McGraw (COL ’19) said the Wi-Fi issues on campus affected her negatively as she had trouble completing her assignments for classes.
“It was very frustrating not to have Wi-Fi on probably every part of campus because you need to get your work done and if you can’t get your work done, like in your room or your library or Lau, how are you supposed to do anything?” McGraw said.
Michael Chen (MSB ’19) said he noticed the issues with the Internet last week but didn’t feel it posed a major issue.
“Overall it wasn’t too big of an issue but, yeah there were definitely some times where like the network would time out and my Google doc would just lose signal,” Chen said.
Jonathan Smith (GRD ’16) said he did not see any issues with the Wi-Fi related to his personal computer, but did experience internet speed reductions when he used campus computers at his workplace last week.
“As far as my personal laptop, I didn’t really experience any issues like I said, definitely our work computers had a lot of slow movement, couldn’t really get on certain websites,” Smith said.

The Georgetown University Press hosted a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the book and film documentary “Black Georgetown Remembered” as part of Black History Month celebrations in Gaston Hall on Wednesday night.
The book and film documentary, first published in 1991, narrates the abundant history of Georgetown’s black community, a history that the book cites as relatively unknown by members of the greater Georgetown community until the book’s publication.
The event was moderated by Georgetown professor Maurice Jackson, who teaches history, African American studies and performing arts, and included a performance by the Georgetown Chapel and Gospel Choir, a video clip of the film documentary and a panel discussion led by those who worked on publishing the first edition of the book. The panelists shared memories about their time working on the book as well as memories of the black community at Georgetown.
Professor of English and Director of the Institute for African American studies at the University of Georgia Valerie Babb said she came up with the idea for the Black Georgetown Remembered project during discussions about the Georgetown’s bicentennial celebrations in 1989.
“I remember sitting in a room with various university administrators and faculties and they were coming up with wonderful ideas on how to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Georgetown University,” Babb said. “Nothing black came up! I thought to myself, ‘This is Washington, D.C. There must be a history somewhere.’”
According to Kathleen Menzie Lesko, who was Babb’s co-author and the head of the Bicentennial Program Committee at the time, Babb’s idea was well received and earned the praise of Rev. Charles Currie, S.J., and Rev. Timothy S. Healy, S.J., Georgetown’s president at the time.
“Both Father Currie and Father Healy told me when I signed on to the bicentennial project that they very much wanted to honor the black community in Georgetown in some way, in some programming and make it part of the University’s bicentennial celebration, so that was a goal from the outset,” Lesko said.
At the beginning of the project, Lesko reached out to the black churches in the Georgetown area.
According to Lesko, the community happily responded to the idea, and members spoke about their experiences as Georgetown residents.
Dr. Monica Roache, Georgetown’s advisory neighborhood commissioner and fifth-generation Georgetown resident, emphasized how much this project means to black residents of the neighborhood.
“I remember 25 years ago how my mother was so excited to work with Kathleen and a few other members of the panel and the audience, and what it meant for her to finally have these stories told,” Roache said.
Babb spoke about her experience as co-author in “rediscovering” the difficult history that residents of Georgetown endured.
“One thing that I think is tricky about remembering is that we tend to think that the history we are seeing here, the history that we have come to celebrate is that: history,” Babb said. “But, these were people’s lives. People went through a process to the Georgetown we know today, and I don’t want us to forget that that process was not always easy.”
Lesko discussed the difficult memories community members had to address during the creation of the project. She specifically reflected on how certain individuals dealt with memories accumulated in the era of racial segregation.
“I remember some very emotionally charged moments when people would ask us to turn all the cameras and recorders off, and they’d share some very private memories of living in Georgetown during the decades of segregation,” Lesko said. “It was a very powerful and moving experience to be in the room, to share those moments with people.”
The panelists, which included descendants of the black residents who were part of the community throughout the 20th century, also discussed the history of black Georgetown and what the community meant to them. Vernon Ricks, Jr., a third-generation Washingtonian, reflected on his childhood in Georgetown.
“There is great truth in the saying, ‘It takes a village to raise a child,’” Ricks said. “Georgetown was a family community. A community alive with the sound of children.”
Despite change and adversity, the black Georgetown community continues to serve an important role in the neighborhood’s past and present.
“What Georgetown means to me is a great deal of pride,” Neville Waters (MBA ’91), a fifth-generation Georgetown resident said.
Gwen Lockman (COL ’16), who attended the event, said she appreciated that many audience members were members of the black Georgetown community who came to reminisce on their past.
“I thought it was really lovely how they incorporated the folks who were able to attend tonight who actually had memories of black Georgetown and that it wasn’t just the panelists on the stage and the experts talking, but that they did give people an opportunity to share their own stories,” Lockman said. “I think it’s a really valuable history that is unfortunately so hidden, so I hope students hear more about it.”

Just remember that Francis Healy, once president of Georgetown, was Irish American (white) and NOT BLACK.

hoyalum says 
March 14, 2016 at 9:32 am
Why is AD Powell trying to deny Georgetown President Francis Healy of the legacy of slavery in his background?   If Wikipedia is true:  “Patrick, as he was known, was born into slavery in Macon, Georgia, to the Irish-American plantation owner Michael Healy and his African-American slave Mary Eliza. Mary Eliza herself was mulatto, the child of a white slaveowner and black slave. Because of the law of slavery that children took the status of the mother, by the principle of partus sequitur ventrum, Patrick and his siblings were legally considered slaves, although their father was free and they were three-quarters or more European in ancestry.”

AD Powell says 
April 6, 2017 at 8:46 pm
Hoyalum, the Healys were never treated as slaves by their father.  Once they moved North (with their father’s assistance), they became “white” in every social and legal sense.  They never identified with blacks or slaves.  Indeed, since they were supported by slave labor, it would have been rather hypocritical to become abolitionists.  The Healys were proud of their Irish-American heritage and identified as Irish-American.  Those who married chose Irish-American spouses.  Why are YOU trying to blacken the Healy name?  Claiming white people as “black” does not “prove” the equality of blacks.  On the contrary, you send the message of racial inferiority, not equality.

Former Anti-Defamation League National Director and Holocaust survivor Abraham Foxman characterized the global status of anti-Semitism today as more dire than at any point since World War II during a lecture delivered in the Copley Formal Lounge on Feb. 23.
The event, titled “Reflections on Recent Anti-Semitism,” addressed topics ranging from attitudes toward Jews in the Middle East to anti-Israel demonstrations on college campuses.
Foxman specifically highlighted protests ahead of the formal launch of the new Center for Jewish Civilization and Georgetown’s Conference on Understanding Contemporary European Anti-Semitism, which both occurred Feb. 22.
Foxman, who was born in Poland in 1940 and survived the annihilation of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, prefaced his remarks by cautioning against the rise of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who holds the highest poll numbers in the GOP election despite divisive comments about banning Muslims and deporting illegal immigrants.
“Mr. Trump comes in and breaks all the taboos about what is a civil compact in our society, that unwritten code of what is acceptable and what is not,” Foxman said. “When we watch every single day another taboo broken, and people hesitant to challenge that breaking of the taboo, it is beginning to undermine everything the common sense and respect that has served us and other minorities well.”
Following his comments on the political situation in America, Foxman contrasted the plight of Jews in the United States and Europe. He claimed that contemporary European Jews are confronted with lamentable situations in their home countries: They are faced with violence as well as discriminatory legislation that targets practices such as circumcision and kosher slaughtering.
“If Jews leave Europe because they cannot live there as Jews, because authorities send messages that ‘we don’t want you,’ because authorities say ‘yeah, you can stay but not as a Jew,’ they’re left with this haunting problem of whether or not to stay,” Foxman said. “And if they don’t stay, Hitler will have a posthumous victory.”
Foxman cited evidence compiled by the Anti-Defamation League over the past two years in a poll gauging levels of anti-Semitism in over 100 countries. The survey identified respondents to harbor anti-Semitic attitudes if they answered “true” to six or more of 11 statements describing negative Jewish stereotypes.
The ADL found that 26 percent of approximately 4.2 billion adults surveyed harbored anti-Semitic attitudes, with the highest averages in the Middle East and North Africa region at 74 percent.
Using the ADL data, Foxman said Jews in the United States are 10 times more likely to be targeted than any other religious group.
“Measuring anti-Semitism is not scientific, but if it acts like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it’s a duck,” Foxman said. “To find that a quarter of the adult population of the world is infected with serious anti-Semitism, and that the number one thing is that Jews cannot be trusted, that’s just very serious.”
As a staunch advocate for Israel, Foxman pronounced most criticism against Zionism to be rooted in anti-Semitism. He asserted that Israel is subjected to a double standard and unfairly chastised for acting in ways that other countries can with impunity.
“Israel is far from perfect. What other country in the world cannot decide where its capital is? Is there another country in the world that has to defend its right to defend itself?” Foxman said. “If you’re anti-Zionist, the only way you’re not an anti-Semite is if they are one of the unique ones in the world who reject all nationalism.”
Foxman said that anti-Zionist attitudes are increasingly evident on college campuses such as Vassar, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Stanford. He explained that pro-Palestinian demonstrations in those schools may result in hostile climates for Jewish students. In January 2016, students at Wisconsin taped paper swastikas and a picture of Adolf Hitler on a Jewish student’s dorm room door.
“It never starts as anti-Semitism,” Foxman said. “It begins as advocacy and morphs and metastasizes very quickly into anti-Semitism. In these demonstrations by students for Palestine where they place eviction notices on students’ doors to symbolize Palestinians being evicted, they post it on the Cohens’, the Greenbergs’, the Goldsteins’ dorms.”
Following his address, Foxman answered questions from the audience about topics such as Jewish attitudes to the Syrian refugee crisis, the condition of Jews in Ireland and the implications of Jewish migration from Europe.
Annabelle Timsit (SFS ’17), who attended the event, said Foxman’s lecture reflected the rampant anti-Semitism she witnessed while growing up and attending public school in France.
“I was very much impacted in class when we talked about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and I heard some very anti-Semitic remarks from students in class,” Timsit said. “Even teachers said, not knowing I was Jewish, ‘Oh, but it’s expected, because these are Jews and they come in and they take over and become more powerful than anybody else’ or, ‘Well, something would have been done about this a long time ago except Jews have control of politics in France.’”
Retired U.S. Foreign Service Officer Ilya Levin, who also attended the event, noted how, during years of service abroad, he found post-World War II Europe riddled with subtle anti-Semitism.
“I went to a country, and they started a center of Jewish tolerance,” Levin said. “I told the director, as a naturalized American and a Jew, the name sounded kind of wrong. You tolerate an unwanted guest. You do not have to ‘tolerate’ someone who is part of your family. It’s the sort of thing here, in America, we take for granted.”
Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18) said certain aspects of the lecture rang more true than others.
“I’ve definitely witnessed anti-Zionism on campus, and obviously Georgetown is inherently political, and these are conversations that need to be had, but holding Israel to a different standard, I agree that is anti-Semitism,” Shinbrot said. “But something that is troubling for me to believe is that if Europe’s Jews have to leave, that is another victory for Hitler. That is very tough for me to hear, and I’m not sure I believe that completely.”

A report released this month by the Center on Education and the Workforce, a research entity affiliated with Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy, has shown that although more students of color are pursuing a college education, they are highly concentrated in low-paying majors.
According to the study, which was released Feb. 9, African Americans make up 12 percent of the total population of the United States, but they are underrepresented in the nation’s fastest-growing, highest-paying jobs, which may be linked back to a student’s choice of major.
The study reported that African-American students have overwhelmingly chosen majors that traditionally lead to low-paying jobs since 2009, including majors like health administration, human services, community organization and social work. These industries typically generate yearly wages between $38,000 and $41,000.
Alternatively, relatively few African-American students study high-paying science, technology, engineering and math and business majors. Only 8 percent of general engineering majors, 7 percent of mathematics majors, and 5 percent of computer engineering majors are African-American.
CEW Director and co-author of the report Anthony P. Carnevale said in a press release that African Americans are concentrated in majors that may reward them in other, noneconomic ways.
“The low-paying majors that African Americans are concentrated in are of high social value but low economic value,” Carnevale wrote.
CEW Chief Economist Nicole Smith said African-American students may choose these majors based on their interests or because of the impact of others.
“We’re questioning if this is purely a decision that students are making for themselves based on their interests, or perhaps they are doing so because there is some amount of inertia, having followed in the footsteps of students before them, or maybe having professors guiding you and saying, ‘This what we think you’re suited for,’” Smith said.
Smith said discrimination in the workforce still exists.
“Even in 2015, we found that discrimination in pay still exists. We found that, for equivalently qualified students with the same level of education and who are working at the same occupation, we still have differences in pay that are not explained clearly by education level and clearly not explained by level of experiences,” Smith said.
According to Smith, the study of major selection and earnings specifically by African-American students was prompted by findings on previous studies conducted by the CEW that focused on majors as a whole.
The report said access to high-paying jobs is especially important for African Americans.
“This is especially important to a demographic group that historically has been deprived of opportunities and had fewer economic assets and resources making them especially vulnerable to the family stress created by economic ups and downs,” the report said.
According to the study, African Americans who choose majors that correlate with well-paying, growing industries are likely to find themselves with greater access to high-paying jobs and less trouble paying off their student loans.
Smith said the CEW produces its reports to help students make informed decisions.
“It’s really sort of a public service,” Smith said. “We want people to know that by choosing a certain major, this is the average wage that a person of that major earns.”
Carnevale said in an interview with The Hoya that students may be helped by improved career counseling.
“Meaningful career planning before college can provide transparency about major choice and potentially prevent onerous debt and underemployment down the road,” Carnevale said.

This is a nice way to gloss over one clearly negative aspect of affirmative action. 
Not all iterations of the “mismatch” hypothesis are well supported, but this one is. Blacks accepted into a selective universities with affirmative action programs are less likely to major in high aptitude STEM fields and more likely to major in less rigorous, “high social value” majors (whatever that means). There may be may some positive results from affirmative action, but this is a clearly one negative result since, as this article mentions, there is also evidence that suggests major selection matters more than school selectivity for future earnings. If you are concerned with racial gaps in income and wealth, this racial gap in STEM-majors should also concern you.

“The low-paying majors that African Americans are concentrated in are of high social value but low economic value,” Carnevale wrote.
This is the trigger warning that should come with every critical theory based major.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority presented a report Feb. 4 revealing the lowest levels of Metro ridership since 2004, coinciding with financial analytics firm SmartAsset’s release of its rankings the same week that named Washington’s Metro system the best public transit in the United States.
SmartAsset also named the Metrorail’s ridership the country’s second largest in its survey, although the metro’s weekday riders have declined by six percent, and weekend riders have declined by twelve percent since fiscal year 2015, which began in July of 2014.
Metrorail ridership experienced consistent growth from 1996 to 2009 — from 150 million yearly trips to 225 million. Because of a revitalization of urban centers, 2011 marked the beginning of a steady and unprecedented decline in ridership.
According to the Metro Budget Report on Ridership and Revenue, the drop in ridership affected all stations, time periods and trip types.
Unlike the public transportation systems of New York and Chicago, which charge flat rates of less than three dollars per ride, D.C. Metro has a base fare and additional, variable charges depending on distance and time of day.
The District’s public transportation system is one of the most expensive in the country. A monthly unlimited pass costs $237, more than double the cost of New York City’s $116 and Chicago’s $100. The report cites this as a possible reason for the decline in ridership. Fare increases were enacted in July 2014, making Metro bus fare $1.75 from $1.60, base rail fare $2.15 from $2.10 and maximum rail fare $5.90 from $5.75.
Since 2004, bus fare has increased by 40 percent, while maximum rail fare has increased by fifty-one percent. According to data gathered in FY 2015, low-income riders made up 51 percent of weekday Metrobus riders whereas 12 percent would be considered high-income. For the Metrorail, 12 percent of riders are low-income and 50 percent are high-income.
The report does not cite one overarching reason for the ridership decline but highlights a list of possible causes, including the popularity of alternative modes of transportation such as bikes and rideshare services, fare pricing concerns, low gasoline prices, poor service quality and reliability and safety incidents.
Safety incidents in the past year include the Yellow Line tunnel incident outside of L’Enfant Plaza in January of last year, the midday shooting on the Green Line, the derailment of a train near Smithsonian in August and a fire at Stadium-Armory in September.
Additionally, the report noted the unreliability of on-time rail service.
“Metrorail is also struggling to provide reliable service to customers. Rail On-Time
Performance, which measures how evenly-spaced the trains are, has been consistently below target, particularly since the opening of the Silver Line,” the report reads. “Riders are experiencing more unpredictable travel times and must budget more time to reach their destination.”
WMATA Media Relations Manager Sherri Ly said Metro is doing its best to alleviate the ridership decline.
“Improving reliability and the safety of our riders is key to bringing customers back to Metro,” Ly wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are also exploring options for a monthly pass, as well as a university pass for students and adding bus services to the current short trip rail pass.”
Many students at Georgetown, such as Caroline Crinion (SFS ’19), use MetroRail to commute to internships or to reach other parts of the District. Crinion, who works in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, commutes for an hour daily on average.
Crinion said that sometimes, she is forced to use other means of transportation because of the lengthy wait time for the Metro.
“In a rush or at times when my class goes over time, I’m forced to take an Uber, which takes half the time if not less, and the cost is around $11 when traveling at non-peak times,” Crinion said. “Uber is more convenient. Being picked up at the front gates and transported directly instead of switching buses and trains is easier. I also think time is a big factor, as if I need to save on time, I Uber.”
Anthony Buonomo (COL ’16) commutes via MetroBus to his internship at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Headquarters. Buonomo said that he spends an average of 45 minutes commuting by bus from Georgetown and prefers to bike to work if possible.
“Sunshine, wind and workout in the morning surely trumps sitting in the dark, fake, tube,” Buonomo said.
Buonomo said he doubted that he would begin to use MetroRail to commute to and from work.
“I don’t think anything would make me consistently take the Metro,” Buonomo said. “Maybe if it wasn’t so grey, and people weren’t so sad.”

Georgetown University Medical Center researchers found that viewing graphic anti-smoking warning labels on cigarette packages stimulates activity in brain areas linked to emotion, decision-making and memory in a study published Feb. 16.
The investigation marks the first of its kind to be conducted in young adult smokers. Researchers conducted the study by showing the 19 participants, aged between 18 and 30 years old, 64 images of cigarette pack labels for four seconds each. Labels ranged from providing no warning of tobacco-use health risks to containing explicit images of potential long-term effects, such as tumors and rotting in the mouth.
The researchers then asked participants to rate to what degree each image motivated them to quit smoking on a scale of one to four. Participants were also connected to frontal magnetic resonance imaging scanners so researchers could monitor brain activity.
The study found that participants were much more likely to report a motivation to quit after viewing the more graphic images. It also showed noticeable brain activity in the areas responsible for making decisions, such as the amygdala and the medial prefrontal region.
GUMC assistant professor of oncology and co-lead author Darren Mays said the study aimed to analyze young smokers and methods of helping them overcome tobacco addiction.
“The goal of the study was to help us better understand how graphic warning labels on cigarettes may motivate young smokers to quit, and to ultimately contribute to the weight of evidence being considered surrounding [Food and Drug Administration] policy,” Mays wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Although it’s unlikely that any single study can tip this balance, our study adds uniquely to this evidence base by applying neuroimaging to show how graphic warnings may affect young smokers’ behaviors, which is new evidence that may contribute to ongoing policy considerations.”
The study’s other co-lead author and psychology professor Adam Green said this investigation has roots in traditional tobacco marketing, although the research team was looking to elicit negative reactions to smoking rather than positive ones.
“Using brain imaging in this way is actually something that marketers have been doing for a while now,” Green wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Their goal has been to find advertisements that elicit the kind of reactions in the brain that affect people’s decisions about what to buy, especially in emotion-related brain regions.”
Green said he is optimistic about the possibility of using marketing techniques in attempts to convince younger smokers to quit.
“One of the exciting things about this study is that we are using that approach in service of public health. Rather than trying to get people to buy things, the goal was to show how a graphic warning label — a kind of anti-advertisement — can elicit brain responses that are likely to influence decisions about smoking,” Green wrote. “Obviously, the long term goal is to shift people’s decision-making away from buying and smoking cigarettes.”
Qualifications for the study included age and smoking status, which Mays said were kept deliberately broad in order to gain a more inclusive look at the population of young adult smokers.
“Our research focused on this group because evidence indicates their vulnerable transitions from experimentation or ‘social’ smoking to regular, addicted smoking,” Mays wrote. “Participants were also screened for fMRI safety requirements, but otherwise we left the criteria fairly broad in order to capture a sample that reflects the young adult population of our local area.”
GUMC’s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Director Louis M. Weiner said he hopes this research will be influential for tobacco regulators at organizations such as the FDA and the National Institute of Health.
“The study provides important guidance to policy regulators who wish to assure that young people receive messages about the dangers of smoking that are emotionally impactful and favorably influence their decisions to either quit or not start smoking in the first place,” Weiner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Such information would be very useful to the FDA in its efforts to combat smoking caused health problems such as cancer and lung disease.”
Weiner stressed the importance of further investigation into this area in efforts to better educate the wider population on the health risks of smoking.
“These results certainly should provide a powerful impetus to NIH to sponsor larger scale studies that can build upon these interesting findings and further refine visual messages about the dangers of smoking,” Weiner wrote.
FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum said this type of research is appreciated by the organization and helps it make progress in its fight against tobacco addiction.
“The FDA values research being conducted to help inform the agency on how best to protect the public, especially youth, from the death and disease caused by tobacco use,” Felberbaum wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The agency evaluates studies as part of a larger body of evidence aimed at assisting in our mission to protect public health and furthering our understanding on particular issues. This includes the important questions being raised about how consumers understand and appreciate the health risks of tobacco products.”
Sarah Schuessler (MED ’19) said she hopes this research can lead to changes in the current medical field.
“I’m really excited about this study. I think it could have a really big impact on the world of medicine,” Schuessler said. “We’re taught in school how to advise patients to quit smoking, but if such research could prevent a person from picking up a pack of cigarettes in the first place, then we wouldn’t have to do that counseling, and I think that’s amazing.”
