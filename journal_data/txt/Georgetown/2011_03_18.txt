A revitalized workshop aimed at advising college students strapped for cash was held in the Intercultural Center last night.
¢ommon $ense, led by Mike Ryan, an adjunct professor in the McDonough School of Business, stressed the need for students to embrace financial planning to a classroom packed with students.
The workshop was the first of several such sessions organized by the Office of Student Financial Services and the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and sponsored by the George R. Houston Memorial Fund.
“It has been increasingly noted that issues of personal finance are frequently overlooked in students’ regular academic courses,” said Marina Test, executive assistant to the Dean of the Office of Student Financial Services. “The program aims to empower students with financial knowledge for their futures.”
The workshops are open to all Georgetown University undergraduate and graduate students and are led by local alumni, professors in the MSB and financial literacy experts. The series will cover a variety of topics ranging from budgeting to investing.
The OSFS and GUASFCU launched the ¢ommon $ense workshops in 2006 to alleviate what they said was a widespread lack of financial literacy in the Georgetown community.
Test said each workshop is designed to address a vital financial literacy topic or issue that students have asked the OSFS about in the past.
“We have come up with a program that effectively addresses many of the concerns held by our student population that is often overlooked by regular curricula,” she said.
Yesterday’s workshop was advertised as an introductory session, but functioned as an interactive dialogue as Ryan addressed several pressing financial topics. In addition to advising students, he threw St Patrick’s Day-themed T-shirts and $1 bills to those who provided insightful answers.
Ryan encouraged students to think ahead in financial planning as far as retirement and to take ownership and responsibility of their own financial affairs.
“Many of us don’t want to seem to learn about financial management, and that’s dangerous,” he said.
Eric Reed (COL ’11) said he attended because he was worried about mounting student debts as he prepares to enroll in medical school.
“I’m looking to minimize the damage,” he said.
Others, such as David Chen (NHS ’14), attended with the intention of more broadly educating themselves in the science of financial management.
“I don’t have anything in mind about what to expect, but I want to learn how to use my money wisely,” he said.
The workshop series was launched in 2006 after the OSFS became aware of the limited knowledge college students and recent graduates had of their personal finances. After four years of the program, the findings of the 2010 Personal Finance Assessment Survey and subsequent evaluation by the Baker Scholar Program continued to emphasize the need and demand for such a program, said Katie Cohen (COL ’12), chief executive officer of GUASFCU.
The survey found that 97.5 percent of the student body saw increased financial literacy education as beneficial, and that 62.9 percent of students would be likely to invest time in a personal finance course.
The high response rate of the survey further suggested an interest among students in learning about financial management.
The implementation of ¢ommon $ense reflects a growing trend toward increased financial literacy education across the country. Universities such as Dartmouth College and the University of Pennsylvania have implemented similar programs in recent years. In addition, financial literacy courses have become mandatory in several states nationwide, as administrators have realized that college-bound students are without the necessary tools to make good financial decisions, Test said.
Future sessions will focus on topics such as debt and credit, budgeting, saving and investment. The series will culminate in an alumni panel on various finance-related topics.
Workshops take place for the next four Thursdays at 6:15 p.m. in ICC 105.

For many transfer students, their college experience will always be shaped by their path to the Hilltop.
“[The fact that I transferred] comes up once a day, from someone. It’s not like it’s ever going to go away. It is part of my identity,” said Alissa Orlando (SFS ’13), who transferred from The George Washington University this year.
About 1,700 people apply to Georgetown as transfers every year and about 20 percent were accepted last year, with over 200 arriving at Georgetown this fall. According to academic counselor Jessica Ciani-Dausch, who sits on the transfer admissions committee and is one of the deans in the College that works with transfer students, the students’ reasons for switching schools are diverse.
Ciani-Dausch said that many prospective transfer students applied to Georgetown as freshmen and were not admitted. Some find Georgetown’s Jesuit identity appealing, and still others are attracted to the reputation of the university’s government and international affairs programs, she said.
The decision to change schools requires a lot of “soul searching,” according to Kate Bermingham (COL ’11), who transferred from Providence College in 2008.
“It was very hard for me to make the decision to leave Providence even after I got accepted to Georgetown,” she said. “I second guessed myself a lot. I wondered if I just stayed another year maybe I’d like it better.”
Ultimately, Bermingham chose Georgetown.
“I just felt like if I didn’t take the chance I would always regret it. I’m fairly certain that it was the best decision that I could ever have made,” she said.
Fellow transfer Orlando looks back on switching schools as an overall positive experience, however.
“In making the conscious decision to change schools you’re taking your academic experience into your own hands. It’s really empowering,” she said.
The transfer process begins on March 1, when the application and financial aid forms are due. Applications are read by the admissions committee, similar to the process for selecting incoming first-year students. But Ciani-Dausch said that transfer applications are expected to be more sophisticated than most freshmen applications — the admissions committee is usually looking for something extra from transfer applicants.
“These are people who have gone through at least a year of college, who have tried somewhere else and decided it didn’t fit for them. Usually there’s a story there, and you have to be able to articulate well what that story is.”
According to Dean Emily Zenick, who works with transfers to the School of Foreign Service, applicants must be able to explain why they are a good fit for the SFS.
“Transfers need to do a good job of researching the school,” she said.
It is also crucial that applicants come with enough credits to meet the SFS’s graduation requirements. Students who have not taken economics or a foreign language are generally not considered.
Youna Ahn (SFS ’13) came to Georgetown this year after studying for a year at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, a school in a rural area of Japan.
Ahn was frustrated by the isolation of her university in Japan — “It sometimes took two days for the newspapers to get there,” she said — and thought that Georgetown would be a better place to pursue her interests in international politics and economics.
“I really wanted to study in a capital,” she said. “Since I’m really interested in international organizations, D.C. is a hub for those. And since Georgetown is situated here, I really wanted to study here to stay close to those important people and to these political and economic issues.”
For Bermingham, it was the quality of the students at Georgetown that attracted her.
“I wanted to be in a place where the entire community felt like it was intellectually curious and where my peers really pushed me as much as my classes did. So, Georgetown was really calling,” she said.
While Dalton Shaughnessy (MSB ’12) switched to Georgetown as a junior, he had been planning on making the change since his freshman year at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
“I think that two years is a long enough time to be anywhere. College is about being able to adapt to new situations. By the second term of my sophomore year I felt like I was beginning to stagnate,” he said, “I wanted something completely different and completely radical from what I was used to.”
According to Shaughnessy, Wisconsin was the best fit for him as a freshman, but he “went with the thought in the back of my mind that I’d probably transfer at the end of two years.”
Whatever their reason for coming to Georgetown, most transfers find the experience to be a net positive.
“I’ve never had anyone come to me and say, ‘this isn’t working for me,’” Ciani-Dausch said. “There’s definitely a challenge to come to a place where so many students have already formed groups, but I’m always impressed that people who have gone through the whole process have that much confidence about their ability,” she added. “They just jump right in.”
Bermingham credited transfer New Student Orientation with helping her to adjust to Georgetown.
“My NSO experience as a transfer was the first time I really knew that I was home. Georgetown does an incredible job of making transfer students feel like a valued part of this community,” she said.
This past fall, Bermingham was a captain for transfer students, a job that put her in charge of leading a group of orientation advisers.
“It really helps transfer students really deal with the specific set of issues they have coming in,” she said.
These issues range from rushing to meet Georgetown’s graduation requirements to struggling to make friends in an environment where most people have already had a year to get to know each other.
“You worry that everybody will already have their set group of friends,” Bermingham said. “You also have a shorter amount of time to get to do the things that every college student wants to do. We have to play catch up in a way.”
According to Orlando, adapting to the academic environment at Georgetown can be a challenge. “It’s a different standard. The standards set by your professors and especially by your peers are so much higher than it was at my other school,” she said.
But ultimately most transfer students, including Orlando, are happy with their decision.
“I’m so appreciative of Georgetown,” Orlando said. “I don’t think that the normal student has the same appreciation that I do. Literally once a day I feel just overwhelming gratitude that I’m here.”

Georgetown alumna Kaya Henderson returned to the Hilltop Tuesday evening as the newly appointed chancellor of D.C. Public Schools.
Henderson (SFS ’92, GRD ’07) spoke about her recent promotion to the position at the Woodstock Theological Center’s forum “Faith in the City,” which focused on enacting social change in the District.
“The question was not ‘Do I want this job?'” Henderson said to the audience. “The question was “‘Will I answer the call to serve?'”
In an interview with The Hoya, Henderson said that she recognized her call to educational policymaking during her time as an undergraduate in the School of Foreign Service.
“I was watching all of my friends make plans to go abroad and work on issues of education, issues of poverty, issues of social justice,” she said. “I felt a lot of the issues people were going to solve abroad we hadn’t really solved here.”
While at Georgetown, Henderson primed herself for a career path in teaching by working with various campus organizations assisting children and the underprivileged, including the D.C. Schools program and Campus Ministry.
After graduating from Georgetown, Henderson entered Teach for America, and her experience as a Spanish teacher in the Bronx led to a lengthy career within the organization as both a recruiter and an administrator.
Now a veteran DCPS employee, Henderson served as Deputy Chancellor to former DCPS Chancellor Michelle Rhee from 2007 to 2010. She said she is excited to continue to advance the city’s educational system as permanent chancellor.
Henderson plans to create a more rigorous, diversified curriculum, featuring the arts and the humanities alongside the sciences.
“I feel like providing our kids with a multidimensional, multidiscipline academic course of study that focuses on the arts, focuses on the humanities and really provides our kids with that same kind of academic experience that kids at Sidwell Friends or in Beverly Hills get,” Henderson said.”A well-rounded education is what I am most excited to deal with.”
DCPS and its newest leader face the challenge of offering students such a holistic education under the strain of increased budget cuts in the District.
Despite financial constraints, Henderson said the continuation of extracurricular activities and non-traditional courses remains important to her administration and to the city.
“It would have been easy for me to cut P.E., art and music,” she said. “Those are the things that some people say are dispensable, and I made it very clear that we cut other things.”
Improving the quality of the District’s teachers is also a priority for Henderson and DCPS.
“We do a ton of professional development. So, for teachers who actually want to improve, there are a zillion resources,” she said.
Teachers will have the opportunity to continue to boost their own education through classes provided by the teachers union, inquiry groups and workshops.
Looking back on her entrance into educational policy, Henderson said she is proud that she chose to pursue public service.
“When I think about my career trajectory, choosing teaching and choosing education ended up providing me with a more rigorous, more relevant and certainly more lucrative career than many of my friends who pursued the legal or business professions,” she said.

The Department of Public Safety apprehended three members of an alleged laptop theft ring in Lauinger Library on Tuesday evening.
According to Sgt. David Ruiz, DPS was called to the fifth floor of the library at around 8 p.m. by a student who saw two men rummaging through the backpacks of students who had temporarily left their seats.
One of the two men had gained access to the library illegally, and neither is affiliated with the university, Ruiz said. One of the men entered the library along with a woman, who is also not connected to the university. Both entered by showing their identifications. According to Ruiz, the woman then let the second man, who did not have identification, into the library through an off-limits door. The two men went to the fifth floor and the woman left Lauinger.
“During the interview following their apprehension it was revealed that one of the suspects was let in by someone [else],” Ruiz said. “They had a knowledge of the location, obviously.”
Ruiz added that it is unclear if there are more suspects in the alleged ring. Security Officer Patricia Watkins recognized the woman, who she had seen in the library on Monday around the time that a laptop was stolen, and also alerted DPS. Ruiz and two officers then detained the two men in the library and caught up to the woman on 37th and Prospect Streets.
All three suspects were apprehended, and the man who had entered the library illegally was arrested and charged with unlawful entry. All three have been barred from campus, Ruiz said. None of the suspects were arrested for and charged with theft, however, as none were carrying stolen materials at the time of the apprehension.
Ruiz said that the apprehension was the result of an ongoing investigation, but also praised students for being proactive and calling DPS to report suspicious activity.
In a statement on the department’s website, DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith wrote that officers dressed in plain clothes have been monitoring activity in the library. Ruiz commented on students’ reaction to the stepped up presence.
“Surveillance has been ongoing and we’ve been vigilantly patrolling. Students are aware of that and taking their laptops with them,” Ruiz said, later adding, “DPS has also witnessed students taking their laptops with them for security purposes.”
According to Ruiz, the investigation was launched in November after a string of laptop thefts occurred in the library. Forty-six thefts occurred in the library in the fall semester. This semester, five laptops have been stolen, four of them this month and one in February. No thefts were reported in January.

The Georgetown University Medical Center announced a new program in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 10, a venture designed to foster joint research concerning regulatory science, ethics, education and training.
The Program for Regulatory Science and Medicine is believed to be the first undertaking of its kind because regulatory science is a relatively new field, according to the GUMC press release. Ira Shoulson, a neurologist and university faculty member, and the newly appointed director of PRSM, said the field focuses on new tools and methods to measure the safety and effectiveness of FDA regulated products.
“Most professionals in the field of regulatory science come from a background in laboratory research, medicine, pharmacy, bioethics and law,” Shoulson said in a press release. “There are no integrated educational programs designed specifically to train future regulators who will be responsible for developing and overseeing new and effective treatments and ensuring the safety of food products.”
The leadership of the program hopes to develop a graduate school educational component and to organize international symposia on regulatory science and medicine, according to the March 10 GUMC press release.
GUMC and the FDA began working together in February with the intention of creating such a program.
Jesse Goodman, FDA chief scientist and deputy commissioner for science and public health, said he was optimistic about the FDA’s affiliation with Georgetown.
“We are excited about this new partnership and the unique opportunities for supporting our goal of translating basic research discoveries into real world products that benefit patients and public health,” Goodman said in a Feb. 24 press release.

The recent economic downturn has been hardest on young people aged 20 to 24, according to a recent U.S. Labor Department survey. Unemployment among this age bracket rose last month, bucking national trends.
Overall unemployment decreased from 9 to 8.9 percent from January to February, but unemployment among 20- to 24-year-olds rose 0.2 percentage points to 15.4 percent in this interval.
As Georgetown seniors prepare to graduate this spring, the news is a sobering reminder of the  magnitude of the current recession.
Despite national concerns, however, Career Center Executive Director Mike Schaub does not believe that these numbers will be significantly lower for Georgetown’s graduating seniors in 2011.The Career Center’s survey of graduating seniors for 2010, which will be released soon, indicates that Georgetown graduates have a competitive edge, even in a tough job market.
“Georgetown seniors who graduated in 2010 fared very well in terms of post-graduation employment despite a challenging economic climate,” Schaub said.
Schaub pointed to a decline of 4 percent in the number of students “seeking employment” from 2009 to 2010 as significant evidence that Georgetown graduates have remained relatively unaffected by the recession.
According to surveys given to graduating seniors from 2004-2009 displayed on the Career Education Center website, on average 60 percent of Georgetown graduates have found employment while about 22 percent have chosen to attend graduate school.
In 2009, investment banking companies, finance companies and the government were three of the leading employers of graduating Georgetown seniors, according to the Career Center survey for that year.
Schaub believes that Georgetown students remain a fit for government positions, but said that this sector does have the potential to cause problems for graduates seeking posts.
“There continues to be some uncertainty with federal and local government jobs due to budget challenges,” he said.
The economic news for graduating seniors nationwide is worsened by the fact that the Department of Labor has also reported the highest rate of unemployment among college graduates of all ages since 1970, according to USA Today. While the unemployment rate for college graduates is far below the rate for those who hold only a high school degree or less, the bureau reports that 5.1 percent of Americans with at least a bachelor’s degree find themselves jobless amid the current recession.
The Career Center’s preparation of Georgetown’s seniors may be the key ingredient in battling the lack of job openings permeating the current recession, according to Schaub.
“Through the Career Center’s educational efforts, we have encouraged seniors to begin looking for employment early, to network often and to take a proactive approach to their job search,” Schaub said. “I think the message has gotten across to students and that they have prepared well for their post-graduation plans.”

Morning runs and late night strolls to the monuments may soon become more scenic, as construction on a pathway connecting the John F. Kennedy Center of Performing Arts and the Potomac riverfront is set to begin later this year, according to the Foggy Bottom Association website.
The design calls for a pedestrian bridge extending over Rock Creek Parkway that will provide direct access to the terrace of the Kennedy Center from the Rock Creek Trail. There are currently no crosswalks connecting the center to the riverfront.
The proposed footbridge is the culmination of almost 10 years of planning by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2002, the Kennedy Center joined with the FHA in an effort to improve accessibility, according to a FHA press release. One of the main problems identified was the lack of a direct connection between the Potomac riverfront and the center.
“The John F. Kennedy Center is the national cultural center,” Norman Y. Mineta, then transportation secretary, said in a FHA 2002 press release. “As good neighbors, we are pleased to work with the community in developing plans to reconnect the people with this living memorial.”
Some students said that they are looking forward to the proposed connection. Ed Walczak (COL ‘14) has run along the riverfront on occasion and has noticed the problem of direct access to the Kennedy Center.
“It is really hard to try to cross the highway [from the trail],” Walczak said.
The exact price tag of the project has yet to be determined. Jack Van Dop, a senior technical specialist for the FHA, told The George Washington University Hatchet, stating that the majority of funding will come from the federal government, with a small portion coming from the District.

With the passage of SAFE Reform and a new GUSA executive team in office, debate has begun over the future of the GUSA Fund, which was set up last year to supplement the money student groups receive from their advisory boards.
Newly elected Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) said GUSA is considering several changes to the fund in order to boost its efficiency. One change proposes a mandate that the GUSA Fund will not retroactively fund events, while another suggests that all documents for events that necessitate Senate approval are sent to all GUSA senators 48 hours before senate meetings.
Both Laverriere and current Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) agreed that there was a possibility of scaling back the GUSA Fund budget in subsequent years, given the increased student activities funding available as a result of Student Activities Fee and Endowment Reform.
“With SAFE Reform passed, demand for the GUSA Fund should logically decrease, because clubs now have more funding available from their advisory boards,” Malkerson said.
Former GUSA President Calen Angert (MSB ’11) and Vice President Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) set up the fund in January 2010 in order to aid student groups that were not allocated sufficient money from their advisory boards, with an emphasis placed on Student Activities Commission groups.
“However, there is some concern that SAC groups may still need supplemental funding because of the restrictions placed on them by program arc. This has yet to be seen,” Malkerson said.
The GUSA Fund was given $15,000 during the spring semester of last year and was allocated another $15,000 for the 2010-2011 school year. At the beginning of the spring semester this year, the fund was allotted another $10,000 in order to finish out the year.
Some GUSA members have also proposed handing over responsibility of the fund to the GUSA Senate, as the fund is currently directed by a board of directors.
GUSA Senator Josh Mogil (SFS ’11) agreed that the GUSA Fund should become part of the senate, describing the current GUSA Fund as underdeveloped.
“The problem is that in [Angert and Kluger’s] rush to create a funding board, they didn’t realize that they need institutional training and advice,” he said. “Student Activities Commission and Center for Student Programs have so many adults there to help and train them because it’s hard work. So I don’t blame the GUSA Fund and all of its people, but I blame the fact that GUSA created something too quickly without the skills they needed to be successful.”
In an interview with The Hoya, current GUSA Fund Chair Yasin Yaqubie (COL ’11) refuted these claims.
“There has been some criticism on how the operations here work, and I would just respond that one of those senators should probably attend one of our meetings and see how open and transparent we are. It’s perhaps the most transparent funding process in this entire university,” Yaqubie said.
But Yaqubie did note that there could be some improvements in order to increase the efficiency of the fund.
According to the current GUSA Fund charter, every allocation over $500 that the board approves must also be approved by the senate body.
“The system as it is currently run is not efficient, because ultimately myself and four other people will spend a few hours each week going through allocations, make that  determination, and then I present [the proposal] to the senate. It becomes as if I have to represent [the proposal] like the club originally presented it to me, so it’s almost doubling the effort,” Yaqubie said.
In order to increase efficiency, Yaqubie suggested that the GUSA Fund run proposals by a smaller body, such as the executive or the Fin/App Committee. He also suggested increasing the $500 threshold.
“$500 may seem like a lot, but when you have proposals upwards of $2000, $500 isn’t that high. I think two years now going there should be enough trust placed within the body to make certain rationales,” Yaqubie said.
Last year, Yaqubie reported that the GUSA Fund was mainly approached by individuals who had specific projects. This year has seen more push by SAC groups, club sports, Lecture Fund and other student groups.
“Lately I feel like the knowledge of GUSA Fund has improved. We’ve been referred to by academic departments, by the student life, by actual funding boards,” Yaqubie said.
Moving forward, Yaqubie suggested increasing the fund’s budget, to the point of doubling it.
“Even with SAFE Reform, I think there is still a vital importance for the GUSA Fund moving forward. There are institutions, there are people who fall through the cracks,” Yaqubie said.
Despite the possible changes in structure, the current GUSA executives intend to keep the fund running.
“Mike and I are committed to maintaining the GUSA Fund or some similar structure that achieves the same end,” Laverriere said.

A military contractor, sued for allegedly selling defective helicopters to the U.S. Army and bringing about the deaths of soldiers in Afghanistan, saw his case dismissed after he invoked what is known as “the state secrets privilege.”
This case is among hundreds of unpublished instances when the state secrets privilege has been used, and for years such invocations went relatively unpublicized.
This week, however, the Georgetown Law Center launched the State Secrets Archives — a major step toward understanding this controversial government maneuver. The new database is considered the first of its kind, currently listing over 160 published and unpublished usages dating back to 2001. The actual secrets that were withheld, however, remain unreleased.
The state secrets privilege is an evidentiary rule that allows the executive branch to withhold documents from legal evidence if their publication could pose a national security threat. The rule gained greater publicity when the Bush administration invoked it after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
Other groups also invoke the rule, which can be particularly concerning, according to associate law professor and acting Director of the Center on National Security Laura Donohue, who has been compiling information for the archive.
“The big surprise is that contractors are using it,” Donohue said. “Contractors have become deeply engaged in our national security infrastructure and are now privy to a lot of information.”
If the evidence withheld is essential to the plaintiff’s case, the suits are often dismissed. Instances of the state secret privilege being invoked include wrongful death, wiretapping and torture, among others.
“There are a number of suits that raise very serious questions,” Donohue said, “and none of these are being litigated because state secrets [privilege] doesn’t allow an alternative.”
Donohue does believe the privilege is conceptually valid, but she calls for either legislative or executive changes to amend its application.
Donohue spent 18 months compiling information about the state secrets privilege. After searching through tens of thousands of legal documents, Donohue published her findings in a Dec. 2011 article in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review titled “The Long Shadow of State Secrets.”
Donohue said she had suspected that published legal information was very incomplete.
“We must only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,” she said. “There must be much more going on here. And it turned out to be true.”
She noted that while some judicial opinions are published, about 80 percent of the appellate court caseload is not. This, as well as briefs, memoranda and court orders, creates a large sphere of state secrets privilege invocations that are often not considered when evaluating the rule’s usage.
The state secrets privilege was formally recognized in a 1953 Supreme Court ruling, but it had been invoked even earlier. Donohue says that there were many usages prior to the Bush era, and she hopes to add them to the archive over time.
Donohue said that the Bush administration did not particularly abuse the rule and only used it when litigation was clearly moving forward. She said the Obama administration has continued to invoke the rule at about the same pace.

After a push by student veterans that lasted more than a year, the university is working toward establishing a full-time coordinator for veterans affairs after hiring a part-time coordinator last month.
David Shearman (SFS ’11), a student veteran who served six years in the army before arriving at Georgetown, was hired for the part-time position on Feb. 23 and officially began his new job the week before spring break.
From his office in Healy Hall, Shearman has been working with prospective students, accepted students and current students who need help with anything from tutoring to paperwork. He even helps recent grads with job placement.
“The basic role is to connect student veterans with the resources they need to succeed at Georgetown,” Shearman said.
Members of the Georgetown University Student Veterans of America have been involved in discussions with the School of Continuing Studies about the possibility of funding a full-time position.
“SCS is exploring a range of options which could include establishing a new position to meet the needs of student veterans, many of whom take advantage of Yellow Ribbon benefits in SCS programs,” said Maggie Moore, a communications officer for the university.
While plans for the new position are still being finalized, veterans celebrated the efforts thus far as an important first step.
“This represents a commitment by the university to step up and do what it needs to do to take care of student veterans,” Shearman said.
One of the key tasks of the new coordinator is to act as a liaison between students and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Erik Brine, president of GUSVA, said he and other officers previously put in around 50 hours a week to help take care of administrative work and provide support to student veterans.
In addition, Brine said that at most schools the position of a certifying officer, who is responsible for confirming that students requesting benefits are enrolled, is a full-time job. Yet for D. Heath Scott, assistant registrar for athletics, veterans affairs and certifications at Georgetown, it is just one of many responsibilities.
“It’s been a year and a half that it’s been our number one priority,” Brine said of the effort to push for a designated administrator.
For now, Scott will remain the certifying officer, but Shearman said he is taking over many other duties that used to be scattered or performed by GUSVA members.
For Barbara Mujica, the faculty adviser for GUSVA and a professor in the department of Spanish and Portuguese, working to enhance the experience of the veterans at Georgetown has been a personal concern of hers.
“There was really nothing for the veterans,” said Mujica, whose son served two tours in Iraq as a member of the Marine Corps.
Shearman said that while there are no official numbers on the total number of veterans attending Georgetown, there are 271 enrolled students currently receiving veterans’ benefits. Mujica estimated that the total number is around twice that.
She said once she began involving GUSVA members in meetings with the administration, things began moving more quickly. Mujica and Brine both said they have never lacked in support from the administration and campus community.
“But sometimes it’s hard to turn support into action,” Brine said.
Mujica said that it was critical to have a full-time position to coordinate programs directed at veterans.
As part of a working group created by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, Mujica has been working to connect with other on-campus organizations that provide services to student veterans. She said the group found that many organizations, such as the Academic Resource Center, Campus Ministry and Health Education Services, offered programs for veterans.
“We weren’t aware of what everyone else is doing,” Mujica said.
Shearman said he is still trying to identify all the places where the office can help by reaching out to other administrators and campus organizations.
“Since I’m the first person in this position, I’m kind of creating it,” he said.
Mujica said the details of the planned full-time position are still being worked out. Ideally, she said the coordinator would be both a veteran and a Georgetown graduate.
For now, the full-time position would likely replace the current part-time post. Eventually, she said the goal is to have an office staffed by a full-time coordinator as well as a part-time program director and supported by students receiving work-study benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Brine said he was cautiously optimistic about the possibility of a full-time position being established.

Georgetown’s Jesuit community will receive a new a leader on July 31, when Rev. Joseph Lingan, S.J., assumes the position of rector — a position held by Fr. John Langan, S.J., for the past five years.
Lingan, the acting president of Gonzaga College High School, a Jesuit school located in D.C., has previously served as novice master for the Maryland, New England and New York Provinces of the Society of Jesus and as rector of St. Michael’s Institute. Lingan was appointed to the Georgetown rector position by the Vatican’s provincial superior; new rectors are appointed every five or six years.
“While I have never previously been missioned to Georgetown, I have always been aware of its prominence among Jesuit universities,” Lingan said in an email. “I am humbled to be asked to serve at Georgetown and look forward to becoming an active member of the university community.”
Langan said that he was pleased by the appointment and does not believe that Lingan’s previous lack of exposure to Georgetown will detract from his work. Langan’s two predecessors were also selected from outside of the Georgetown community.
“I don’t think there will be a dramatic departure from the current role of the rector. I have positive impressions of [Lingan],” he said. “He won’t have major external commitments, which I have had. There are different ways of doing this job. The job is bigger than the skill set most individuals bring into it.”
Langan explained that the rector is an advocate for individual Jesuits and the community as a whole, and daily tasks range from handling finances to individual conversations with other Jesuits.
Langan said that he has had multiple conversations with Lingan via phone, as the latter prepares to transition into his new role. He added that he plans to meet with Lingan to answer any questions his successor may have and introduce him to administrators and other Jesuits at Georgetown.
Lingan said that while he has not yet had a chance to visit Georgetown due to his commitments at Gonzaga, where he is interim president until June, he looks forward to familiarizing himself with the Georgetown community.
“I acknowledge I have a good deal to learn and I look forward to that,” Lingan said in an email. “Since the announcement about my coming to Georgetown was made, I have received several phone calls, emails and notes of congratulations and welcome, which has been wonderful and heartening.”
He added that Langan was among the first to congratulate him on his new role. Langan said that he received a letter from the Vatican in January specifying who his successor
would be.
Langan plans to continue to be an active member of the Georgetown community. He currently serves as Cardinal Bernardin Chair in the Kennedy Institute of Ethics and teaches one course. He will spend the next year in Oxford, England, writing a new book on just war theory, but plans to return in fall 2012 to resume teaching.

The Department of Public Safety has selected Talib Abdur-Rahim as their new crime prevention coordinator. The position, which was created in 2009, focuses on community policing and nontraditional methods for solving crime problems, according to InterHall General Assemblyman Dalvin Butler (COL ’13).
Abdur-Rahim said that he hopes to create positive ties with different parts of the community.
“I applied because I thought and think that I will do a good job in the position, and saw the need for someone who had an inclusive approach and was willing to meet the students and other community members where they are,” Abdur-Rahim wrote in an email. “I believe that it is crucially important that we have trust, respect and communication as a basis in our partnerships.”
Abdur-Rahim came to Georgetown at the beginning of the Fall 2010 semester as a patrol sergeant, and he is transferring to the new position from his role as patrol operations shift supervisor. He previously spent three years as a supervisor at the American University Public Safety Department. He is also working on a master’s degree in International Training and Education.
Butler expressed excitement at Abdur-Rahim’s appointment.
“In this capacity, being responsive and interacting with the Georgetown University community is paramount, and [Abdur-Rahim] plans to score a home run,” Butler wrote in an email.
Butler said the new crime prevention coordinator plans to work with InterHall and other student organizations to ensure safety in residence halls.
DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith also emphasized the community partnerships that will define Abdur-Rahim’s role. The crime prevention coordinator is expected to serve as a liaison officer with student associations, Student Affairs, Residence Life, Off Campus Student Life and Facilities. Such cooperation, Smith said, will serve to involve the greater Georgetown Community and lead to more effective problem-solving using logical thinking and unconventional ideas.
“The anticipated net result is twofold: a reduction or elimination of a crime problem, and the empowerment of our students, faculty and staff to work as equal partners in this process,” Smith wrote in an email.
Smith served as DPS’s first crime prevention coordinator, according to Butler. Abdur-Rahim will replace Sgt. Eric Threlkeld, according to Smith.

Members of the Georgetown community have rapidly mobilized in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan last Saturday, raising over $2,000 for relief efforts and participating in events ranging from prayer services to academic panels.
Georgetown University’s Japan Network, the student group leading relief efforts thus far, began planning efforts at an emergency meeting Sunday after members had returned from spring break. The organization has been tabling in Red Square this week in order to solicit donations and plans to continue doing so next week.
J-NET Secretary Shannon Munayyer (COL ’11) said she was impressed by the $2,000 received so far from students and faculty.
“They just surprise us sometimes,” she said.
J-NET is also planning a letters and prayers campaign, in which they will collect contributions written in English and Japanese. They hope to compile these works into an online blog to provide comfort to the disaster victims.
The group is also pairing up with the Japanese-American Student Union of D.C., a coalition of Japanese-American students from six universities in the area. JASU will be selling “Hope for Japan” wristbands, sending heart-shaped cards to the Red Cross and creating videos of encouragement in Japanese.
“The most important thing is for the people in Japan to know that people across the world … really care for them. … I want this event and for our efforts to help,” said Kazu Koyama, the president of JASU and a student at The George Washington University.
Other groups on campus have also rallied in support of the victims. The Corp has decided to donate all tips and proceeds from the Drink of the Month at all locations to the Japan Relief Project. Hoya Innovation, an on-campus group comprised of students, faculty and alumni that hopes to address the needs of the Georgetown community with creative ideas, will be launching a 1,000 Paper Crane project next Friday. One proposal on the table is that the cranes be sent to the Japanese embassy in Washington, D.C., in order to emphasize the university’s connection to the local community.
“It’s showing how much we are with our community and how they are a part of our community,” project coordinator Jamil Poonja (COL ’12) said.
The administration has also responded to the crisis by sponsoring various events around campus. The Office of Campus Ministry held a service Tuesday featuring prayers in the Shinto, Buddhist and Christian faiths to show respect for and solidarity with the victims of the natural disasters. About 100 students, including Georgetown University Student Association President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12), were in attendance alongside Provost University James O’Donnell and Associate Vice President Jeanne Lord.
Prayers were conducted in both English and Japanese. Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., executive director of Campus Ministry, opened the service on a somber note.
“This is a time of great sorrow and suffering and uncertainty,” he said.
University President John J. DeGioia then addressed the crowd, expressing sympathy for those affected by the disasters and emphasized the idea of solidarity and love within Georgetown.
The university also worked with J-NET, as well as the Georgetown International Relations Club to sponsor an academic panel on the natural disasters in Japan. “A Town Hall on Japan: The Earthquake and Its Aftermath” was held Thursday in McShain Lounge, sponsored by the Mortara Center for International Studies and the Asian Studies National Resource Center.
The panelists all stressed Japan’s demonstrated resilience and the potential dangers to the Japanese economy, environment and people in an academic and humanitarian manner.
“We are here as a community in compassion but also as a community of scholars,” said Michael Green, associate professor of international affairs and Japan chair of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
The panelists also emphasized the necessity of continuing to pay attention to the nation.
“It is important for us to think about the psychological, emotional and spiritual needs of those affected,” said panelist Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., assistant professor of government.
Other academic programs, including the East Asian Languages and Cultures department, have also been instrumental in responding to the crisis in Japan. The program is planning to organize department and alumni donations in the coming weeks, according to department Chair Jordan Sand.
Georgetown’s Center for Social Justice, Research, Teaching and Service will be responsible for collecting the money raised by on-campus organizations and determining which relief fund to donate to. The CSJ is also serving as the bridge between student groups, faculty and alumni who want to contribute to relief efforts through the Jesuit University Humanitarian Action Network. JUHAN is supervised by the CSJ, the School of Foreign Service and the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship. The organization serves as an adviser for relief efforts events, rather than a creator and planner of them.
The CSJ has been contacted by a variety of student groups, including the Hindu Student Association and individual alumni who are interested in participating in on-campus efforts.
“They, just like everyone else, are trying to figure out how they can help,” said Suzanne Tarlov, associate director of CSJ.
The CSJ is also providing assistance to Georgetown students who live or have studied in Japan. The center does not plan to put on any independent events but has suggested a possible teleconference with Japanese alumni.
The greater Georgetown community has also turned out to support the victims of the disaster. Local bakery Georgetown Cupcake is donating 100 percent of its online and in-store sales of their Red Velvet cupcakes Tuesday to the American Red Cross’ Japan Earthquake and Pacific Tsunami fund. The store has raised more than $7,000, according to Kim Reynolds, senior account executive of TLCommunications.
JASU will also be holding a fundraiser this Sunday at Café Asia in Rosslyn, Va., from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. The event will feature a performance by local traditional Japanese group Nen Daiko, and all proceeds from sales at the restaurant during the event will be donated to JASU’s Japan Relief Project.
The 9.0 magnitude earthquake first shook the Tohuku region of the Pacific Ocean after originating off the coast of Japan early Friday morning. The aftershocks of the earthquake were followed by a tsunami, which ravaged the Pacific coastline of Japan’s northern islands. Damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility has caused failures in the plant’s cooling systems, leading to the release of radiation that has led Japan to call for the evacuation of citizens living within 12.4 miles of the site. Georgetown students in Japan are leaving the country following a recommendation by the Office of International Programs.
