Two people were killed Monday in Venezuela as thousands continue to protest against President Nicolas Maduro’s government, which continues to be engulfed by political scandals and an economic recession.
The latest deaths bring the total number of people killed due to political unrest in April to 21, according to BBC News. The past month has seen a series of protests, politically-motivated shootings and clashes between security forces and protestors after a March 29 Supreme Court decision, reversed April 1, to strip legislative authority from the opposition-controlled National Assembly.
Since his contested election in 2013, Maduro has been unwilling to negotiate with the opposition and most international organizations, including the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund.
The Hoya sat down April 17 with Secretary General of the Organization of American States Luis Almagro,  one of the few international leaders who has met with Maduro.
Since taking office two years ago, Almagro has taken an active role in denouncing and countering Venezuela’s troubling practices, including documenting the Maduro government’s malfeasances in a 132-page dossier and calling for a referendum to recall Maduro.
In an interview with The Hoya, Almagro discussed the current situation in Venezuela and laid out his expectations for the future of democracy in the country.
What does the situation in Venezuela represent for the development of democracy in Latin America?
The situation in Venezuela is a major setback in the development of democracy in the American continent. First, because Venezuela is a country that had maintained a democratic tradition and during the ’70s and ’80s, Venezuelan governments assumed very strong positions in claiming democracies in the Southern Cone, which was experiencing dictatorships at the time.
It is a significant setback because, in general, the left should already have this conceptualization resolved. The left can and should only be democratic. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, there was no more space for the left to assume totalitarian or authoritarian syndromes. The case of Cuba remained isolated, with a process that hinted to an eventual opening.
However, with Venezuela practically violating, in its entirety, the principles of the Inter-American Democratic Charter, which represent the principles and values ​​of democracy, has caused a revival of the conceptual debate over a left that is not democratic on the continent, and that means a tremendous ideological setback for many of the leftist parties in Latin America.
What role has the OAS played in recent years in Venezuela? What has been the general disposition of the Venezuelan regime towards the OAS?
What the OAS has done during the time I have been here is to mobilize its efforts so that the regime no longer has impunity. The regime must assume its responsibilities and we have worked to end the impunity it currently exercises in relation to democracy and human rights violations. These efforts have relied on our two voluminous reports exposing the political, social and economic situation in Venezuela.
The Venezuelan regime has openly said very bad things about the OAS, and — something even more worrisome — has personally targeted the Secretary General, which is simply inadmissible. The regime has continuously expressed certain negative feelings and emotions to the work that has been carried out by the OAS in Venezuela. Venezuela is part of the recent Permanent Council resolution that discusses the country’s constitutional order violations, placing the Venezuelan issue very high on the OAS agenda.
Does Latin America continue to be a hospitable region for authoritarian regimes like the one in Venezuela?
There is very little space in Latin America for democratic countries coexisting with undemocratic ones. In a time in which societies and political governments have significantly strengthened, there is very little space for a path — a closed, authoritarian path — such as the one that has been paved by the Venezuelan regime.
In the future, the OAS will have to play an even larger role in Venezuela by dealing with the problems the country is facing: mainly, the lack of separation and independence of powers, the co-optation of the judiciary branch by the executive power, the oppression of the National Assembly, the existence of political prisoners and the humanitarian crisis itself. All these issues, we have to resolve them to help Venezuela regain its democracy.
What are the main instruments of the OAS to address the current crisis in Venezuela?
The OAS has requested the application of Article 20, which allows the Secretary General, or any state, to take the initiative regarding the constitutional order violations in Venezuela. Article 20 contains a series of procedures that are actually very constructive: diplomatic efforts, joint resolutions and other means seeking shared solutions with the country that is violating the Inter-American Democratic Charter.
When none of this works, there is the penultimate step, which would be the suspension of the country from the OAS framework. We hope that the gradual character of these measures and the progressive pressure they can create will allow for the reforms Venezuela needs.
You have stated that the solution to the crisis “must be for and by the Venezuelans.” How will the OAS reconcile this wish with the current democracy and human rights violations in the country?
To make a dictatorship fall, two types of pressures must be exercised. The first is the external pressure, which is the series of sanctions by which the international community condemns the acts of the Venezuelan government. Over time, the sentences have been very clear, condemning the government’s political disqualifications, repression, exile of political prisoners and weakening of the National Assembly. All this is part of a greater pressure that establishes that the international community does not accept these anti-democratic practices in Venezuela.
The second is internal pressure. The dismantling of a dictatorship requires forceful internal pressure. The OAS has no intervention forces and its aim is not an invasion or an intervention. It is about getting the Venezuelans to vote. So, the internal pressure, the people marching on the streets asking for democracy and elections as it is happening now — that is the substantial element.
It’s about letting the people vote. Sovereignty lies in the people. When a state, in this case a regime, represses and silences the opposition, it is silencing the only sovereign voice the country has. Ergo, that country is losing its sovereignty. Venezuela is under a scheme of authoritarianism that lacks any rule of law. Sovereignty lies in the people and to give sovereignty back to the country there must be elections — that is the only way forward.
In relation to the future of the country, what does the situation of Venezuela mean for young Latin Americans?
No one can want their children to grow up in a dictatorship environment. I grew up in a dictatorship environment from the age of 10 to 21. The Venezuelan dictatorship is taking away the possibility to decide their own future from the youngsters. If you are young, you get to decide your future. The future is yours, it belongs to the youth.
The Venezuelan youth is assuming this commitment to act to protect the country’s future. It is a commitment that has a lot of generosity, drawing much tension and intention from the inside. The young man who faces the state’s repressive apparatus today is putting aside a comfort zone, but he knows that this comfort zone means having a life with no future, no perspective on tomorrow, because now, what can Venezuela offer to its youth? What is the prospect of a country that does not have vaccines for its people, does not have medicines to treat basic diseases, does not have food to ensure fundamental nutrition? From there, what kind of perspective of life can you construct?
The young are the driving force of change. Young people mean the hope of the country, and young Venezuelans have assumed a responsibility to their country, despite the tear gas dropped at them from helicopters, despite the snipers waiting on the roofs. The fact that the youth still has the courage to confront the regime means that the country still has a desire of democracy and has not reached the most abject stage of “Cubanization,” which is the worst condition in which a political system in Latin America could find itself nowadays.
What are the expectations about the future of democracy in Venezuela and the role of the OAS in the conflict?
The role of the OAS will continue to demand for democracy in Venezuela and for the better functioning of democracy in all countries across the American continent. The OAS will strive to ensure the protection and validity of human rights in Venezuela specifically, but also in relation to the rest of the continent.
Venezuela is a case of current crisis, and that is why it is such a serious concern for the Organization. While dialogue is the key instrument of democracy, this means that there must be a democratic spirit for there to be dialogue. The priority today is to restore democracy and dialogue.

The Georgetown University Student Association officially signed on to a regional student government coalition’s Student Association Statement of Support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Obama-era program that allows children brought into the country without documentation to receive deferred action waivers or work permits March 23.
GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) signed the Statement of Support on behalf of GUSA. The statement was written by members of the Student Leadership Alliance, a group started by the Federal and D.C. Relations Committee of GUSA with a national and local arm that brings together student leaders from across the country.
The statement notes the DACA program directly benefits some undocumented Georgetown students by allowing them to attend the university without fear of deportation. It also argues many undocumented students have integrated into the community.
“Undocumented students attending institutions of higher education across the nation are feeling vulnerable as the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program remains uncertain,” the statement read. “As leaders and members of our university communities, we stand together with all of our students, and believe that every student should have the opportunity to pursue their learning objectives without fear of deportation.”
The statement asks U.S. House of Representatives and Senate leaders to support the Bar Removal of Individuals Who Dream and Grow Our Economy Act, which would extend the DACA program for three more years. The BRIDGE Act is meant to continue the program until comprehensive immigration reform can be achieved in the future.
“We exhort our respective university administrations to continue to support and uphold DACA on your campus and in your community,” the statement read. “Together, we will continue to create an environment of support for those students who feel unsure of their futures in this country and at their university.”
Student Leadership Alliance Executive Director Allie Gurwitz (COL ’19) said the Student Leadership Alliance will give the Statement of Support to other universities outside Washington, D.C., to sign later this spring.
“We will be sending this statement out to the rest of the schools in our network soon along with additional materials so that each campus involved can do their own advocacy,” Gurwitz wrote in an email to The Hoya.
University President John J. DeGioia had previously signaled his support for maintaining the DACA program in an email to the Georgetown community.
DeGioia announced initiatives to conduct training sessions for immigrant students on their rights if they are detained and advocacy for comprehensive immigration reform April 3.
Other schools in the D.C. branch of the Student Leadership Alliance, known as the D.C. Consortium of Schools, include Georgetown, George Washington University, American University, Catholic University, Howard University and Gallaudet University. So far, only these D.C. Consortium schools have signed the Statement of Support.
Zac Schroepfer (MSB ’19), the founding director of the Student Leadership Alliance, said the organization works to help students who could be negatively affected by national legislation. The Student Leadership Alliance is officially nonpartisan.
“[Repealing] DACA would have an extraordinarily bad effect on our campus, as well as many other campuses around the United States,” Schroepfer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As I said earlier, the SLA aims to advocate for students, not take a ‘political side’ or choose between parties.”
Schroepfer said Georgetown, as a Jesuit university, has an obligation to help students who would otherwise be discouraged from applying to the university as a result of the DACA program’s protections for students without documentation ending. He said Georgetown would be a less diverse institution if DACA were ended by President Donald Trump.
“Georgetown University is a university that aims to embrace the Jesuit value of a community in diversity,” Schroepfer wrote. “This means bringing people from ALL backgrounds, from across the country and the world, to our campus to study, engage in dialogue about our society, and form their thoughts to allow them to be more productive and altruistic servant leaders as global citizens.”
Gurwitz said Trump’s actions have made undocumented students at universities, including Georgetown, feel less safe. As a result, Mack’s signing of the Statement of Support should help them know that their community supports them.
“Looking at this issue from a student perspective is extremely important, as undocumented students are beginning to feel less and less safe on campuses across the country,” Gurwitz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The repeal of DACA would be detrimental for the community of undocumented young adults who wish to pursue a higher education.”
The Hoya reported April 4 following DeGioia’s email on 50 members of the Georgetown community attending a candlelight vigil in Red Square on April 3.
D.C. Consortium Director Henry Callander (COL ’18) said he thinks the statement may help student morale on the DACA issue.
“Hopefully we can make the statement that this is really an important program and we don’t want it to be cut,” Callander said.

Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, left a Georgetown International Project on Cyber Engagement panel on “fake news” and propaganda yesterday 20 minutes before it was scheduled to end after heated exchanges with a group of students protesting his invitation.
Gorka was scheduled to depart the panel before 1:30 p.m., according to event organizers who moved the question-and-answer session forward to accommodate audience questions.
Gorka’s invitation to the seventh annual summit on the challenges of cyberspace, held by the Cyber Project, a School of Foreign Service graduate program, came into question by a group of student demonstrators, many of them members of the Jewish and Muslim communities, due to Gorka’s alleged connections to Hungarian neo-Nazi group Vitézi Rend and his positions on the Muslim community and religious profiling.
Students met privately with SFS Senior Associate Dean Anthony Arend (SFS ’80) the previous night to voice their concerns about inviting Gorka to speak at campus, given his views toward Islam and Judaism.
The demonstrators, who were not part of a formal group, gathered in protest outside the Leavey Conference Center event room prior to the 12:30 p.m. panel and stood toward the back of the room during the panel. Some held posters with messages opposing Gorka’s invitation, including “Gorka’s gotta go” and “reject anti-Semitism.”
After tense and raised-voice responses to four of the demonstrators’ questions during a question-and-answer period, Gorka left the panel at 1:27 p.m. before it was scheduled to end at 1:45 p.m. Gorka did not say why he was leaving, but said he would let other panelists answer questions.
“I am going to allow my colleagues to actually get questions about the issues on the table,” Gorka said, just before gathering his things and leaving.
Several media outlets, including Talking Points Memo and The Hill, reported that Gorka left out of exasperation at the protests and questions. A university spokesperson disputed this account, saying organizers told the university that Gorka informed them he would be leaving early prior to the event.
Cyber Project Director Catherine Lotrionte, who organized the event, said Gorka informed her of his early departure prior to the event.
“Mr. Gorka told me prior to the panel that he would have to leave at 1:30 p.m,” Lotrionte wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I informed the moderator of the panel.”
Arend said he was also informed of Gorka’s schedule change 15 minutes before the start of the event.
“I was told about 15 minutes or so before the panel began that Mr. Gorka would have to leave at 1:30.” Arend wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our moderator was also aware of this early departure, and she began Q&A early in order to make sure there was ample time to be able to ask questions of the entire panel before his departure.”
In an interview with The Hoya, SFS Dean Joel Hellman said he was unaware of any prior plans for Gorka to leave early.
“I have no idea why he personally left. We made it very clear that if he was going to be in the panel, that we insist as we do with all these events, that he take questions from students and that students be given access to the room,” Hellman said. “He didn’t give us any explanation for why he left. I was told by somebody that he had a plane to catch. He didn’t mention that publicly.”
Hellman said he would not have chosen to invite Gorka himself, but that his invitation allowed students to confront him with their views.
“I would not have invited him, because I do not believe he had the expertise that I think was needed for that conference. My own view is that he does have a reputation for bombastic comments and chauvinistic views, in particular with reference to Islam. I think he has a history of troubling statements,” Hellman said. “But I think once he was invited, this was an opportunity for students to tell him exactly how they interpreted his remarks, and they did that.”
Gorka, who was hired to work on foreign policy by Trump in January, was first tied to neo-Nazis by a March report in The Forward, after a photo surfaced of Gorka wearing a medal associated with neo-Nazi connected group Vitézi Rend. Gorka strongly rebuked the protesters’ allegations of his involvement with the group, saying at the event he wore the medal in honor of his parents, who were imprisoned and tortured by the Nazi and communist regimes they resisted.
He said that the medal was awarded to his father by the Order of the Vitéz, a western, anti-communist organization that shared its name with an older organization. He said this story was turned against him due to his connection to the Trump administration and said the protestors were victims of fake news.
“Today, because I work for somebody named Donald J. Trump, that fact is used as part of a fake propaganda campaign that brought those people at the back of the room sadly to a point where they are the victims of fake news,” Gorka said. “Every single person holding a placard to protest my parents and myself, I challenge you now, go away and look at everything that I’ve said and written in the last 46 years of my life and find one sentence that is anti-Semitic or that is anti-Israeli.”
Gorka echoed press criticism by Trump and other administration members, casting himself as a victim of biased reporting. Trump has frequently tweeted criticism of major news media, including The New York Times, and called for tightening libel laws to be able to sue newspapers for false reports.
Andrew Meshnick (COL ’17), a member of the Jewish community on campus and one of the demonstrators, questioned Gorka about false claims by the Trump administration. Gorka refused to answer and challenged the validity of the question. Meshnick said after the panel ended that he was disappointed by Gorka’s unwillingness to engage with the students constructively.
“I was shocked that Mr. Gorka was so combative with his questioners. He was so uncomfortable answering questions and having his views subjected to public scrutiny. He was so uncomfortable that he left halfway through it and the gap in the middle of the stage spoke volumes,” Meshnick said. “He couldn’t even stand up to a bunch of 20-year-olds with signs and facts.”
Director for Jewish Life Rabbi Rachel Gartner praised the students for uniting for a common cause and engaging with the speaker.
“I was impressed with our students’ strength and perseverance and bravery, because it’s hard to do what they did,” Gartner said.
Gartner also commended the SFS for giving the students the opportunity and the encouragement to question Gorka.
“I want to commend them for their responsiveness and their going above and beyond and making it very clear to GUPD and to the students themselves that they wanted them to have the space to ask them any questions. In fact, they encouraged them to do so,” Gartner said.
“I think that’s really important too. It was a beautiful moment to feel like every part of Georgetown — campus ministry and university administration and students — rose to this occasion and came together in a very mature and caring way for each other.”
Aly Panjwani (SFS ’19), a member of the Muslim community on campus and one of the demonstrators, said that the event showcased the strong relationship between Georgetown’s Jewish and Muslim students, who grew closer as a result of the political climate ushered in by Trump’s rhetoric.
“This was a very good example of us really coming together for our collective liberation,” Panjwani said. “The same racist and bigoted ideas that affect the Muslim community also affect the Jewish community, so they go hand-in-hand. It was really powerful to see us come together for the same cause.”

I am not familiar with Gorka or any organization that he is alleged to be affiliated with. What are the troubling statements he supposedly made that the student’s had issues with? Why would he be “combative” if he were treated like a guest? Why would the university subject a guest speaker to protester’s? It couldn’t possibly be that he works for Trump?
This article leaves more questions than answers and if the man left because he was shouted down or felt intimidated than shame on Georgetown. People have the right to have a different opinion. It’s called freedom of speech which is in short supply on today’s college campuses!

Aging Hoya says 
April 25, 2017 at 3:55 pm
So, has anyone taken him up on the challenge to find inappropriate things that he’s said or written?

Mike Flynn says 
April 25, 2017 at 8:44 pm
Of course not! The students believe in free speech if it fits their political profile. Why wouldn’t Gorka be combative when confronted by abusive students holding a sign with a swaztika on it? They hate him because he is a “TRUMP” adviser and are still in denial that they lost the election.

Students can use academic research to promote the interests of marginalized groups and the working poor, according to panelists at the “Work, Organize, Struggle: Student Perspectives” conference hosted in Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Hall on April 24.
“Scholarship can intersect with activism,” Director of African and African American Studies Program at Towson University Donn Worgs said in a keynote address. “I think as scholars we ought to be engaged in thinking about what people actually do but also thinking about having a practical impact — our ideas being relevant to what people are doing on the ground.”
Undergraduate students presented their research on issues of systemic violence, social justice, community organizing and radicalism at the conference, which was organized by Vincent DeLaurentis (SFS ’17)  in conjunction with the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor. The conference included four panels, each with a focus on different aspects of working struggles.
Besides serving as a platform for students to display their academic work, the conference sought to inspire attendees to take part in the liberation of oppressed peoples, according to DeLaurentis.
DeLaurentis stressed the importance of the students’ work in his opening remarks.
“I hope this conference will spark an expansion in the number of students doing social justice-oriented academic work on campus,” DeLaurentis said. “I believe the types of scholarly interventions you will hear today are important now more so than ever.”
DeLaurentis also emphasized the importance of bringing conversations about labor and the working poor to college campuses, as mainstream liberal thought tends to align with capitalist class politics.
“Students and professors must be willing to defend the university from this right word in neo-liberal trend,” DeLaurentis said. “We must also work together to build a university that produces thought capable of supporting community solidarity and collective liberation.”
Worgs further contextualized the students’ scholarship as a form of productive engagement, which he defined as people providing their own resources and efforts to produce a public good or service for a community. He said through productive engagement, scholars could transcend the academic value of their work and make important political statements.
Worgs also discussed the importance of performing social research for altruistic motives rather than solely for career advancement.
“There is a struggle to not be exploitative. We can be rewarded when people tell us their sob stories,” Worgs said. “Are we there because we really want to help folks and we want to transform the world, or is it just an activism tourism? Just a training ground for our careers, testing ground for our theories?”
The first panel, titled “Community Solidarity, Popular Struggle,” included presentations on marginalized groups around the world and how they have come together throughout history to achieve recognition of their rights.
Obed Ventura (SFS ’19), who moderated the panel, highlighted the overarching theme of struggle by the oppressed.
“In all these cases, struggle means fighting the existing structure in order to create a better world for the marginalized among us and at times, ourselves,” Ventura said. “It also means demanding space in a world that often denies or distorts narratives of the oppressed.”
Barbara Anne Kozee (SFS ’17), who presented her research on the challenges, successes and conditions of community organizing in urban Latin America, said she intended to identify useful strategies for mobilization.
“I tried to use the different struggles and successes to create a larger framework of how we can view community organizing — what worked, what didn’t work and what we can take into the future,” Kozee said.
In a final reflection on the role of academia in the struggle against oppression, Worgs quoted Spanish poet Antonio Machado’s “We Make the Road by Walking,” saying it encompassed the function of scholarship in activism.
“Wanderer, your footsteps are the road, and nothing more; wanderer, there is no road, the road is made by walking,” Worgs quoted. “By walking one makes the road, and upon glancing behind one sees the path that never will be trod again.”

The March for Science drew tens of thousands of marchers, including Georgetown students, to the National Mall on Saturday in support of science and in protest of policies of President Donald Trump’s administration that critics consider anti-science.
The protest, corresponding with National Earth Day celebrations, was accompanied by more than 600 concurrent “satellite marches” on all seven continents and included scientists, environmental activists, students and other science advocates.
A roster of speakers in scientific fields invigorated protestors at a rally, stressing the importance of science in solving key issues like climate change, prior to a march from the Washington Monument to the U.S. Capitol Building.
The march takes place in the context of a series of actions by Trump’s administration that have been criticized for hindering research funded by the federal government.
The administration’s proposed budget included cuts to the National Institute of Health and the Department of Energy’s Office of Science. Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt has also expressed skepticism about the role of human activity in climate change.
Rachelle Bonja (SFS ’20), who participated in the march, said she finds it unfathomable that many Americans, even in the present day, do not take scientific findings seriously.
“I went because I think it is outrageous that it is 2017 and some people can still question scientific evidence,” Bonja wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Also, I think it is important to just show up because every person at these protests makes a difference.”
Bonja said she was impressed with the determination of the marchers despite persistent rain throughout the march.
“The crowd was extremely devoted. I was so surprised with how many people showed up given the rain,” Bonja wrote. “Everyone was marching with their umbrellas and ponchos and they kept going.”
Anna Braendle (COL ’19) also attended the march and said she was inspired by the crowd of passionate pro-science advocates marching with her.
“The individuals in the crowd ranged from those that had earned PhDs and MDs to people that simply understood the need to advance science and were willing to stand in the pouring rain to make their voices heard,” Braendle wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I had never been among so many people that felt the same passion for science as I did. Without science there would be no cancer survivors or beer.”
As a science student at Georgetown, Braendle said she enjoyed taking action on what she has learned in the classroom.
“Since beginning my science studies here, I have learned more and more about the importance of research and the application of science. Science is for everyone,” Braendle wrote. “When a government threatens to take away the funding of something that affects so many aspects of our human life, usually for the better, I felt the urge to do something about it.”
Another marcher, Alice Beneke (COL ’19), said her passion for her minor led her to attend the march.
“I decided to attend the March for Science because as someone who is pursuing a minor in biology and hopefully a healthcare profession one day, science is a huge part of my daily life,” Beneke wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Expressing her disappointment thus far with the Trump administration’s stance on science, Bonja said she remained hopeful that the March for Science would make a difference.
“I have been disappointed with the current administration, and it makes me happy to see that people are not silently accepting their fate,” Bonja wrote. “I know that if the resistance keeps going and people continue to be vocal about things that matter to them, there will be a difference in policy-making.”
Braendle came away from the march with optimism about science’s strong base of supporters and advocates.
“These events demonstrate that other people have the same frustrations that I have. It shows me that while maybe the current government doesn’t understand the importance of science, there are still many other people that do,” Braendle wrote. “Together we can make a difference for what we believe in.”

A female Georgetown student was assaulted while walking alone on the 3300 block of N Street around 2:44 a.m on Friday, April 21.
The Metropolitan Police Department arrested the suspect after a SafeRides van driver spotted the suspect and after GUPD conducted a search for the suspect after the student contacted police.
MPD charged the suspect, 22-year-old Tejeda Hernandez-Chrispin, with assault with intent to commit first-degree sexual assault after being apprehended and the suspect remains in police custody.
The incident follows an event held last Wednesday by the Sexual Misconduct Task Force, a team consisting of students, faculty and staff working on recommendations to address sexual misconduct on campus, to address the 2016 Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey’s findings and recommendations to expand mandatory sexual assault education and increase student education on effective bystander intervention.
MPD officers apprehended and arrested a suspect for third-degree sexual assault on Sept. 18. That arrest came after a series of four sexual assaults in the Georgetown area reported between Aug. 3 and Sept. 12.
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said students need to be aware of resources that can help reduce the risk of off-campus assaults.
“Students need to be acutely aware that they live in a major metropolitan city and need to take a stake in their own security when they are on, and especially off campus,” Gruber said in an interview with The Hoya. “Students should take advantage of resources such as LiveSafe, SafeRides, student guard safety escort program, Uber and walk in groups in well-lit areas.”
Students who have experienced harassment or assault say it is that important attitudes regarding sexual assault on campus improve so victims speak up and have a strong support system from fellow students and faculty.
Maria-Jose Nebreda (MSB ’19) said she experienced a similar incident in October in which bystanders chose not to intervene in the case of an assault.
Nebreda said she had been walking alone at night from Booeymonger restaurant to LXR Hall when several men in a car shouted sexual insults and threatened to rape her.
When she saw a group of male Georgetown students, she walked in their direction, expecting them to help her out of the situation.
“Before I could reach them, the men in the car sped up to them and said, ‘Turn around and wave at this girl, we called her sexy and she called us sexist,’” Nebreda said. “And before I knew it I had 20 Georgetown boys laughing and waving at me, alongside the men who had assaulted me, leaving me no choice but to continue walking by myself while the car sped back to me and assaulted me my whole way back.”
Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17), co-chair of the Sexual Misconduct Task Force, said education for witnesses of sexual assault must increase to improve knowledge of how to intervene on or off campus.
The Hoya previously reported Oct. 28 that Georgetown Health Education Services purchased “Bringing in the Bystander,” an education curriculum focused on educating witnesses on what to do in the case of a sexual assault in response to the release of the university’s Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey on June 16.
Former President Barack Obama endorsed the program in a 2014 report from the White House’s Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault and again in 2017 and it is now mandatory for three leaders of every university-recognized student group to participate in training.
However, Hinerfeld said she believes information on bystander intervention needs to be available to all students.
“The task force is recommending that all students receive the ‘Bringing in the Bystander’ training in their freshman year going forward,” Hinerfeld said. “We are recommending the exploration of a mandatory first-year course — that could be one way to reach all students — and we’re also looking at incorporating it into NSO. Hopefully that kind of action can make a difference in these cases.”
Hinerfeld noted the importance of GUPD’s role in providing support for the victim and preventing the perpetrator from assaulting yet another student.
“In terms of this incident, I think it shows the importance of having well-trained GUPD staff, an officer having identified the perpetrator of Friday’s assault. We are recommending further training for GUPD to ensure they are informed in their approach and have the skills to deal with survivors of sexual assault,” Hinerfeld said.
