Professor Alan Confino discussed his book “A World Without Jews: The Nazi Imagination from Persecution to Genocide” and provided insight on the psychological basis of the Nazi consciousness Wednesday afternoon in the Mortara Center. The event, sponsored by sponsored by the Program for Jewish Civilization, featured Confino, who teaches at the University of Virginia and Ben-Gurion University in Israel, and discussed how the Nazis were motivated more by religious than racial motivations.
The Rev. Dennis McManus, S.J., a faculty member in the Program for Jewish Civilization, introduced Confino. McManus said that Confino’s work explores a different angle on the Holocaust than have numerous past studies, an angle that is crucial in order to completely understand the Nazi worldview.
“Something is missing from these studies, something that helps us understand the deepest levels of the Nazi mind and where the devastating image of the Jew comes from, how it is nourished and developed into the cultivation of hate towards Jews,” McManus said. “Perhaps it is within the bounds of social psychology that Professor Confino has opened up a great new door for us to understand.”
Confino began by mentioning the historical episodes of Nazis burning the Hebrew Bible in the front of German synagogues. “Recent accounts of the Third Reich do not address why the Nazis burned the Hebrew Bible,” Confino said. “This is because they regard racial ideology as the fundamental source of the motivation and the beliefs that led to the Holocaust. In burning the Bible, the Nazis directed their wrath against the religious and not racial symbol.”
In his book Confino questions what Nazis told themselves in order to legitimize the persecution and extermination of Jews. “When you are killing someone or a lot of someones you need a good story to go along with it,” Confino said. “No one likes to admit themselves to be the bad guy who is killing all these people for no reason. Most of us, even when we do bad things, we try to find a good reason to explain ourselves.”
Confino also discussed how the relationship between space and time in putting together the full spectrum of events in the Holocaust. “The category of space has become really important because scholars have become very aware, through colonial studies, that the Nazis built an empire in Europe,” Confino said. “The Nazi empire was a vast organization, especially towards the East. The Nazis wanted to colonize the East and use the people as slaves and use the resources of the land. This assessment has been very important, but there is something very important missing from the picture, which is the element of time.”
Confino then emphasized how his work distinguishes itself from other pieces on the history of the Holocaust. “I reject the dominant interpretation of racial ideology as the main motivation of the Nazis,” Confino said. “The Nazi imagination towards the Jews was more complex and it includes many other ideas.”
At the end of his presentation, Confino addressed how the Nazis read into the past in order to construct their dangerous narrative. He said that the Nazis picked and chose symbolic stories from the history of Jewish, Germanic and Christian relations that redefined understanding of national origins.
“Nazis built their identity, using present day ideas, mixing and matching, creating stories about themselves, based on facts, inventions and imagination,” Confino said.” Telling stories makes us feel human, but not all stories are humane. Stories give life and stories kill as well.”
Giulia Martins (SFS’18) attended the event and said she appreciated the ideas Confino presented.
“It is always refreshing to be exposed to ideas which differ to what we regularly see in history textbooks,” Martins said. “Professor Confino’s work is groundbreaking in the sense that it looks at the Holocaust through a completely different lens, one which assesses different factors which many other historians might have overlooked. I found his perspective to be fascinating”

As the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility votes on fossil fuel divestment today, GU Fossil Free will continue its campaign in preparation for its meeting with the university’s board of directors in February.
The divestment proposal by GU Fossil Free calls for the university to divest its holdings from the 200 largest fossil fuel companies. The 12 voting members of CISR will vote to determine whether they will recommend the proposal to the board of directors.
CISR, which is made up of four students, three professors and five university administrators, votes on written proposals from Georgetown community members and makes recommendations on socially responsible investment to the university’s board of directors.
GU Fossil Free will be holding a rally today at Red Square at 9:15 a.m. to demonstrate student support for divestment before the committee votes between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m .
GU Fossil Free member Chloe Lazarus (COL ’16) said that she hopes the rally will convince CISR members to recognize divestment as a course of action that reflects the university’s Jesuit values.
“We are framing the [rally] as a marriage between the CISR and Georgetown’s values,” Lazarus said. “Georgetown holds its Catholic and Jesuit values highly and we believe divestment from these top 200 fossil fuel companies will make Georgetown follow its core principles.”
According to GU Fossil Free and CISR member Caroline James (COL ’16), the committee will most likely vote against divestment for fiduciary reasons. CISR has been working with GU Fossil Free to develop their proposal for almost two years. Other members of CISR declined to comment before the vote.
“I’m anticipating a ‘no’ vote with the exception of one or two ‘yes’s … which disappoints me,” James said. “Based on our dialogue with CISR so far … I think where they are feeling conflicted is in whether or not it’s moral to move so much money around, and if there is in any event the [risk of the] endowment being hurt if we were to divest.”
However, James said that most voting members in CISR are in agreement with GU Fossil Free’s reasons for divestment.
“It doesn’t seem to me that anyone doubts the moral implications of what we’re saying, being that investing in companies that are directly hurting many disadvantaged populations and destroying ecosystems around the world is a bad thing,” James said.
Approximately 10 percent of Georgetown’s endowment fund, which consists of $1.2 billion, is invested in fossil fuel companies. However, James expects a larger portion of the fund to be affected after divestment because many of the companies are in mutual funds with Georgetown, which would force the university to divest from the entirety of the funds. The university’s Investment Office also declined to comment before the vote. The Georgetown University Student Investment, a student group that manages over $500,000 of the university’s endowment, also declined to comment on the issue.
“Because of the way that commingled funds work, a lot of these funds are not simply invested directly in various companies. Rather, they are invested in larger funds that happen to include fossil fuel stock,” James said. “While I can’t give the exact number, it would be a much greater amount than 10 percent of the divestment.”
Despite the financial burden that divestment could place on the endowment, James said that GU Fossil Free has presented a list of alternatives to investing in fossil fuels.
“We very much do not think that divestment would be hurtful to the endowment. In fact, we think that it could be helpful because, with plummeting oil prices, the energy sector isn’t doing so hot lately.” James said. “In fact, a growing number of funds managers are now offering fossil free funds. So it would not at all be impossible to move those funds around.”
Center for the Environment Director Edward Barrows stressed the urgency of divesting from fossil fuel companies and investing in alternative energy.
“I personally think [that] humanity should move to investing much more in renewable, green energy sources as soon as possible, and move away from using polluting fossil fuels,” Barrows said. “Humans now know better and should stop shooting ourselves in our feet by using harmful fossil fuels.”
Barrows added that student groups should initiate dialogue with the administration to move towards environmental sustainability.
“Student discussions with the Georgetown administration should help the university to become greener,” Barrows said.
James said that she feels more optimistic about GU Fossil Free’s meeting with the Board of Directors in February than she does about its relationship with CISR. GU Fossil Free met with University President John J. DeGioia Nov. 25 to discuss its mission and discuss CISR’s vote, which was originally scheduled for the end of the academic year. Before the November meeting, DeGioia met with CISR Chair and Associate Dean for Transnational Programs Jim Feinerman to encourage an earlier vote and succeeded.
“I don’t think that it will matter to whether or not we get a ‘no’ [from CISR], because I think that both President DeGioia and many members of the board of directors are aware of the fact that divestment has swept the nation pretty quickly considering that it was one that only started a couple of years ago,” James said.
18 universities worldwide, including Stanford University, Pitzer College and University of Glasgow have committed to divestment.
James added that the Board of Directors may be more interested in improving the university’s image as an environmentally conscious school, following the footsteps of other universities in the country. She cited the divestment attempts at Harvard University, which failed after the university refused to withdraw investment from fossil fuel companies and subsequently invested $79.5 million into fossil fuel companies, which has led to heavy media coverage.
“I don’t think that [Georgetown will face the] publicity difficulties that Harvard has encountered,” James said.“If we were to present this to the board, they wouldn’t so much be thinking about what CISR’s recommendation was, but rather how Georgetown would be portrayed, and how it would be very much praised, especially in its Catholic identity.”
Recently, the Online Schools Center ranked Georgetown at number 29 on its list of the top 50 greenest schools in the country, which evaluates universities on criteria including sustainability, clean energy, recycling and student programs focused in environmental conservation.
In 2012, President DeGioia pledged to cut the university’s carbon footprint in half by 2020 through the conversion from fossil fuels to renewable energy on campus.
However, Lazarus said that in order to qualify as a green school, Georgetown must divest from fossil fuel companies.
“Even though Georgetown has committed to reducing its carbon footprint on campus through green energy initiatives, Georgetown is still investing in the same companies and fuels it is moving away from,” Lazarus said. “Divestment would act as the next step, following the series of environmental initiatives President DeGioia has supported and Georgetown’s foundational principles value.”
Regardless of the outcome of the CISR vote, GU Fossil Free will continue to campaign for the university to divest.
“Even if we were to get a ‘no’, GU Fossil Free’s campaign would be proceeding more strongly than ever,” James said. “We’ll rally and petition and point out the fact that CISR, whose job in title literally includes social responsibility, will have only satisfied the investments part of their title and not the social responsibility part, so we’ll definitely be talking about that if the ‘no’ vote happens.”
 
Correction: The original article stated that nine universities worldwide have committed to divestment. In fact, 18 universities have done so.

Application totals for the Class of 2019 remained nearly identical to the previous year, despite changing national trends regarding demographics and high school graduation rates.
Regular decision applications were due Saturday, Jan. 10, but were accepted until Monday, the first business day after the due date. As of Jan. 13, the number of regular decision applications across Georgetown’s four undergraduate schools totaled 19,427, nine fewer than the 19,436 applications that were received at the same point last year.
“The theme is the applicant pool remains steady in the face of declining high school graduate pool. That’s basically the environment,” Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said. “Being even was good. We wanted to hold the pool between 19,000 and 20,000.”
Georgetown College received 11,510 applications compared to 11,551 for the Class of 2018; the McDonough School of Business saw 3,322 applications, similar to its total of 3,305 last year; the School of Foreign Service collected 3,513 applications, up from 3,439; and the School of Nursing and Health Studies received 1,041 applications, a decrease from the 1,141 applicants in 2014. Deacon explained these changes as natural variation, particularly with the specialized nature of the NHS.
Continuing a 10-year trend, women composed nearly 60 percent of the applicant pool, with 11,463 applicants, while 7,963 men applied to the university. Black applicants declined from 1,875 to 1,848, Hispanic applicants remained stable from 2,341 to 2,345 and Asian-American applicants increased slightly from 3,332 to 3,382.The university also received more applications from international students, with 2,248 this year compared to 2,188 last year.
At least nine applications were received from each of the 50 states. North Dakota was the only state not to have a student admitted during the early action period.
The largest number of applicants came from, in descending order, California, New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Florida. However, New York, New Jersey and Maryland, along with the other states of the Middle Atlantic and Northeast region of the United States, saw decreased application numbers, while California, Florida and Texas sent more applications than last year.
“[The trend is] largely declining white students in that part of the world. Those have been the primary feeders, the largest feeder states,” Deacon said. “Fortunately, for Georgetown, international [students], California, Florida and Texas have moved significantly up the list, and that’s where the population growth is coming from. Fortunately, we have a brand that’s visible in the growing areas to offset the declining areas where it’s traditionally been.”
The peak high school graduating class in the United States came in 2011: the number of high school graduates since that year has declined by five percent. During that same period, Georgetown’s application numbers have increased by a total of two percent.
The overall acceptance rate is expected to stabilize at a similar level to last year’s 16.3 percent. During the early action acceptance period in December, Deacon explained that admissions committees chose to reserve more space for students applying in the regular cycle, leading to a small decline in that acceptance rate.
The lower early acceptance rate flies in the face of a national trend among elite institutions to accept more students early. A recent Bloomberg article explained that early acceptances privilege affluent students in comparison to the regular decision process, since they make up a larger proportion of the early pool.
“The implication of that is significant. The more people you take early, the more likely there is to be a higher percentage of paying students, and the more you’re squeezing out at the other end. That would be a cynical way of reducing the amount of financial aid,” Deacon said. “It’s just another example of admissions becoming a business. We’re philosophically similar to where we were twenty years ago, saying that we should be student-centered, rather than institution-centered.”
Decisions for the regular application period will be released near the end of March.

University President John J. DeGioia announced the creation of Global Futures, a two-year-long initiative formed from a university-wide collaboration that will engage the community in four global themes: development, governance, security and environment, on Jan. 15.
The initiative, led by Vice President for Global Engagement Thomas Banchoff, was developed over a six-month period by multiple university departments, including the Office of the President, the Office of the Provost and a variety of campus graduate and undergraduate programs.
“In the time since I took the role [of VP for Global Engagement], I’ve been working with colleagues to explore how we can build on Georgetown’s strengths around global questions and take advantage of our D.C. location to build a platform to explore those issues,” Banchoff said. “That’s what led to the initiative.”
According to Global Engagement Communications Manager Sarah Rutherford, the initiative is part of the university’s efforts to engage in global issues.
“Georgetown is developing the model of an engaged global university,” Rutherford said. “This initiative is one of our first opportunities to advance as an engaged global university in terms of our teaching, research and outreach activities.”
Global Futures activities will revolve around one major theme each semester, beginning with development in spring 2015. The four semesters will be unified by four smaller, cross-cutting themes: religion and ethics, migration and cities, gender and diversity, and health and family.
“The idea was to choose four themes that are critical in today’s world. In other words, they’re topics that are on everyone’s mind and will shape the global future,” Banchoff said. “We wanted to choose topics that would be of interest to faculty and students, but we also wanted to have a chance to explore the intersections between those themes over two years, which is the initiative extends more than one semester.”
To engage the Georgetown community in each theme, the initiative will bring a variety of world leaders to speak. For spring 2015, the university has partnered with the World Bank Group, and will receive a total of four lectures from President Jim Yong Kim and Senior Vice President and Chief Economist Kaushik Basu, who will deliver two lectures each. Rutherford and Banchoff could not provide information on future speakers because the details have not yet been finalized.
“Our idea is to invite world leaders to campus and to encourage them to set out a vision based on their expertise for dealing with global issues and global challenges and to address the policy implications but also some of the ethical implications of the choices that we face,” Banchoff said.
Rutherford said Georgetown’s reputation made the partnerships between large organizations such as the World Bank possible.
“We’re able to work with World Bank Group in part because of our D.C. location, which makes it easy for those leaders to come to Georgetown and give lectures, and because of Georgetown’s reputation of academic excellence and Jesuit identity, which gives us expertise and interest in addressing pressing issues,” Rutherford said. “It’s a draw for world leaders to come to Georgetown.”
In addition to speaking events, the initiative will also include an academic aspect that gives students and faculty research grants and incorporates the four themes into both the undergraduate and graduate curricula.
The initiative has set aside $25,000 for spring 2015 research grants, for which students and faculty can apply online by Feb. 3 . Each applicant may receive up to $7,500 for topics that address one of the four Global Futures themes or cross-cutting themes. This money comes from the Office of the Vice President for Global Engagement’s existing budget.
The initiative also includes a Global Futures Curriculum Studio formed in collaboration with the Designing Future(s) of the University Initiative founded in November 2013. The studio will encourage faculty members to incorporate global perspectives and the four themes into their courses through workshops and seminars.
“We want to bring faculty and students together to think about how to further integrate these topics into the curriculum,” Banchoff said. “Obviously, they’re already there, but we want give faculty the tools that we can to do that more effectively going forward.”
The last component of the initiative is a Global Futures blog that will allow the university community and the outside world to discuss current events, ideas and themes. The blog, which launched Jan. 1, features posts from Georgetown faculty members and administrators with backgrounds in each theme.
According to Banchoff, the program as a whole will provide a platform for discussion, but will also elevate the university’s status in regards to global studies.
“I think it’s an opportunity for us to highlight our strengths for an external audience like the academic excellence we have across disciplines in dealing with global questions,” Banchoff said. “But also I think it’s an opportunity to foster more collaboration within the university around these issues, across campuses, across schools, but also between faculty and students going forward.”
In a statement sent to the university Jan. 15, DeGioia expressed his excitement for the inauguration of the initiative.
“The challenges we face today as a global community are more complex than ever, transcending national and cultural boundaries,” DeGioia wrote. “… Through the Global Futures framework, we will bring the resources of our university’s distinctive tradition — our academic excellence, our history of broad global engagement — to bear in advancing thoughtful solutions that lead to a better future for all people.”

D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) sent Initiative 71, the ballot initiative to legalize the possession and cultivation of marijuana approved by voters in November, to the United States Congress on Tuesday, beginning a 30-day congressional review period.
Congress, according to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973, reviews all pieces of legislation enacted by the D.C. Council and can block the legislation with a disapproval motion that passes through both the House and the Senate. If Congress does not act on the legislation, the bill will officially become law in the District. Initiative 71, which passed with 69.4 percent of the vote, permits adults over the age of 21 to possess up to two ounces of marijuana, grow up to six marijuana plants and freely give one ounce of the substance to other adults.
Mendelson’s decision comes in response to the omnibus spending bill, which included a clause that prevented the usage of federal funds to “enact” marijuana legalization, authorized by Congress in December. Congressman Andy Harris (R-Md.), who introduced the so-called policy rider, claimed that this would dismantle D.C.’s legislation. Proponents of the bill and D.C. home rule, including Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), however, disagreed, opining that the initiative was enacted when voters passed the legislation in November, well before the passage of the spending bill.
“The District’s examination agrees with our analysis that the initiative was enacted when voters approved it and will take effect at the end of the 30-day congressional review period,” Norton Communications Director Benjamin Fritsch said.
This question of interpretation could lead to a judicial battle if the legislation is enacted and opponents attempt to strike it down behind the omnibus bill. Mendelson did not call the decision a political maneuver, explaining it instead as his legal obligation.
“I have no choice,” Mendelson said in an interview with the Washington Post. “The law says that I must transmit the measure. That is all I am doing.”
Despite the possibility of Congress rejecting the initiative in the next 30 legislative days, a mechanism that has been used only three times in the last 40 years, D.C. Cannabis Campaign Chairman Adam Eidinger, who introduced Initiative 71, explained that opponents to the legislation were pointing to the omnibus bill as the most likely obstacle to the initiative’s passage.
“Rep. Andy Harris and a handful of others have been out there saying that they already passed a law addressing this, that D.C. shouldn’t revisit this. They need to talk to a lawyer and read the bill they passed because the bill they passed does not address us at all,” D.C. Cannabis Campaign Chairman Adam Eidinger said. “They’re avoiding the issue for political reasons. They do not want to have to put a resolution forward because then it would be very clear who’s doing it.”
Eidinger added that if any resolution of disapproval were introduced, his organization would mobilize protests.
In preparation for legalization, the D.C. Council passed legislation in October authored by Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) that sealed the criminal records of anyone convicted for marijuana possession. Grosso also had proposed legislation to enact a tax-and-regulation system similar to those in Colorado and Washington, anticipating that the system would be created and set up in 2015. This legislation has been frozen by the spending bill, preventing any implementation of such a system for the time being.

The university registrar removed almost 20 courses that failed to meet an eight-student enrollment minimum prior to the add-drop period, in accordance with recent policy from the Office of the College Dean.
According to University Registrar John Q. Pierce, the courses were cut because of low enrollment.
Jeff Connor-Linton, the associate dean of faculty and strategic planning, said that the cancellation process had minimal impact on students, because it occurred before the beginning of the add-drop period.
“Spring 2015 course enrollments were evaluated in November, after preregistration closed for students but before students were finally placed in courses,” Connor-Linton said. “Based on review of the preliminary assignment of students to courses and previous enrollment patterns, department chairs determined which low-enrolled courses needed to be canceled.”
Students who registered for under-enrolled courses were notified of schedule changes prior to the beginning of the semester, Connor-Linton said.
“Students who had registered for a canceled course were enrolled in another section of that course or in one of their alternate courses,” Connor-Linton said. “Since students received their spring 2015 schedules in December, no courses have been cancelled due to low enrollment.”
Connor-Linton said that the cancellations were to ensure the quality of courses offered by the College.
“The College and the registrar have a careful process to ensure the reliability of course offerings and maximize the breadth and depth of the curriculum while maintaining necessary minimum levels of enrollment,” Connor-Linton said.
Pierce agreed that the cancellation policy was necessary to ensure a sensible allocation of faculty and resources.
“If there’s a reason to have it then that’s fine, sometimes when you reflect on it there really isn’t a reason to have such a course,” Pierce said. “The faculty member who’s teaching it could be made more available in a different setting.”
According to Pierce, classes were also cut to ensure that the university is spending money effectively on courses.
“The pressure to invest money into all sorts of things grows constantly and so one of the ways to address that is to be as prudent as possible in the use of the resources that we have. That doesn’t mean that you start cutting things recklessly,” Pierce said.
Additionally, around half of courses in the College are exempt from the low enrollment minimum.
“Many courses are exempted from enrollment minimums — for example, courses required for a major and beginning and intermediate language courses,” Connor-Linton said.
Pierce said that the registrar also ensured that core curriculum classes were not cancelled.
“[The] list was overviewed by the deans and the registrar and any course that we felt were part of the undergraduate core,” Pierce said. “Then what remained was sent to departments for them to review and if they felt the course was needed by a major and only after all of that did they come up with the course that were cancelled.”
Although the eight-student minimum was only instated this year, the registrar has cancelled under-enrolled courses in the past.
“We always have some cancellations and additions and changes at various stages in the process,” Pierce said. “What’s different is the College deans requested that departments in the College pay closer attention than they have in the past to courses that are under -enrolled, that is under eight [students], and justify to the deans the values of such a course.”
Some students were bothered by the decision to cut courses. Laura Greuring (SFS ’18) said that one of her own courses, North African Literature, narrowly avoided being cut.
“A class that I was in only got two people in it, but they offered to turn it into an individual tutorial so it actually had the opposite effect, but if they would have cut it I would have had a feeling that that was unfair,” Greurig said. “The registrar offered to cut it but the department decided to maintain. So I guess we were lucky.”
Greurig said that cutting courses due to low enrollment was a poor decision.
“I think that for the students that are really passionate about those classes it’s kind of unfair that just because some students don’t take the same interests as they do, they’re cut,” Greurig said. “Especially at a big university like Georgetown, you’d think Georgetown has the possibility to move some funds around to be able to support the class.”

what classes were cut–it would be interesting to see if there is any pattern re the areas drawing low enrollment

Burr says 
January 18, 2015 at 3:18 am
How come this article didn’t publish which classes were cut?  That seems like a basic detail worth knowing.  Did the author get lazy and not bother finding out, or are the courses not being reported because, as johnk says, there is a “pattern” here.

A Georgetown University Student Association senate proposal released Jan. 11 aims to strip the residency requirement for the District’s Boards and Commissions, which would thereby allow Washington, D.C., college students to participate in local government.
The proposal, introduced by GUSA senate Speaker Tyler Bridge (COL ’17) and Vice-Speaker Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16), also aims to create a Mayoral Task Force in Higher Education that would bridge the gap between public service and university students.
“We want to be involved and have a bigger stake,” Bridge said. “Plus, we’re college students. We have a passion for these things.”
Currently, only D.C. residents are allowed to serve on D.C. Boards and Commissions, meaning that students who are not residents of the District are not permitted to serve in this capacity.
There are over 100 boards and commissions in the city, dealing with a variety of District issues that range from stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS to the Commission on Fashion Arts and Events.
According to GUSA Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15), this issue was brought up during the election cycle last fall. After conversations with other D.C. student governments, it became clear that there was widespread interest in this proposal.
“The city of D.C. would greatly benefit from allowing students access to Boards and Commissions as they inform a lot of the work the city government pursues,” Jikaria said. “Especially in D.C., university students make up a large constituency and are as affected by policies of the city as are permanent residents.”
The GUSA senate sent the proposal to the student governments of American University, Catholic University, Gallaudet University, Howard University, University of the District of Columbia, George Washington University and George Mason University.
Once all schools have signed, the proposal will be sent to both the D.C. Office of Boards and Commissions and the Office of the Mayor.
“If we’re all trying to do something for the betterment of us all in the same community, it’s a no-brainer to work collectively,” Bridge said.
One of the main arguments against allowing students on Boards and Commissions is that the positions deal exclusively with D.C. issues, and therefore should only be available to legal residents. GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), however, said that students would still be valuable assets, regardless of their residence status.
“What that fails to consider is that we have about 80,000 students living in the District, which is over a tenth of the District population,” he said. “In order to give them a stake in the process, and in order for D.C. politicians to tap into a non-used reservoir of political support, making these forums easier to participate in is a must.”
The majority of the D.C. Boards and Commissions positions are unpaid, but Tezel said that he does not think this will discourage students from applying.
Students regularly express interest in District politics, be it through registering to vote or running for positions on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission.
“A lot of students are saying that this is something important,” Tezel said. “I want to make sure the city is governed in a way that supports university interests.”
Both Bridge and Tezel said that Deputy Director of the Office of Boards and Commissions David Walker has been helpful in the process. Walker could not be reached for comment.
Bridge also discussed a possible tie-in between this proposal and the Center for Social Justice’s Fourth Credit Option for Social Action. If a student were to serve on a board or commission that integrated their academic studies, they may be eligible to receive an additional credit in the corresponding course.
“The fourth credit option is a new program in the CSJ where students can apply to the program, and through service that works with their academic schedule, they can get a fourth credit added to their class,” Bridge said. “Say your interested in socioeconomic diversity, and you do work with a committee dealing with homelessness, you can apply to the CSJ for credit and really tell the story of how those things worked together.”
Georgetown will send a student delegation to this weekend’s town hall-style meeting with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to discuss this proposal and other ways for the university to interact with the District.
“It works well with the mission of Georgetown, and its mutually beneficial,” Bridge said. “It’s good for us, and the city has people who are dedicated, committed and innovative. We want to serve, and it doesn’t make sense why we shouldn’t be allowed to.”

Bread for the City CEO George Jones will receive the John Thompson Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award forhis work as an advocate for the fight against poverty. The honor, which recognizes a community member who has significantly affected D.C. residents and has been a leader in solving issues in the District, will be given to Jones at the Kennedy Center on Jan. 19 as part of Georgetown’s annual MartinLuther King Jr. Day celebration.
Bread for the City, a local nonprofit organization which has locations in Ward 2 and Ward 8, aims to assist city residents in need of a variety of resources, including food, clothing, medical care and legal services. Under Jones’s leadership, Bread for the City has grown tenfold, from an agency with a budget of $1.5 million when he was hired in 1996 to a $10.5 million organization today.
“We’ve expanded our facilities, our reach in the D.C. community and the services we offer. These developments have allowed us to serve our clients more holistically than ever before,” Jones said. “When I came to Bread 19 years ago, I never imagined we’d be growing our own produce, offering yoga classes or leading community media trainings.”
Molly Cielinski (COL ’17), a weekly volunteer with the organization, echoed Jones’s sentiments and said the organization goes beyond just providing food and clothing for D.C. residents in need.
“It often acts as a sort of community center, a place of safety and of advocacy for people. I have seen many of the same people come in week after week just to speak to the women behind the desk who have become prominent figures in the community,” Cielinski said.
Bread for City COO Jeannine Sanford said Jones has been a driving force behind the organization’s progress and development in recent years.
“We’re starting to dedicate resources and energy to alleviating the conditions that perpetuate poverty, and not only addressing the symptoms, but trying to get at the causation. [Jones] has really been a champion for digging into that,” Sanford said.
Additionally, Sanford praised Jones’ leadership style.
“It’s great to work with him on a day-to-day basis,” Sanford said. “He’s steady, even-tempered. He has his eyes on the prize. He asks the good questions, he makes you feel like you can take chances. He is the epitome of leadership.”
In the same way his staff appreciates him, Jones said he is proud of the work they are doing.
“I am extremely proud that seemingly every week someone in the community — a resident, someone at another nonprofit, even government officials tell me of the high quality of the work the dedicated staff of Bread for the City does day in and day out,” Jones said. “More and more of our staff members are spending time advocating for the public policy reforms that will bring about economic justice for those living in low-income communities.”
Jones’ passion for community service has been evident throughout his life: he previously served as a case manager for the homeless and people suffering from mental illness in Los Angeles, Calif. In 1995, as Jones began to look for opportunities to move back to his home state of Virginia, he learned of an opening for executive director of Bread for City.
“I’ve always felt called to work in a setting that served the community,” Jones said. “I came in and met with [Bread for the City’s] staff and board of directors, and I jumped at the chance when they offered me the opportunity to lead the organization.”
After being on the ground, Jones said he understands the importance of including clients in decision making; the organization invites Bread for the City clients to serve on its board of directors to help guide the organization’s advocacy.
“We have a client advisory council that provides input about the issues they care about, and our staff helps our clients testify before the D.C. City Council and other government leaders to directly address the challenges they often face living in low-income communities,” Jones said.
He added that he is touched to be receiving the Thompson award this year and credited much of his success to the Bread for the City staff.
“I’m extremely humbled to be the recipient of this award, largely because of who the award is named for, John Thompson, Jr., and whose legacy it honors — my personal hero, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,” Jones said. “More importantly, I think this award is a testament to — and calls much deserved attention to — the very important work that our staff, Board of Directors and volunteers do to make a difference in D.C.”
As a result of Jones receiving the Thompson award, Georgetown and Bread for the City will enter into a year-long partnership, primarily coordinating on racial equity. Jones noted that Georgetown officials have expressed interest in attending racial equity trainings with the nonprofit.
“Our racial equity work centers on our effort to help reverse the socioeconomic disparities facing communities of color, greater unemployment rates, shorter life spans, lower incomes, higher incarceration rates, et cetera,” Jones said. “Perhaps the University will agree to partner with us in hosting community dialogues designed to mobilize the cause of economic justice for people of all races.”

Pressed by a potentially severe winter and rapidly decreasing shelter space, the D.C. Council is considering further action to combat the problem of homelessness, already having tweaked the operation of shelters this winter.
According to a report from the Washington City Paper, D.C. General, the city’s largest homeless shelter, was near capacity, housing 230 families out of a maximum total of 248. Additional shelter space in two motels provided 310 total spaces, of which 251 have been filled thus far. The D.C. Council has begun negotiations for additional space with a third motel.
Kate Coventry, policy analyst for the Fiscal Policy Analyst, said that despite the limited space, this year’s experience has been better than 2014, when the inability to anticipate demand for shelter services led to the motels becoming oversaturated.
“In the past … there hasn’t been as much onsite staff [at motels], there was staff that would travel to the spaces,” Coventry said. “Also, contracting for entire motels is more transparent about how many units we have available, because we contract for a certain number of units versus renting them on an as-needed basis so that’s good for planning. I can tell you how many families were in shelter two nights ago and how many spaces we have left.”
However, the shelter at D.C. General and the motels are intended to be used as emergency shelters. To keep emergency capacity, the D.C. Department of Human Services aims to move about 65 families per month from the shelter into more permanent housing but only managed to relocate 79 families in November and December, leaving a increasingly worrisome problem for the long-term stability of the shelters. Accordingly, much of the rhetoric surrounding the new administration of Mayor Muriel Bowser has focused around finding permanent, long-term solutions for the housing problem.
“My focus is not on creating more shelter but on creating new housing opportunities,” Bowser said to The Washington Post.
Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) attributed this new focus of city government to the results of last fall’s elections.
“I think you’re going to see a radical change [in homelessness]. You have a council now and a mayor that are committed to ending homelessness in the District of Columbia and that’s what we’re going to try to do,” Grosso said. “I think you’ve seen a strong commitment from Muriel Bowser on trying to get to a place where we have a housing-first approach where we are taking the homeless and we are working closely with them with all of the services that are needed to get them into permanent housing so that they can stop having to live on the street.”
Grosso said that disagreement between former Mayor Vincent Gray and the former council prevented the passage of legislation regarding homelessness in the past.
“The former mayor had an idea about how he was going to handle the crisis and I think he had some good ideas. What happened was the council worked with advocates to try to get something that would work for all people that were homeless, and in the end the mayor just didn’t agree with our approach,” Grosso said.
One such example was the dispute over the legislation passed by the council in November that changed the operation of shelters this winter. The Dignity for Homeless Families Amendment Act calls for private and safe rooms for all families, newly defining a private room as one with a door that shuts and locks.
Additionally, the bill calls for shelters to open 24 hours a day so families do not have to reapply to stay every night. Shelters in the District have historically had hours of 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.
Although Bowser supported the bill, Gray urged the Council to oppose it, worried that it would divert investment from permanent solutions for housing.
“The proposed bill will mandate additional investment in shelter at the expense of investments in affordable housing and other more permanent housing solutions. This legislation will throw the District back to an era when streets were lined with hotels filled with homeless families,” Gray wrote to Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) in a letter Oct. 28.
Grosso also said that Gray had misinformation about costs of potential plans when approaching this issue during his term.
“He was bent toward saying people need to start stepping up and taking care of themselves more than the government needs to continue to help people get on their feet again,” Grosso said. “He had bad advice that it would cost millions and millions of dollars to do this when in fact there had been some fiscal analysis that it wasn’t going to cost that much.”
With the motels providing some measure of stability for this winter, Grosso pointed to the work done by Friendship Place as a long-term way to transition to more permanent housing.
The private organization committed to ending homelessness has taken over multiple shelters in the District over the past few years and employed a new strategy to homelessness. Called a “wraparound” strategy, the organization provides 24-hour care as well as health and psychiatric services. In 2013, Friendship Place provided 701 free primary care consultations and 329 free psychiatric consultations, helping to move people out of shelters into permanent housing.
“The way we’re handling homelessness in the District this year is going to include a lot more wraparound services than it has in the past so people are going to have their problems addressed immediately,” Grosso said. “They’re going to be able to get into housing and then they’re going to have the backup services that they need to stay on their feet. I think you’re going to see a radical change.”

Four years ago, Adan Gonzalez (COL ‘15) rolled his bag to the airport on his way to start his freshman year at Georgetown University. Even though he had not yet arrived on campus, he already felt different.
“At the airport I had one carry-on luggage [piece] and I couldn’t afford the fee,” Gonzalez said. “I was left with ten dollars in my pocket for two weeks. So I imagined one day I would make this experience different for someone else. That led to the Trailblazers Program.”
The Trailblazers Program, which provides students with free luggage, is just the latest of Gonzalez’s initiatives that are part of a nonprofit he created in 2012 called Si, Se Puede. The organization provides students with academic advice, helps them discover scholarships and encourages them to participate in community service programs.
In November, Gonzalez received the most votes in the Coors Light Líderes Program Competition and won $25,000 to fund his organization’s efforts. The Coors Light Líderes Program, which launched in 2006, celebrates leadership within the Hispanic community and nominates 12 Hispanic leaders each year to compete for the award.
Gonzales will use the money to develop a Latino leadership project in collaboration with AVANCE-Dallas, a nonprofit organization that provides educational support for those at risk in the community.
“Adan is a tireless advocate for his community. We are delighted to recognize his work and partner with him on a program that will benefit Latino families and the local community,” Director of Community Commerce and Partnerships for the MillerCoors Brewing Company Alberto Senior wrote in a statement.
Gonzalez chose to partner with AVANCE-Dallas because as a young child growing up in Dallas, he benefited from the organization’s services.
“Everything comes full circle, I was part of that program 16 years ago so being able to represent them in this capacity was cool. … Early childhood education is lacking in the country, it’s a big factor of why our public education is suffering” Gonzalez said.
Gonzalez said that his desire to provide educational support to impoverished youth comes from difficulties he faced during his childhood.
“When I was in middle school I saw my dad crying for the first time because we couldn’t pay the rent and we were about to lose our home … That’s the reason I’m here,” Gonzalez said. “All that struggle, I’m here because of that.”
In addition to starting Si, Se Puede, Gonzalez has logged over 12,000 hours of community service, served D.C. schools as an assistant teacher and worked as a White House intern.
“It’s worth it, every moment of it, every struggle, because I see the impact at home in my community,” Gonzalez said. “They are living a journey through me that no one ever thought was possible. I never thought it was possible.”
Carmen Marsans, senior vice president of client services at the Hispanic public relations firm Comunicad, has worked with the Coors Light Líderes program for several years. She said that Gonzalez has made a true impact on his community.
“I have asked a lot of people in Dallas about this network and it is helping so many other Latinos be able to have at least the knowledge that someone cares for them,” Marsans said. “As far as I can see, I think that Adan is going to go places, and I think that Adan may very easily have his name be resonating for many years to come because he has that fire and that commitment. He really wants to do it for his family and his parents and as a mentor to his brother and for others. That is why we chose him.”
Gonzalez said that although he hopes to inspire others, his main goal is to work beside his neighbors and friends to build a better community.
“A lot of people point at me and say I’m special and say, ‘He’s from the hood, he’s made it out,’ but my goal is to make ‘hood’ a place people want to be part of,” Gonzalez said. “According to numbers, I grew up in poverty. I hate the word ‘poverty’ but if that’s what they call it so be it.”
One person who has been a part of that journey his entire life is Gonzalez’s younger brother Eric. Although he is only 12 years old, Eric has had a profound effect on Adan.
“He is always pushing me to try harder … When he first started he would go in to talk to my teachers and give speeches at my school and I would be so embarrassed because I wasn’t used to it, but then everyone started congratulating me because I have a brother like him,” Eric Gonzalez said. “Now, I’m proud of him.”

Georgetown University Law Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced a partnership to offer a joint course to law and engineering graduate students this semester. The course will examine the legal and technical aspects of modern privacy problems and draft models of state privacy legislation.
The first session of the class was held at MIT on Wednesday, and the following classes will be switch campuses based on which professor is leading the lecture, collaborating via video conferencing. GULC Center on Privacy and Technology Faculty Director David Vladeck and Executive Director Alvaro Bedoya will teach the Georgetown half of the course, while Daniel J. Weitzner, director of MIT’s Cybersecurity Policy Initiative, and Hal Abelson, professor of electrical engineering and computer science, will lead the MIT side. The joint program currently has 12 GULC students and at least 10 MIT students enrolled.
According to Bedoya, the primary aim of the course is to improve communication between lawyers and engineers.
“There is a really big problem in the world of privacy,” he said. “There are far too few lawyers who are comfortable speaking with engineers, and far too few engineers who are comfortable speaking with lawyers.”
With increased privacy problems such as the hacks of the consumer databases of Sony, Target and Home Depot last year, Vladeck added that lawyers should be more knowledgeable about technology and engineers about policy. Having worked with Weitzner during his time at the Federal Trade Commission, Vladeck collaborated with him to introduce the course.
“We often discussed the difficulty that lawyers had in understanding the difficult technical issues that often drive privacy policy and the difficulty that technologists had in understanding the policy issues that underlay their work,” he wrote in an email to The Hoya. “So we started thinking that when returned to academia, we’d try to put together a class that brought law students and technology students together and had them collaborate on projects, with the aim that the lawyers would become literate in the technology, and the technologists would become literate in policy.”
Jim Davy (LAW ’15), who is enrolled in the class, cited the increased importance of information privacy as driving his interest in the class and expressed his excitement to collaborate with MIT students.
“[The class is] the opportunity to get out of the classroom and work on these issues in a more practical context,” he wrote in an email. “That we’re doing it with MIT — connecting the legal part of the subject directly to the technology part — is hugely appealing as well.”
At the end of the course, the students will present their research and findings to a panel of experts and the panel will evaluate the most promising proposals.
“The goal is to get lawyers and engineers in training to realize that they can’t tackle privacy problems alone.” Bedoya said.
Both Bedoya and Vladeck were optimistic about the program, hoping to offer similar courses in the future.
The course is part of GULC’s increased emphasis on technology and privacy concerns. In addition to the MIT collaboration and the formation of the Center on Privacy and Technology, the law center also announced Tuesday that Paul Ohm, a former senior policy adviser to the Federal Trade Commission and foremost expert on law and technology, would join the center’s full-time faculty. Vladeck pointed to the developments as optimistic signs for the future.
“If all goes well, I would hope to institutionalize and expand this collaboration,” Vladeck wrote. “From the perspective of the law school, I think that helping our students develop competencies in emerging areas like cybertechnology will make them better and more effective lawyers, better and more effective policy advocates, and will help them in this highly dynamic legal job market.”

The Francis Project, a new initiative created in October that attempts to foster on-campus dialogue about human dignity, held its first campus-wide event Monday evening in the Healey Family Student Center.
Around 60 people attended the event, which featured a talk by Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien and a showcase of how groups on campus are working toward human dignity. Four groups were present to speak with students: Students Stopping the Trafficking of People, GU Knights of Columbus, Catholic Daughters of Georgetown University and Georgetown Right to Life.
The initiative will serve as a forum to bring together groups of all different religious backgrounds who share the common goal of recognizing the significance of human life, according to O’Brien.
“The Francis Project takes its inspiration from Pope Francis because he articulates for Catholics and non-Catholics, by both what he says and what he does, a message of human dignity that we want to make sure we share on campus,” O’Brien said. “It is to support natural life from conception to natural death in all forms and to defend human dignity of all peoples. That’s the inspiration.”
Andrea Price (COL ’14, GRD ’15), who is currently leading the Francis Project, said that she hopes the discussion that will result among students will make the often misunderstood position of pro-life more clear.
“Usually when you’re talking pro-life, people go right to the abortion issue,” Price said. “But the Francis Project is hoping to promote awareness of the Catholic notion of pro-life at Georgetown. The Catholic notion of pro-life is that life is sacred and special and that humans deserve dignity from conception to natural death and at all moments in between.”
The Francis Project is still in development, so it does not yet have a set number of groups with which it will collaborate throughout the year. Other details of the initiative, too, such as how often the group will come together have yet to be decided, though Price said the biggest goal is to provide a safe space for discussion.
“This is not to create a new group, but really to network students and groups that are already active in promoting human life and human dignity, and most particularly not just religiously based groups,” O’Brien said.
Price knows first-hand the difference having an open and understanding environment for dialogue can make.
“Personally, as a freshman I was afraid to talk about pro-life issues on campus because I was afraid of being verbally attacked or being judged,” Price said. “It took me a long time to find a safe space to discuss these types of things and know that I was respected and that I was being listened to.”
Georgetown has received criticism in recent years by alumni and fellow Catholics who say that Georgetown is not Catholic enough. Most notably, William Peter Blatty (C ’50), the author of “The Exorcist,” filed a formal complaint with the archbishop of Washington this year regarding the operations of Georgetown, which the Vatican responded to as well-founded concerns.
Price said that she was hopeful the Francis Project would give students and alumni a more favorable view of the university’s religious identity.
“Hopefully the Francis Project will make mental connections … between our social justice work, which has roots in Catholic social teaching, and also the Catholic identity of the university,” Price said. “It’s one thing to have crosses in the classroom or have masses every Sunday or every day here, but it’s another thing to put your faith into action.”
The project will also attempt to bring one prominent speaker to campus each year to talk about themes relating to human dignity, O’Brien said.
The environment of excitement and interest at Monday’s event was a hopeful sign for the future endeavors of the Francis Project, Price said.
“I had a lot of people coming up to me and asking, ‘What’s next? What’s next? This is so great, we can’t wait for the next thing,’” Price said. “That was really great for me to hear. So the event was definitely a positive experience, and it just made people interested and hungry for more of these issues.”
Clare Murphy (SFS ’15), president of Students Stopping the Trafficking of People, represented her group at the showcase and said that she looks forward to collaborating with The Francis Project to provide a chance to dialogue about the value of human life.
“Our group participating in The Francis Project will be able to bring attention to the issues of promoting human dignity as a whole,” Murphy said. “And specifically for our group, it will hopefully be able to bring attention to the issue of human trafficking and modern day slavery by getting students to start thinking about what that issue is and the dignity that is in every person.”
Celia Calano (COL ’18) said the event was helpful for her to find ways she could get involved in promoting human dignity on campus.
“I learned more about Pope Francis’ involvement in human dignity and about the issue in general. And I learned about clubs at Georgetown that I might not have known about already,” Calano said.
 
Correction: A previous version of the article stated that 30 to 40 people attended the first Francis Project event. In actuality, about 60 people attended.

At the ripe age of nine Connor Bernstein (COL ’16) created his own business. And now more than a decade later, he has kept at it, growing what was once a schoolyard operation to a company with national reach.
Bernstein grew up with an interest in science and enjoyed performing experiments with activity kits as a child. But he was often frustrated and disappointed with the quality of the experiments.
“They were expensive,” Bernstein said. “They were hard to use. The instructions were bad. They were overpriced and not kid–friendly.”
Rather than continuing to use these flawed kits, or giving up all together, Bernstein began making his own science kits and sharing them with friends as a fourth-grade student. As more and more people took an interest in his kits, Bernstein was able to turn this hobby into a business with his parents’ help.
“I made kits in my living room at home and sold them at local street fairs and craft shows in Chapel Hill, North Carolina,” Bernstein said. “The very first street fair that I sold at … I pretty much sold out. I had brought either 80 or 100 kits I had made myself. They were really popular.”
He continued making and selling these science kits locally as an elementary and middle school student, and named his company Connor’s Kits for Kids. In 2009, he formed an LLC as a freshman in high school, and worked with a marketing firm to help develop a logo, product packaging and a website: www.kitsforkids.com. He worked with sales representatives throughout high school and sold his kits to toy stores around the country.
Bernstein believes that what makes his products unique and superior to the kits that frustrated him as a child is that the experiments are easy to follow and can be performed again and again. The kits allow children to perform a variety of experiments, including making crystals, growing plants and making polymer slime. They retail for under $20 each.
“Everything is included to do the experiment multiple times, so they can actually experiment and change things around, and they can do them fairly independently because the instructions are very kid-friendly,” Bernstein said.
Bernstein is a fellow in the Entrepreneurship Fellows Program, a program developed to help students pursue entrepreneurial careers through various courses and co-curricular activities.
“I’ve been able to take a lot away from the [Entrepreneurship Fellows] classes in terms of how I approach new ideas and new opportunities and how to run the company,” Bernstein said. “It’s really helped me cultivate skills that are useful and that I can apply to my company.”
Jeff Reid, founding director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative, has worked closely with Bernstein as an Entrepreneurship Fellow and believes Connor’s Kits for Kids is a strong and promising venture in the education marketplace.
“With the country’s emphasis on science education, I would expect his company to continue to be really successful,” Reid said.
Reid also commended Bernstein for his emphasis on the student experience in using his science kits.
“Many studies have shown that when a young student enjoys what they’re learning, they’re going to learn a whole lot more,” Reid said. “What Connor has done is really focus on the experience of the kids, he’s made it more fun for kids to engage with science.”
Bernstein handles all the marketing and management for Connor’s Kits for Kids himself. He recruited several interns from the Entrepreneurship Fellows Program, as well, to work with the company this semester, which he will be spending abroad.
Alyssa Lovegrove, associate director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative and adjunct professor in the entrepreneurship program, has advised Connor in the program and is working with him this semester to coordinate the interns.
“He has an opportunity to really grow this company, but it’s really been just him so what he’s been trying to do is create a deeper team so they can go deeper faster,” Lovegrove said. “I think the company has a lot of further growth potential, so I’m excited to see where it goes.”
Bernstein plans on expanding Connor’s Kits for Kids by developing more products and continuing to break into the education market, selling to schools and educational programs.
Reid said he has high hopes for Bernstein and Connor’s Kits for Kids.
“Connor is a great example of a Georgetown entrepreneur,” Reid said. His company is successful in making money, but it’s also successful in making a difference in the world. He’s helping to educate young people about science, and that’s a great thing for society. And that’s what entrepreneurs do — they create value and improve society.”

Georgetown University alumnae David Fajgenbaum (NHS ’07) and Eric Oermann (COL ’07, MED ’13) were named to Forbes Magazine’s 30 Under 30 list, which highlights young entrepreneurs in the healthcare sector. The magazine’s entire list spans 20 categories, recognizing 600 of the nation’s top young entrepreneurs.
“[They are] finally dragging our medical system kicking and screaming into the digital age…changing the healthcare space,” Forbes wrote.
Howard Federoff, Executive Vice President for Health Sciences and Executive Dean of the School of Medicine at the Georgetown University Medical Center, congratulated Fajgenbaum and Oermann for their work.
“I join my colleagues Patricia Cloonan, Ph.D., RN, interim dean of the School of Nursing & Health Studies, and Ray Mitchell, M.D., Dean for Medical Education at the School of Medicine, in congratulating both of these graduates on this impressive accomplishment early on in their careers. I know that the professors who taught and mentored David and Eric during their time at Georgetown will also applaud this achievement,” Federoff said in a press release.
Fajgenbaum, now an adjunct assistant professor of hematology and oncology at the University of Pennsylvania and co-founder and executive director of the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network, is described in the Forbes article as “perhaps the most inspiring” of the young entrepreneurs on the healthcare list. Faigenbaum, who lost his mother to brain cancer, explained that his family history inspired him to study medicine.
“When I was at Georgetown, my mom got diagnosed with brain cancer. That’s what got me really focused on cancer,” he said. “I decided I wanted to become an oncologist and I wanted to study cancer and try to defeat it through research.”
During his time as a Georgetown undergraduate, Fajgenbaum founded a national non-profit organization for grieving college students called National Students of AMF, an acronym inspired by his mother’s name that the organization now calls “Actively Moving Forward.” The student-run organization now has chapters on over 50 campuses and has worked with students from over 250 colleges.
Fajgenbaum himself was also later diagnosed with cancer.
“I was also diagnosed with cancer myself during medical school. First, with a rare cancer in my liver and later on with a rare disease called Castleman disease that behaves like lymphoma. I almost died and had my last rites read to me in my third year of medical school. I realized I needed to dedicate everything towards trying to solve this disease,” he said.
Fajgenbaum was also a member of the global advisory board for the first-ever Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for Castleman Disease. Through his many roles, he has worked directly with hundreds of Castleman disease patients, physicians, and researchers.
Fajgenbaum recognized the hard work of the global network of volunteers at the CDCN for much as the progress they have made and in contributing to this achievement.
“This accomplishment will certainly make people more aware of what we are doing. It validates the hard work of so many people. The only reason we were able to accomplish so much was because I had the most incredible team of people around me,” Fajgenbaum said. “The big picture goal is determining how we can apply this model to thousands of other diseases where patients are dying because progress isn’t being made quickly enough.”
Oermann, now a resident physician at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, majored in mathematics as an undergraduate and then attended the School of Medicine. He focuses his research on developing individual patient survival and customizing therapies for patients with Stage IV cancer. He also questions how radiation is used to treat cancer, highlighting some of the problems in cancer treatment today. Oermann could not be reached for comment.
“Right now, generally speaking, lots of cancer patients get the same amount of radiation. What if an artificial intelligence could personalize this dose, making it more likely there’d be enough to kill the cancer but not too much? That’s one of the problems Oermann, a physician and mathematician, is working on,” Forbes wrote.
Having spent six months studying the ethical dimensions of health care, Oermann credited Edmund Pellegrino, founding director of the Center for Clinical Bioethics at the GUMC, as one of his greatest influences and inspirations.
“Having the chance to interact with [Dr. Pellegrino] has colored how I approach my clinical work. Medicine was a vocation for him—if you are going into medicine it’s not just something you can do as your day job,” Oermann said in a press release.
