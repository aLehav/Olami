student was sexually assaulted as she was about to enter her residence on the 1300 block of 35th Street early Saturday morning.
 
According to a Public Safety Alert sent to the community by the Department of Public Safety on Sunday, an unknown male approached and assaulted the student at 2:15 a.m. Saturday as she was retrieving the keys to enter her residence from her purse.
 
The suspect came up behind the victim and put his hand up her dress and underwear, according to the Metropolitan Police Department incident report.
 
The student fended off her attacker, who first fled north on 36th Street and then west on O Street, according to the incident report. The suspect is described as a white male, approximately 5-foot-9 inches tall, about 200 pounds, with dark hair and wearing a white T-shirt and blue pants. DPS Investigative Sgt. David Ruiz said there was no indication of whether or not the suspect is a student.
 
MPD and its sex crimes unit were notified, according to the PSA, and MPD is now leading the investigation. DPS provided the student with support materials and has followed up with her since the incident, Ruiz said.
