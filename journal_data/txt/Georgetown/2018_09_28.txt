Students and congressional alumni shared messages of support for Christine Blasey Ford after her Thursday testimony on Capitol Hill regarding allegations of sexual misconduct, but expressed unease about the greater implications of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s potential confirmation.
Ford and Kavanaugh testified Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Ford’s recent allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers.
Ford’s account came out following Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing Sept. 16; she accused him of sexually assaulting her in 1982, when she was 15 and he was 17. Kavanaugh has denied the accusations, along with two accusations that have surfaced since Ford’s came to light.
In the days leading up to Ford’s testimony, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick came forward with allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, and reports of Kavanaugh’s alleged heavy drinking in high school surfaced.
Georgetown alumni on the committee, Sens. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) (SFS ’66, LAW ’69), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) (LAW ’64), and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) (LAW ’78) all expressed support for Ford.
Ford testified first, describing the incident and the impact it had on her life. Ford could not remember several details about the party at which she said the incident occurred, such as exactly when or where it was, but said she could remember distinctly the feelings of Kavanaugh’s hand covering her mouth.
When Leahy asked Ford how certain she was that Kavanaugh was her assailant, Ford responded, “100 percent.”
H*yas for Choice President Angela Maske (COL ’19), Casey Doherty (COL ’20), Venishea Smith (COL ’21) and Andrew Straky (COL ’20) were among the Georgetown students who protested at the Capitol today. This comes after messages of support for Ford were written in chalk in red square last week.
Doherty went to the Capitol Thursday because she felt a responsibility to support Ford.
“I felt like I needed to be there to show support for Dr. Ford,” Doherty wrote in an email to The Hoya. “She is so courageous and deserves all the support in the world, and I wanted to be at least a small part of that. Dr. Ford has upended her life because she felt a responsibility to share her story.”
Kavanaugh testified next, saying that those on the left of the political spectrum have unfairly worked to prevent his confirmation.
“The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy,” Kavanaugh said. “Since my nomination in July, there has been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation.”
Durbin said Ford showed bravery in her testimony today, which he says will undoubtedly serve to empower survivors of sexual assault nationwide.
“Dr. Ford, no matter what happens with this hearing today, no matter what happens to this nomination, I know, and I hear from so many in my home state of Vermont there are millions of victims and survivors out there you have been inspired by your courage,” Leahy said. “We owe you a debt of gratitude for that, Doctor.”
Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) (CAS ’80), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) are still undecided as to how they will vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said.
The Judiciary Committee is set to vote Friday morning on whether to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination.
Doherty said Kavanaugh’s confirmation would send a harmful message to those watching.
“If Kavanaugh is confirmed to the highest court in the United States, the message to the public will be: Our lawmakers care more about upholding traditional structures of power and powerful men than listening to, respecting, and responding to survivors of sexual assault,” Doherty wrote. “It will hurt me, many people I know, and many more people I do not know irreparably.”
Maske, who has been regularly visiting the Senate office buildings to urge Collins to oppose Kavanaugh’s confirmation, said to Refinery 29 she went to the hearing to continue her opposition.
“I’m here in the Hart Senate Office Building to show that I stand with survivors and that Brett Kavanaugh should not be confirmed to the supreme court,” Maske told Refinery 29.
A spokesperson for H*yas for Choice said the organization firmly opposes Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court and praised Ford for her decision to come forth with her accusations.
“It is now even more clear that Kavanaugh cannot be confirmed to the Supreme Court—no person who has perpetrated sexual assault should sit on the nation’s highest court, or in any position of power, period,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Further, we would like to commend and acknowledge the bravery and selflessness demonstrated by Dr. Blasey Ford while she testified today.”
The members of GU Women of Color wrote in an email to The Hoya that they support Ford and worry about certain senators’ reaction to Ford’s testimony.
“We are in support of Dr. Ford and her authentic testimony and we hope that the Senate does not allow someone who can manipulate people and bodies into the Supreme Court,” GUWoC wrote. “However, it is unsettling to know that women of color are even less empowered to speak up about sexual assault and harassment because of the negligence apparent in the testimony.”
Georgetown University College Democrats President Maria Cornell (SFS ’20) said that what happens tomorrow at Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote will be a watershed moment for U.S. history.
“This is a very pivotal moment in American politics and on our campus as it represents how deeply embedded misogyny and rape culture are in our society,” Cornell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Especially when considering the accusations brought up against the previous GUSA president and conversations about sexual misconduct in the Catholic Church, this has been a very difficult time for students on campus, whether they are a survivor of sexual assault or not.”
Former Georgetown University Student Association President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) resigned on Sept. 11 amid allegations of sexual assault. No complaints had been filed against Nair through the Title IX office or the Office of Student Conduct, he wrote in a May 28 email to The Hoya. A university spokesperson confirmed that, as of May 2019, Nair was not the subject of any complaints through either office nor had he been found responsible for any violations of the Student Code of Conduct.
Georgetown University College Republicans were unavailable for comment.
Cornell hopes the university will begin to use its platform and address the current climate surrounding sexual assault.
“I hope that the University administration will end its quite deafening silence around what is happening both on and off campus and will start providing resources and spaces students and workers need to heal from this trauma,” Cornell wrote.
This article was updated July 2 to indicate the absence of Title IX or Office of Student Conduct complaints and to include comment from Nair.

The most embarrassing Georgetown headline of all during this sham hearing has been the tweet from SFS professor Christine Fair. Regarding the Senators defending Kavanaugh from the unproven allegations she wrote:
“Look at thus chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement. All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.”
Asked to comment, the university made the following statement: “Our policy does not prohibit speech based on the person presenting ideas or the content of those ideas, even when those ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable.”
Would they have made the same statement if her comment was made about any other group? Perhaps the school’s new Racial Justice Institute can look into that. 
Georgetown has quite a bit of audacity to call its many white male alumni asking for generous donations, while implicitly calling for their violent murder. This October, the university could use the exorcism of at least one evil spirit from its presence.

“The most embarrassing Georgetown headline of all … has been the tweet from SFS professor Christine Fair. ”

Georgetown University is set to begin faculty recruitment to launch the Institute for Racial Justice, a multidisciplinary research and advocacy organization, as part of a series of commitments the university made to racial equality.
The institute’s launch will mark the completion of University President John J. DeGioia’s commitments made in February 2016 to expand the university’s commitment to racial justice.
Other steps toward inclusivity included the establishment of an African American studies department, which was accomplished in June 2016, adding faculty to support these new institutions and the establishment of the Working Group on Racial Justice.
Georgetown is recruiting four faculty members for the institute, according to an email from the Office of the Provost sent Thursday morning.
The institute will be an outreach center to explore a range of racial inequities in health, education, income and employment, among other topics; it will bring together university scholars from Georgetown and other universities, according to the email. The university has not announced an official launch date.
On Oct. 4, 2017,  Robert Groves, provost and executive vice president, extended an invitation for proposals from departments across the university for ideas on confronting racial inequities.
The guidelines for proposals, which establish the goals each of the four new faculty members are to pursue, were based on themes established by the institute and the working group such as inequality and difference, and structures and solutions.
A university faculty committee selected four proposals from the department of health systems administration in the School of Nursing and Health Studies, the departments of performing arts and African American studies in Georgetown College, Georgetown University Law Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy to comprise the institute.
Christopher King, director of the health administration graduate program, drafted a proposal to inform Georgetown students and those outside the community about how health care systems can be made more equal.
“Our focus is making sure that the most vulnerable members of our population are cared for,” King said in an interview with The Hoya. “In a health care space, we’re teaching our students on how to be leaders with a focus on making sure that the most vulnerable individuals have access to quality health care. … We want our department to be perceived as a national leader in academia in helping health systems across the country apply racial justice lens in how they deliver care.”
In February 2016, DeGioia emphasized the need to confront the racial inequalities present in the United States, as well as on campus, at an address to the community.
“The moral imperative for complete social justice continues to summon us not to discussion but to action and that summons will not go away — we ignore social morality at our peril,” DeGioia said in his 2016 talk.
The Thursday email was written by the three executive vice presidents of the university’s main campus, Medical Center and Law Center, and it noted the university’s progress on tackling racial injustice since 2016, specifically with establishing a department of African American studies. The university also created a Working Group on Racial Justice to create a plan to address racial inequities.
“Georgetown has established a Department of African American Studies and hired three faculty members,” the email read. “Last year, we led a faculty advisory committee to solicit and review proposals—from departments across all of Georgetown’s campuses—for four faculty appointments that will be critical in the development of a new Institute for Racial Justice.”
While the faculty members have not yet been selected, all four departments chosen to head the institute have a clear vision of how to integrate racial justice within their respective concentrations.
The departments will “connect to the scores of scholars at Georgetown whose own scholarship relates to the social, economic, and health consequences of racial differences,” Groves wrote in a Sept. 12 blog post. “It will use, whenever possible, the Washington community as a partner in its work and through those partnerships solidify the University as a good citizen of the city.”
According to the post, the department of performing arts and the department of African American studies are working together in their approach because of the entwined history of activism and art.
“It is crucial to keep the very public role of the humanities and the arts at the heart of our work on transformative social justice, as an acknowledgement of the long history of African American engagement with arts as activism,” the departments wrote in their post.
The McCourt School of Public Policy proposal emphasized the need to look at the intersectionality of public policy and racial injustice.
“From public classrooms, to courtrooms, to voting booths, institutions meant to upheld the American ideals of ‘free and equal’ continue to be manipulated and corrupted,” the McCourt School wrote in the post.
Similarly, the Law Center focused on the civic implications of racial injustice, and department leaders reflected on the racially biased disparities within every step of the criminal justice system.
“Too often, we are reminded that the actions of the US justice system—from law enforcement, prosecution, trial outcomes, and incarceration—tend to vary by the race of the person experiencing the system,” the Law Center wrote in the post.
King urged each scholar to use their voice to help shape the continued discussion of difficult issues on Georgetown’s campuses, such as racial inequities.
“We see this person as a key player and facilitator in discourse and stimulating synergy upon this campus with a focus on racial equity,” King said. “We see this resource as someone who can connect faculty and scholars to renowned content experts in the racial justice space. We’re also looking forward to this person informing curricula.”

Students can now request absentee ballots through a voter drop box system implemented in Residence Hall Offices across campus as part of an ongoing effort headed by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service.
The student-led voter registration initiative, called GU Votes, aims to simplify the voting process and increase student turnout rates on Election Day.
The drop box system launched Sept. 24, and boxes will be checked nightly by GU Votes volunteers for absentee ballot requests through late-October.
The development is part of GU Votes’ attempt to register students to vote in the upcoming Nov. 6 elections. Prior to the 2016 election, 90.4 percent of Georgetown students were registered to vote, with 71.1 percent of registered students turning out to vote, resulting in an overall Georgetown student turnout rate of 64.2 percent, according to a 2016 report by the National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement.
Since the initiative was launched, GU Votes has helped either register or get absentee ballots for over a third of undergraduate students, according to GU Votes Co-President Andrew Straky (COL ’20).
Conveniently located in RHOs, the drop boxes simplify the process of requesting an absentee ballot for many students interested in voting, Straky said in an interview with The Hoya.
The typical process of casting your vote involves filling out a state-specific absentee ballot request form, printing out and mailing the form, receiving the ballot in the mail, and then mailing the ballot back to a state or local registrar office.
GU Votes hopes to reach every student on campus, Straky said.
“We’re going to effectively reach every single Georgetown student at the undergraduate and graduate level, and it would not be possible without the level of support in Georgetown voter engagement across the board,” Straky said. “It’s something that everyone can get behind, and we’re just happy that we have the opportunity to be able to facilitate that process.”
In partnership with the Office of Residential Living, GU Votes is providing pre-stamped envelopes at six RHO drop box locations, eliminating one step of the process. Ballot requests can also be dropped off at the GU Politics office located in Healy Hall.
“Very few students know where you can buy a stamp on this campus, so that in itself can prevent a lot of people from voting,” Straky said. “If you’re passing by an RHO several times a week, there’s no reason why you can’t take the time to log on and vote if you’re interested in doing so.”
Housed in the GU Politics office in the basement of Healy, GU Votes is funded by the Andrew Goodman Foundation, which works to inspire young voters; the Georgetown University Student Association; the Office of Student Affairs; and the Office of Federal Relations.
GU Votes was founded in 2015 with the mission of registering more voters and increasing political participation on campus. It organized its first “Storm the Dorms” event in the fall leading up to the 2016 presidential election between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
One barrier preventing registered students from voting is the early deadline to submit an absentee ballot, which often comes 25 days before Election Day, Straky said.
“Voting deadlines are often 25 days or more before Election Day so it makes it very difficult for students who don’t even realize that it’s mid-October and it’s already too late to vote,” Straky said.
The addition of the drop box system and the inclusion of pre-stamped envelopes removes obstacles that may prevent students from participating in the 2018 election, Georgetown University College Republicans President Jake Lyons (COL ’20) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“GU Votes was a great resource to students during the 2016 cycle, but have improved by breaking down even more barriers that may prevent Hoyas from being able to vote in November,” Lyons wrote. “Having simple things like letters and stamps, a drop off box, and a responsive GU Votes community who will answer any question you might have makes a profound impact on the ability for Hoyas to vote.”
GU Votes also held a “Storm the Dorms” event Sept. 25, which was National Voter Registration Day, to push voter registration and turnout. Fifty volunteers from student groups across campus, including Georgetown University College Democrats and GUCR, tabled inside freshman dorms, the Southwest Quad and the Leavey Center.
Volunteers helped students register to vote, check their voter registration status, fill out an absentee ballot request form and view the candidates on their specific ballot through the GU Votes student portal, a website outlining the voter registration process for students.
“Storm the Dorms” is crucial in reminding students to register to vote, GUCD Director of Campaigning and Off-Campus Affairs Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21) said in an interview with The Hoya.
“Especially during this time when there are midterms happening, it can be really difficult for college students to have anything on their minds but that,” Hollister said. “We’re definitely focused on getting people registered to vote because the work we do at College Democrats would mean nothing if people don’t actually vote.”
Community outreach events like “Storm the Dorms” is part of the ongoing effort to encourage civic engagement, GU Votes Co-President Jacqueline Beveridge (SFS ’19) said in an interview with The Hoya.
“One of our goals is to create a civic engagement ecosystem and voter engagement within the campus community,” Beveridge said. “Something like ‘Storm the Dorms’ really brings the campus together to unite around National Voter Registration Day.”
Ongoing support from the university and student groups enable voter registration efforts to have a wide reach across the student body, Straky said.
Although student groups are traditionally not allowed to table inside the residential communities, the Office of Residential Living has granted special permission for voter registration drives, according to Straky.
GU Politics plans to continue offering support to the student-led initiative in the future, according to Jennifer Solorio, GU Politics manager, student engagement and logistics.
“GU Politics is proud to be the home of GU Votes,” Solorio wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We’re definitely going to keep supporting this project long-term, we are so proud that students run the initiative, and thrilled that this has truly become a community effort.”
Moving forward, GU Votes hopes to better integrate voter registration both on campus and in the greater D.C. community, Beveridge said.
“One thing that has been in the back of our minds, and we’re trying to figure out how to do it, is reaching out to the larger Georgetown community beyond the gates,” Beveridge said. “That is really an important step forward because Georgetown is such an open campus and we do engage with the larger Georgetown and D.C. community.”
Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated 64.2 percent was the nationwide student turnout rate.

A team of Georgetown undergraduate students and professors helped exonerate Valentino Dixon, who spent 26 years in prison after being found guilty of murder, on Sept. 19.
Three undergraduate students in professor Marc Howard’s spring 2018 “Prison Reform Project” seminar assisted with the case, unearthing new evidence that led to Dixon’s release. Dixon was convicted in 1992 for the murder of Torriano Jackson in Buffalo, N.Y., and released Sept. 19, 2018, from the maximum security Attica Correctional Facility.
“The Georgetown students made me a believer that anything is possible — and that justice can be done,” Dixon said in a Sept. 19 news release.
The three students who studied the case, Julie Fragonas and Naoya Johnson, who both attended Georgetown as part of a study abroad program, and Isobella Goonetillake (COL ’18) worked alongside forensic and legal professionals to investigate the case. They produced social media content, a website and a documentary outlining the details of the case and their findings.
Fragonas said the work she did on the case changed her perspective on the criminal justice system and the impact she could have.
“Meeting Valentino and the rest of his family made me understand the power of strength and dedication,” Fragonas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think it made me realize the realities of the system. Never will I ever see a prisoner the same from now on.”
The “Prison Reform Project” seminar, taught by Howard and adjunct professor Martin Tankleff, brought together 16 undergraduate students to tackle four cases of wrongful conviction. Tankleff himself is an exoneree and served 17 years for his parents’ murder before his 2007 release. Howard and Tankleff are lifelong friends, and Tankleff’s experience led to Howard’s interest in wrongful convictions and pushed him to begin teaching the seminar.
“One of the reasons I was interested in wrongful convictions is because my childhood friend Marty Tankleff — who co-taught the course with me — was, himself, wrongfully convicted, and I was part of a team that pushed and eventually succeeded in getting him exonerated,” Howard said in an interview with The Hoya. “So, it was very personal, and I really understood deeply how hard it is, how painful it is, for someone to be wrongfully convicted, and how difficult it is to get that person exonerated.”
Tankleff said the opportunity to teach the seminar at Georgetown and participate in the processes of tackling other cases of wrongful convictions is important and meaningful to him. The goal of the class, according to Tankleff, is to produce a successful outcome in all four of the cases studied in the class.
“The ultimate goal would be to get at least one person out, but our goal now is to really have success in all four of our cases,” Tankleff said in an interview with The Hoya. “And we believe this is absolutely possible because we believe that our students, in conjunction with the experts who work on the cases, really uncovered some great evidence.”
Both Howard and Tankleff said the amount of work the students did was extraordinary and showed dedication to the overarching goal of the seminar: to help those who have been wrongfully convicted.
“This was something they invested all of their heart and soul and energy and blood, sweat and tears because they realized that another person’s life was at stake, and they took it really seriously,” Howard said. “They were really fully invested in his case, and that’s what you have to do if you want to get someone exonerated.”
Tankleff said the students, by doing the work necessary to exonerate a person, defied many common expectations about undergraduates’ ability and dedication and highlighted the impact the students’ efforts had on Dixon’s life.
“People said it can’t be done; I think we just proved them wrong,” Tankleff said. “They gave someone their life back, which is kind of incredible.”
One of Dixon’s lawyers, Donald Thompson, said the Georgetown students’ work was instrumental in calling attention to Dixon’s case and providing additional resources and information that were key in his release.
“It generated some great interview videos with a number of people that I never expected they would be able to talk to — the trial prosecutor being one of them — and in the course of the interview with the trial prosecutor, got him to represent that, in fact, there was gunpowder residue testing at the time of trial that was negative for Mr. Dixon’s clothing or hands or whatever,” Thompson said in an interview with The Hoya. “There was never any disclosure of gunpowder residue testing at the time of trial. There were never any results from any gunpowder residue testing at the time of trial.”
These negative gunpowder residue test results for Dixon were crucial in his exoneration.
Thompson also said that he was encouraged by the investigation done by the Erie County District Attorney’s Office’s investigation that ultimately led to Dixon’s exoneration, and he hopes that this case can serve as a model to other district attorney’s offices looking to improve their handling of wrongful conviction cases.
“If you frankly and without fear search for the truth, no matter whom it hurts or helps, you may get to the bottom of it, and you may be instrumental in righting a wrong,” Thompson said.
Howard said that, although he, Tankleff and the course’s students were thrilled by Dixon’s exoneration, there is still much more work to be done.
“We’re happy, but we’ve got so much more work to do because our criminal justice system is bankrupt, and we’re doing one small part in trying to fix it,” Howard said.

This effort led by Marc Howard exemplifies what is best about Georgetown and makes me think of the words spoken by one of my favorite Jesuits – Rev Howard Gray in his final lecture at Georgetown – “The Centrality of the Good Person in Jesuit Education” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLdRUEc6drc#action=share

Catholic clergy cannot be trusted to initiate meaningful reforms combatting widespread clerical abuse, leaving the responsibility to lay people, former federal prosecutor and original member of the National Review Board for the Protection of Children and Young People Robert Bennett (CAS ’61, LAW ’64) said at an event in Gaston Hall on Tuesday.
The Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life hosted an event titled “Confronting a Moral Catastrophe: Lay Leadership, Catholic Social Teaching, and the Sexual Abuse Crisis,” at which Bennett sat on a panel of lay people, members of the church who are not clergy, sharing their reactions following revelations of clerical abuse this summer.
The panel also featured Kevin Byrnes, a former criminal trial attorney and survivor of clerical abuse; Karen Tumulty, a columnist for The Washington Post; and Dawn Eden Goldstein, a theologian. John Carr, director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Pubic Life, moderated the discussion.
Former Cardinal and Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C. Theodore McCarrick resigned this summer amid mounting allegations of sexual misconduct, which an investigation by the Archdiocese of New York found credible. Less than a month after McCarrick’s resignation, a Pennsylvania grand jury report released in August detailed seven decades’ worth of sexual misconduct in Pennsylvania churches and the Catholic Church’s efforts to cover up the potential scandals.
Bennett said the leadership of the Catholic Church simply will not change unless it is forced to change.
“Until the laity takes on the hierarchy, there’s never ever going to be a change,” Bennett said. “What I found was an attitude on the part of the bishops of ‘Well, we’ve been around for a thousand years, and this too will pass.’”
Tumulty said that she does yet believe the church is even willing to take full responsibility at this time for the ‘moral catastrophe’ it has created.
“I’m just not sure yet that the leadership of the church is ready to, first of all, share power with the laity as much as they give lip service to that, and, second of all, really themselves confront the damage they have done to our church,” Tumulty said.
Bennett said the hierarchy of the church, especially in its higher levels, will protect itself against efforts to enact reforms necessary to stop clerical abuse.
“It’s a very selective men’s club, mostly all white, mostly old,” Bennett said. “They resist change. They have some sort of an inherent dislike of women, except for the blessed mother maybe.”
Tumulty said that she also doubts the ability of church leadership to handle the crisis but that she does not have faith the hierarchy will allow lay people to receive greater authority.
“I’m not sure that the church leadership is really going to do that because that means giving up power, which seems to be a very difficult thing to do,” Tumulty said.
Tumulty explained that frustration with the church stems in large part from its failure to take significant punitive action against abusers within the Catholic Church.
“Most lay people, they don’t want to hear about canon law, until we feel that the church is doing the first thing, which is dealing with the kind of law that puts people in jail,” Tumulty said.
Byrnes, speaking of his own experiences of clerical abuse, said it represented a massive betrayal of the faith.
“In Catholicism, we call our priests fathers,” Byrnes said. “Any father that will not protect his children or will abuse them has no right to wear a collar.”
Byrnes said it permanently altered his life, contributed to self-destructive behaviors and irrevocably damaged his faith.
“I’m just not sure I can convey to you what a horrible experience it is to wake up in the middle of the night, thinking one thought and one thought only from the Bible,” Byrnes said. “‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me.’”
Still, Goldstein said she, a survivor of sexual abuse, converted to Catholicism believing both in its teaching and in the church’s ability to change.
“What I realized is that if every human being on earth believed and practiced what the Catholic Church teaches on human dignity, I wouldn’t have suffered abuse,” Goldstein said. “No one would have suffered abuse.”
Goldstein said she converted, despite the scandals, because she had faith in the church’s potential to grow.
“Only on the inside, with that faith and strengthened by the sacraments, could I be part of the solution,” she said.
Bennett echoed that change is not impossible, but that action must occur from outside the church hierarchy.
“What we have to do is realize that we are the church,” Bennett said. “They’re not the church. We are the church.”

Nearly 50 people gathered in Red Square to demonstrate their support for Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, two women who made allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, as part of a nationwide protest at 1 p.m. Monday.
Over 19,000 Facebook users said they were “going” to the “National Walk Out: Support Dr. Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez” event, organized by 24 political interest groups, including Queer People of Color, GU Women of Color and Black Student Alliance. The Facebook event for the national walkout encouraged those in D.C to join protesters in the Senate Hart Atrium. Participants walked from there to the Supreme Court for a “National Speakout.”
The Georgetown walkout was planned by GU Women of Color, the Black Student Alliance and Queer People of Color.
As sexual assault is an issue affecting women from across different identities and backgrounds, it was necessary for GUWoC to help organize the walkout, GUWoC President Shakera Vaughan (COL ’19) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Being that GUWoC’s mission centers around supporting, encouraging, and uplifting women, we wanted to be intentional in making sure that encompassed the many issues and barriers that women face,” Vaughan wrote. “This, of course, includes sexual assault.”
Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez shared allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh in The Washington Post and the New Yorker, respectively. Julie Swetnick brought forward her own allegations two days after the walkout.
Stories of sexual violence shared by women at Georgetown and across the country helped motivate students to organize the walkout on campus, former BSA member Kylen Small (COL ’18) said in the event’s opening speech.
“2018 has been a year of cases coming to light and survivors bravely coming forward, and we want to start the school year right by echoing calls for justice,” Small said.
Students and faculty present at the walkout observed a moment of silence for victims of sexual assault at Georgetown.
The 20-minute walkout was an opportunity for survivors and allies to stand in solidarity on instances of sexual assault, Vaughan said.
“In a time where sexual assault instances are being highly publicized at the Hilltop, it is critical that survivors of sexual assault know that they are supported, believed, and loved,” Vaughan wrote. “This walk out was especially important for Georgetown students because it allowed for a physical visualization of other students expressing solidarity on such a sensitive and emotional topic.”
The walkout protested incidents of sexual assault affecting a wide variety of people, Small said.
“From governing figures to Hollywood executives, our day-to-day relationships, we as students say no to more silence,” Small said in her speech. “When the most intimate boundaries of men and women and gender non-conforming folks are being crossed, we say no.”
After Small finished speaking, several students took turns sharing their thoughts. One survivor thanked the crowd for walking out, and other students offered words of encouragement for survivors and those gathered.
Vaughan said that GUWoC hopes to hold a “Sexual Assault Survivor’s Dinner” later in the fall semester for survivors on campus.

Georgetown University Student Association Senate elections, set for Sept. 30, include 33 candidates running for 14 open positions.
The open seats include seven vacant spots for freshmen, four at-large seats available to students from all years, and three open seats for senators from the junior class. Vacancies for the class of 2020 resulted from the appointment of former transition chair of the senate Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) as president Sept. 16, and from senator Josh Sirois (SFS ’20) being abroad for the fall semester.
Former GUSA President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) resigned Sept. 11 amid misconduct allegations. Senior members of the GUSA executive, including former Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) and former Chief of Staff Aaron Bennett (COL ’19), resigned Sept. 14, prompting Martinez’s presidency.
No complaints had been filed against Nair through the Title IX office or the Office of Student Conduct, he wrote in a May 28 email to The Hoya. A university spokesperson confirmed that, as of May 2019, Nair was not the subject of any complaints through either office nor had he been found responsible for any violations of the Student Code of Conduct.
Chad Gasman (COL ’20) resigned from the Senate after the executive resignations, creating another senate seat vacancy for the junior class.
“I left for mental health reasons primarily,” Gasman said. “As a survivor, the situation was too much to continue to be a part of GUSA.”
Despite Gasman’s resignation, they expressed confidence in Martinez’s ability to move GUSA forward.
“I wholeheartedly trust Juan to push GUSA in the right direction,” Gasman said.
Winston Ardoin (SFS ’21), a candidate running for an at-large position, said the surfacing of the allegations against Nair almost dissuaded him from running this semester.
“The recent events actually led me to think about not running,” Ardoin wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Senate candidate Alec Camhi (COL ’20), who is running for one of the junior class senate seats, believes this election will be challenging for some senate candidates.
“I think that this would’ve actually been an easier [election] to sit out than get into,” Camhi said. “It’d be easy to kind of keep an arm’s length from the fight.”
Ardoin is concerned that the GUSA executive resignations may have been many Georgetown students’ first large-scale exposure to GUSA and its representatives.
“Before the recent events, I cannot say that I thought many people even knew or understood what GUSA did,” Ardoin wrote. “Quite frankly, this event has, for the first time, introduced many to the world of our student government. Sadly, these events highlight many of the negative factors both in our school as a whole and in our student government.”
The resignation of the executive might inspire more students to vote in the GUSA senate elections this fall, Graisnt Castle, Vice Chairman of the GUSA Election Commission, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“With heightened news and scrutiny of GUSA, I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw higher turnout than normal this fall,” Castle wrote. “The Election Commission has remained committed, since the beginning of the resignations and recent events in GUSA, to ensuring that the Senate elections take place as planned.”
Zaki Thabet (SFS ’21), a candidate running for an at-large position, decided to run for senate after the resignations. Thabet created a platform on the idea of a more transparent GUSA.
“In order for GUSA to get any kind of good reputation back, they really need to be focused on outreach and on reaching students where they stand on campus, and not forcing students to go to GUSA to find out more,” Thabet said in an interview with The Hoya.
Elections for the senate of the Georgetown University Student Association will take place Sept. 30. Fourteen seats are open this semester.
This article was updated June 23 to indicate the absence of Title IX or Office of Student Conduct complaints against Nair and to include comment from Nair.

Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and Metropolitan Police Department Chief Peter Newsham announced a new policy aimed at reducing the number of Washington, D.C. residents taken into custody for public consumption of marijuana in a Sept. 21 news release.
Under the new policy, arrests made in connection to public marijuana usage, for those who are eligible, will result in field arrest citations — formally referred to as Form PD 61-D — rather than custodial arrests, which involve detention by law enforcement officers.
The change in protocol will allow MPD to allocate time and resources toward other public safety measures, Bowser said in the Sept. 21 news release.
“We cherish the trust we have built between residents and the police,” Bowser said. “This policy will reduce the number of people who are taken into custody and allow us to better focus our efforts and resources on building a safer, stronger D.C.”
Issuing a citation was an option to be used at police officers’ discretion in the past, but the new policy now makes it mandatory to exercise a non-custodial arrest.
The policy will reduce the conflict associated with a marijuana consumption arrest, Executive Director of the MPD Strategic Change Division Kelly O’Meara said in an interview with The Hoya.
“Generally, what is the most problematic in the police interaction is taking somebody into custody, putting the handcuffs on somebody,” O’Meara said. “If we don’t have to do that, if they can just report later, that removes that point of conflict.”
Under the new standard, issuing a citation requires the person under non-custodial arrest to report to a police station within 15 days to complete processing of the field arrest, including booking and fingerprinting. The case can then either end immediately through the payment of a $25 fine or can be taken to court, according to MPD.
While possession charges of marijuana have plummeted since 2013, marijuana distribution charges have increased almost 300 percent in the district since its decriminalization, according to O’Meara. Public consumption charges of marijuana have increased to 265 in 2017 from 99 arrests in 2014.
People who are ineligible for non-custodial arrest for public consumption of marijuana include juveniles, individuals with outstanding warrants and people who may have damaged property or caused injury or harm to themselves or others, according to the Sept. 21 news release.
The announcement of the new policy is the most recent development in the Bowser administration’s campaign to reduce the legal consequences of recreational drug use, an effort that continues a trend toward decriminalization of marijuana in the District.
Marijuana in quantities of one ounce or less for personal recreational use was decriminalized in July 2014 through the Marijuana Possession Decriminalization Amendment Act of 2014. When Bowser tookoffice in 2015, she passed Initiative 71, which legalized the drug in quantities of two ounces or less.
Custodial arrests for marijuana consumption were important to resolve as MPD seeks to improve D.C. residents’ quality of life, O’Meara said.
“One of the things we recognize is we need to be able to prioritize the most serious crimes and work with the community to address what are quality of life issues,” O’Meara said. “The public consumption of marijuana is definitely a quality of life issue and it’s very important to our communities, but we want to make sure that we can resolve the charge in the best manner possible.”

Andrew Steigman, a professor and associate dean in the School of Foreign Service for over twenty years, died Sept. 7 after a stroke in August. Steigman was born in 1933.
Before coming to Georgetown University as a professor in the practice of diplomacy in 1985, Steigman spent 27 years as a foreign service officer. Steigman served several posts in Africa, including as U.S. ambassador to Gabon and to Sao Tome and Principe between 1975 and 1977. 
Steigman is from Mountain View, Calif., and attended Princeton University, graduating summa cum laude and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa, a prestigious undergraduate honor society, in 1954. After graduation, Steigman was a Fulbright Scholar at the London School of Economics, where he studied international relations. 
Steigman first became interested in political affairs in Africa while studying in London, he said in a 1998 interview with the Library of Congress for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Program. Princeton had no courses on Africa at the time, he said, so he began studying the continent to fill his knowledge gaps. Steigman said that the experience drew him toward working in the region.
“I came into the Foreign Service with an eye on Africa clearly,” Steigman said in the interview. “I already had the interest in Africa.”
Steigman entered the Foreign Service in April 1958 and served foreign postings, in addition to his ambassadorships, in the Republic of Congo, Libya, France and Nigeria over the course of his career. His wife, Meryl Steigman, who died in 2017, joined him at these posts. 
Andrew and Meryl Steigman were married in 1959, and had two children, according to Volume 60 of the Princeton Alumni Weekly. Meryl also worked on international affairs, working with the State Department to write and edit reports on issues affecting women in the foreign service, according to the Bulgarian-American Society, which she worked with. 
Upon retiring from the Foreign Service in 1985, Steigman joined the SFS. He said in the Library of Congress interview that this career move was one of his best decisions. 
“And then what turned out to be perhaps in some ways one of the most useful things I ever did, I came over to Georgetown as diplomat-in-residence and found a new home,” Steigman said. 
With his extensive experience in the Foreign Service, Steigman took on a role as a counselor to mentor those interested in similar work. For 25 years, Steigman oversaw the Friends of the School of Foreign Service, a networking opportunity for SFS undergraduates to meet with professionals in their fields of interest. 
“Steigman had an amazing impact on hundreds of students in the School of Foreign Service,” the SFS wrote in a news release. “He served as a committed administrator and enthusiastic academic adviser.”
As an associate dean in the SFS, Steigman served as an academic adviser, mentoring students on their career paths and in completing applications for scholarships, such as the Fulbright and Carnegie and Mellon fellowships, according to the SFS news release. 
Steigman also stayed involved with the Washington, D.C., chapter of Phi Beta Kappa  throughout his life, serving as president from 2008 to 2010 and as interim president from 2012 to 2013, according to the D.C. Area Phi Beta Kappa Association. Steigman also was chapter secretary for Georgetown University’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, and made a point to ensure SFS graduates were represented after they graduated, according to the SFS news release. 
Steigman is survived by his daughter, Daria Steigman, who lives in D.C., his son, Jonathan Steigman, who lives in Mountain View and his grandson, Daniel Steigman, according to an obituary published in The Washington Post.

The U.S. Department of Energy awarded a $4.5 million grant to Georgetown University physics professor James Freericks and a team of academics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, to research how X-rays can be used in solids, according to a Sept. 13 news release.
The study will focus on the Linac Coherent Light Source, a machine at Stanford that delivers powerful and quick x-ray pulses. The machine is currently under development and will ideally be functional within the next two years, according to the news release.
“I have been working in this general field for over a decade,” Freericks wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But this work takes me much more directly into experiments with X-rays which I have less experience with.”
Because of the relatively new nature of the field, little is known about how the continued quantum systems will respond to the experimental choices the researchers make, Freericks said. Machines like the LCLS are just now enabling research on this to occur.
The technology will allow the research team to study how X-rays can be used in solids, Freericks said.
“The simplest analogy is to think of hitting a matXRAYSerial with a really big hammer and then watching how it changes at distinct times afterwards,” Freericks wrote. “They allow us to measure how materials change their energy by exchanging it … after they have been highly excited. These types of require everything to be done really, really fast. This has only become possible recently with machines like LCLS being built.”
A portion of the grant funds will be used to fund a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow to work in Freericks’s lab for the next three years.
Freericks is slated to be the team’s theorist and will be responsible for putting the theory behind the experiments into practice.
Freericks is also on teams for two other projects that recently earned grants from the Department of Energy to study quantum computing, a field that “represents the next frontier in the Information Age,” Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said in a DOE press release.
Freericks’ other DOE-funded project supports research to provide faster quantum algorithms, which can help explain how electrons move. Georgetown will receive $500,000 of the four-year, $8 million grant to help fund a graduate student working in the lab.
“[Freericks] is one of the world’s experts in developing theory for describing these types of novel and important experiments,” professor Jeffrey Urbach, chair of the physics department, wrote in an email to The Hoya.  “This funding will support extending that work into a new area where the experiments are using X-rays as the probes.”
The LCLS X-ray research has important implications for everyday life, Freericks said. Many of the electronics people use in their daily lives operate based on the nonequilibrium effects that he and other researches study, he said.
“It’s a great example of the kind of thing that can happen when Georgetown scientists team up with leading researchers from other top institutions,” Urbach wrote.

An entertainment and sports arena set to house Washington, D.C. professional women’s basketball team the Washington Mystics, as well as NBA G-League team Capital City Go-Go, opened Sept. 22 in Congress Heights and is anticipated to bring jobs and increased economic opportunities to residents of the neighborhood.
The opening of the $65 million arena offers the District more than just a new sports facility, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said in a Sept. 22 news release.
“The Entertainment and Sports Arena is the home our Mystics deserve. But this project is even bigger than basketball,” Bowser said. “The ESA is about jobs, opportunity, and community; it’s about ensuring that every neighborhood, in every corner of our city has world-class housing and amenities.”
The ESA also serves as the official practice facility for D.C. professional men’s basketball team, the Washington Wizards. The Wizards will continue playing their home games at the Capital One Arena, located in Chinatown.
The construction of the new arena is a rare development effort in the Congress Heights neighborhood, which often gets passed over, according to The Washington Post.
The venue was built on the former site of the St. Elizabeth’s East Hospital as a District-led effort to revitalize the neighborhood. The arena is anticipated to create almost 3,000 jobs for community members, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Brian Kenner told The Washington Post.
The Bowser administration announced its plans to construct the ESA in 2015 as part of an initiative to increase economic prosperity in the surrounding neighborhood. The initiative is in partnership with the District’s convention and sports authority, Events D.C., and sports company Monumental Sports & Entertainment.
Monumental Sports & Entertainment, owner and operator of the Washington Capitals, Wizards, Mystics and Capital One Arena, has pledged to invest $10 million in Congress Heights over the next 19 years of its contract on the property, according to NBC.
Bowser was joined at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the arena by Kenner, Ward 8 councilmember Trayon White, officials from Events D.C. and representatives from Monumental Sports & Entertainment, according to the Sept. 22 news release.
Although the District owns the arena, officials from Events D.C. will manage the day-to-day programming of the ESA, according to Washingtonian.
The 4,200-seat arena will feature cultural and community events for citizens in addition to economic opportunity, said President and Chief Executive Officer of Events D.C. Gregory A. O’Dell in a Sept. 22 news release.
“Similar to some of our other venues like the Walter E. Washington Convention Center and Nationals Park, this arena is important not only for the attraction of new events and experiences to the city, but for DC’s greater economic development and job creation,” O’Dell said.
The ESA will host a variety of entertainment events ranging from sports games to musical performances, O’Dell said in a Sept. 22 news release.
“We look forward to delivering unmatched event programming from esports and boxing to amateur sports and electrifying concerts – starting with our grand opening celebration blockbuster lineup,” O’Dell said.
The venue will host its grand opening concert featuring R&B artist Mary J. Blige and singer-songwriter Jacob Banks on Saturday, Oct. 6. Popular American bands Cage the Elephant and Judah & the Lion are set to perform at the arena’s second grand opening ceremony the following week on Oct. 13.
Other future events will include the semifinals of a mixed martial arts Professional Fighters League in October, as well as the Colonial Athletic Association’s men’s basketball tournament games from 2020 through 2022.
The ESA and other development efforts are expected to bring Congress Heights economic prosperity similar to that of other D.C. neighborhoods, Ward 8 Advisory Neighborhood Commission Chairperson Mary Cuthbert told The Washington Post.
“Development has been very slow and very rare, and that’s why we’re so excited about it,” Cuthbert said. “It’s going to change the whole neighborhood completely. Just as all the other neighborhoods in Washington, D.C., have changed, this too will change.”
