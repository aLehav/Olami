For many artists whose stardom began during their childhood, fans worry that their sound and image will change so drastically that they will never again create music like that which first made them popular. Teen legend Brandy Norwood, however, has released five records over 15 years that have blended the genres of hip-hop, blues,funktronica and pop. Now, Brandy has returned to her R&B roots in her sixth studio album, Two Eleven —  proving that Cinderella can still rock the same glass slippers but now in this season’s latest style.
Two Eleven hits the airwaves after her unsuccessful urban pop record Human in 2008. A reference to her Feb. 11 birth date, the album’s title also pays tribute to Whitney Houston, who died on the same day this year. Dealing with the themes of rebirth and renewal, Brandy draws from some of her life’s disappointments — like breaking off her engagement to NBA guard Quentin Richardson in 2005 and causing a car accident in 2006 — and applies her pain  to the music. No longer the young girl from her earliest albums who is unsure of her feelings, Brandy is a mature woman who expresses her love in a contemplative, poignant way and communicates her remorse and desire to move forward.
In “Without You,” “No Such Thing As Too Late” and “Hardly Breathing,” Brandy showcases her vocal range and portrays the emotions associated with each stage of relationships with simple yet meaningful lyrics. Combined with soft beats and soulful harmonies, all three singles allow the listener to relate to the singer’s message. They present a stark contrast to her earlier R&B hits whose head-bopping rhythms drowned out any sense of significance in the lyrics.
Brandy also collaborated with DJ Bangladesh and singer Chris Brown for a few of the album’s tracks, adding somewhat of a hip-hop flair to her collection of smooth tunes. In “Put It Down,” her collaboration with Brown, she performs an up-tempo rap. Of the two tracks produced by Bangladesh, “Let Me Go” stands out as a potential radio hit. Fusing Brandy’s and Swedish sensation Lykke Li’s music, Bangladesh produces a club-style single that mixes ethnic pop melodies with the soft pulsing of R&B.
Two Eleven will please those who enjoy Brandy’s old music in that it retains her classic R&B style. However, by presenting contemplative lyrics and displaying her incredible, matured vocal range, Brandy proves that she is no longer the naive teenager she played in “Moesha.”

MTV filmed live from campus, allowing students to pose questions to the presidential candidates in Healy Circle Friday afternoon.
MTV News correspondent Andrew Jenks interviewed nearly 40 students, who were selected through a short application on Wed. The student questions corresponded to a a live online segment of a televised interview with President Barack Obama.
Jenks invited students to ask questions during the online show, which were then relayed to MTV News Correspondent Sway Calloway, so he could incorporate them into his interview of President Obama at the White House.
Student questions focused on renewable energy, women’s issues, gay rights and the economy.
MTV spokesperson Janice Gatti said the network was immediately drawn to Georgetown when trying to choose a location.
“The university hosts a diverse range of incredibly talented, bright students, and the campus itself offers a great backdrop for the special,” she said.
Director of Media Relations for the university Rachel Pugh said that Georgetown was approached earlier this week to play host to the event. MTV explored the other universities in the District as well.
“We believe this represents an opportunity to showcase the diversity and depth of opinions of Georgetown’s student body to a national audience, primarily of young people,” Pugh said. “It represents a unique experience for our students to continue to engage in our political process as they make decisions about whom to support in the Presidential election,” Pugh said.
Jenks echoed Pugh’s sentiments.
“I was impressed at how articulate everyone was,” Jenks said. “They knew the issues and were very specific in what they wanted to hear from the President.”

The university activated the emergency response team in preparation for possible inclement weather early this week, according to a broadcast email sent by Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Christopher Augostini Friday afternoon.
The community will be updated through the HOYAlert emergency notification system about the progress of Hurricane Sandy and any delays or closings.
According to the email, emergency generators are in working order; however, they do not guarantee power to all buildings. Sellinger Lounge will be open in case of a power outage.
Augostini urged all students should remain in a designated safe space and cooperate with emergency personnel.

Comedian Carl Reiner (SFS ’43) received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Georgetown at a ceremony at the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills, Calif., Tuesday.
Reiner, who came to Georgetown to study French as part of the Army Specialized Training Program, is the creator of “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and a director and producer of many successful comedies.
University President John J. DeGioia presented him with the degree, and Associate Dean Bernard Cook (C ’90) read the degree citation.
“His genius has always been to serve the joke, the laugh — never to demand the spotlight,” Cook read from the citation.
Reiner recalled his time impersonating his professors during comedy shows in Gaston Hall as some of his finest comedic moments.
“I’m watching everything here, and I realize, ‘I’ve done it,’” he said. “If I don’t get a laugh tonight, it means I’m finished, right? I can’t top any of that, so I won’t try.”

A rash of thefts hit Yates Field House this month, with five incidents occurring over a two-week period.
In contrast, seven thefts at Yates were reported to the Department of Public Safety between January and September. Similarly, in past years there have been few thefts reported at the location during the month of October. In 2010 and 2011, no thefts were reported at Yates in that month, and only one was reported in October 2009.
Overall, theft has not spiked significantly on campus this month. A total of 18 incidents have occurred through Oct. 24; in comparison, 19 thefts had been reported last month through Sept. 24.
Each victim of theft at Yates within the last month had property stolen from a locker, according to DPS records. Four reports indicated that items were stolen from an unsecured locker, while one report did not specify whether or not the locker was secured.
Among the items stolen from the lockers were wallets, a sweatshirt, school supplies and other unspecified property. Four of the thefts occurred between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m.
Kaitlin Carano (COL ’13) had her wallet stolen from her backpack in the women’s locker room Oct. 16 between 4:50 p.m. and 5:50 p.m. Despite having her laptop in the same bag as her wallet, her laptop was left untouched.
Carano said that while it is difficult to ensure security in a locker room, she thinks more can be done to prevent theft at the field house.
“I talked to DPS, and they had had a few of these thefts happen, and they said the hard thing is that they can’t put cameras in [the locker rooms],” she said. According to Carano, she was not aware of a theft problem because it hasn’t been publicized. “I go to Yates all the time, and I’ve never had a problem.”
Carano suggested that increasing awareness about thefts from the location would be helpful in preventing future crimes and that Yates should continue to advertise the ease of renting a locker or encourage members to bring a personal lock to secure their belongings.
All of the theft cases are still pending investigation, according to the DPS website.
Representatives of DPS did not respond to requests for comment.

Talk show host Chris Matthews spoke about bipartisanshipand political cooperation in Lohrfink Auditorium Thursday evening.
The lecture, “Making Politics Work,” was co-sponsored by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and the Tanous Family Endowed Lecture Fund.
Matthews, who is known for his hour-long talk show “Hardball with Chris Matthews,” opened the presentation by talking about bipartisanship, using the relationship of former President Ronald Reagan and former Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill as an example.
“The country we built here is all about the kinds of people we sent here,” Matthews said, referring to elected representatives in Congress. “The older I get, the more I believe in the system. I just want it to work. I just want the right and the left to get together and negotiate and compromise and find a way to make this thing work and stop kicking so many cans down the road.”
Matthews, who served as an aide for O’Neill during his tenure as speaker, is currently working on a book about Reagan and O’Neill.
“[Reagan and O’Neill] both loved the country, and in their own ways they wanted it to work,” Matthews said. “For a half dozen years in the 1980s I was on the inside politically … The Speaker of The House, an old-time liberal Democrat, and his adversary Ronald Reagan, [who was] destined to be one of the most popular presidents in history. I think I saw American government run the way it was supposed run back then.”
Matthews said that O’Neill and Reagan’s relationship emphasized how bipartisanship and government ought to function.
“If politics was zero sum, we wouldn’t get anywhere with self-government,” Matthews said. “Sometimes the success of a whole thing depends on good competition, a balance and where a fight makes both guys look good.”
Students said they were impressed by Matthews’s speech.
“I’m just voting for the first time and it’s important … to hear other perspectives,” Alexandra Daniels (COL ’16) said. “I think he has a lot of good points and that people do need to see … what we can collaborate on and what we can agree on is more important than what separates us.”
“I like that even though he is a pretty liberal guy, he still thinks that we all need to compromise and work like Tip O’Neill and Reagan did to actually make politics work,” Elyssa Skeirik (SFS ’15) said.

Wisey’s #1 LLC filed a lawsuit for intentional trademark infringement against local restaurant owner Davar Ashgrizzadeh and his businesses, Minellis Pizzeria Enterpries LLC and Nimellis Pizzeria LLC.
Wisey’s #1 is the parent company of Wisey’s — better known as “Healthy Wisey’s” — located at 1440 Wisconsin Ave. NW.
Ashgrizzadeh’s restaurant Cafe Romeo’s, located at 2132 Wisconsin Ave. NW, became the base for Wiseats, which operates as a pick-up, delivery and catering service in the D.C. area, earlier this year.
The Wisey’s complaint, which was filed Sept. 27, alleges that Wiseats copied Wisey’s name and logo earlier this year.
“Defendants did not open another location, expand or even alter CafeRomeo’s,” the plaintiff wrote in the complaint. “Defendants simply began marketing their inferior but competing products and services under the confusingly similar Wiseats mark … for the sole purpose of trafficking Wisey’s goodwill and reputation.”
The two delis’ logos, menus and slogans are markedly similar. The Wisey’s slogan is “Eat Right, Eat Wisey’s,” while Wiseats’ slogan is “Eat Wise, Eat Wiseats.” Additionally, some items on the Wisey’s menu, such as a smoothie containing bananas, dates and honey, are replicated exactly on the Wiseats menu.
According to a Wisey’s employee who asked to remain anonymous because speaking to the press could jeopardize his job, Wiseats’ appearance on the market has been confusing to customers.
“[Ashgrizzadeh] is trying to confuse customers, and it’s working,” the employee said. “Customers have called Wisey’s to complain about orders that Wiseats screwed up, and others have called us asking if we opened another store.”
The employee alleged that the infringement began when Ashgrizzadeh recruited a Wisey’s employee who was willing to divulge the deli’s recipes.
“The salads and smoothies on Wiseats menus are all Wisey’s recipes,” the employee said. “But they weren’t able to get a cook to jump ship, which is why they [aren’t able] to copy our sandwiches.”
The employee also alleged that Ashgrizzadeh had his menus made by the same printing shop that Wisey’s uses, Korea Monitor, Inc. The printing shop, however, did not put its own information on the menu for Wiseats.
Though Wisey’s menus bear the publishing information from Korea Monitor, Inc., the Wiseats menus are devoid of any publisher information. The company would not confirm whether it was responsible for printing the Wiseats menu. However, the two delis’ menus have comparable formats, color schemes and coupon inserts and are identical in size.
According to the Wisey’s complaint, Ashgrizzadeh’s copyright infringements on their menus have negatively impacted the deli’s business.
“[They] are intentionally defrauding D.C.-area consumers and maliciously profiting by quite literally brazenly stealing and injuring the reputation and goodwill that Wisey’s has spent years building,” the filing said. “The defendants are competing in the exact same product market from a location on the same street as Wisey’s, selling a knock-off product and hoping that unsuspecting consumers will not notice until it is too late to cancel their order.”
The anonymous Wisey’s employee echoed the sentiments of the complaint.
“We work hard to make a good product,” the Wisey’s employee said. “We’re a small business, and we help out the community, so to have someone come and blatantly steal from us is horrible.”
Wiseats staff declined to comment.

Undergraduate and graduate students met with Assistant Vice President of Student Health Services James Welsh Oct. 24. to discuss enhancing the university’s current online appointment scheduling system for the Student Health Center.
The student delegation comprised Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) and two representatives from the Graduate Student Organization, President Paul Musgrave (GRD ’16) and Vice President of Advocacy Carina Minardi (GRD ’16).
According to Minardi, the initiative began last year as a joint project between the GUSA executive board and GSO and then was passed down to Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount.
“The meeting was a joint effort with GUSA and GSO because this is an issue that affects a great number of graduate students as well as undergraduates,” Musgrave said.
The university implemented an online appointment request system called “My MedStar Connect” in April 2012, which allows students to request appointments, renew a prescription and review test results.
To set up an account, students must acquire a personal identification number by submitting a request online and then set up an account through the program’s website. Minardi said the new system is important, especially for graduate students whose university-provided health care plans mandate that they use the Student Health Center.
“We only get our health care through the health center, so before we can get any sort of other treatment, we have to go to the clinic,” she said. “This is a big problem for students who live off campus, who have to go there prior to going to any [emergency room] or anything, so not getting an appointment is incredibly difficult and frustrating.”
Though the new request system is meant to make scheduling appointments easier, Kohnert-Yount said it needs to become more user friendly.
“You need to submit a request, then you wait a week for a pin number, then you need to pick up the PIN number in person, then it’s still not connected to your NetID,” she said. “It’s just a very long and confusing process.”
Students can obtain pin numbers either by submitting an online request or being a patient at the Student Health Center.
She added that the system is not sufficiently advertised to be useful to students.
“[The system] is buried deep in a random paragraph on a remote page on the website,” she said. “Very few people on campus know about it, much less use it.”
Approximately 200 students — less than 1 percent of the student body — have enrolled in the program, according to Welsh.
Musgrave agreed that increasing awareness about the program is key.
“We will also be educating students. We really hope to make this a priority in a way that I don’t think it has been for the health center, administration or MedStar,” he said.
“It’s one of those things that when you’re receiving the care versus administering the care — small changes and knowing how the system works can really change how you use it.”
Kohnert-Yount said she also wants to increase awareness about the program to ensure that the system is efficient and effective, especially because it can be difficult to secure an appointment at the health center over the phone.
Kohnert-Yount cited her own experiences with the health center as her reason to push for change.
“Recently, I had a bad throat infection, and I called the Student Health Center and was put on hold for 20 minutes, so I hung up. I called again, was put on hold for 20 minutes again, so I hung up again and tried a last time,” Kohnert-Yount said. “After being put on a hold again, I gave up and just left a message. No one has gotten back to me about it yet, and this was a few weeks ago.”
She later decided to go to an off-campus doctor that night.
Other students recalled their own difficulties in securing an appointment with the student health center.
Anna Hernick (SFS ’16) had to choose between waiting five days for an appointment or sitting in a waiting room for two hours.
“I was told that there were no ‘sick’ appointments available until Tuesday of the next week,” Hernick said. “The woman told me I could try to get a walk-in appointment if I didn’t want to wait five days to see a doctor. The next day, I headed to the Student Health Center in the morning and waited for two hours before I saw a doctor.”
Despite these complaints, Welsh said that the Student Health Center is fully staffed.
“The Student Health Center is staffed with seven full-time or part-time physicians, five full- or part-time nurse practitioners and two full-time registered nurses,” he wrote in an email.
The center had a temporary reduction in its staff after two physicians went on leave and another two resigned, but Welsh said that those positions have now been filled.
“The new physicians should be seeing patients within the next week or so, pending full credentialing by the hospital,” he wrote.
Though frustrated with the appointment request process, Musgrave complimented the center’s service.
“The quality of care offered at the clinic is very good. It may just be a clinic, but the doctors are fantastic, the nurses are nice and the whole medical care part has been fantastic,” he said.
Students agreed with the initiative to push for a more effective online scheduling system that was posted on IdeaScale by Kohnert-Yount Oct. 13. Thus far, the idea has received 238 votes.
“I believe there definitely should be an online booking system that is available at all hours,” Aeysha Chaudhry (NHS ’15) said. “That would save students time instead of waiting on the phone for 20 minutes to make an appointment.”
Kohnert-Yount added that the online scheduling system would help students schedule more timely appointments.
“Being able to be seen that day is so important, especially when you’re sick,” Kohnert-Yount said. “We hope that with increased awareness and usage of the online scheduling system, students will be able to fit appointments as soon as possible around their schedule.”
Minardi addressed more generally how she feels the problem can be solved.
“What I think really needs to happen is that the communication between students and the health center needs to improve,” she said. “It needs to be a collaborative effort, but the willingness to serve the student population is there. And that’s very important.”

Mark Stern argued in his column “No Suppression of Stupidity” (A3, Oct. 23, 2012) that Metro’s recent attempt to censor racist advertisements was a violation of free speech. The ads, sponsored by the anti-Islamic American Freedom Defense Initiative read, “In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.”
“There is no doubt that the AFDI’s posters are offensive and ridiculous, but hatefulness and stupidity have never been cause for censorship in the United States,” Stern wrote. “It is only by protecting the speech of those whom we like least that we preserve the liberties we cherish most.”
He’s right, of course. But to leave the story at that — not to go beyond a wistful sigh that there’s nothing we can do to stop people like AFDI founder Pamela Geller from posting hateful messages in our public space — makes it seem like the victory must lie on the side of hate speech. On the contrary, many individuals and religious groups, including members of the Georgetown community, have responded to these ads exactly in the manner that First Amendment watchdogs would want: by making their own voices heard in support of love and tolerance.
It started in New York when, after these ads were posted in the subway system, people responded with vandalism. Some ads were slapped with a sticker saying “RACIST,” while others were covered in black spray paint. Then, counter-ads started to run in D.C. and New York. United Methodist Women ran an ad saying, “Hate speech is not civilized. Support peace in word and deed.” The Council on American-Islamic Relations posted a quote from the Quran: “Show forgiveness, speak for justice and avoid the ignorant.” Sojourners, a Christian organization, posted an ad stating simply, “Love your Muslim neighbors.”
Closer to home, a group of Georgetown students have been going to Metro stations and distributing flyers supporting peace. Our very own Rachel Gartner, rabbi and director of Jewish chaplaincy at Georgetown, wrote a piece for The Washington Post denouncing the ad and calling on Jewish Americans to speak out against it as an obligation of their faith. “As a rabbi, I insist on the responsibility to speak out against hateful speech,” Gartner wrote, “particularly when it comes at least in part from one of our own. Judaism teaches [that] anyone who has the ability to intervene but does not is held responsible [by God] for those sins.”
Gartner makes an important point: the First Amendment guarantees not simply a right, but also a responsibility, to speak out and take responsibility for the consequences of our speech. These ads are meant to incite fear and hatred of Muslims, equating savagery with jihad and, by extension, with Muslims. This tactic is crude, offensive and irresponsible. Anti-Islamic propaganda has real consequences for the daily lives of Muslims and non-Muslims around the country and around the world.
U.S. media rarely provide a platform to share the experiences of the Muslims who are vilified in public discourse. When the other side of the story is never told — when all we see are depictions of Muslims as terrorists intent on jihad — it becomes easy to accept racist stereotypes about who is “civilized” and who is “savage.” These attitudes creep into policy decisions just as they spur horrific hate crimes. Speech has consequences.
Censorship is not the answer. More speech is better, especially in cases such as this. It is significant that the response to these ads has overwhelmingly been one promoting love. On a topic that too often incites a squabbling match rather than meaningful debate, Jews, Christians and Muslims have refused to take the AFDI’s bait. Instead, they are using it as an opportunity to come together against intolerance. Juxtaposed with the AFDI’s ad referring to human beings as savages, the ads calling for peace, love and justice expose the AFDI ad for what it really is: racist, cynical and hateful. They shame the AFDI for dishonoring its right to free speech so egregiously.

Though there have been no reported thefts in Village C West since the start of the academic year, the Office of Housing Services recently changed all the locks in the Y wing of the third and fourth floors.
An e-mail was sent to all residents of those floors on Oct. 24 informing them of the change.
“In order to maintain the integrity of the lock system, the university is changing out the keys for your room on Wednesday, October 24th,” the e-mail said.
According to Kendyl Clausen (COL ’16), no other explanation was offered for the lock changes.
“Nobody told us why, but we got an email saying that [the locks] would be changed. I haven’t noticed any thefts, and nobody on my floor has, that I know of,” she said.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr stated that the change was necessary to ensure the continued safety of students and their residences.
“In an effort to promote a safe residential community, the Housing Office, in conjunction with the Lock Shop, takes steps to ensure the integrity of the key systems. In some instances that will involve lock changes to certain residence areas,” she said. “These steps are on top of other key security measures we employ year round.”

Life is only on Earth and not for long,” actress Kirsten Dunst laments in the film “Melancholia” before a rouge planet annihilates our world in a spectacular collision seen by no one.
I remember a specific point in time when I looked up at the night sky through the passenger window of my father’s powder blue Geo Metro and watched my own eyes grow wide in the reflection with epiphany. Suddenly, an idea I had heard time and time again in grade school science clicked, and I realized just what it meant to be so small in a universe so big. My nine-year-old self spent the next two weeks holding on to every ledge and railing available to avoid being launched into space.
In that instance, education fulfilled its raison d’etre. As a product of the public school system, I had internalized knowledge and applied it to the world around me.
Ten years later, members of my generation have an enormous body of information under their belts; and we are nowhere close to satiated. Yet I do not think I am the only one who often wonders how we are supposed to tie together the knowledge we’ve gained. Education requires definition.
What does an education mean — at Georgetown and across the country? The answer to this question is crucial because its consequences are so dire. Even more than ignorance, the wrong kind of education is one of the most dangerous things in the world. Knowledge is a burden transferred from our parents’ generation — it has a weight, and it comes with a price.
Education bids us struggle every day to come to terms with the unspeakable crimes humanity commits against itself, from Sparta to the Inquisition to Hiroshima and Nagasaki and beyond. With every passing year, we develop a more acute sense of the lonely chill that comes from understanding the limits of our biology and the uniqueness of the human condition, thrust upon us by intelligence, self-awareness and opposable thumbs.
When, as teenagers, we first looked into the abyss of human history that is war and tragedy, we simply closed the books and directed our attention elsewhere. Yet something within us felt different. It was not the void that changed.
Childhood innocence is fragile, and we lose it just as much from our sins and the sins of others as we do from the recognition that the monsters we fear are inside us. Education confronts us with the most unchecked aberrations, perverse usages and greedy misappropriations of our shared human faculty.
Our sense of security is ripped away by the cold, hard truth of human societies and the physical world with which they wrestle. Ignorance is indeed bliss, until and unless one of your differences earns you derision or expulsion from a closed society.
Do not interpret this column as advocating for ignorance. Rather, I argue that education must put something in the place of the innocence it stripped away.
Education must not produce empty shells of post-modern men and women migrating between the twin fates of spiraling disillusionment and the totalitarian temptation of political ideology. Skepticism and critical thinking skills are important elements of a well-honed mind, but to leave us with those traits alone is to commit a cruel omission.
Education in the truest sense must teach us to believe — believe that something in us connects us to something bigger than ourselves. Belief can take many forms: religious, spiritual, philosophical and so forth. Students must be encouraged to investigate and discover those personal values that will keep them rooted to the ground as humanity hurtles through space and time.
Based on oft-quoted Jesuit values, this is the kind of education Georgetown has the potential to bring into the 21st century. Properly advertised and communicated to prospective matriculates, the Hilltop can become a place where students gather to engage in a truly holistic model of education. As current students, we ought to demand this model both for ourselves and for the broken U.S. public education system that so desperately needs reform in the place of platitudes and thoughtless legislation.
Accumulated knowledge means we can look into the stars at night and see them for what they are. Philosophy, faith and personal values, developed over the course of a lifetime, allow us to imagine what could be of the world. Education also instructs us what humanity is capable of — it is belief that teaches us that good will win out in the end.

The Georgetown University Roosevelt Institute was reestablished after a two-year hiatus this summer by Asjed Hussain (SFS ’15), current president of Georgetown’s chapter.
Founded in 2009 by Carolina Delgado (SFS ’12), the Georgetown chapter of GURI is part of the Roosevelt Institute Campus Network, a national student think tank focused on policy research and proposal and includes more than 85 chapters nation wide. It was disbanded in 2010 because of a lack of interest. However, it was reestablished over the summer after Hussain heard Delgado speak at an informal Carroll Fellows event where alums spoke to freshmen fellows about their experiences at Georgetown at the end of last year.
“I heard about the incredible things Carolina had done during her time here; however, it seemed that the Institute never really took off before,” he said. “I approached her after her talk and told her that I wanted to take it over, so she provided me contacts with the national organization, which is how we got it all started.”
The national Roosevelt Institute organization is separated into six major parts, called centers, which focus on six areas of policy: economics, education, healthcare, energy and environment, equal justice and defense and diplomacy.
GURI follows the structure established by the national organization: Each center holds meetings once a week at which the approximately 50 members brainstorm solutions to policy situations and learn how to write policy. Policy chairs serve as the teachers after attending a training session in the beginning of September.
Each member then uses these skills to produce a policy piece by the first week of December, that promotes a solution to a specific problem. The pieces are sent to the national organization, and 10 pieces are published in the Institute’s publication, “10 Ideas.”
“These pieces really have promise of creating solutions,” Hussain said. “Beyond having the potential opportunity to be published as an undergraduate, some of these authors meet with members of Congress and heads of government to advocate for their solutions.”
Over the summer, Hussain selected VP Dao (SFS ’15) to serve as vice president of the chapter. Both Dao and Hussain then recruited seven students to serve as chairs during the first week of September.
The two sophomores began advertising GURI at this year’s Student Activities Fair.
According to Hussain, nearly 100 freshmen signed up at the event
“With such a positive response, it certainly furthered my conviction that students were looking for this type of opportunity on campus, given the levels of political activism and international awareness typical of Georgetown students,” he said.
The group also established a Facebook page to advertise the first information session, which, according to Hussain, attracted 30 people.
Policy center meetings began during the last week of September, and each center has held two meetings so far this semester.
“I was really glad to have found out about GURI because I’m planning to get involved with public policy as a career, and given the nature of many Georgetown students feeling the same, I was looking for a group that gave me the opportunity to explore it.” Courtney Kishbaugh (COL ’15), a current member of the economics center, said.
This year, GURI was approved by the Student Activities Commission, and Hussain said he hopes to attain funding from SAC, which would allow him to publish a Georgetown-specific policy journal.
In the meantime, GURI has a blog on Tumblr that provides students who are looking to write shorter policy pieces with a space in which to publish their work.
“This is a unique opportunity for Georgetown students, as we’re taught by many policymakers and policy implementers from whom we gain advanced insight,” Dao said. “We wanted to form a group and forum for students to peel back politicizing and really look for the solutions that politics often muddles over.”

Pinstripes, a restaurant chain that also offers bowling and bocce, may be among the new tenants of the soon-to-be-renovated Shops at Georgetown Park.
The restaurant has submitted a proposal to the D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment to build a new venue in the mall and hopes to open within a year.
Pinstripes locations’ fine-dining atmospheres, complete with a wine cellar and upscale decor, set them apart from the traditional bowling venue, according to founder and CEO Dale Schwartz.
“We’re very, very different. We’re just a … quality venue that is unlike any other out there,” Schwartz said.
Schwartz said that he seeks to replicate the ambience of high-end hotels such as the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton.
According to Schwartz, Georgetown is an ideal location for Pinstripes because of the nature of the neighborhood.
“We tend to look for high-quality markets with residential communities that have an appreciation for sophisticated fun,” Schwartz said.
Not everyone shares Schwartz’s enthusiasm for a bowling alley in Georgetown, however. As reported in local blog DCist, some residents, such as David Miller, are concerned with the consequences of developing a bowling alley in Georgetown.
“As recreation, it’s a great idea. But there are three main concerns: noise, noise and noise,” he told DCist. “I don’t believe there’s any concern at all about the who, what, where it is in that mall and the impact it may have on the residents above it.”
In particular, many residents who live in the condominiums in the upper levels of the Shops at Georgetown Park worry about the noise and the vibrations from a game of bowling.
“In every one of our locations, we get concerns,” Schwartz said. “It’s mostly people that really don’t initially fully understand how different we really are from any bowling or, for that matter, entertainment venue. In every location we’ve done, after we’ve simply talked to the local residents and anybody else about the issues, we’ve in every case been able to get people very comfortable with what we are doing.”
Currently, Washington only has one bowling alley open to the public: Lucky Strike in Chinatown. Unlike Pinstripes, Lucky Strike offers the more traditional bowling alley staples of pizza and tacos.
If the BZA approves the proposal, the Georgetown location will be Pinstripes’ fifth venue in the United States. Pinstripes currently has three restaurants in Illinois and one in Minnesota.
Schwartz also indicated interest in expanding to multiple locations in the metropolitan area.
“Over time we would consider doing one other, maybe two other, locations in the Virginia-Maryland-D.C. area,” Schwartz said.

I loved Georgetown from the first day that I set my footlocker down in Healy Circle and asked an upperclassman how to find a room to put it in. I loved the Jesuits, too. In my novel “The Exorcist,” I thanked them for “teaching me to think.”
Georgetown gave me the gift of a liberal education that included the keys of reason to unlock the mysteries of faith. Throughout an undeservedly wonderful life, I have been guided by the light of my Georgetown education, grounded firmly, as I had been even in my youth, in the unmatched intellectual wealth of the Catholic Church. Each time I faltered — as I often did, sometimes grievously — that light never failed to come to my rescue.
What I owe Georgetown, however, is nothing compared to what she owes her founders and the Christ of Faith. It grieves me deeply that my alma mater is failing so scandalously in its debt to both, as well as to the militant Jesuits still buried there who made it so special for so long. Georgetown today seems to take pride in insulting the Church and offending the faithful.
I know that some students, or the earnest Jesuit, will point out the liturgies, the chaplains, the Knights of Columbus chapter and so on. Administrators assure me that they speak to the archbishop and visit Rome regularly. I know the litany all too well. But it describes a Potemkin village, complete now with long, waving banners.
Those who believe this illusion seem satisfied with their little Catholic ghetto. It contrasts so starkly with the archdiocese’s view of things. On May 10, its official publication stated plainly that, at Georgetown today, “leadership and faculty find their inspiration in sources other than the Gospel and Catholic teaching,” and that “the vision guiding university choices does not clearly reflect the light of the Gospel and authentic Catholic teaching.”
Of course, the decimation of “Catholic” began long ago when we first looked with envy toward Harvard and reduced the Jesuit curriculum. The dissidents came later, some in Roman collars and others who found personal gain in the movement against Church authority. Georgetown galloped toward secularism; even crucifixes disappeared from classrooms.
Then, in the early 1980s, a top New York public relations firm counseled the university that it was misguided to diminish its Catholic identity. Their report showed how Catholic identity was a valuable “brand” to be exploited in fundraising and recruitment. Georgetown got the memo but pursued a cynical path. In the prose, Latin quotes and other cosmetics, Georgetown would tell the world that it was “Catholic and Jesuit.” At black-tie alumni dinners, a Jesuit would be placed at every table like a flower centerpiece. The march toward secularism and moral relativism continued.
Debate is the servant of truth. In this case, debating whether Georgetown is Catholic has itself become a deception. Some say yes, some say no. But it does not matter what we think. There is only one accrediting agency that gets the last word. In 1990, Pope John Paul II, a former university professor, finally issued a normative constitution for Catholic universities, Ex Corde Ecclesiae. Georgetown has a metric, but its leaders have chosen willfully to ignore it.
It is not too late. I have formed the Father King Society to unite students, faculty, parents and alumni to make Georgetown honest, Catholic and better. Students and faculty have joined us. Anyone interested can contact me. The courageous are welcome.
To become authentically Catholic again does not mean returning to the past. It means building something entirely new, a new way for our university to meet the world that Georgetown’s old guard might be unable to imagine. Among other things, a Catholic university will defend academic freedom against the illiberal and intolerant new orthodoxies that allow no dissension from their new truths, as is happening at Georgetown today.
Our new society is named for Fr. Tom King, S.J., who, in 1991, assisted a first canonical petition to stop Georgetown’s slow separation from the Church. That petition asked the Church to strip the university of its Catholic label if it did not stop funding abortion advocacy. Georgetown reversed itself. Soon, we will ask the Church to do something quite different. Our excitement is palpable. Like Jesuit Father Karras, we do it for “love.”

Georgetown Law professor and attorney Robert S. Bennett (COL ’61) spoke about three trials that defined his career in McNeir Auditorium Tuesday night.
Bennett, best known for representing former president Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, also played a role in cases surrounding the Valerie Plame and Iran-Contra affairs. His talk was co-sponsored by the Lecture Fund and the College Dean’s Office.
“I sought to bring Bob Bennett to campus because I knew he would offer a unique and interesting take on what happened behind the scenes during some of America’s most iconic scandals,” Chris Mulrooney (COL ’14), vice chair of internal affairs for the Lecture Fund, said to introduce Bennett. “But beyond his unique perspective, Bob is an engaged member of the Georgetown community who cares about students here on campus.”
After graduating from Georgetown University Law Center in 1964, Bennett went on to receive a degree from Harvard Law the following year. After graduation, he returned to the District to work as a clerk for U.S. District Court Judge Howard Corcoran and then became a federal prosecutor.
“Beyond the high-profile cases and high-paying contracts, in being a federal prosecutor, I dealt with rape, murder and extortion cases that gave me a true sense of fulfillment in knowing I was putting some really bad people away,” Bennett said.
Bennett later entered the field of private law.
At the beginning of his talk, Bennett described how he represented Judith Miller, a writer at the Washington bureau of The New York Times who disclosed the identity of undercover Central Intelligence Agency Operative Valerie Plame in what became known as the Plame Affair.
During the trial, Miller was jailed after being found in contempt of court after refusing to cite her sources. Bennett worked out an agreement with prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald that allowed Miller to reveal her notes to her lawyer rather than the prosecutor, an act that led to the conviction of Scooter Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney’s former chief of staff, who had leaked the private information.
Bennett pointed to the Miller case as one that taught him that the justice system is not infallible.
“This case definitely pointed out some of the catches of the judicial system,” he said. “The prosecution saw leaking confidential information as a very bad thing, but on the other hand, we have the idea that reporters have a right to protect their sources [because] if they always had to reveal them, they could never go about their jobs properly.”
Bennett also discussed his time representing Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998.
According to Bennett, Hillary Clinton had hired him to investigate the case.
“I was called in one day after being referred to the Clintons by some of their colleagues and friends, and at first, it was certainly a surreal experience,” he said. “That said — after I said ‘Mr. President, how are you?’ it was like any other client, and we would have some really honest discussions.”
Bennett also pointed out some details of the scandal that are often overlooked.
“It’s not unfair to say that the President exercised some pretty bad judgment in that situation — no question about it — but one of the things that struck me was one day, I talked to him four times on the phone. It was getting late in the afternoon, and I had a conference call for another case, so when I let him know I needed to run, he said, ‘That’s fine, I have to get back to Iraq,’” Bennett said. “Beyond all the nonsense, the man did a great job of compartmentalizing to keep up with the real issues.”
During the question-and-answer portion at the end of the presentation, a student asked if Bennett ever had any hesitation about representing Clinton.
“This was a great example of handling a crisis, and one that applies to everyone’s lives,” he said. “The important thing about handling these situations is getting the truth out, and getting it out right away. You can’t cover it up. That’s where everything goes south.”
Finally, Bennett addressed his involvement in the Iran Contra Affair, a 1986 scandal in which U.S. officials illegally sold weapons to Iran, which had been under an arms embargo at the time. Officials had hoped the sale would secure the safe release of seven hostages and facilitate U.S. Intelligence aid to Nicaraguan contras.
Bennett represented former defense secretary Casper Weinberger, who was one of 14 officials to be indicted in wake of the controversy.
According to Bennett, although 11 of the officials were convicted, he was able to grant Weinberger enough time to be pardoned, in the final days of former President George H.W. Bush’s term.
“Beyond the law, this really hit home the power of the pardon,” Bennett said. “No matter how outrageous — or the criticism on to whom [pardons] are given — they exist as, in my opinion, the single greatest power of the president.”
One student asked him to describe a situation in which his beliefs conflicted with those of his clients; Bennett responded that his opinions should not matter when considering a case.
“I’m a great believer that everybody is entitled to a defense,” he said. “Our system says that guilt or innocence isn’t determined in a lawyer’s office; it’s up to the government to prove guilt. Our constitution gives everyone, without bias, the right to representation, and I believe in that.”
Bennett concluded by commenting on what he called the most important aspect of his life.
“You have to put happiness and fulfillment over everything. Anybody that tells you that you can’t be successful and have a career is lying,” he said. “I’ve done it, and I always put my family first. That’s what I’m most proud of.”
This message hit home for his audience.
“Beyond seeing this lawyer who has been amazingly successful, it was great to have him give us some life lessons too,” student Max Malec (COL ’15) said. “It really added so much to the reputation of this man who has represented so many powerful people.”

This October, students in McCarthy Hall can forgo the O’Donovan Hall experience to eat with a professor at The Tombs.
Launched last February by Hall Director Lamar Dawson, the McCarthy Hall “Out to Lunch” program provides students with a unique opportunity to connect with professors outside the classroom.
Previously, resident assistants held faculty-student programs that included pizza dinners in common rooms with a professor, but according to Dawson, these initiatives were neither effective nor engaging.
“What I was finding was that [Resident Assistants] would invite professors to have a presentation on the floor, and yeah, there’d be free pizza, but no one would come. “
Dawson said he wanted to establish a new program that students would actually want to attend.
“So I was thinking, ‘What do students really like, and what can they learn at the same time?’” he said. “Students love The Tombs, and people love a free lunch, so what if we took our professors out to lunch to break down some of those barriers and just have a relaxed conversation?”
So far this semester, Dawson has organized six lunches, and roughly six to 10 students have attended each, along with an RA and a professor invited by the Office of Residence Life.
RAs organize the lunches, helping to break the ice between students and teachers. At the end of the meal, they also pay for the lunch using a portion of the floor funds collected at the beginning of the semester.
The group meets for an hour-long meal at The Tombs, and discussions have included the uprising in Syria, the Occupy movement and the presidential debates.
Assistant Dean of the School of Foreign Service and professor Elizabeth Arsenault led the discussion about Syria last February. She said she was impressed by student turnout and participation in the discussion.
“The students were tremendously engaged, drawing linkages between the
events in Syria and coursework that they had studied in their various
classes,” she said.
Other professors who have participated said they found that the program gives them a glimpse of student life outside the classroom.
“It is easy for both faculty and students to forget that faculty were once undergraduates,” assistant professor in the department of human science Maureen Basha, who led a discussion on the final presidential debate Monday, said. “These lunches help remind me of the student point of view and the joys and challenges of being an undergraduate.”
Dawson chooses preliminary topics for discussion and each professor revises the subject to suit his or her interests. The most popular discussions have been ones that relate to social issues.
“Students really crave being able to talk about what it means to be a Georgetown student,” Dawson said.
Brian Monahan (COL ’15), an RA in McCarthy, agreed.
“The conversation felt very organic and natural, and I think everyone benefited from discussing things that were mutually interesting for everyone at the table,” he said.
For many students, the lunches present an opportunity to befriend people in their dorm whom they would not normally meet.
“Sophomores tend to stop trying to meet people in their hall and building, so this is a nice way to get that started,” McCarthy resident Tania Ryseck (MSB ’15), said. “I met people in my building who I now can say hi to in the elevator, which is nice. It makes for a better community.”
In the future, as the program becomes more institutionalized, Dawson said he wants students to play a larger role in planning each lunch.
“I want to purchase preloaded gift cards to The Tombs, and students would be able to take initiative and invite one of their current professors to lunch — maybe one in whose class they’re struggling or just someone they want to get to know a little better.”

Georgetown alum Steven Mull (F ’80) was sworn in as the U.S. Ambassador to Poland Wednesday.
“In the 23 years since it regained independence, Poland has proven itself as an unshakable ally of the United States, standing shoulder to shoulder with us on the front lines from Iraq to Afghanistan, shining the light of democracy on those dark corners of the world that have not yet won their freedom, and volunteering to be among the first in helping the NATO alliance defend against the threat of ballistic missiles,” Mull said at his swearing-in ceremony, according to a transcription of his speech posted on the U.S. Department of State website.
Mull began his career in the Foreign Service in 1982 and is currently a Career Minister. He has served in the Bahamas, Poland and South Africa and was the U.S. ambassador to Lithuania from 2003 to 2006.
“Steve was always the first to spring into action, standing up task forces, managing rapid response personnel,” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said before Mull was sworn-in, according to a transcription of the speech. “Whether it was after the earthquake in Haiti, the terrible natural and nuclear crisis in Japan, or, most recently, the awful assault on our post in Benghazi and other diplomatic posts that were threatened, we never doubted we’d get the best response, the most professional response because of Steve’s leadership and hard work.”

Student-run beverage delivery service H2Bro has floundered this semester after a technical mistake on their website said it was closed for business.
Though H20Bro manager Will Roth (MSB ’14) corrected the mislabeled site this week, he said that the company needs to increase on-campus awareness.
“The site definitely didn’t help us through the fact that it said that, and so I think we could probably do a better job as to getting our name out there,” he said.
Along with fellow manager Noble Carpenter (COL ’14), Roth plans to continue to increase H2Bro’s clientele this year. Currently, the company averages about 40 customers each week, an increase from the original 10 customers each week when the company was founded in 2009.
Founders, Andrew Pence (SFS ’12), Brian Kim (COL ’12), Peter Hadjipateras (COL ’12) and Bowen Williams (SFS ’12), developed the idea during their freshman year, but current H2Bro managers are looking to expand the company’s presence on campus. However, its original founders graduated last May, leaving the delivery service in a transitional period.
Efforts to expand H2Bro’s scope to other parts of the District, including The George Washington University, were unsuccessful last year.
“At first it went well, then the school got aggressive with [the company],” Roth said. “They were a little skeptical of an outsider just coming in and delivering water to the dorm.”
But Roth noted the benefits of H2Bro’s student leadership at Georgetown.
“We’re students, we have access to the dorm and we can bring it right to your door,” he said. “The few people we’ve talked to have said, ‘Thanks guys — you’re providing a service to the school.’ Parents love it.”
Outside of H2Bro’s loyal base of customers, many students have either not heard of the service or never thought to use it.
“It was a great concept,” Carla Frank (COL ’13) said. “I never used it. It occurred to me, but I don’t know why I didn’t.”
Roth and Carpenter hope to increase H2Bro’s presence on campus this semester through advertising.
“We really want to start being more aggressive with our advertising, and that will be Facebook, that will be tabling [and] that will be flyering,” Roth said.
Despite numerous setbacks, Roth and Carpenter are still committed to their business.
“We invested a lot of time in this company our first two years, so it means more to us,” Carpenter said.
