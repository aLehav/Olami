Amid tenuous U.S.-China ties, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke opened a policy conference on the two countries’ commercial relationship on Thursday morning in the Lohrfink Auditorium with a keynote address stressing the need for cooperation.
“We’re here to discuss how we can nurture and improve the most heavily scrutinized bilateral commercial relationship on Earth – one in which our disagreements get all the headlines,” Locke said. “The United States is the most open major economy in the world, and we are committed to forging a future in which China can take full advantage of the opportunities that come with economic liberalization.”
The discussions at this conference will serve as a preamble to the next U.S.-China joint commission on commerce and trade, which will be held later in December. Panelists at the day-long conference came seeking a deeper understanding of the underlying issues between trade agreements.
Introduced by Dr. Resat Kasaba from the Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington and by McDonough School of Business Dean George Daly, Locke kicked off a day-long discussion on the economic trends and trading patterns of the United States and China, two key players in the 21st century’s global political and economic arena.
Jessica Holland (SFS ’11), a regional and comparative studies major who has been actively studying Chinese relations, said Locke gave a thoughtful presentation.
“I noticed his careful use of language,” Holland said. “He was praising China’s economic growth, but he also underlined the United States’ desire for more Chinese consumption, but he said this all in a careful way and welcomed discussion from the panelists.”
The panels were divided into four topics: China’s changing economic landscape; science and technology innovation trends in China; energy and environmental cooperation; and the impact of developments in China’s commercial legal system. Each panel had three discussants and one moderator.
Professor Robert Sutter, a Georgetown visiting professor of Asian studies in the School of Foreign Service, served as a moderator for the science and technology panel.
“This conference is a very good exercise for better insights,” Sutter said. “We need a better understanding of the economic relationships because they are subject to a lot of one-way thinking. The variety of perspectives we hear from [the panelists] is very important.”
Locke urged the panelists and moderators, who ranged from professors to representatives from the U.S. Department of Commerce, to address issues such as U.S. exports in China and mutually beneficial trade on a providence-to-providence level.
“I thought that the regional focus about Cambodia and Southeast Asia was interesting, like how they adjust to this new economic norm and model. It was helpful for me that the panelists focused in on specific areas,” Gabriel Ruth (GRD) said. Ruth works for Tailored Solutions & Consulting, and she plans to go to China next summer for a global residency program.
While panelists did acknowledge the growth of trade between the two countries in the last decade, there was much discussion about the cultural challenges and the potential ability of Chinese companies to become lucrative trading partners for the United States.
Panelist for “China’s Changing Economic Landscape,” Courtney Gregoire, director of the National Export Initiative at the Commerce Department, recalled her interactions in a trip to China for the U.S.-China legal exchange.
“There was a lot of robust dialogue between us and the Chinese officials about how to administer the National Export Initiative and the free trade agreements,” Gregoire said. “While a lot of U.S. companies see the nine to 10 growth rate and are excited to trade in China, only 1 percent of small medium-sized companies are exporting, and 58 percent of those are exporting to Canada and Mexico.”
Panelist Shang-Jin Wei, professor of finance and economics at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business, echoed Gregoire’s concerns, but from the Chinese perspective.
“China is one of the few places that will allow U.S. exports to double once every five years. The key to increase U.S. net exports is not micro, or firm-level competitiveness, but a macro, country-level savings-investment balance,” Wei said.
Overall, the conference seemed to explore the struggle with China’s changing political, social and technological trends, and how they might align with those of the United States in the future. The relationship between these two major global influences has already improved in the past decade, and Locke assured speakers and attendees of the conference that more collaboration will fuel global economic prosperity.
“As recently as 40 years ago, a commercial relationship between the United States and China barely existed,” Locke said.
“Successful engagement between the Commerce Department’s scientific agencies and Chinese research institutes, government labs and government agencies are essential parts of us creating a more integrated economic relationship.”

The D.C. Council has proposed two laws this week, the “Bullying and Prevention Act of 2010 and the Harassment and Intimidation Protection Act of 2010, which aim to provide a new, comprehensive policy for prohibiting bullying in D.C. public schools, charter schools, libraries and the University of the District of Columbia.
The Bullying and Prevention Act, which was created by Councilman Michael Brown (I-At-Large) and Mayor-elect Vincent Gray, would define bullying, help establish anti-bullying policies and protect schools that report bullies.
The Harassment and Intimidation Act, proposed by Councilman Harry Thomas (D-Ward 5), would establish similar measures but would extend the reach of the policy beyond public and charter schools.
Brown’s legislative director, Kilin Boardman-Schroyer, said that the committee is currently dedicating most of its energy to the city’s budget. It plans to pass the legislation this or next year.
He hopes that the committee will be able to synthesize the two bills.
The District of Columbia’s Committee of the Whole, which is in charge of all public education, held a hearing Monday to discuss the new anti-bullying legislation. About 20 public witnesses and representatives from the LGBTQ community, including the D.C. Trans Coalition, were present at the meeting. The DCTC, which is dedicated to upholding the rights and well-being of the transgender and transsexual community in D.C., has played a major role in supporting the legislation.
Currently, 45 states have anti-bullying laws, but the District’s would be further reaching than most, especially because of its focus on gender identity-related bullying.
In its testimony, DCTC cited gender identity-related bullying as a key reason preventative legislation should be passed. Citing a study by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network the testimony stated that nearly two-thirds of transgender students felt unsafe in school, 48 percent reported being physically assaulted and 76 percent reported being sexually harassed. As a result, transgender students are more inclined to skip class, have lower grade point averages and are less interested in attending college.
“There needs to be a better solution,” Boardman-Schroyer concluded, “It can’t just be that [bullying] comes with the territory of being a kid.”

Though documentaries are the “brussel sprouts” of movies according to filmmaker Louie Psihoyos, his film “The Cove” may overcome the stigma of the often despised vegetable.
Psihoyos, director of the Academy Award-winning documentary “The Cove,” spoke to Georgetown students last night about his film and mankind’s impact on the environment.
“The Cove” follows a team of filmmakers, activists and other specialists as they covertly film annual dolphin hunting in Taiji, Japan. Using investigative reporting techniques, hidden microphones and infrared cameras, the film captures Japanese fishermen herding dolphins into a hidden cove where they are slaughtered for consumption.
“These animals are so cool, so exquisite,” Psihoyos said. “They are the only wild animal to ever come out to save a human being.”
Psihoyos speaks from experience – dolphins defended him from a hammerhead shark while he was diving.
“I’m trying to repay the favor a little bit,” he said.
In addition to discussing the ecological impact of dolphin hunting, the film reports on the human threats to ocean life. But the process goes both ways, as the film points out – humans are at a risk of mercury poisoning from consuming dolphin meat and other seafood.
Psihoyos hopes the issues brought to life in his film will eventually influence policy.
“Most movies are 10 dollars and a box of popcorn, but I think this movie can change the world,” Psihoyos said.
Before working on “The Cove,” his first feature film, Psihoyos was a photographer for National Geographic magazine.
“The only experience I had was a three-day crash course before I went to Taiji,” he said. Psihoyos said, however, that his biggest challenge was not in the filming itself, but in making a movie that appealed to audiences as a documentary.
“The business model for documentaries is broken,” he said. “But that isn’t why we made this movie.”
Psihoyos hopes that “The Cove” will motivate people to discover solutions to such problems. “Turn off the lights, invest in energy efficient appliances.”
“There’s not an energy shortage, there’s a creativity shortage,” he said. “We just need more voices inspiring people to make the right choices.”
Students that attended felt that Psihoyos himself certainly inspired them.
“He was able to make a documentary so important and so entertaining at the same time,” Joe Mancino (COL ’13) said.
Eric Wright (MSB ’13), the member of the Georgetown Lecture Fund that helped coordinate the event, felt that Psihoyos has an important message for Georgetown students.
“I think everyone should know about this issue,” he said. “We have a lot of activist-type people on this campus, and if you can get them passionate they can change things [.] you know that the people here are going to be running the world in 20 years.”
In exchange, Psihoyos also valued the opportunity to speak with Georgetown students.
“This generation I’m speaking to now is the one I have the most hope for,” he said. Everybody here has a mission – why you’re here, why you’re in school. You all right now have the best ideas you’ll ever have, and I want to inspire you to keep that. You want to change the world, and that’s what “The Cove” is about.”

The George Washington University announced yesterday that it will offer gender-neutral housing for the 2011-2012 academic year, as talks of gender-blind living arrangements at Georgetown are only getting off the ground.
At GWU, the new program will give students the choice to live with each other regardless of gender or sexual orientation.
Students will be required to request gender-neutral housing and room with a student they know, GWU spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard told The Hatchet, GWU’s student newspaper. No student will be randomly assigned to a mixed-sex room. The gender-neutral assignments will exist in all but three residence halls.
Gender-blind housing is being discussed on the Hilltop, but success seems more distant. A Georgetown University Student Association Senate resolution advocating more dialogue on the issue was passed Nov. 14.
GUSA Senator Josh Mogil (SFS ’11), the driving force behind the effort, hopes that the approval at GWU will reinforce the efforts of Georgetown students to promote gender-blind housing on campus.
“It’s just a sign that the times are changing,” said Mogil. “It reaffirms our commitment to make every Hoya feel comfortable.”
Georgetown’s proposal for gender-blind housing, however, is fundamentally different from GWU’s gender-neutral option. Gender-blind housing would not take gender into account when finding the best situation for an individual student, such as one who does not identify with a gender.
“We’re asking for [gender-blind housing] only for kids who need it for safety and security issues,” said Mogil. “We want to implement more options or at least education about current options.”
GUSA has not taken a formal position on the policy.
ogil is convening a preliminary meeting about the issue next Thursday with the administration, but university spokeswoman Julie Bataille has said there are no plans to change the protocol at Georgetown. Mogil predicts that the upcoming changes at GWU won’t affect Georgetown’s position due to the university’s Jesuit background.
However, Todd Olson, Vice President for Student Affairs, said he was willing to speak with students about possible changes.
“I am open to discussing ideas and interests with students as they pursue this dialogue,” Olson said.
Gender-neutral housing is not entirely new to GWU’s campus. In 2008, students formed a living and learning cohort titled Escaping Gender, which allowed students to live with others of the opposite sex. The cohort houses six students and is the only gender-neutral housing option currently available on campus. Frustrated by the lack of more options, student Michael Komo formed Colonials for Gender-Neutral Housing in the fall of 2009. The group researched gender-neutral housing options at other universities and pushed for a campus-wide expansion of the cohort.
Komo followed this up with a push among the student government; in January 2010, he sponsored a resolution advocating gender-neutral housing options for all students that was passed by the GW Student Association Senate. In response, GWU’s administration created a policy review committee for the issue. Finally, on Dec. 2, Komo’s vision became a reality.
“It’s been a constant dialogue on how to implement this, and it feels wonderful,” Komo said. “Once we get the involvement a little bit higher, there will be a sort of domino effect. I think we will need some of those tools to be on the progressive end and implement this at other universities.”
At Georgetown, Mogil will keep working for the sake of students who feel uncomfortable in single-sex housing on the Hilltop.
“I am personally ecstatic that GWU has made this incredibly bold move,” said Mogil. “This is a path that other D.C. schools should follow.”

The inaugural run of online faculty evaluations for certain courses has been met by mixed reviews from students, with some wary of dubious anonymity and a lack of personal connection.
 
“I’ve heard of people who don’t take the online surveys because they don’t think they’re anonymous,” Christian Ortiz (CED ’12) said.
 
Completing the Internet surveys does require a NetID and password, but the website assures students that the responses are still anonymous.
 
 
 
“I worry about whether my responses can be traced back to me when they come with an e-mail address,” said Corinne Seals (GRD), a teaching assistant who is in the linguistics department.
 
 
 
Some students say they may not feel as invested in the survey now that some are on the web.
 
 
 
“When I do it online I can feel less personal about giving honest feedback,” Glenda Dieuveille (COL ’14) said.
 
 
 
An email from the Office of the Registrar seemed to offer incentives for students hesitant to complete the voluntary evaluations. Advertisements told of the opportunity to win two lower-level tickets to a Georgetown men’s basketball game, an iPod or gift certificates.
 
 
 
Still, the question remains whether or not the marketing push can halt a slide in participation. As the system stands, online surveys are not mandatory and students are no longer handed hard copies of the evaluation forms in class for courses that elect to be rated online.
 
 
 
“At the end of the semester, I don’t have the time to do a survey unless the school makes time for it,” Seals said “I wouldn’t give my students online surveys if I was given the option.”
 
 
 
According to the Registrar’s website, “Evaluation results are used in decision making for rank and tenure.” Although Georgetown publishes the aggregate results online, some of the survey data is withheld.
 
 
 
Associate Professor Maria Donoghue of the biology department and Faculty Senate expressed displeasure at what seemed to be an antiquated reporting process.
 
 
 
“I don’t know why the results of student evaluations posted on the Registrar’s website aren’t more current,” she said. “I think my last evaluation is from 2007, and when I look at the list of evaluated faculty, many of the professors aren’t teaching the listed courses anymore or aren’t even at Georgetown any longer.”
 
 
 
According to John Pierce, University Registrar and evaluations coordinator, Georgetown has been conducting faculty evaluations at each semester’s end for over 25 years. He doesn’t recall any modifications to the questionnaire since the 1990s. The generic paper questionnaires feature a fill-in-the-bubble-style front side and a chance to respond to open-ended questions on the back.
 
 
 
Some students don’t put much faith in this evaluation style.
 
 
 
“I don’t feel the evaluations are very personal,” Ann-Marie Jacoby (COL ’13) said. “And because of that, I don’t put in much effort.”
 
 
 
Jacoby has another reason for doubting the evaluations, citing a professor she said has undermined the process. This week, according to Jacoby, the professor said to the class, “`I would like you to take the survey, but it’s not going to affect me.'”
 
 
 
For Jacoby, professor apathy toward student feedback can be disenchanting.
 
 
 
“When a professor says something like that, it makes me feel like the evaluations aren’t serious and my voice isn’t being heard.”
 
 
 
Ryan Crowe (COL ’12) said that, to her, evaluations usually come down to whether or not she liked her professor.
 
 
 
“I only take them seriously if I don’t like the teacher,” Crowe said. “If I hated the teacher I might reflect that in my evaluation of the course.”
 
 
 
Professors share similar concerns about the outcome of the new evaluations,
 
 
 
“My concern is that my evals might be lower than the paper evaluations. Why? I think when you are in class and the professor is right there that a student might feel more inclined to review the class positively,” Elizabeth Stephen, associate professor of demography, wrote in an email. “If a student is sitting in his/her room, she/he might think, `Oh, man, that class was a lot of work’ or `I didn’t really like how the prof. graded my paper.'”
 
 
 
Other professors said that they hoped the new system would prove successful, despite fears that students would not respond if not forced to fill out the form in class.
 
 
 
“I really hope students will use the online forms – -if the response rate is lower, then I will probably switch back,” John Corcoran, a Ph. D. candidate who is teaching a European history course this semester, wrote in an email. “I’d like to think they will be more effective, because students will be able to take a little more time when the evaluations aren’t squeezed into one of the last class meetings.”
 
 
 
Most students interviewed by THE HOYA were unaware that the results are published online. Donoghue believes students could get more from the evaluations for course selection, particularly for general education requirements, if the published results were more current and accurate.
 
 
 
“Instead students have to rely on ratemyprofessor.com, which I think includes only the extreme points of view and tends to miss the middle, since some effort is required to post,” Donoghue says.
 
 
 
Many colleges around the country supplement student evaluations of the faculty with other forms of assessment. At Williams College, for example, students are also interviewed, and departing seniors give a more detailed evaluation.
 
Associate Professor Anna De Fina of the Italian department, a Faculty Senator, notes that Georgetown has other forms of evaluation. She cites faculty peer observation, review of teaching materials and other in-department methods as a few examples.
 
Since the Georgetown University Student Association pushed for the original implementation of the evaluation system, the body has had access to the survey results, according to Pierce.
 
 
 
GUSA President Calen Angert (MSB ’11), though, has never seen the evaluations used by GUSA in his four years of service.
 
 
 
Angert conceded to being “hazy” on the history of the evaluations, and he was not aware that some results were not published.
 
 
 
“We obviously have a limited amount of time to address a limited amount of issues,” Angert responded when questioned why GUSA has not advocated a more complete publication of results.
 
 
 
“We can’t address every issue under the sun. If someone were to approach us, we would explore it.”
 
 
 
Joan Leach, rank and tenure committee president, and Wayne Davis, Faculty Senate president, could not be reached for comment.
 
 
 
Last spring, prior to the online evaluation system’s launch this semester, some classes tested out the web surveys in a pilot program.

Hearts of soccer fans across the United States broke Thursday morning when FIFA announced that Qatar had beat out a strong United States bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
Despite a plan that had been reviewed by FIFA as low-risk in 13 of 15 potential problem areas, an achievement that the bids of Qatar and Australia could not boast, the selection committee elected to hand the responsibility for organizing the single largest sporting event in the world to the Middle Eastern nation smaller than Connecticut and with about the same population as New Mexico.
For some at Georgetown, frustrations have arisen as the United States lost a chance, for at least another eight years, to break the World Cup attendance record that it set in 1996. This disappointment, however, is mitigated by the possibility of the Cup’s leading to a huge boon for the Walsh School of Foreign Service’s campus in Doha, Qatar.
“It [could] get more and more students to choose Qatar instead of the more traditional places like Egypt or Jordan,” Michael Ang (SFS ’11), a senior that spent a semester in Doha last year, said.
“Overall, it [could be] great in helping the greater educational community appreciate the campus that we have over there,” said Joseph Brown (COL ’11), who spent the summer at SFS-Q. “This will allow people to get a better understanding of what Education City is.”
While concerns about the Qatari bid range from its small population to the poor quality of the Qatari soccer team – which will receive an automatic bid to the World Cup and likely become only the second host country after South Africa not to advance past the group stages – Brown is upbeat about Qatar’s chances to impress. Still, he sees several other potential problem areas.
“Public transportation is a huge facet of the Qatari culture that’s missing,” he said. “There are bars, but there [are] only four of five of them, and there’s only one liquor store. And, considering the need of the adult population that might be traveling there, they might need to address that in a different way.”
The Qatari government has promised an influx of funds to provide the infrastructure that will be needed to make the World Cup a success, pledging to make sure that the requisite 12 stadiums are ready for use by 2022. They also need to address concerns about player safety in Qatar’s stifling heat.
Although the rest of the world may be a bit skeptical about the sheer amount of construction and modification needed over the next decade-plus, under-fire FIFA President Sepp Blatter and the voting committee are not the only ones convinced that Qatar will be able to pull off the World Cup successfully.
“I think this is going to be a refreshing experience for the World Cup,” Brown said. “It [will be] great for the Middle East and the culture that surrounds it. I think very few people know how important football is to these people, and it’ll be great for them to have this exposure.”

Georgetown has seen a dramatic rise in early undergraduate applications from minority students, specifically black students, this admissions cycle.
Applications in the early pool from minority students rose by about 24.5 percent on the whole. Within that figure, early applications from black students jumped the most, with an increase of about 44.9 percent. The number of Latino students applying early increased by about 24.7 percent from last year. Early applications from Asian Americans increased by 11.4 percent and those from international students increased by 29.5 percent.
Although the rise in applications from Latino students can be partly attributed to the general population growth of that demographic in the United States, the rise in early applications from black students is largely inexplicable, according to Charles Deacon, dean of undergraduate admissions.
“There is this macro trend. And so it’s not surprising to me therefore that the increase between last year and this year is almost entirely students of color, plus international students,” he said. “But it is surprising to me, the number of African American students jumping so much. That’s not what you would predict because that population is not growing. That’s a stable population. So that’s an interesting phenomenon that at the moment is inexplicable.”
Deacon’s lack of an explanation for this year’s spike in applications from black students is not unfounded. Georgetown has traditionally been popular among black students, and in 2008, Black Enterprise Magazine ranked the university as number five on a list of top colleges for black students for 2008.
According to Candace Carrington (COL ’12), a member of the Black Student Alliance board, this year’s dramaticincrease may stem from Georgetown’s recent focus on diversity issues.
While Georgetown has drawn attention for some racially-charged incidents, minority applicants may have been encouraged by the promotion of the bias-related incident reporting and dialogue surrounding diversity, Carrington said.
Ryan Wilson (COL ’12), co-chair of the Admissions and Recruitment Diversity Working Group, cited a variety of proposals, such as a new question about diversity on Georgetown’s application, that could have contributed to the jump.
“I think it’s just an overall campaign to show our values,” Wilson said.
Georgetown’s continued commitment to meeting the full financial need of applicants and fundraising push for scholarships makes Georgetown a draw for low-income students, according to Wilson.
Both Milana Edwards, education committee chair for Georgetown’s chapter of the NAACP, and Carrington said that more black students are graduating from high school.
“I also think there might be an increase – and I’m not sure how significant this is – in educational opportunity for minority students of lower socioeconomic status. Charter schools [in urban areas] have been graduating their first class of seniors in the past 10 years or so .” Edwards said in an email.
“I know from a personal standpoint I was the first from my school (which was a charter school) to go to Georgetown, and for the past three years there’s [been] a student that goes here and more and more are accepted.”
Edwards said, however, that the high number of applications from minority students is not necessarily linked to the number of applications from low-income minority students. Georgetown saw an overall increase in applicants who qualify for financial aid in the early action cycle, according to Deacon.
While the university has initiated fundraising efforts for student scholarships, providing full financial support for all accepted students will become more of a challenge in the future.
“It’s a huge issue. I’m hoping Georgetown is going to continue to have as a priority responding equitably to all populations. And I would think we would based on our history,” Deacon said.
“But it’s going to take money that we don’t have right now. And the question is how we are going to solve that problem. It puts a lot of pressure on the Advancement Office to raise money.”
Ultimately, however, the Georgetown administration has been pleased with the increased applications from minority and low-income students.
“I think that the admissions office is doing a great job getting out the message in many communities that Georgetown is a remarkable university and an ideal place for students of every background to develop their potential and realize their goals,” said Daniel Porterfield (COL ’83), senior vice president for strategic development and co-chair for the Admissions and Recruitment Diversity Working Group.
“I like the way that the Advisory Group on diversity issues within admissions has been thinking creatively about how we can recruit still more diverse incoming classes. It’s inspiring to see Georgetown doing so well.

The entrepreneurship advice website asitchanges.com created by Georgetown students Rahul Singh (CED), Austin Yoder (COL ’11), David Liu (MSB ’12), Ivan Batischev (SFS ’08) and Ankit Goyal (SFS ’12), aims to inspire those looking for ideas for their own startup.
The website specializes in the compilation and development of materials designed to inspire and empower young entrepreneurs in their endeavors, particularly those conducted online. The website features articles written by and about successful businessmen and offers multiple resources about business management.
“My business partner and I wanted a site where we could learn about business and have a continuous stream of inspirational and motivational stories of business leaders from all over the world and give that to everyone, whether they were in D.C., Moscow, Delhi, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Montevideo, or Nairobi,” Singh, founder and writer for the website, said.
“Asitchanges.com provides people with the information and tools necessary to be successful in the new Internet age,” Liu, a marketer and editor for the website, said. “We believe our website can be particularly helpful to college students trying to start their own companies.”
Eventually, Singh hopes that asitchanges.com will serve as a social network for entrepreneurs to better exchange ideas and connect with successful predecessors.
Singh and his business partner Eric Ramseur, an expert in computer science, founded the website during the summer of 2010 in order to address problems they felt were apparent in the entrepreneurial environment.
“AsitChanges addresses the problem of information overload,” Singh said. “All the knowledge of the world is available online, especially new knowledge of business, which changes every day. We want to make it easy for people at a hyper-local level to get access to this information, knowledge, education and hopefully wisdom from the masses.”
The website has a large target audience, ranging from high school students to executives of small businesses.
“Our goal is to show people a career path to entrepreneurship no matter where they live, how old they are and how much money they have,” Singh said.
Singh and Ramseur are also developing Appleseed, a software portal through which micro-enterprises, businesses with five employees or less, can integrate the activities of online software to optimize communication and trade with other businesses.
“I want to make it easy to start a company in 24 hours and do all the necessary connecting of information from the bank account to the government, so that people don’t have to deal with the horrendous paperwork involved,” Singh said. “That’s the beginning of the problem. There is a continuous need for people nowadays to manage information. Appleseed addresses the inefficiencies of business.”
The recent developments of AsitChanges.com and Appleseed have been further fueled by Singh’s experiences in his entrepreneurship class with professor William Finnerty.
“His class really is a week by week self-discovery process which causes people to act rather than think,” Singh said. “Although [Ramseur and I] were well into our ideas, his class definitely motivated me to get moving faster and understand that it is always a now or never moment.”
Singh, Ramseur and their team say that they hope their work instills the sense of entrepreneurship in other hopefuls like themselves.
“We are creating the future of the world here,” AsitChanges.com reads. “It won’t happen overnight, and it won’t happen because we think about it, but rather by showing people how they can do it themselves. AsitChanges wants you to succeed in life by creating a better life for yourself, your community, and your world by taking part in the new world of business.”

After a wave of laptop thefts swept campus in the past two months, the Department of Public Safety is developing strategies to keep students’ computers out of the hands of criminals.
Plans include publicizing DPS’s laptop registration program and reducing opportunities for laptops to be left unattended.
Though the registration program has existed for over 10 years, only a small percentage of the laptops on campus are currently registered, according to Associate Director of Public Safety Joseph Smith.
DPS is looking to increase the number of sign-ups, by setting up tables in Sellinger Lounge and Red Square to encourage students to participate in the voluntary program.
“Traditionally we’ve [tabled] at the beginning of the academic year. I’d like to increase that a bit . get it out there more,” Smith said.
He said that the program most likely will not deter criminals, but will make recovery easier for students who have lost their possessions. When a student registers a laptop, the serial number, model, color and description are recorded and a metal sticker is stamped on the bottom. That information can help identify the laptop if it is found. The registration fee is $10.
Smith is also drawing on student groups such as to garner support for the program. InterHall General Assemblyman Dalvin Butler (COL ’13) has met with Smith about reducing crime on campus.
“We want outreach to the Georgetown community to make sure they are aware that this program exists,” Butler said.
He is organizing a DPS presentation about laptop registration and theft prevention strategies for the Southwest Quad Community Council.
Smith and Butler are also working on some more novel efforts to keep student computers safe by targeting one of the most common reasons for leaving a laptop unattended – a bathroom break.
To help curb thefts in Lauinger Library, Smith is engaged in talks with the university’s librarian and administration about a plan to install “laptop shelves” in the building’s bathrooms.
Smith said he was the one who conceived the plan to place the shelves in the stalls. He has since met with Butler to help launch the campaign.
“At this time, we are determining the cost and where the funds would come from,” Butler said.
The two met on Tuesday to discuss the proposal and Butler said that he is looking to bring the issue to the InterHall Council.
“We expect this to be in place sometime in the spring semester,” he said.
Smith says registration and laptop shelves are just parts of a multi-pronged effort to reduce theft.
“We’re approaching [the problem] from multiple levels,” he said.
Smith emphasized that the most important way to reduce theft is student education.
“We’re working to make students more accountable. They shouldn’t be leaving their laptops unattended,” he said.
In the month of November, 24 laptops were stolen on campus according to DPS crime logs. Three of the thefts in the last week were unattended laptops in Lauinger.

With companies now releasing “whipahol” – alcohol-infused whipped cream – many speculate that the new product may be filling the void left by the ban on Four Loko.
Brands of the whipped cream such as Whipped Lightning and Cream are advertising their flavored product as a topping for drinks, cocktails and desserts. The whipahol ranges from being 30-proof to 36-proof, depending on the flavor.
While the product is not new to the market, it has only recently become a popular treat for students.
Neither Whipped Lightning nor Cream are sold in D.C., but they can be bought in Maryland and Virginia, as well as through several online vendors.
Because the product is being compared to Four Loko, some people are concerned about the risk of alcohol poisoning. Whipahol is advertised as an addition to already alcoholic drinks and could lead to excess, critics say. Biology Office Manager Ellen Bateman expressed concern over the increased alcohol intake.
“It’s dangerous to your health and has a negative effect on brain cells. Georgetown students should be too smart to do this,” Bateman said.
John Devlin (COL ’13), however, feels that there is not too much cause for concern.
“It doesn’t seem to be that popular here and it would take a lot of whipahol to begin to worry about alcohol poisoning,” Devlin said.
Dr. Anita Barry, director of the Boston Public Health Commission, is concerned about the packaging of the new product, according to an interview with New England Cable News.
“If a product looks like something else, it’s easy not to be aware that it might contain a lot of alcohol,” she said.
Bateman echoed this concern, and said that she is also worried about the increased use of aerosol cans. Aerosols can be harmful if inhaled directly and have been said to have a negative effect on the ozone layer. Regardless, many students expressed curiosity and willingness to try the new product.
Those who have tried it say they like it, focusing on the surprisingly noticeable amount of alcohol.
“It was surprisingly good, I think it was peppermint and it was amazing,” Samir Sarda (COL ’13) said.
