Universities across the country, including Georgetown, have become the nucleus of the burgeoning microaggressions movement which uses social media to promote dialogue about discrimination in daily life.
The Brown University Micro/Aggressions Facebook page, is one of many university movements aiming to address the prevalence of discriminating racial and stereotypical microaggressions in everyday life.
“As an African American female in a white-washed community, I understand that my hair is something of a novelty. However, that does not give people the right to come up and touch, tug or, God forbid, try to run their fingers through it whenever they please.” Comments like this are posted frequently on the page and have been echoed in similar micro/aggression campaigns across the country.
Campaigns, such as #BBUM (Being Black at University of Michigan), “The Microaggressions Project” from Columbia University, as well as #DBKGU (Dangerous Black Kids of Georgetown) and #BBGU (Being Black at Georgetown University), have brought light to the daily phenomena of microaggressions.
Aanchal Saraf, a sophomore at Brown University who has posted on Brown University Micro/aggressions, an anonymous Facebook page, stressed that microaggressions can exist anywhere and can target anyone, even at an elite university such as Brown.
“Micro/aggressions happen with frequency for folks with marginalized identities no matter where we may go. This is inescapable, even at Brown,” Saraf wrote in an email.
The word, microaggression, first appeared in academic dialogue at Harvard during the 1970’s and has since been fleshed out by professor of psychology at Columbia University Dr. Derald W. Sue. In his book “Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation,” Sue defined the term, microaggression, to describe commonplace verbal statements that hold negatively charged and discriminating undertones.
Frequently directed at racial minorities, microaggressions can be unwanted, daily happenstances that leave individuals defending or explaining their own background.
Professor of race and American law at Georgetown and author of forthcoming book, “Place Not Race: A New Vision of Opportunity in America,” Sheryll Cashin described contemporary microaggressions as a more dimensional and covert version of traditional racism.
“A microaggression is distinct form of old style Jim Crow racism or just racial hatred,” Cashin said. “It conveys this idea that there is something about you that is inherently foreign. There is embedded in this statement the idea that you’re not from here, you’re not American.”
It is this notion of racial comfort and misperception that fueled the satirical, justice-driven campaign Dangerous Black Kids of Georgetown, created in early March to respond to specific instances of racial profiling and killing.
“Whether we are in casual clothes or dressed well, and regardless of all we have achieved, it is our skin, our blackness, that causes society to perceive us as dangerous, but there is always more than what meets the eye. Black does not equal violent, it does not equal dangerous,” the movement’s founding principles read.
Creator of DBKGU Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson (SFS ‘14) described a personal experience of racial profiling while dressed in a hoodie.
“I was wearing a hoodie walking around campus…and I was stopped by the Georgetown Police and they asked me what I was doing in the area…and I told them that I was a Georgetown student, but they didn’t believe me,” Corbin-Johnson said. “I pulled out my GoCard to show them.”
Corbin-Johnson said she sometimes feels similar judgment among the student body at Georgetown as well.
“Depending on the classes you take, people have a different perception of you where you feel like you have to represent your race well, especially in certain classes,” Corbin-Johnson said.
According to Cashin, the “micro”-ness of the statement ought not to be overlooked either, as the stereotyping statements can accumulate to hammer home the message, “You don’t belong.”
“[The statements] can be quite innocent and the person who says these things has no idea that they’re conveying a negative idea, but through the cumulative lived experience of these daily comments on the receiving end it’s the idea that they are microaggressed,” Cashin said.
Saraf, who has posted on the Brown micro/aggressions page herself, felt that the anonymous format of the page provided a space for students to voice their experiences without targeting a specific party.
“My sense is that the page exists to validate the experiences of marginalized folks to people who may not realize the implications of what they’ve been saying or doing. It is an anonymous space to call people in to the conversation on privilege without cannibalizing them individually in a public space,” Saraf said.
Cashin expressed support for social media platforms such as these in raising awareness of a diverse set of cultural experiences.
“The campaigns are a way of helping these groups become more culturally dexterous. It’s a way of educating people not of these groups what the daily, lived experience of these groups is and to make people more culturally sensitive,” Cashin said.
Corbin-Johnson stressed the value of social media platforms for informing the public in a multimedia-centric society.
“I think the best type of campaign is the one that has a face to it – it makes it more real and something tangible to hold onto,” Corbin-Johnson said.
Corbin-Johnson said that while the conception of a post-racial society can seem a far cry from reality, campaigns to raise awareness of microaggressions within daily interaction are necessary to the larger goal of equality.
“Whatever project it’s going to be, it’s going to be a process; nothing is going to happen overnight, but you can’t let the problem resolve itself because I don’t feel like it ever would on its own,” Corbin-Johnson said.

A six-semester on-campus housing requirement for all undergraduates is currently under consideration, with the university set to announce a decision by the end of the month. The policy change would require all juniors to live on campus. Currently, only sophomores and freshmen are required to live on campus, while juniors are free to move into the surrounding neighborhood, although relatively few choose to do so.
The potential requirement is part of the university’s effort to meet the stipulations of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, under which Georgetown must house an additional 385 students on campus by the fall of 2015. Construction of the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall, which is scheduled to open by the fall of 2016, and renovation of Ryan and Mulledy Halls, the former Jesuit residences, are also part of the university’s push for 385 additional beds. The two projects, however, still leave many of the 385 beds unaccounted for — a gap that a third-year housing requirement could help fill.
The new Georgetown University Student Association leadership, led by GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), has expressed fears that the prospective housing change would place limitations on transfer students or those who study abroad.
“Our biggest concern is the idea of a third-year, six-semester requirement, which would then inevitably mean that if you are studying abroad junior year or if you’re a transfer student, you will be automatically required to live on campus your senior year,” Tezel said. “And we don’t think that freedom of choice should be taken away from students.”
According to Associate Vice President for Community Engagement Lauralyn Lee, the university is set to invest $50 million in renovation and construction over the next three years in order to add the required number of on-campus beds.
“We’re currently in talks with administrators who are predisposed to the option that will make it easiest to ensure that we hit the requirements of 385 additional students on campus by fall 2015,” Tezel said. “But we are very much pushing for a less restrictive policy being put in place so that we can preserve that freedom for students, specifically study-abroad and transfer students, as well as continue to maintain a system in which the university is incentivizing students to live on campus instead of requiring them to do so.”
Other options for changing next year’s policy include requiring sophomores to live in dorms rather than apartments, providing a third year of guaranteed housing to juniors or instituting a financial aid guarantee.
“It comes down to the fact that they don’t want — the people in the Georgetown community, our neighbors — don’t want students living in the neighborhood, because they don’t want to have students disrupt them,” GUSA Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15)  said. “So they want more students to live on campus.”
In addition to requiring an extra 385 beds, the Campus Plan relocated 65 students living on 36th Street townhouses to on-campus apartments and dormitories during the fall of 2013. According to the Zoning Commission Order No. 10-32, 450 students once living on 36th Street or in other parts of the Georgetown neighborhood will be housed by the university by the fall of 2015.
“We have been keeping the neighbors who participate in the Georgetown Community Partnership informed of our efforts around student housing, but the decisions about what housing will be constructed, what type it will be, what it will look like, where it will be, whether and what policy changes may be implemented are decisions that are being made by the university administration, in consultation with its students,” Lee said.
The GCP facilitates communication between Georgetown University and the surrounding community; the GCP will be involved in the development of a 20-year campus plan, which is set to begin in 2018. Discussions about the new requirement have not reached a conclusion yet, but GUSA expects administrators to announce a decision just before final exams.
“They were kind of playing with policies that would allow them to hit that number,” Tezel said. “And I think especially after students made it clear in last semester’s referendum that they did not want a satellite campus, it put the administration in a position where they would have to consider additional policies or requirements to meet the bed count necessary.”

Born from the ideas of Vatican II, the Vatican’s Pontifical Council for Culture established the Courtyard of the Gentiles in 2010 to facilitate interaction between Catholics and non-Catholics on a variety of topics, including science and art. Having already held conferences across the world, the initiative has come to the United States for the first time; this week’s “Faith, Culture and the Common Good” will run at Georgetown from April 9 to 11.
The conference includes panels constructed by the Office of the President in conjunction with the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs; it includes professors from University of California, Berkeley, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Pitzer College and Harvard University.
The conference is the result of a partnership between Georgetown, through the Office of the President, and the Vatican’s Pontifical Council for Culture, through the Washington Archdiocese.
Previous installments include a February conference in Budapest called “Morality, Economics, Secular Society in the 21st Century” and Berlin’s “Freedom Experiences With and Without God.”
“The event will provide a context for participants to engage in meaningful dialogue and to strengthen our collective commitment to the common good. The dialogue among people is an essential component of this gathering,” Georgetown University Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh wrote in an email.
Pugh emphasized how civic life can be ameliorated if people of different faith traditions or no religious affiliations combine.
“In addition to fascinating discussions on how people of different faith traditions, as well as those who claim no religious affiliation, can work together to enrich civic life in America, we are exploring culture through performance,” Pugh wrote.
Thursday’s Gaston Hall panels, “Realizing the Common Good” and “Faith, Culture and Community,” focused on this question of civic life. The day featured opening remarks from University President John J. DeGioia, Archbishop of Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl and Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, the president of the Pontifical Council for Culture. Cokie Roberts, of ABC News and NPR, moderated the first plenary session, while Paul Elie of the Berkley Center moderated the second. The day featured breakout sessions interspersed between panels on Copley Lawn, in “Tents of Dialogue.” A performance of Flannery O’Connor’s “Everything that Rises Must Converge,” by theater troupe Compagnia de’ Colombari followed in the evening.
Kicking off the conference, Talib Kweli and five other hip-hop artists of various faiths performed Wednesday at the Kennedy Center, followed by a panel discussion about the influence of faith in hip-hop music.
The concert, which was entitled “Faith, Hip-Hop and the Common Good,” was open to the public and featured a nearly packed audience at the center’s Eisenhower Theatre, which seats over 1,000 people.
Hip-hop icon Russell Simmons, whose book on meditation was distributed to all attendees, opened the event with an introduction, explaining the importance of music in his faith.
“Music draws you to the present moment,” he said. “When society goes wrong, a musician can look inside and correct it. The world is sucking us out, but music is sucking us in.”
Simmons explained hip-hop’s specific place in music.
“Hip-hop is a good place to start. … All the prophets talk about stillness because then you explore the peace of God, and then you find this connection, this sameness,” Simmons said. “This idea of sameness is what we’re exploring. Musicians especially get it, as do all artists.”
The Narcicyst served as the host for the concert, with DJ Boo providing the backing beats for all the artists.
Amkoullel, a Muslim rapper from Mali who sang about revolution and democracy, was the opening act. He later ceded the stage to Mandeep Sethi, a Sikh emcee from California. Poetic Pilgrimage, two Muslim women wearing hijab, took the stage next, followed by MC Jin, who spoke about his conversion to Christianity.
All the artists emphasized unity as the theme of the concert.
“We all share love, we all share struggle together,” The Narcicyst said.
Unity was looked upon by all artists as something worth striving for.
“Any time there’s unity, it’s a blessing,” MC Jin said.
Finally, Kweli concluded the concert with his set, which featured songs from his newest album, Prisoner of Conscious.
After the concert, all the performers returned to the stage for a conversation with Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson, who prompted them to discuss the importance of their faith in relation to their music.
“Music is prayer. This is my church, this is my prayer doing this music,” Kweli said.
Dyson asked the artists to reconcile the theme of unity underlying the concert with the various divisions created by religion.
“What I put in my music is just love,” Amkoullel said. “I’m not asking you to be Muslim.”
The artists stressed the ways in which unity is brought about in their music.
“The key is focusing on similarities, not differences,” Kweli added.
Dyson underlined the importance of the concert as he closed the event.
“When I hear this music, I hear power,” he said.
Wednesday’s event served as both part of the conference and as part of the Kennedy Center’s ongoing hip-hop series.
The concert also aimed to showcase a distinctly American style of culture.
“The conversation on culture begins at the Kennedy Center, a place that serves as a national home for the arts in the United States,” Pugh wrote.
Students who attended the event reacted positively to its message and execution.
“I really enjoyed it. First the music was wonderful and really fun. Then the conversation afterwards touched on something I don’t think gets discussed a lot when talking about hip-hop and music in general, in the deeper significance and depth to the lyrics those artists had,” Kieran Halloran (SFS ’14) said.

With the annual upperclassmen scramble to confirm off-campus living plans for the coming year in mind, a website that will allow students to discuss and rate the quality of landlords and conditions of homes launched Wednesday. The site, Roomr, is the product of collaboration between Students of Georgetown Inc., the Georgetown University Student Association and the Georgetown Student Tenant Association and aims to increase transparency in housing selection.
“The goal of Roomr is to make sure that seniors and people living off campus can keep this information for younger students’ use so that when they’re looking for housing they don’t have this issue where they have no idea who a good landlord is,” GSTA founder Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14), a former GUSA deputy chief of staff who currently serves as transition chair, said.
The site aims to eliminate some of the frenzy typically associated with selecting an off-campus home.
“It’s such a competitive process that a lot of students just sign up for any lease they can get because they know that the landlords have so much leverage. This is a way for students to already have an idea of where to seek out the right landlords,” GSTA Co-Director Nick Suttle (COL ’15) said.
The website, loosely modeled after Rate My Professors, allows students to post comments detailing the responsibility and reliability of their landlords and the condition of their houses. The houses up for lease can be organized on the website based on monthly price, the number of people they can accommodate or the location.
The site’s creators said they hope that in addition to serving as a database for student tenants, the website will serve to make landlords more accountable for their actions.
“The goal is to make sure the good landlords are rewarded and create this market-based incentive for them to do better because people will gravitate toward the landlords that are ranked better on Roomr,” Peterson said.
Although neighborhood landlords currently have not been informed about Roomr, Suttle said that landlords will be notified of the site’s existence.
“It would defeat the purpose if they didn’t know, in terms of increasing accountability,” Suttle said.
GUSA is responsible for publicizing Roomr, which it will do primarily through a social media campaign set to launch this week.
GSTA will oversee whether or not the homes posted on the website have been inspected within the past two years and are in possession of a basic business license and moderating the site’s comments to avoid slander or swear words.
The idea for the website originated with The Corp. The Corp IT+Marketing department developed and programmed the website as well as paid for server cost.
“Even if this isn’t the most even-handed collaboration in terms of where the expenses are being paid, I think it’s a good first step for The Corp as an organization to think about how it can create positive partnerships with other groups on campus that are mutually beneficial,” The Corp Chief Executive Officer Sam Rodman (MSB ’15) said.
Roomr will be the second external website developed by the IT+M department, after last spring’s launch of the pre-registration tool Classy.
“It represents this entirely new effort from The Corp to serve students,” Rodman said. “Our external storefronts have a great impact on student life and it’s a great way to serve students but these things take three or four years to get off the ground. It’s been really cool to see that we can consistently find new ways to benefit students that we can churn out every six months, every year or so.”
Although entirely student-run, Roomr complies with the university’s 2010-2017 Campus Plan Agreement, which dictates that the university must maintain a list of rental homes in West Georgetown and Burleith that have basic business licenses.
“The way the current [Office of Neighborhood Life]-maintained website works is that they basically solicit landlords,” GUSA Secretary of Neighborhood Relations Chris Kraft (SFS ’15) said. “But that largely misses what’s actually happening. That doesn’t take into account students who aren’t living in houses with BBLs.”
The ONL declined to comment at this time, stating that they had insufficient knowledge of the website.

The Academic Resource Center, responsible for accommodating the additional resources and necessities for students with disabilities, has been unable to meet the needs of disabled students on campus because of certain bureaucratic guidelines.
Most recently, ARC denied aid to a student requiring an interpreter at a Georgetown University Student Association Law School Admission Test class.
“GUSA was co-sponsoring an LSAT prep company to teach six classes here at Georgetown for GU students at a low cost. I reached out to the ARC who let me know that they were not ‘legally responsible’ because it was not related to academics,” Heather Artinian (COL ’15), a hearing impaired student, wrote in an email.
As a result, Artinian contacted GUSA, the co-sponsor of the class, in hopes of being able to receive aid from them.
“I then reached out to GUSA. They unfortunately did not have any accommodations budget because they are a student group,” Artinian wrote. “The issue has probably not come up before for them.”
The lack of consistency in providing for disabled students has created many problems in the past and continues to cause difficulties.
“I have experienced problems like this with the university in general, with all departments. There is always a struggle to book interpreters because there is no central guideline, policy, nor funding by the university, so it’s all about figuring out what goes on, who pays for it, what to do, who to ask, and so on,” Artinian wrote.
ARC’s inaction, coupled with the lack of university-wide regulations for providing aid, has forced organizations such as the Lecture Fund and GUSA to pay for interpreters and aids out of pocket in the past. This year alone, the Lecture Fund spent over $3,000 — the 2014 fiscal year Student Activities Fee appropriation was $65,000 — on American Sign Language translators.
“We had not originally made room in our budget to fund these translators,” Lecture Fund Chair Chris Mulrooney (COL ’14) said.
Translators can cost anywhere from $500 to $700 per event, which usually requires two translators.
GUSA also faced difficulties accommodating the needs of disabled students, as they did not expect their organization to pay for these costs, but as a group representative of students, feel they must accommodate these needs.
“As an organization representing all students, whenever there is an issue with a student group not receiving funding to provide accommodations, it’s our issue,” GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said.
According to Mulrooney, ARC maintains they are providing as best they can with their current budget.
“The Academic Resource Center is doing the best they can with the budget that the university has allocated to them. The issue is that they are facing budget cuts that severely limit their ability to provide adequate accommodations,” Mulrooney said.
The ARC did approach student organizations early in the year to notify them about such budget restrictions and the probability that student organizations would have to provide aid themselves.
“The university officials approached us early in the year asking for our assistance because of budget cuts to the Academic Resource Center,” Mulrooney said. The ARC declined comment for this article.
For GUSA, the organization funded interpreters through differing means, not just out of pocket.
“We pursued other means of reaching out to personal connections, applying for ad hoc funds from SAC and looking for money from Corp Philanthropy,” Tezel said.
However, the Lecture Fund paid all costs, although they recognize that such funds will someday run out.
“While our organization has been able to fund every accommodation request this year, we also realize that we cannot act as a funding board in this capacity for a prolonged period of time,” Mulrooney said.
However, simply not providing aid or disregarding requests from disabled students is not an option for the Lecture Fund or GUSA. Artinian praised GUSA’s efforts to meet her needs for the LSAT class.
“Trevor and his administration were absolutely wonderful in how they dealt with it. They reached out to many different organizations. They really, really tried,” Artinian said.
Likewise, the Lecture Fund meets all requests because of their belief in an inclusive environment here at Georgetown.
“We realized the importance of creating an inclusive environment for our events. We’ve also tried our best to make sure that students are aware that we want to help,” Mulrooney said. “For the past few months, we have included a notice at the bottom of our weekly emails that instructs students on what to do if they need any accommodations to attend our events.”
Although there are a few gateways for accessibility for students requiring additional assistance on campus, Artinian believes that the university still has a long way to go, even if student groups like GUSA and the Lecture Fund are taking the initiative.
“The university needs to take a comprehensive approach to the issues of accessibility on campus. If Georgetown knows that there are issues of accessibility to an LSAT prep company providing services to Georgetown students, on their campus, co-sponsored by GUSA, I would have liked to see more of a ‘we care about you and we will help you’ approach,” Artinian said. “As a student at Georgetown I should have equal access to all events that students have access to. I haven’t felt any support from the university.”

Since the creation of the D.C. Tuition Assistance Grant program in 1999, the D.C. government has prioritized providing access to a wide range of higher education options to D.C. youth; however, Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) has recently raised concerns about possible conflicts between two specific tuition assistance programs for D.C. students that could lead to potential defunding of the federal program she helped put in place.
D.C. TAG provides grants of up to $10,000 to cover the  the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition at public colleges and universities throughout the U.S., as well as up to $2,500 per academic year toward tuition at private colleges in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area, private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) nationwide and two-year colleges nationwide.
According to the Office of the State Superintendent of Education, the D.C. TAG program has helped District students to attend over 300 colleges and universities across the country, and its current federal funding level is $30 million per year.
However, Norton has recently said that the D.C. Promise Act — a recent proposal passed by the D.C. Council authored by mayoral candidate and Chairman of the Council’s Education Committee David Catania (SFS ’90, LAW ’93) (I-At Large) — could put the program at risk. D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray has expressed support for the bill, which would provide the city’s low-income high school graduates with up to $7,500 per year for college, and it will need his signature to become law in addition to funding in the city’s budget.
“Upon learning of the Promise bill, congressional appropriators warned that if it appears the city can fund its own college access program, future funding for D.C. TAG would be at risk,” Norton said in a February statement following the Council’s passage of the bill.
Catania, joined by Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, wrote a letter to Norton before the passage of the bill stating the differences between the D.C. Promise program and the TAG program.
The Promise program specifically targets low-income families, does not provide assistance for tuition at Historically Black Colleges and Universities nor universities within the District of Columbia, and costs significantly less than the TAG program.
The letter goes on to say that the demand for tuition assistance among District students far exceeds what even the TAG program and Promise program can cover, but that the Promise program indicates progress in providing necessary aid to the families that need the help the most.
“There is a demand, as you have acknowledged, far beyond what both D.C. TAG and D.C. Promise will fund. D.C. Promise targets low income students beyond what is available through federal funding, yet does so in a way that is clearly distinguished from the existing D.C. TAG program and at a lesser cost,” the letter said.
Brendan Williams-Kief, Committee Director for Catania, pointed out that no congressional appropriators have contacted the Councilmember’s office to raise concerns about the Promise bill’s funding, and emphasized the need for the bill as college tuition rates continue to rise across the country.
“The Promise bill has always been a way to support, not supplant, D.C. TAG,” Williams-Kief said. “The Councilmember was very proactive about reaching out to appropriators on the Hill, including the chair’s office, throughout the process. Although there have been claims that appropriators are skeptical or concerned about this, they have not to our ability been able to specify a single one that would express such a concern to us.”
Williams-Kief went on to say that while D.C. TAG has helped families across the District with the barrier of college affordability, the District still maintains a distinct disadvantage compared to states across the country that the program simply can’t eliminate.
“D.C. TAG was initially conceived to make up for the fact that the District does not have a robust state university system like every state in the country. We have UDC (University of the District of Columbia), but that is not the same as having the University of Michigan, it’s not the same as having the University of Virginia, it’s not the same as having Penn State,” Williams-Kief said. “D.C. TAG was created to bridge that difference, but with the increasing costs it simply doesn’t, so I would think the D.C. Promise would be seen by folks on the Hill as us taking responsibility.”
While Holmes Norton’s office could not be reach for comment, the congressman has maintained that she will fight any attempts to reduce funding for the D.C. TAG program despite the perceived doubts of congressional appropriators.
“I will fight to save D.C. TAG if it is threatened with the loss of all or any part of its funding.  If D.C. residents lose D.C. TAG funding for now or in the future, I know that they will hold the Council accountable to replace whatever funds are lost,” Holmes Norton said in a statement.
Williams-Kief also noted that although it will no doubt face intense opposition from Republicans in Congress, President Obama’s budget includes a significant increase in funding for the D.C. TAG program.
“The President included not a reduction for D.C. TAG in his recently released budget, but in fact a $10 million enhancement to fund it to $40 million a year,” Williams-Kief said.
The bill promises to be a hot topic of conversation as Catania continues his campaign against Democratic nominee for D.C. mayor, Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), who has emphasized a revamping of the city’s middle schools as the key tenant of her education policy.

The Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, the official publication of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, is launching a new website at the end of this month, with hopes of extending its brand in the academic community.
“The goal is to facilitate academic community because we have so many different authors and so many different pieces coming out,” Co-Online GJIA Editor-in-Chief Catie Burleson (SFS ’15) said. “We wanted to have the functionality of really creating a web community.”
New features include specific webpages for authors and easier maneuverability through articles. From Jan. 1 to Nov. 13, 2013 the website received 91,969 visits and 157,057 page views.
“I think it will definitely enhance our online edition,” Co-Online GJIA Editor-in-Chief Daye Shim Lee said (SFS ’14). “Georgetown Journal online started out as a small blog with staff writers contributing to it but now it has become a more legitimate online publication, featuring really prominent experts in the field of IR.”
With four years of experience working at the journal, Lee became GJIA’s online Editor-in-Chief this past year. According to Lee, who came from the print journal, a large learning curve was involved with online.
“I learned a lot about how fast-paced the online publications are and what we need to do to survive in that area of publication,” Lee said.
The print version of GJIA is published biannually, while the online version includes anywhere from two to five new articles every week, with funds for the journal coming directly from the SFS Dean’s Office.
“We are looking to build more bridges between print and online and we definitely use online to feature the print content,” Burleson said. “With online, we have different columns that focus on different themes that are always turning over.”
While scholars and experts in a particular field mainly write the articles that are published in the journal, students play a main role in editing and reviewing.
“The journal is actually really interesting because it’s probably the only organization on campus that I know of that actually has a hybrid staff that is comprised of undergrads, graduate students and actually Ph.D. candidates as well,” GJIA Executive Director William Handel (SFS’ 14) said. “When you work on the staff, you really get exposed to people that are at all different points in their career track at all different levels of experience.”
Due to GJIA’s spread of international topics, it is written for a readership that largely includes readers outside of the Georgetown community.
“The journal’s readership is mostly an amalgamation of government, business leaders, policymakers, think-tankers and major institutions around the world,” Handel said. “We would love for more of our readership to come from students, especially Georgetown students, but it’s notoriously difficult for us to retain their attention for a long period of time and that’s something we always struggled with.”
The readership for the journal is mainly in the Washington, D.C. proper area and the international community, among which the United Kingdom, India, Canada and Australia rank most prominently.
“We are looking for scholars, for experts with a very good understanding of what goes into their industry and their field,” GJIA Undergraduate Editor-in-Chief Medha Raj (SFS ’14) said. “We know who our readership is and we try to cater to that readership.”
Student readership at Georgetown has been a continual issue for the journal. Although GJIA is internationally known, students seem to turn to other publications on campus.
“Georgetown students are very busy and everyone has work they need to do for class,” Handel said. “There are so many publications out there that, if a Georgetown student only has a limited number of hours in a day to read stuff, they probably won’t turn to us first.”
Nevertheless, GJIAhas also made great strides in recent years. With many of the Georgetown students at the journal having worked there for multiple years, they have seen tremendous growth.
“I think it definitely grew a lot in terms of substance, but I think what we do need to continue to work on increasing our presence in the Georgetown community,” Lee said.  “We are very well-known and respected in D.C. and elsewhere and we have global readership, but here at Georgetown, I don’t think as many people know what we do.”
One way that the journal tries to reach out to readers in the Georgetown and greater D.C. area is by holding events.
Choosing themes for the different issues is another important aspect the journal must consider when constructing their print issue.
“We look at what is most current and get a variety of perspectives,” Raj said. “Myself and Warren Ryan (GRD ’14), the graduate editor-in-chief, go through topics and decide what we think is most fitting, not just in terms of timing, but also in terms of what is more cutting edge and what other journals aren’t necessarily writing about.”
As a student organization, the journal is highly dependent on its undergraduate and graduate staff to continue to build the publication and help it grow in the future.
“It’s so dependent on the talent here and the level of commitment that they can put into it and the ownership they take,” Burleson said. “We have seen a lot of ownership being taken and the team really being built and we hope that continues in the future and expands to be broader than just our staff.”

On Monday, the Maryland Senate voted overwhelmingly to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana, following in the footsteps of 24 other states, including the District of Columbia.
The decision comes in the wake of the D.C. Council’s March 4 10-1 vote overwhelmingly in favor of the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana for individuals over the age of 21. The bill, which is expected to be signed by Mayor Vincent Gray in coming weeks, would decriminalize possession and private use of marijuana less than one ounce.
In a 34-8 ruling, the Maryland Senate ruled that individuals caught with less than 10 grams of marijuana would face only civil, not criminal, sanctions. The Senate measure was sponsored by Sen. Robert A.  Zirkin, a Democrat from Baltimore County and received the support of Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley.
“As a young prosecutor, I once thought that decriminalizing the possession of marijuana might undermine the public will necessary to combat drug violence and improve public safety,” O’Malley said in a statement released Monday. “I now think that decriminalizing possession of marijuana is an acknowledgement of the low priority that our courts, our prosecutors, our police and the vast majority of citizens already attach to this transgression of public order and public health.”
Under the new legislation, a first offense would merit a $100 fine and would not require a court appearance, with an escalating scale thereafter. For individuals between the ages of 18-20 caught with the drug, a first violation would require a court appearance and possible drug education course thereafter.
Robert Locke, a junior at Johns Hopkins University, agreed with the decision and its potential to turn resources toward more violent crimes.
“I agree with the legislation — law enforcement will be able to better focus their attention on more pressing issues, especially in Baltimore where crime rates are high,” Locke said.
However, Adam Grudnan, a sophomore at the University of Maryland, did not foresee decriminalization changing the drug culture or use on his university’s campus.
“Honestly, I don’t think decriminalization will do anything at all,” Grudnan told The Hoya. “I think a lot less people will get in trouble [for possession] but it won’t really change the amount of people using it.”

Former Finance Minister, President of the Central Bank and International Monetary Fund Representative of Brazil Pedro Malan spoke about Brazil’s economic challenges in the Fisher Colloquium on Wednesday.
The Brazilian Club, the Stanton Distinguished Leaders Series at the McDonough School of Business, the Lecture Fund and the Latin American Board co-sponsored the event, entitled “The 20th Anniversary of the Real Stabilization Plan: Dialogue Between Past and Future in Brazil.”
Throughout his time as Finance Minister of Brazil, Milan helped craft the Plano Real, a comprehensive economic plan that worked to lower the country’s inflation rates, which reached an all-time high in the mid-1990s. Malan spoke about the plan, but also about his reinterpretation of the plan over the years. According to Malan, it is important to reevaluate the past to create new perspectives.
“The fact is, [with] every single generation, a part of it revisits, reinterprets, tries to understand what happened. … The past is constantly being revised, rewritten by success of generations, although it’s irrevocable as the future is uncertain,” Malan said.
Malan also discussed his experiences as a civil servant in Brazil. He maintained his work in the area of international finance continues to interest and excite him.
“You’ll never be bored being interested in international economics and international finance because there will always be crisis,” Malan said. “There will always be something challenging and stimulating that will make you feel that you are alive. The field itself has the gift of eternal youth.”
One major crisis that Malan faced as Brazilian finance minister was the country’s rising inflation rates. In 1993, the inflation rate was nearly 2,500 percent. Malan’s Plano Real helped bring the rate down to around six percent in 2013.
“It worked. It was a very high risk because 1994 was the year of elections and it had to be done otherwise we’d have a heightened inflation in the transition,” Malan said.“It was not an end in itself. It was absolutely fundamental.”
Malan also spoke about the changes in the economic world sphere in the 1990s, claiming that major events such as the launch of the Euro as currency, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall greatly affected economic trajectories.
“Each of these things that I mentioned joined forces in a major technological change which reduced the cost of commercial and financial transactions and provided information to hundreds of millions of people about what’s going on in the rest of the world,” Malan said.
Despite past economic turmoil, Malan continues to hope and have confidence in the future of Brazil.
“I have a big confidence in my own country. Let me tell you why. It is clear to me that the country changed, and not for the worse,” Malan said.“The country changed for the better as a whole. … Overall, I think that the country is better today than it was in the past and has enormous potential. It is an extraordinary country that is very complex to understand and to administer.”
Students in attendance enjoyed the lecture, due to Malan’s expertise.
“I think that Pedro Malan was an incredible insight into Brazil’s rising economy,” Alexa Pereda (SFS ’17) said. “His optimistic look towards the future of the country showed how much potential Brazil has to keep rising in the international markets. Brazil is definitely a country to look out for in the coming years.”
Muriel van de Bilt (SFS ’17), a student from Sao Paulo, Brazil and a member of the Brazilian Club, said that she gained new insight from Malan’s lecture.
“I really enjoyed his perspective over Brazil’s economy and the potential areas of growth with a bigger inclusion of the private sector,” van de Bilt said. “I enjoyed this perspective because it is in some sense a different approach from the current government.”

Professor Javier Corrales (SFS ’86) led a discussion on the recent crises and the state of democracy in Venezuela entitled, “Is the New Venezuela All That New? Politics in the Age of Barricades” on April 9.
The event, hosted by the Center for Democracy and Civil Society and the Center for Latin American Studies, and sponsored by the government department and the Masters of Arts in Government and Democracy program, involved Corrales sharing his expertise on the volatile South American nation. Corrales is a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts, and is the co-author of multiple books on Venezuelan-U.S. relations and democracy in Latin America.
The discussion began with a breakdown of the economic conditions that led to the crisis, including the oil boom and the resource curse argument. Corrales laid out the conditions in Venezuela during the Hugo Chavez presidency, especially the improvement in economic conditions for the poor that accompanied his rule, which lasted from 1999 until his death in 2013.
“What is the impact of relying too much on one commodity?” Corrales said. “We used to think it was good, but now it is considered a curse that can ruin the economy, as well as politics for a nation.”
Additionally, Corrales expounded upon the economic situation following the Chavez’s death.
“Most [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] members saved and had very good surpluses, but Venezuela did not,” Corrales said. “There has also been a strange combination of scarcity and inflation.”
Despite these fiscal difficulties, Corrales noted that Chavez was able to control these factors relatively effectively, maintaining his political power with minimal disruption.
“It’s not automatic that a resource boom is negative for a democracy,” Corrales said. Chavez had managed to create a “hybrid regime,” in which he maintained strong political and economic control despite a disregard for checks and balances, and still managed to win elections with a large margin. Spending increased and sectors modernized, and clientelism decreased along with militarism.
The current regime of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela blames the private business sector for the nation’s economic plight.
“At the end of 2013, the government blamed the business side,” Corrales said. “This narrative worked very well for Maduro, and it helped him electorally. It’s a strong populist narrative, and appeals to a lot of the population.”
A question and answer session followed Corrales’ presentation. Topics discussed included the status of the military, the future of Venezuelan cooperation with Cuba, Venezuelan relations with Brazil, and the future of the ALBA coalition, a socialist intergovernmental organization in Latin America.
“Our interest as a program is training people in terms of democracy and government, as well as human rights issues,” Co-Director of the Georgetown Masters of the Arts Program in Democracy and Governance Eusebio Mujal-León said. “Given the topicality of what is going on in Venezuela, we thought it would be a good time to bring in Javier. He is a Georgetown grad who I knew, and he was more than happy to come and host a talk.”
Attendees found the event to be educational and inspirational.
“I’ve actually been a little confused just about what’s going on, so it’s really great to see just exactly what the situation is,” Michael Scott, librarian for Latin American and Iberian studies at Lauinger Library, said.
“I think Venezuela is one of those forgotten stories in the news,” Kim Cosart, a graduate student at New York University, said. “Everyone associates it with Hugo Chavez, but he’s been dead for a year now and things are definitely changing. U.S. foreign policy needs to focus more on Latin America.”

Take Back the Night, an advocacy group on campus that fights against gendered violence, including domestic violence and sexual assault, is holding a week full of events dedicated to these issues, from April 7 to 11, as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
The week focuses on events and conversations about gender equality, sexual assault and ways in which students can be actively involved in conversations about these issues.
The week kicked off Monday with the Sexual Assault Peer Educators Pilot Program, an open dialogue capped at 20 students.
“The focus of the event was on issues of consent, rape culture and being better allies to survivors,” TBTN Board member and SAPE member Sarah Rabon (COL ’16) wrote in an email. “This was the first event of its kind at Georgetown. Historically, SAPE trainings have been targeted to specific groups and not open to all students as this one was. It was great to see that students are interested in attending these events.”
Take Back the Night also hosted a movie watch of “My Masculinity Helps,” a documentary about how gender issues relate to sexual assault.
The organization also organized a candle-light vigil in the past to honor survivors’ experiences. In addition, “It Happens Here” honors the stories of sexual assault of Georgetown survivors by listening to anonymous stories.
“It was an extremely powerful event. From the moment stories began being read, I think all of the attendees were speechless. I personally was struck by a particular trend I noted in the stories — a startling number of survivors would preface their stories with the disclaimer that they were not raped or sexually assaulted, but then would proceed to go into a story of how they were, in fact, assaulted,” Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) said. “This demonstrated to me that there seems to be a very prevalent culture of survivor shame on campus. Together, we need to make survivors feel empowered, rather than feel denial and embarrassment.”
The Georgetown Student Association and several students in the Georgetown community supported the event.
“This event shows GU students that even if you haven’t been personally affected, sexual assault does happen on this campus and we all have a role in helping to prevent it,” GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said in a press release.
In addition to dialogues and reflection, the week included a pizza party Thursday evening. The event celebrated allies in the fight against gendered violence and emphasized the importance of self-care.
The final event of Take Back the Night Week is Denim Day, a day celebrated worldwide in April.
Denim Day originated from a decision made in an Italian Supreme Court in which the judges believed the assault was consensual since the survivor wore tight jeans when she was assaulted and therefore must have aided her perpetrator in taking them off. Denim Day stands in solidarity with the survivor and shows that there is no excuse for sexual assault.
On Friday, Take Back the Night and Sexual Assault Peer Educators will hand out stickers that say “Ask Me, Why Denim?” and run a photo campaign.
Take Back the Night President Haley Maness (NHS ’15) was very pleased with the support for the week this year and hopes the conversations continue beyond Friday.
“I think that sexual assault is conversation that makes people really uncomfortable,” Maness said. “Something like Take Back the Night and SAPE are so important because it reframes these conversations. … You as a person can actively change [the culture] and I think that’s really powerful.”

Often removed from the day-to-day functions of life at Georgetown, advisory boards across divisions serve an important function in informing the academic life within their respective schools.
Georgetown’s College, School of Nursing and Health Studies, School of Foreign Service and McDonough School of Business boards physically convene twice a year to discuss ongoing projects, offer advice and keep in touch with on-campus activities and students. Specific topics of discussion include strategic thinking about school programs and priorities, the trajectory of the school, new course offerings, program development, student admissions, challenges faced by graduates and alumni engagement.
Although advisory boards are mostly comprised of alumni, parents and some prominent business individuals, each dean places a different emphasis on the makeup of his board.
“I’d say there’s a distinction between the board of past years and the board of current years. I would say that we try to have a more hands-on approach by our board members now,” Senior Director of Development for the College Erin DeLoach said. “I think in years past it was sort of a group of people that would come together to be spoken to about the College, now we really look to the board for expertise in various areas.”
In recent years, the MSB has diversified its board by recruiting more women, minorities and international business leaders.
“Diversity on the board is important to me because of the various perspectives that individuals with different experiences offer,” MSB Dean David Thomas wrote in an email.
Although general topics overlap, each of Georgetown’s advisory boards focuses on different areas or engagement strategies. For instance, both the College and MSB advisory boards established committees in which members can concentrate on certain topics.
“It’s really about engagement, they really want to be involved, they really don’t want us to just come here and talk to them. With these committees, we’re really hoping to take them to a deeper level of involvement with the school,” MSB Associate Dean Chris Kormis said.
Kormis, who heads the committee on branding and marketing, has found these forums to be especially helpful to the trajectory of the MSB.
“I like having them because, for example, when I was struggling with which way to go on a certain situation, I knew there were certain people who came to my information session about my committee, that they were interested in it, so I tapped into them,” Kormis said.
The College Advisory Board is similarly divided into four committees: development, ambassadorship, science and strategic planning.
The development committee is currently focused on the Capital Campaign, while the ambassadorship committee is working with public relations; the strategic planning committee is undertaking various initiatives, including an effort to expand gallery space on campus.
On the other hand, the SFS Advisory Board is currently focusing on fundraising as its chief goal. “Each member of the board is asked to make a contribution each year. It is expected when you’re invited onto the board that you do so, that is obviously we have a number of people who are actively engaged in helping us fundraise for the board,” SFS Director of Outreach Gail Griffith said.
The university’s various advisory boards also differ developmentally.
“Our Board of Advisors is a relatively new model and reflects the merger in 2010 of two bodies: the NHS Parents Council and the NHS Board of Visitors.  Since those two bodies often had a shared goal — namely the support of NHS and our faculty and students — the school thought it would be best to combine efforts,” NHS Dean Martin Iguchi said.
Despite differences among the advisory boards, each dean and school finds that the capacity of the board for pertinent advice and experience is critical to Georgetown’s growth.
“Our board members can be extremely valuable and critical. They really are just so important to the workings of the college, they sometimes just help us ask the right questions,” DeLoach said. “Sometimes they help make critical relationships that we might not have natural inroads into. They help on all kinds of different fronts.”
