The School of Foreign Service (SFS) awarded the annual J. Raymond “Jit” Trainor Award to William J. Burns, a former U.S. ambassador and the current director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in a Feb. 2 ceremony. 
The Trainor Award, named after a former SFS registrar, is handed out on a yearly basis to an exemplar of excellent conduct in diplomacy. Burns won the award in 2022, but he could not attend a ceremony in-person until now because of ongoing commitments with the federal response to the war in Ukraine. 
Burns served as a diplomat for 33 years before retiring in 2014. Throughout his career in diplomacy, Burns served as Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs during the September 11 terrorist attacks, Senior Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs at the National Security Council, U.S. Ambassador to Russia, U.S. Ambassador to Jordan and Deputy Secretary of State. 
After receiving the award, Burns offered remarks responding to global threats and engaged in a conversation with Ambassador Barbara K. Bodine, a professor in the practice of diplomacy and director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, a Georgetown University center dedicated to exploring diplomacy and global issues..
Burns said encouragement from his father and his father’s service in the military first sparked Burns’ decision to enter a career in diplomacy.
“Public service has shaped my whole life. When I was a graduate student many years ago, trying to figure out what to do with my life, I got a letter that proved to inspire me,” Burns said at the event. “It was from my father, a remarkable career army officer and a fine man who died recently. ‘Nothing will make you prouder,’ my dad wrote, ‘than to serve your country with honor.’”
Burns said this advice served as his inspiration over his decades-long career in foreign service in countries across the globe. 
Looking to the future, Iran should be a central focus for American policymakers approaching the often-murky relationship between the United States and the Middle East, according to Burns.
“The Middle East has emerged as a particularly complicated set of challenges for American policymakers as well,” Burns said, “Part of that is about the Iranian regime that I think is increasingly unsettled about what’s going on inside Iran.”
Burns said that instability in Iran can be attributed to protests in the country speaking out against the current regime.
“The remarkable courage of demonstrators over the last few months, especially young Iranian women, who in many respects are fed up with economic decay, corruption, political oppression and social restrictions, I think that unsettled view of what is going on internally is leading to more aggressive behavior externally toward the Iranian regime,” Burns said.
After the September 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman who died while in police detention, protests swept Iran with demands for increased freedom in the country. While similar protests occurred in Iran in 2009, 2017 and 2019, the ongoing movement is the most widespread in recent memory.
Burns said addressing ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, including conflict in the Israel-Palestine region, will be an engaging task to take on in his work as CIA director.
Recent developments in the region, including a shift to the right in Israeli elections and clashes between Israelis and Palestinians, have sparked fears that conflict could spiral. In a recent visit to Jerusalem, Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged both sides to remain calm and begin to work toward restabilization.
“We see it across the Middle East,” Burns said. “Part of the responsibility of my agency is to work as closely as we can with Palestinian security services and Israeli security services to prevent the kind of exposure to violence that we have seen in recent weeks as well. That is going to be a good challenge.”
Burns said his personal experiences in public service have prepared him for his current position leading a national intelligence agency.
“Today, I am still in the arena, very proud to have been a career diplomat and equally proud now to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, leading another incredibly dedicated group of women and men at a moment of profound transformation on the international landscape,” Burns said.

Glossier CEO Kyle Leahy (CAS ’05) spoke with students about her vision for Glossier, her experience working in the beauty industry and her path from Georgetown University to her current role. 
The McDonough School of Business hosted the Feb. 3 event in collaboration with the Georgetown Retail and Luxury Association (GRLA), a student-run organization committed to educating students about the retail industry and connecting them with professional opportunities in luxury and retail. The event focused on Leahy’s long-term expectations for Glossier, a community-driven beauty brand built around connecting emotionally with its consumers, and her experience as a student at Georgetown. 
Leahy said she spent her undergraduate years studying both humanities and STEM. 
“I was an English and mathematics major, though that was probably a sign that I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life,” Leahy told The Hoya. “But it was also the start of a thread that’s been throughout my career, which is balancing the arts and sciences.”
As an undergraduate student, Leahy had an interest in consulting, but began feeling an urge to balance both her artistic and analytical sides by working in a more creative industry. This desire brought her to Harvard Business School, and later, Nike.
“Nike really opened my eyes to the power of consumer brands,” Leahy said. “Seeing a transcendent brand that has dominated its industry on such an emotional and resonant level yet continues to develop new products and marketing strategies was just eye-opening to me.”
This focus on brand power led her to join Glossier as chief commercial officer before moving up to CEO. 
“I genuinely believe that in 2030, Glossier will be the next household name of beauty, and when we look forward decades, Glossier will have served a transformational role in the beauty industry,” Leahy said. “We are built on the belief that someone’s story is the most powerful way to create human connection. We tell these stories to give a voice to people who use our products.”
Leahy said the current beauty industry is built to make people believe they must look a certain way. Glossier’s goal is instead to create an environment where everyone is comfortable with how they look, according to Leahy.
“Beauty, ultimately, is a feeling, and Glossier taps into that in such a resonant, emotional way,” Leahy said. “You can be part of a community, be part of something bigger than yourself, in the way that you’re experiencing with our brand. What excites us the most is that as a brand, we are on a mission to change how the world sees beauty.”
Glossier’s motto, “Skin First. Makeup Second,” represents the company’s fundamental ethos to make everyone feel like the best version of themselves, according to Leahy.
Another thing that sets Glossier apart is the curation of its retail stories to their respective locations, something Leahy said is important for bringing a company’s brand to life within a specific community.
“We’re continuing to lean into our retail experience because it’s the place where we can bring our brand and the community aspect to life,” Leahy said. “Each of our stores is designed with the lens of ‘how do we inspire the Glossier brand but localize it to where we are?’”
Leahy said that in the next five years, she believes Glossier will not only be a leader in the beauty industry but also a major player in changing the industry’s values.  
“When we look out into the future, I believe this will be the next household name of beauty that will really serve all aspects of different consumers around the world,” Leahy said. “I hope that we can be a leader in terms of changing the paradigm of how the beauty industry is perceived. I think instead of being a feeling about a superficial way you should look, it’s about how we make people feel.”

This is an inspiring article about Kyle Leahy’s journey to becoming CEO of Glossier. It’s amazing how she has been able to make Glossier stand out from other beauty brands with her focus on community and emotional connection. I’m curious to see where Glossier will be in the next five years – what do you think it will look like?

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate voted to impeach and remove Senator Olivia Valante (CAS ’24) from the senate at its Feb. 5 meeting for accumulating excessive unexcused absences.
GUSA limits members to two unexcused absences per senate session, and further unexcused absences are grounds for removal. Valante missed all four meetings of GUSA’s November session without excuse, according to the impeachment resolution.
Nineteen senators voted in favor of her removal from office, with four opposed and two abstaining. This met the two-thirds majority threshold for impeachment. 
GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair John DiPierri (SFS ’25), GUSA Senate Speaker Manahal Fazal (SFS ’24) and GUSA Policy and Advocacy Committee Chair Joshua Bernard-Pearl (SFS ’25) introduced the articles of impeachment against Valante. Senate Vice Speaker Alicia Gopal (CAS ’25) initially sponsored the resolution but asked during the meeting for her name to be removed as sponsor.
“Senator Valante has accumulated four unexcused absences, missing meetings on Nov. 13, Dec. 4, Jan. 22 and Feb. 5, which has been every single meeting of the 18th senate November session thus far,” DiPierri said at the meeting. 
Valante did not respond to requests for comment.
Valante did not submit any requests for an excused absence to the senate, according to the articles of impeachment.
“Senate leadership has, on multiple occasions, publicized the existence of an excused-absence request form as well as clarified that advanced notice must be given for any excused-absence to be granted,” the articles of impeachment read. 
GUSA President Camber Vincent (SFS ’24), the previous speaker of the senate, said Valante had also missed several senate meetings during the body’s prior session. Vincent said that he had reached out to Valante but received no response.
The impeachment of Valante is the first of its kind since August 2019, when the senate impeached but did not remove Senator Peter Lee Hamilton (CAS ’20), also for accumulating unexcused absences.
DiPierri said removing a senator from office is a last resort that the GUSA Senate has rarely had to enforce.
“It is very rare that the GUSA Senate takes articles of impeachment up,” DiPierri said at Sunday’s senate meeting. “This is a rather unprecedented incident for the vast majority of senators who were not here through an impeachment process.” 
Bernard-Pearl said Valante’s unexcused absences could not be overlooked, as senator attendance at meetings is integral to the functioning of GUSA.
“If we are not being serious with attendance, then the order of this institution falls down,” Bernard-Pearl said at the meeting.
A majority of members of the senate’s Ethics and Oversight committee, which Senator Bora Balçay (SFS ’23) currently chairs, must first approve impeachment resolutions before the full senate can vote on them, according to GUSA bylaws. 
DiPierri moved to break the rules and introduce the resolution without prior Ethics and Oversight approval.
Balçay, Bernard-Pearl and Gopal initially favored tabling the resolution until after the Ethics and Oversight committee had the chance to vote on the resolution, although Balçay said that the committee would likely give its approval.
“As senators, we like to take breaking the rules fairly seriously,“ Balçay said at the meeting. “I would rather give the option of discussion by the committee first, then move by the senate.”
DiPierri said that waiting for the Ethics and Oversight committee to meet would waste time, encouraging members to confirm the articles of impeachment directly. 
“The idea of waiting two or three weeks to get six people to meet together, who meet very infrequently anyway, together to decide this, which could essentially be a 30-second conversation, is not a good use of our time,” DiPierri said. “Over those three weeks, we will have a senate seat that is essentially vacant. I hesitate to tabling this, because you are essentially preventing student voices.”
The senate ultimately approved the motion to impeach in a 19-4 vote, with Gopal and Senator Saatvik Sunkavalli (SFS ’25) abstaining and Senators Max Massick (CAS ’24), Chijioke Achebe (SFS ’25), George Currie (CAS ’26) and Rob Arzano (CAS ’24) voting against Valante’s impeachment. Valante’s seat as a Class of 2024 senator will be filled through appointment before the next senate meeting Feb. 19.
DiPierri emphasized the importance of GUSA senators participating in student government.
“We are just trying to expedite the process of having someone here who wants to be here, and actively engaged in not only our club, but the institution and the Georgetown community,” DiPierri said.

The Georgetown Americas Institute (GAI) hosted a panel Jan. 30 to discuss the regional forecast for Latin America and the Caribbean in the upcoming year.
The panel, titled “Latin America and the Caribbean in 2023: What to Expect?” featured Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics; Michael Shifter, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University; Shantall Tegho, a managing director at Goldman Sachs; and Alejandro Werner, GAI’s founding director. The event focused on political extremism, political instability and economic market outlooks in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The panel came amid vast protests in the Latin American region in recent months, with large-scale demonstrations against the lack of social mobility in Colombia and Chile, the elimination of fuel subsidies in Ecuador and election fraud in Bolivia. 
The center of discussion was Latin America’s largest country, Brazil, which experienced a highly divisive election in which the winning candidate, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, won by 1.8 percent of the vote over far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro. Fervent supporters of Bolsonaro protested the election results, which many believed to be fraudulent, by storming key government buildings in the capital of Brasilia.
De Bolle said that the new government of Brazil, under Lula’s leadership, has a long road ahead of them to mitigate political division.
“There’s a lot of rebuilding and a lot of reconstruction to be done,” de Bolle said at the event. “Surely, some of it will be done. But it’s four years — it’s four years to rebuild an entire country, to give people the competence that they once had. That social mobility will be back, that inequality is going to be reduced, that yes, politicians are going to respond to the needs of the people: these are the basis for Lula’s election.”
These issues are confounded by Latin American free trade agreements, which have not seen monumental success, according to Werner. 
“We have not seen any of the free trade agreements signed with the U.S. be a game-changer in Latin America,” Werner said at the event. “NAFTA in ’94, the Colombian free trade agreement with the U.S., the Chilean free trade agreement, they were very good. They significantly affected in a positive way some regions of these countries, but these are not European Union integration processes.”
“Obviously, Latin America stands out for a region that has constantly disappointed markets,” Tegho said at the event. “We did come out of the COVID prices with growth that was never able to go back to the levels we saw pre-2020. We had very violent political forces in the last few years, and that is not going to change in the future.”
Shifter said corruption, crime and inequality are the three issues key to analyzing and predicting the state of Latin American affairs in 2023.
“When do you expect those to be reduced in 2023?” Shifter said at the event. “It is not easy to come up with a lot of encouraging responses. And those are three critical issues that certainly contribute to political volatility.”
Tegho said that conditions in Latin America are largely dependent on the state of the American and Chinese economies because of the region’s dependence on external markets. 
“For Latin America, the two most important driving forces of external conditions are U.S. growth and Chinese growth,” Tegho said. “Latin America absorbs external conditions, they never dictate external conditions.”
Shifter said he has cautious hope for the political state of the region because people are largely still committed to voting, despite the region’s general instability. 
“Democracy is under stress,” Shifter said. “It is under stress, but it survives.”

Washington, D.C., announced Feb. 2 its third major investment in high-impact tutoring (HIT), a form of intensive individual or small-group tutoring.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), the state education agency for the District, will support an additional 3,600 students with their investment and hopes to close opportunity gaps in learning created during COVID-19 online classes. D.C. will divide the funds between nine tutoring organizations across the city, according to a D.C. government press release. 
Bowser said disruptions in learning due to the pandemic made it necessary to invest in educational support like HIT.
“We know that many students are still recovering from the time spent out of the classroom during the COVID-19 pandemic and need extra support to rebuild confidence in learning,” Bowser said in the Feb. 2 press release. “There are also students who were already struggling academically before the pandemic, and that’s why we are focused on strengthening and scaling up our high-impact tutoring program.”
The English Language Arts (ELA) proficiency rate for D.C. students in third to eighth grade dropped from 38 to 30 percent between 2019 and 2022. Similarly, math proficiency dropped from 32 to 22 percent.
The increased funds for HIT will focus on aiding at-risk groups because of the disproportionate impacts the pandemic had on learning disruption, according to the press release.
“The disruptions in learning that occurred during the pandemic disproportionately impacted students of color, students from lower-income families and students who were already struggling academically,” the press release read. “The HIT programming prioritizes these students and ensures they have the supports needed to achieve academically.”
The ELA proficiency rates for Black and Hispanic students in D.C. dropped 7.7 and 7.0 percentage points, respectively, compared to the 5.3% drop for white students. For math, the proficiency rate dropped 13.4 percentage points for Hispanic students, 12.0 for Black students and 8.7 percentage points for white students.
Antonio Gutierrez, co-founder of Saga Education, a high-impact, in-school tutoring organization receiving funding from the District, said that HIT is an efficient and tested approach to combating learning challenges.
“High impact tutoring, when implemented with fidelity, is one of the most cost-effective approaches ever rigorously evaluated in U.S. Public Education,” Gutierrez wrote to The Hoya. “It is an area worthy of additional exploration and investment.” 
Of the nine organizations receiving funding in the form of Scaling HIT Grants, six will partner with schools, two will work in schools and within communities at non-school sites and one will provide HIT in non-school sites only. 
Organizations obtaining the grants include American University; Great Oaks Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to expanding access to career-technical programs and services for youth and adults; Horton’s Kids, an organization helping children and families in Ward 8 with academics, youth development, health and wellness and family engagement; and Lana Learn, a global education and training company.
Bowser has committed more than $39 million over three years to HIT programming and announced in the press release that her goal is to deliver HIT to at least 10,000 D.C. students, which is 2,000 more students than OSSE’s original goal in September 2022. 
HIT as an intervention strategy has proven to be successful in improving student learning, according to the release.
“HIT allows students to receive intensive tutoring, either one-to-one or in very small groups, on a sustained basis over a semester or longer,” the release read. “This type of tutoring has strong evidence supporting its effectiveness among all learning interventions.”
D.C. State Superintendent Christina Grant said that the experiences students have in HIT programs positively impact the trajectory of their entire educational career.
“The relationships that students build with tutors in the HIT programming shapes their learning experiences for life,” said Grant in the press release. “It’s important that all students in DC have the confidence to learn and grow academically, and we know that having more tutors in our schools will ensure that our most vulnerable students are better supported and prevent achievement gaps from growing.”

Former Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) made a record charitable donation of $4 million to Georgetown University from his campaign fund account, the largest congressional campaign donation ever made directly to a university, according to a comprehensive database.
The $4 million donation, which was made public in a Jan. 31 filing, quadrupled the next largest congressional campaign donation to a university, according to Andrew Mayersohn, a researcher at OpenSecrets, an independent nonprofit that tracks money in U.S. politics. Richard Shelby chose not to run for reelection in 2022 after serving in the U.S. Senate for 36 years, leaving him with $16 million of unspent campaign funds.
The senator’s team did not respond to a request for comment.
Annette Shelby, the senator’s wife, is professor emerita in the McDonough School of Business (MSB). In 1997, Annette Shelby became the first woman to be a tenured professor in the MSB; she taught at Georgetown for more than 20 years. 
Annette Shelby said her husband raised more money than was necessary to fund his senatorial campaigns and felt that giving back to Georgetown would make a continuing impact for university students.
“In the end, he had some money left, and he felt that Georgetown had been such a wonderful place for me and had given me many opportunities,” Annette Shelby told The Hoya. “He wanted to show that, and he also wanted to leave some kind of legacy for me as well.”
Annette Shelby also said the recent donation to Georgetown comes after Richard Shelby’s campaign donated much of its excess funds to other universities and fellow candidates, though all of these donations together did not total even $1 million.
A university spokesperson said the donation will fulfill important needs in the MSB.
“Georgetown works carefully with our generous donors to ensure alignment of goals in the purpose of gifts,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “We deeply appreciate the trailblazing contributions Prof. Shelby has made to the Georgetown University community over the years and are grateful for this gift in support of critical priorities at the McDonough School of Business.”
Mayersohn said the OpenSecrets database reflects expenditures from the past several election cycles, using sections of publicly available data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Only a few political campaigns in the past decade have donated near or over $4 million to any charitable organization. Such donations include a $6 million donation from former Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) presidential campaign to the McCain Institute, a part of Arizona State University; a $4.2 million donation from former Rep. Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) to the Marty Meehan Educational Foundation; and $3.5 million from the campaign of former Rep. Sara Gideon (D-Maine) to Maine Equal Justice, a nonprofit organization.
Richard Shelby’s campaign committee recorded one donation of $4 million disbursed to Georgetown University on Nov. 3, 2022, according to the FEC website. Shelby’s campaign account now has about $5.5 million in remaining funds.
Richard Shelby also leads the political action committee (PAC) Defend America, which supports Republican candidates. According to The Washington Post, in 2014 Shelby used substantial campaign and PAC funds for extravagant travel and food expenses. These expenses included $4,400 at the Senate Gift Shop and $1,000 at Chick-fil-A, according to The Wall Street Journal.
For the 2021-2022 period, records show reimbursements of over $28,000 in total to Richard Shelby and Annette Shelby for travel and food expenses.
Richard Shelby left office with the most leftover funds out of any retiring member of the 117th Congress, with $9.7 million in his campaign account and $6.5 million in Defend America, according to Roll Call.
FEC records show that Defend America contributed a total of $5.5 million to the Alabama Christian Conservatives, a super PAC that supported his successor, Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.). Donating leftover leadership PAC funds directly to a super PAC is relatively unusual, according to Mayersohn.
Mayersohn said that once a member of U.S. Congress retires, the main options for spending leftover campaign funds include giving to a charitable organization, donating to a party committee, refunding campaign donors or supporting another candidate.
“I would guess the normal thing to do is to donate the money that was raised to begin with to support fellow members of their party,” Mayersohn told The Hoya.
Myles Martin, FEC public affairs specialist, said federal campaign committees are allowed to donate to educational institutions, as they are a type of organization that falls under the charitable donation category outlined in Section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
“Donations of campaign funds to a charitable organization do not constitute the personal use of campaign funds unless the candidate (former or current) receives compensation from the donee organization before the organization has expended, for purposes unrelated to the candidate’s personal benefit, the entire amount donated by the campaign,” Martin wrote to The Hoya.
Richard Shelby’s campaign account has never received money from Georgetown University, according to the FEC website.
Mayersohn said that because leadership PACs face fewer restrictions on spending, FEC records are not fully reflective of how candidates handle their funds. 
“Be aware of what the data can and can’t tell you,” Mayersohn said. “We know a lot about who donates to congressional campaigns because that data is all required to be made public and with very stringent requirements. We know a lot less about who donates to super PACs and outside spending groups because those groups have many more avenues of hiding the money.”

CW: This article references/discusses violence related to natural disasters. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources. 
Georgetown University’s Turkish students organized a food and supply drive to send resources to people in Turkey following the deadly earthquake that killed around 21,000 individuals in Syria and Turkey as of a Feb. 9 statistic. 
Bora Balçay (SFS ’23) worked with other Turkish students to organize the supply drive, collecting items like clothes and food, after learning of the 7.8-magnitude earthquake. The earthquake, epicenter near Gaziantep in south-central Turkey, struck in the early morning of Feb. 6 local time with a 7.5-magnitude aftershock occurring nine hours later about 60 miles away.
The earthquake caused widespread building collapses in both Turkey and Syria, killing over 15,000 people in the two countries as of Wednesday. The earthquake’s epicenter lies in an area where millions of displaced people have settled, including at least 1.7 million of the 3.5 million Syrian war refugees that Turkey hosts.
Student efforts to organize the Feb. 6 drive started after the Turkish Embassy announced it would be collecting donations and flying them to Turkey, according to Balçay.
“I am in touch with a contact at the embassy, who was helping us when he gave me the list of necessary items, shared the embassy donation account and its numbers that I have been sharing,” Balçay told The Hoya. “When the boxes are filled, hopefully tomorrow, I am gonna take the first party of goods to the embassy, and they are going to help.”
Students can drop off new winter clothes, outdoor equipment, unopened canned food, baby formula, diapers and hygiene products in the drive’s collection box in the Intercultural Center Galleria until Feb. 10.
The areas impacted by the earthquake are currently experiencing harsh winter weather, further exacerbating the disaster’s scope and complicating rescue efforts.
Parts of the affected area in Syria are controlled by the Syrian government and their opposition, making providing aid to affected areas of Syria more difficult. The United States and members of the European Union currently sanction the Syrian government, while opposition-held areas have little formal sovereignty through which countries or humanitarian organizations can provide aid.
Balçay said it is crucial to remember that the earthquake has also caused damage and death in an already-vulnerable Syria even though the student supplies will be sent to Turkey.
“We are on the Turkish side, and there is also the Syrian side of the story, which nobody is really talking about, because, unfortunately, damage is very unclear so far,” Balcay said. “Disaster relief is incredibly hard to get there, information is really not coming down.”
Turkish student Cansu Özdemir (CAS ’26) said it was very difficult to read about the earthquake.  
“Fortunately, my family and friends are safe and were not directly affected,” Özdemir wrote to The Hoya. “However, this is a challenging time for all in Turkey, as the rebuilding process will be lengthy and difficult for everyone.”
Doğa Bozkurt (CAS’ 26), a Turkish student helping organize the drive and raise funds, said she felt shocked upon hearing about the earthquake.
“Having to live with the reality, there is so many people from your country who is struggling right now, and knowing that there is not much you can do right now to help other than donate and raise awareness, it is so upsetting,” Bozkurt told The Hoya.
Bozkurt said the unity she saw in Turkey following the earthquake was inspiring. 
“What inspired me was the sheer courage of Turkish people to come together at this time, no matter who they are, if they know the people who were affected or not,” Bozkurt said. “They are all sharing in the pain of the people.”
The university also encouraged students to aid Turkish and Syrian relief organizations in a Feb. 6 email to students.
“We are deeply saddened by the devastation and loss of life caused by the recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria,” the email reads. “We offer our prayers and thoughts to all those affected by the earthquakes and their aftermath, and we encourage our community to help respond to this disaster as ‘people for others’ in any way that we can.”
Bozkurt encouraged Georgetown students to help as much as they can through donations to the supply drive and to Turkish governmental rescue organizations.
“There are many ways that you can help,” Bozkurt said. “Even if you are helpless and your contribution is relatively small, it is still huge. During this time, it is important for everyone to come together and provide whatever are the necessities of the people who are left homeless or people who are still under the rubble.”

Content Warning: This article discusses police brutality. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Georgetown University students gathered at a candlelight vigil to grieve and remember the life of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man whom Memphis police officers brutally beat to death.
Dozens of Georgetown students, faculty and staff attended the Feb. 5 vigil in Red Square, organized by Kessley Janvier (CAS ’25), to celebrate Nichols’ life and mourn his death. A diverse audience of students, faculty and Campus Ministry staff held candles in silence as Janvier, Lukas Soloman (SFS ’26) and Rev. Ebony Grisom, the interim director of Protestant Christian Ministry at Georgetown, spoke.
On Jan. 20, the Memphis Police Department (MPD) fired five officers involved in Nichols’ killing, before releasing body camera and surveillance video of Nichols’ arrest Jan. 27. By Feb. 3, two further officers and three emergency medical technicians had also been fired. 
The footage prompted widespread protests across the United States, from New York to Los Angeles, as well as advocacy from members of U.S. Congress, all demanding police reform and accountability for Nichols’ death.
Campus Ministry supplied candles for the vigil, which attendees lit as Janvier described Nichols’ life. A 29-year-old family-oriented father to a 4-year-old son, who loved skateboarding and landscape photography, Nichols had his mother’s name tattooed on his arm. 
“I tell you that to say that he’s just an average person,” Janvier said at the vigil. “He’s just an average guy trying to go home, trying to go to his mother’s house, and his life was taken.” 
“I just think of how they have to explain to that boy that Dad went to work one day and didn’t come home,” Janvier said at the vigil.
Attendees observed a moment of silence following Janvier’s speech before Grisom said a prayer for compassion and justice.
“When we see our sibling hurting, may we pause and extend love. When we see our sibling struggling, may we pause to extend help. When we see our sibling grieving, may we pause to extend compassion,” Grisom said at the vigil.
After Grisom’s prayer, Soloman read Jericho Brown’s “The Tradition,” a poem about brutality, injustice and systemic racism.
Janvier said she chose to hold a vigil, instead of bringing the Georgetown community in a different forum, such as a rally or protest, because it allowed for students to pay their respects to Nichols’ life beyond his death.
“I feel like a lot of times when people are killed by the police, they lose their personhood. They become a line on Twitter, or a photo, and very often you lose the entire backstory of their lives,” Janvier told The Hoya. “I felt like a vigil was a good way to discuss who he was and also come together as a community to express our sorrows at not only his death, but by the manner in which he died, without necessarily centering the way in which he died.”
Soloman, who helped Janvier organize the vigil, said the event intended to provide a space for community members to come together and support each other.
“Anger and frustration weren’t the primary reactions. It was more just pain and grief and exhaustion, and we wanted something that was more appropriate for those feelings,” Soloman told The Hoya. “And we wanted to cultivate a space where those emotions could be felt and shared and expressed and processed.”
Ollie Henry (CAS ‘24), who attended the vigil, said they find community essential to process the grief of racist violence.
“It takes me back into my body with a reminder that support exists, that violence to the Black community is more than just another headline to other folks at the University,” Henry wrote to The Hoya. “Tyre died alone. We deserve to grieve together.”
Janvier said she organized the vigil alone, rather than through campus clubs, in order to separate the affirming role of cultural affinity clubs, such as the Black Student Alliance (BSA), from the burden and grief of the vigil.
“Very often, when there is an event that happens within that affinity group — so, for example, a hate crime against Asian people, or a Black person gets shot by police, or somebody experiences any kind of racism — it falls on that affinity club to organize for that and to advocate for that, and I feel that is wrong,” Janvier said. 
“The role of the BSA is not to be protesting every week. The role of the BSA is to provide a safe space for Black students,” Janvier added. “I didn’t want the BSA to be putting on a vigil because they should not have to put on a vigil.”
Both Janvier and Soloman were surprised by the vigil’s immense turnout. 
“What we ended up seeing were people from many different identities and backgrounds, racially, religiously, showing up both to grieve and also to support,” Soloman said.
Janvier said it is important to continue to demonstrate kindness and compassion in the wake of Nichols’ death.
“We ought to extend more love to each other,” Janvier said at the vigil. “Tyre’s mom, she said that he had a beautiful and loving soul. And I think if there’s one thing we can take away from his life, and unfortunately his death, is to extend more love to each other on this campus and off this campus and every day.”

Citigroup Global Chief Economist Nathan Sheets delivered his largely pessimistic 2023 global economic forecast on Feb. 6 to Georgetown University students in the Intercultural Center (ICC).
The Georgetown Americas Institute, a research center focusing on key challenges facing Latin America, and the Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, a research center about good financial industry practices and policies, co-hosted the event. Sheets discussed domestic monetary and fiscal policy, U.S.-China trade relations and global market projections during his talk, suggesting overall pessimism for the global economy in 2023.
Sheets projects low economic confidence due to high inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes, saying governments have a lot of work to do to restore consumer confidence in banks.
“Central banks look at the high level of inflation as an existential challenge,” Sheets said at the event. “As they’ve seen the inflation surge, it’s kind of a four alarm fire within the central banking community. And they’re hiking vigorously to try to bring it down.”
Sheets said a key global economic development has been the shift in consumer spending away from goods and toward services, with the United States as a prime example of this transition.
“The strength of services has important implications for the growth outlook, for real GDP, for inflation and for labor markets,” Sheets said. “Of all of the 517,000 total job creations during the month of January, 128,000 was in leisure and hospitality alone, and educational and health services were another 105,000.”
Services markets produce more than two-thirds of the global gross domestic product (GDP). They have become increasingly dominant in the global economy and provide close to two-thirds of jobs in developing countries and four-fifths of jobs in developed countries.
Oversaturated services markets have created large inflationary pressures, which Sheets said the global economy needs to address moving forward.
“Taking some momentum out of the services sector can be a tougher kind of proposition, which kind of boils down to convincing all of us to stop spending so much on services,” Sheets said. “We think that getting inflation down to two percent ultimately is going to be a slog.”
Despite his overall pessimism for the global market, Sheets said it is helpful that different regions of the world operate on different economic timelines because market volatility will be better distributed.
“We see a lot of recession risk in the global economy this year. But an important point is that it doesn’t look like all of the major economies are going to go down together,” Sheets said. “There’s a story in the United States, there’s a story in the Euro area, there’s a story in China, there’s a story in the emerging markets and they’re all pretty different.”
With an increasingly powerful economy, Sheets said China will be a potential major player on the global stage for years to come. 
“China’s economy is growing, it’s becoming more powerful,” Sheets said. “A bigger part of the global economy, China itself is more influential.”
Latin America’s strong performance over the past few years is another reason for optimism about the future of the region, according to Sheets.
“Latin American economies were much more resilient than what we were expecting,” Sheets said. “And specifically for Brazil, we were expecting Brazil to have a recession in 2022. That never arrived.”
Sheets said recent data collection suggests governments outside of Latin America have also responded well to current economic challenges.
“Most of the information that we’ve received over the last six week period has been more favorable. And specifically, it’s been better than we thought in the Euro area,” Sheets. “It’s been better in China and the data in the United States have been surprisingly resilient.”
Sheets said he has measured optimism for the 2023 fiscal year in light of the flexibility that global financial institutions have demonstrated in a time of economic uncertainty.
“Significant tightening from the Federal Reserve has performed better than we would have expected,” Sheets said. “And I think that the key question, even if there are recessions, we don’t think they’re going to be extremely deep.”
Sheets tempered his hope about the global market due to difficulties other regions of the world face, including the Russia-Ukraine war continuing to complicate supply chains and trade logistics.
“I’m probably the most pessimistic about Central and Eastern Europe,” Sheet said. “That region right now, for obvious geopolitical reasons, is disrupted.” 
Sheets said other geopolitical tensions could also create more economic fragmentation in the long run, especially between the U.S. and China.
“I do see kind of a deeper divide and deeper schism emerging on the tech front between the United States and China. And potentially, if the United States brings in other allies, I think we may move to a world where technology operates in two spheres,” Sheets said. “I don’t know what that means for the global economy. It’s got to be negative.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate unanimously approved a resolution urging the university to improve lighting in and around Red Square at its Feb. 5 meeting.
First-year senators Meriam Ahmad (CAS ’26) and Dylan Davis (CAS ’26) sponsored the resolution to improve student safety by adding better lighting to Red Square. GUSA Senate Speaker Manahal Fazal (SFS ’24), GUSA Policy and Advocacy Committee Chair Joshua Bernard-Pearl (SFS ’25) and GUSA Senator Rhea Iyer (CAS ’26) co-sponsored the resolution.
Davis said that areas around Red Square, behind White-Gravenor Hall and between White-Gravenor and the Intercultural Center (ICC) are poorly lit. 
Currently, several lit bollards — short, vertical posts — around the square’s perimeter, a lit clock, and lanterns on the exterior of Copley Hall comprise the only lighting at night in Red Square, as can be seen in photographs that Ahmad and Davis captured in inspections on Jan. 29 and Feb. 4. 
Other existing lights in Red Square are dysfunctional, Davis said.
“There’s also existing lights that are scattered around Red Square,” Davis said at the meeting. “Upon inspection, one night a week ago, some of those aren’t turned on, some of them are broken, they haven’t been fixed, leading to a lot of dark areas.”
According to Davis, the steep ICC amphitheater steps pose a particular risk in the dark.
“Something that a lot of students have been talking about is the lack of lighting around certain areas. And one thing, one place, where they have a lack of lighting, is Red Square. There’s the amphitheater area, where at night, you can barely see the steps in front of you, so that poses a health hazard,” Davis said at the meeting.
Ahmad and Davis originally planned only to advocate for improved lighting in Red Square, but other senators, including Lucy Sonsalla (MSB, SFS ’23), pushed to amend the bill to also include the area behind White-Gravenor.
Around White-Gravenor, Davis said that existing lights are often turned off, such as lampposts and the overhead lights in the arch between the ICC and White-Gravenor.
“There’s actually overhead lights underneath that arch that are turned on, apparently, or turned off depending on the day. So those, A, need to be turned on. B, there’s also some existing lampposts. There’s two that are right around the perimeter that are off, or they’re broken or something, that aren’t on. There’s definitely room for improvement and repair,” Davis said at the meeting. 
The resolution states that this lack of lighting makes students feel at risk — particularly during the winter months, when the sun sets before 6 p.m. and classes are still in session.
“Many students on campus feel unsafe walking through the Red Square arch and the ICC amphitheater steps, the area behind White-Gravenor, and the area between White-Gravenor and Red Square after sunset,” the resolution reads. “Adding lights to Red Square would enhance student safety.”
Ahmad said the resolution does not ask much of the university.
“The only two requests that we have for the university is to add more lights to the areas that need lights and to repair the existing light fixtures that are currently not working,” Ahmad said.
A university spokesperson said that the Office of Facilities Management is assessing light levels in Red Square and will work to solve any issues emerging from the inspection.
“The safety and security of our students and campus is a top priority and we are always monitoring and taking steps to improve safety measures both on and around campus,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “We appreciate hearing feedback from students about our campus.”
Bernard-Pearl said it was imperative for senators to support the resolution.
“Students are bringing it to the attention of the university,” Bernard-Pearl said. “I think it’s a very good solution. It’s a great win-win for GUSA and the university.”

H*yas for Choice (HFC) launched a new sexual joy committee for Georgetown University students to learn more about sex and sexual empowerment, which held its first meeting Feb. 2.
The sexual joy committee’s first meeting introduced interested participants to the committee’s goals for the semester ahead, which include expanding knowledge about sexual experiences and generating more awareness around safe sex practices. HFC, an abortion-rights student group, hopes the committee will draw interest from a broad range of Georgetown students.
The committee houses three subdivisions — sexual empowerment, sex education and queer sex — that mirror the overarching targets of the new initiative. Committee members plan to host informational seminars and lead interactive workshops throughout the semester to create a more positive sexual environment for the Georgetown community.
Serena Barish (CAS ’25), HFC co-director of advocacy and organizing, steered the formation of the new sexual joy committee. Barish said that advancing reproductive justice requires creating safe spaces for conversations about sex, especially at religious institutions.
“We feel like information is really important, and especially surrounding sex, it’s not something that people generally have the easiest access to, especially people who have gone through kind of like the Catholic school pipeline up to Georgetown,” Barish told The Hoya.
Sophie Burk (SOH ’25) and Brigid O’Connor (CAS ’26) co-lead the sex education subcommittee, which focuses on building better foundational understandings of topics like birth control, closing the orgasm gap between men and women and destigmatizing sexual experiences for those with medical conditions. 
Burk said the sexual joy committee is an extension of HFC, though the committee places a greater emphasis on sharing information about the sexual experience itself.
“We’re here trying to create a space that focuses on how to create positive sexual experiences,” Burk told The Hoya. “It’s more about the pleasure aspect, the joy aspects of mindsets.”
Sydney Abele (CAS ’25), a co-leader of the queer sex subcommittee, said committee leadership prioritizes engaging participants from diverse backgrounds.
“With me being a representative from GUPride, as well, I think that it’s really important to have not only gender and sexual minorities be represented,” Abele told The Hoya. “It’s also really important to have people of color represented and people from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. So that’s definitely something that we’re really cognizant of, and working towards actively.” 
For their first campus-wide event, the sexual joy committee invited students to participate in a discussion about hookup culture. 
O’Connor said events like this are critical to the overall mission of the committee but also to attract potential new participants.
“We’re still very much in our kind of incubating phase where we’re still collecting applicants, and trying to build the committee up a bit more,” O’Connor told The Hoya. “As more people kind of gauge interest, and as we start having this type of event, and increase our presence on campus, we already have an influx of interest from more people.”
Marieteresa Porcher Allen (MSB ’24), an attendee at the hookup culture event, said the meeting was very informative.
“I learned a lot. I feel like I knew some stuff already, but I feel like I’ve learned a lot, like half of the population has herpes, that was kind of crazy,” Allen told The Hoya. “I’m looking forward to more events like this.”
Allen said she appreciated how attendees actively contributed new perspectives to the conversations at the event.
“I thought it was really good. I learned a lot from the open discussion, especially from the guys that were here making good comments, which was interesting and made me happy,” Allen said.
Burk said those who have engaged with the sexual joy committee so far have displayed large amounts of enthusiasm for the committee and its purpose.
“It’s kind of a self-selecting group who comes, but honestly, the thing that surprised me the most was just how the people who came or have been coming to what we’ve been doing have actually been very eager to participate and have their voice heard,” Burk said.
“The three goals that I would use are probably education, empowerment and destigmatization,” Abele said. “Those are three really big goals that sum up what we’re trying to do here.”

Former Mexican Undersecretary for Foreign Trade Luz María de la Mora discussed the future of Latin American trade with Georgetown University students on Feb. 6.
The Latin American Policy Association (LAPA), a student group dedicated to the discussion of Latin American policies and politics, and the Georgetown University Graduate Association of Mexican Students (GUGAMS), a student group focused on professional development and Mexican cultural appreciation, organized the event. 
De la Mora focused the discussion on restructuring supply chains, which she sees as a top economic priority for Latin American countries, particularly Mexico, in combination with maintaining macroeconomic stability and a strong fiscal policy.
De la Mora said it is important for Latin America to scale up its supply chains in order for the region to play a bigger role in political development.
“Geopolitics are taking a very important place in global issues, and Latin America has a role to play,” de la Mora said at the event. “We are not very clear about where we are located and what are the benefits of integrating or participating in the global economy, so we are suffering from the effects of the global decisions.”
Latin American countries have experienced a slowdown of trade integration efforts because of geopolitical circumstances like the pandemic, according to de la Mora.
“We have talked about the US-China trade relations, we have  talked about the Russia-Ukraine invasion, we have talked about things that are happening in the European Union, how this is affecting global supply chains,” de la Mora said. “We know that there are very important challenges now. For example, we have suffered tremendously from inflation as a result of the Russia-Ukraine invasion, but also because of the pandemic.”
De la Mora said the existing state of affairs in Latin America is dismal because Latin America has not been a traditional hotspot for international trade.
“Latin America is a minor player in international trade,” de la Mora said. 
Latin America makes up about three percent of exports and three percent of imports of global trade, according to de la Mora. Trade in Latin American countries like Brazil and Argentina  amounts to less than 30% of their GDP. 
De la Mora said that Latin American countries could take advantage of nearshoring, which are outsourcing efforts by geographically proximate countries and free trade agreements to stimulate trade in the region.
“The opportunity here is, how can we find those specific inputs or products or sectors?” de la Mora said. “In labor intensive industries, for example, textile and fashion, that is  an area in which we see a lot of movement.”
Countries like Mexico already have multiple trade agreements in place, but could stand to gain from building new relationships with countries they have not previously interacted with, according to de la Mora.
“After the European Union, the UK and the U.S., Mexico does not have agreements with the Republic of Korea or China, as other countries do have,” de la Mora said. “So that tells you and gives you an idea of where we could integrate into those supply chains.”
De la Mora said Latin America has a high ceiling for growth, especially if political leaders make strategic decisions both in the short and long term.
“I think that Latin America needs to think about industrial policy,” de la Mora said. “And when we talk about industrial policy, I think that we need to choose sectors, we need to choose the champions because we cannot use all of our resources for everything.”
De la Mora said it is important for Latin American countries to direct much more investment into their economic futures so they can compete with the rest of the world.“We need to invest in physical infrastructure in workforce development, rule of law and long term vision,” de la Mora said. “Otherwise, I think we will only see opportunity when there is  plenty of room and there is plenty of work.”
