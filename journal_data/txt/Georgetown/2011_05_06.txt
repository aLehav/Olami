Three more Georgetown students recently received Fulbright awards, bringing the total number of recipients of the prestigious scholarship to 16, with the university still waiting to hear back about six more applications.
Seven of the awards will go to graduating seniors, while the remainder will go to graduate students or recent alumni.
Since Fulbright scholarships — which provide recipients the chance to teach and conduct research abroad — are awarded by individual countries, applicants are notified at different times.
Maryam Mohamed, associate director of the Office of Fellowships, Awards and Research, said that the office should hear back about all of the applicants by mid-June.
The scholars will be studying and teaching on every continent except Antarctica, in countries as diverse as France, Azerbaijan and Cameroon.
Georgetown has historically seen several students receive Fulbrights each year.
“We are hoping that this year continues to be on trend,” Mohamed wrote in an email when the first round of 13 awards was announced in April.
With the total now up to 16, the school has reached the number of awards received last year. Fourteen Georgetown students were awarded the scholarship the year before that and 18 in 2009.
Mohamed added that Georgetown students are especially competitive because many of them begin working with faculty researchers early in their careers, have experience teaching or have studied abroad.
Jacalyn Bedard (COL ’11), who received a Fulbright award to Spain, said she fell in love with the country after spending her junior year abroad there.
“When I left Spain, I felt that my time there wasn’t finished, and I needed to find a way to go back,” she wrote in an email.
Bedard said she will be using her Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship award to spend 16 hours a week as a teaching assistant in a secondary school in Madrid. She also plans to conduct research about the integration of immigrants into the Spanish school system.
“I think investigating the resources that are provided to students who are immigrants and observing how they are perceived in the classroom from a different cultural perspective will be a rich experience that I can draw upon in the future if I work in the U.S. education system,” she said.
Kevin Donovan (SFS ’11), who received a Fulbright award to South Africa, will spend a year in Cape Town doing research on the role of digital technology in the democratic practices of South Africa.
“My research aims to understand how the proliferation of these technologies changes or sustains the unique deliberative democracy of South Africa, hopefully also illuminating other countries, as well,” he wrote in an email.
The Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program awards about 1,100 grants annually, according to the organization’s website. The program was established in 1946 with legislation introduced by then-Sen. J. William Fulbright (D-Ark.).
This year’s recipients from Georgetown include Charlotte Guy (SFS ’09), Angela Carothers (GRD ’11), Berkley Braden (COL ’11), Nick Wertsch (COL ’09), Larisa Veloz (GRD ’11), Mary Holman (COL ’11), Tessa Wegener (GRD ’11), Amanda Rivkin (GRD ’11), Max Lambertson (SFS ’11), Irene Jagla (GRD ’10), Kevin Donovan (SFS ’11), Jacalyn Bedard (COL ’11), Gaby Baca (SFS ’08), Benjamin Lee (MSB ’09), Lexi Crampton (COL ’11) and Sarah Tucker (SFS ’11).

The District of Columbia Office of Planning’s review of the 2010 Campus Plan to the DC Zoning Commission last night requires that Georgetown house 100 percent of students on campus by 2016.
In its report, the OP called for the university to dramatically boost its capacity of on-campus residences within the next decade. While the agency supported the university’s commitment to add 250 more beds on the Hilltop by next fall, it asked that the university pledge to increase housing coverage to 90 percent of all undergraduate students by the start of the 2015 school year. Georgetown would then be required to quarter all students on campus by the following year.
If the school did not meet these requirements, the number of total undergraduate enrollment would have to be reduced by 25 percent of the difference between the number of undergraduates and the number of on-campus beds provided. This reduction would occur annually, from 2017 through 2020, until the university complied with the full housing goal.
The report also called for a cap on overall enrollment at 12,959 students for the next two academic years, as well as a maximum of 13,432 students for the 2013-14 terms. In comparison, combined undergraduate and graduate enrollment for the 2009-2010 school year was already 12,888 students.
In its March 31 changes to the original campus plan, the university volunteered to limit overall enrollment to 15,000 students.
The OP’s recommendation came just ahead of the continuation of campus plan hearings before the DC Zoning Commission next week.
The Hoya reported on April 14 that the university faced questions about its plans for student residency from neighbors at the first zoning commission hearing. Many neighbors complained about alleged unacceptable student behavior off-campus.
The Office of Planning seems to have considered these complaints while examining the Georgetown plan and the enrollment figures.
“The number of students, noise and traffic has created objectionable conditions to neighboring residential properties by reducing available on-street parking in a neighborhood with severely limited off-street parking and intermittent alley systems, noise, litter and public disturbances that resulted in an increase in 911 calls to the MPD,” the report said.
MPD has received more than 1000 911 phone calls from the West Georgetown area in the past year. However, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said on the Kojo Nnamdi radio show on March 21 that only a quarter of these were directly related to students.
According to Bill Starrels, the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration  representative on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, more on-campus housing could provide a win-win situation for both the university and the community.
“I think this is something good for our constituents. I think it’s good for the students,” he said.  “I think students can be empowered by the opportunity to live on campus.”
Scott Stirrett, chair of the student advocacy group D.C. Students Speak, disagreed. He said that Georgetown students as a whole should not be penalized because of the minority who cause a “problem for the neighborhood.”
“Even if there are these few students, fundamentally you can’t exclude a certain group just because you don’t like them,” he said.
Stirret added that he was surprised by the OP’s recommendation because Georgetown quarters more of its students on campus than any other area school.
“[Housing 100 percent of students on campus] is simply infeasible because there is limited space on campus behind the gates,” he said.
Chair of ANC 2E Ron Lewis said that, though he had not had a chance to speak with his colleagues about the report, the OP’s advice should prove useful in the proceedings to come.
“The report by the Office of Planning is a very important document,” he said. “It uses careful thought, research and it bases its conclusions on demonstrable fact.”
“I believe the OP report will be of considerable help to the Zoning Commission,” he added.
At Zoning Commission headquarters on May 12, neighborhood representatives will resume their questioning of the group of university officials and experts behind the campus plan. The ANC will make its own presentation and undergo questioning at a later date.

Georgetown’s Board of Directors approved Wednesday a $1.5 billion fundraising campaign that will launch on October 28 and last through 2016.
The project has been divided into four goals – ensuring access for students, enhancing student life and community experience, pursuing transformative opportunities and promoting faculty excellence and academic excellence. To fulfill these objectives, the university intends to raise money for scholarships, student programming, interdisciplinary programs and faculty and academic programs and resources respectively.
The campaign will begin publicly the weekend of October 28.
The fundraising initiative is the most expensive in the university’s history, according to University Spokeswoman Rachel Pugh. The measure comes in lieu of a $2 billion campaign developed in 2010 that was supposed to launch in September.
Georgetown has had significant fundraising success in recent years. Money raised for financial aid increased from $12 million to $32.5 million between 2006 and 2008, according to a university press release.
The 35-member Board of Directors is currently chaired by Paul Tagliabue (CAS ’62), former commissioner of the National Football League.
