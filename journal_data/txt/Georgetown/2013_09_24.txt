Serious delays in construction have pushed the reopening of Hoya Court eateries back two months, with completion of the renovations now projected for late October.
The Leavey Center dining area will include new vendors Elevation Burger and Salad Creations in addition to a larger Subway, replacing KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.
The university had two years remaining on its contract with the former food services provider in Hoya Court but decided to negotiate an alternative contract with Aramark, which already operates O’Donovan Hall, Starbucks, Cosi, Grab ‘n’ Go, the dining at Wolfington Hall and Dr. Mug in the Pre-clinical Science Building. The deal with Aramark allows for greater flexibility in licensing options, as Aramark has partnerships with many restaurant groups, as opposed to the former, local provider, which had partnerships with just three businesses.
“The former vendor left a little later than we had anticipated, so the project got out to a month late start because of that,” Associate Vice President and Chief Business Officer Debbie Morey said. “Going into any aggressive project, there are issues that come out.”
The decision to expand a hood over Elevation Burger to increase its prominence hampered progress, as did unanticipated plumbing and infrastructure issues. The garage, which lies underneath the site, required core drilling and scaffolding.
The university also encountered difficulties in securing licenses for “Licensing in the college market is a very big deal. … We went to places like Five Guys, Sweetgreen and Chipotle to gauge interest,” Debbie Morey said. “We knew we wanted to keep Subway … so based on feedback, we presented a couple of options, what we could get to with the Food Services Committee. We really didn’t have that many other options.”
Five Guys rejected the offer, citing desire for a storefront as well as concerns that students are not on campus year round. Chipotle said that it would not move onto college campuses at this time.
Elevation Burger appealed to Auxiliary Services due to its sustainability efforts and provision of vegan and vegetarian options. Salad Creations provided a healthy option, which the administration thought would attract customers, particularly those from the medical campus. Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese cited an increase in business at the Epicurean salad bar and Cosi while Hoya Court has been closed.
Business Services will monitor the success of the new dining options.
“We wanted flexibility to switch out these venues instead of waiting 10 years, and Aramark gives us the ability to do that,” Debbie Morey said. “Some people won’t work directly with us, and some people won’t work directly with Aramark. … They’re able to leverage brands and do things we could not do ourselves.”
In addition to the three Hoya Court vendors, Roasted, a rotisserie currently operating temporarily in Hoya Court, may soon have a permanent location on the north side of campus.
“Roasted has been a very good concept. … We’re working to see if we can keep that,” Wiese said, citing the possibility of moving Roasted to the hallway that houses Starbucks and Cosi.
Currently, the Einstein Bros. Bagels in the Car Barn is beta-testing a meal-equivalency program, where students with a meal plan can use a swipe for a meal at that location. The program could potentially be expanded to Elevation Burger and Salad Creations, but Wiese said that would not happen this year.
Chair of the Georgetown University Student Association Subcommittee on Food Service Sam Greco (SFS ’15) serves on a working group that is charged with enlivening Hoya Court. The area is supposed to be used as a student activity space, especially while the Healey Family Student Center is under construction.
“We really want to make a more welcoming, brighter place where people want to come and eat,” he said.
To that end, the seating area will be redesigned and the walls will feature decorations. Due to dust concerns, the overhaul of the seating area will coincide with the reopening of the food court.
Late-night hours for the restaurants are being considered, especially in light of Epicurean’s new 24-hour policy. Elevation Burger is currently slated to be open until 11 p.m., with a possibility of extension depending on student feedback. The move ties into the university’s attempt to contain student nightlife on campus.
The food court should reopen Oct. 25 with a soft opening, featuring little advertisement, which will allow services to make tweaks before the grand opening a week later.

Epicurean and Co. introduced 24-hour service before finals in May in an effort to lure students onto campus late at night. But since around-the-clock operations resumed Sept. 3 after a summer hiatus, late-night patronage at Epicurean has languished.
The restaurant’s late-night hours have not been profitable, drawing no more than a few dozen customers after 2 a.m. on a typical night.
Though the decision to remain open is questionable for the restaurant and the average student spends less than $5 per visit, owner Chang Wook Chon said that he will keep Epicurean open to align with the university’s goal of bringing student social life back to campus as outlined in the 2010 Campus Plan agreement.
“If you look at the success side, it isn’t the finances,” he said. “I made a commitment. We are open 24 hours.”
While Chon estimates that the restaurant serves upward of 80 customers during peak hours between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., this number tails off after 2 a.m.
Although Chon originally said that Epicurean was losing money in a joint interview with Associate Vice President of Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese, Chon claimed in a second interview that Epicurean was breaking even. However, Wiese maintained that Epicurean is indeed losing money during its nighttime operations. Chon declined to provide the amount that Epicurean was losing and said that his business’s finances were private.
The university does not currently have any plans to recoup Epicurean’s late-night losses, as the establishment is not losing money overall.
“It’s by mutual agreement. Because we all are in the customer service business this is something that we’ve all agreed to,” Wiese said. “When you look at a business model you don’t expect to make money every single hour. We’re trying to understand what service it does provide and what are the hiccups.”
However, Auxiliary Services is willing to re-evaluate the situation with Epicurean eventually.
“I think if they say this isn’t working for us we’ll re-evaluate it,” Wiese said. “It really depends on the particulars and we just need to build up that history and that’s kind of what we’re doing now.”
Auxiliary Services and Epicurean are currently collecting data to decide how often Epicurean should operate in the future. The restaurant will remain open 24 hours through the fall semester, but changes could occur further down the road.
At this point, Wiese and Chon are unsure of whether late-night Epicurean will ever be profitable.
“It could just be where it always loses money in those nighttime hours, but overall it does provide a service, and there’s nothing wrong with that,” Wiese said.
Chon maintained that the late-night hours have been successful in some ways, if not financially.
“I’ve been here a few nights, to see what kind of energy is around,” Chon said. “I think it is a success.”
The late-night eatery has yet to develop the following of nearby favorites including Eat and Joy, Quick Pita or former student favorite Tuscany Cafe, which closed in June.
“It doesn’t have that kind of tradition that a lot of other late night places like Tuscany had,” Branden Oliver (SFS ’15) said.
Cristina Fletcher (SFS ’15) was disappointed to find her food options limited on a recent late-night visit.
“We just wanted a piece of pizza, and they didn’t even have that. We decided to go elsewhere,” Fletcher said. “I’m assuming it isn’t going as well as they hoped.”
The eatery, however, remains popular with freshmen living in adjacent Darnall Hall.
“It’s more about convenience at 3 a.m.,” Darnall resident Joshua Peña (COL ’17).
The eatery also attracts medical students and staff of Georgetown MedStar Hospital, located across the street. Bridget Steuerer, a NICU nurse, noted the extended hours as a welcome change for fickle medical staff schedules.
“With unpredictable schedules, nurses and doctors usually don’t know when they will be able to eat dinner. With later hours, I don’t have to worry about bringing food,” Steuerer said.

With new GPS systems, SafeRides vans will now broadcast their location via the NextGUTS feature of the Georgetown mobile app.
NextGUTS, which launched in April, previously tracked only Georgetown University Transportation Shuttles. When students call SafeRides, they are told to stay inside until the van comes, a practice that sometimes leads to miscommunications between students and drivers. Georgetown University Chief of Police Jay Gruber said that the new feature was created out of concern for student safety and to solve this problem.
“Students felt they had to wait outside because they didn’t know when the van was coming — that made them feel uncomfortable,” Gruber said. “Our goal is to keep students safe, to keep them inside a safe area until the van is close, and now they have a great opportunity to see when the van is close and come out just before the van arrives.”
The two SafeRides vans operate from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday, and until 3 a.m. Thursday through Saturday. The Department of Public Safety also operates neighborhood shuttles to M Street and Burleith on the weekends, although they are not included in the GPS tracking update.
In addition, DPS had received significant student feedback from roundtable discussions, Gruber’s student safety advisory board and the online Georgetown Ideas forum, all of which embraced the tracking feature. Students who call in for a van will now be given an estimated time of arrival and will be able to follow the vans via their smart phones. SafeRides vans will appear as a small letter S on the map.
“You see these S’s just zinging over the Burleith and West Georgetown areas,” Gruber said. “If you get to the real granular level, it’s just pinging right along, so you’ll know when that SafeRides van is a block or so away easily.”
University Information Services Deputy Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson added that integrating the SafeRides GPS system into the mobile app was easy because of the app’s flexible mobile development platform — the university simply had to install the GPS devices into the actual vehicles. The initiative’s total cost was under $7,000, and the mobile app itself is free and available via iPhone, Android or web browser.
The new feature appears to be part of a growing trend among other colleges with SafeRides programs. The University of Chicago and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are among the universities that currently track vans in programs similar to SafeRides’ GPS technology.
Although students must currently call via phone to request a SafeRides van, Nicholson said the university’s next goal is to integrate requests into the app, similar to popular taxi-hailing service Uber. According to Nicholson, this step could be available within the next year.
Overall, students said that they thought the new feature was a good idea.
“It’s not safe to be waiting outdoors, and now you can be warm and indoors while you wait,” Sharanya Venkataraman (SFS ’16) said. “There have been a couple times where I’ve had to wait a while for the van, and it would definitely help me feel safer if I knew when it was coming or where it was.”
Owen Phillips (GRD ’15) agreed.
“I think if you’re not outside your house when they come by, they’ll leave you, so if you know they’re coming by sooner than later you can step outside and not miss them,” Phillips said.

The finalists for this year’s Opus Prize, a $1 million award that honors volunteers who are inspired by faith to solve social problems around the world, hail everywhere from Indonesia to Washington, D.C.
Monday, the Opus Prize Foundation announced the Fahmina Institute, along with Carol Keehan, Catholic Health Association president, and Sakena Yacoobi, Afghan Institute of Learning founder, as the finalists, in partnership with Georgetown’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs.
The finalists will come to Georgetown for the awards ceremony in November.
“[The prize is] to honor and thus to encourage remarkable people who are working to solve the world’s biggest problems,” said Katherine Marshall, a senior fellow at the Berkley Center. “But perhaps the second and equally important goal of the prize is to inspire the spirit of service in students.”
In addition to the $1 million award, the two other finalists will each get $100,000 awards to fund their work.
“This year’s finalists are inspiring examples of the positive differences that each of us can make in our communities and indeed our world,” University President John J. DeGioia said in a press release. “They embody the Jesuit principle of being women and men in service of others, and we are honored to host them on campus this fall, for both the awards ceremony and discussions with our students.”
Like other Opus Prize finalists, Yacoobi’s drive to run the Afghan Institute of Learning comes from her faith. While growing up in Afghanistan and seeing women and children suffer from diseases and discrimination, she saw Islam serve as the impetus to help them overcome these struggles.
“Being a Muslim, I believe God loves us, and if we act in a loving way, God will help and guide us,” said Yacoobi, who was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. “I actually started to cry [when I was notified of the decision] because of the great honor to AIL’s work.”
“I believe that things happen for a good reason,” she added. “Thanks to being a finalist, the work of AIL will be better known and will help us do things that we have not yet been able to do yet. I have been thinking about things I would like to do, and now I will have the opportunity to do them.”
The Fahmina Institute, established in 2000 in Cirebon, Indonesia, is a finalist for its work in educating people about Islamic culture and values while also focusing on scholarly research and educating young Muslims.
The final nominee, Keehan, works to aid the poor at the Catholic Health Association of the United States, based in Washington, D.C. She pushed for the passage of the Affordable Care Act and was listed in 2010 as one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World.
One professor and one student from the Opus Prize Foundation’s steering committee will visit each nominee and report back to the foundation’s board of directors, which will choose a winner ahead of the Nov. 13 awards ceremony.

Two new Living and Learning Communities centered around the environment and Judaism, respectively, joined Georgetown’s themed housing offerings this fall.
The Greenhouse LLC currently has only three residents in addition to its resident assistant, Penny Hung (SFS ’16), The Hoya’s city news editor. Though the small size was initially an obstacle to its establishment, the residents say it has not compromised the LLC’s goals.
“There are only three of them, but the three that are there, and the RA, are super passionate about it, and so sometimes the work of a few minds can equal more than that of two or three times the amount,” Assistant Director of Residential Education Amanda Erdmann said.
Greenhouse residents, who live on the fourth floor of LXR, go on hikes, garden in Georgetown’s community garden, focus on building a community and other sustainable practices. The LLC is allotted only a few hundred dollars for the year, but founder Megan Griffin (COL ’14) hopes to work on other initiatives, like a composting program or solar electricity.
“I think if we could make a campus where people were as engaged and in tuned to environmental issues as they are economic injustice, social injustice … think of what could happen in the city,” Griffin said.
Bayit, the Jewish Interest LLC in Henle Village, aims to provide a place for Jewish and non-Jewish students alike to practice their religion and Jewish culture as well engage with other Jewish groups on campus.
The community plans to celebrate religious holidays together, such as having weekly Shabbat dinners. However, Kosher Cleanliness Captain David Turer (MSB ’16) hopes that Bayit can become more than just a place for religious events, but one that fosters a sense of community among its members.
“[Judaism] is more of a culture I’d say than a religion, or equally,” Turer said.
Despite the Jewish affiliation of the majority of its residents, Allison Heymann (SFS ’16) said that she feels comfortable as a non-Jew living in Bayit.
“It doesn’t even feel like Jewish housing, more like a really nice Henle,” Heymann said. “I feel like all of the Jewish students living here have gotten a lot out of it, but as someone who’s not Jewish, I feel very impartial.”
Bayit does, however, differ from surrounding apartments in that it expects its residents to keep kosher to a certain degree.
“To be truly kosher, it’s not impossible, but it’s really, really difficult,” President of Bayit Jake Bercow (COL ’16) said.
Along with a ban on pork and shellfish, a strict kosher household would need separate refrigerators and utensils to completely separate meat and dairy.
“It’s just not really sustainable or practical for a Living and Learning Community, so we have to deal with that,” Bercow said.
There are nine LLCs with themes ranging from French to Justice and Diversity.

Administrators cleared up some confusion about the proposed satellite residence at the first in a series of open houses addressing off- and on-campus housing options last week.
During the open houses, which took place in O’Donovan Hall and the Village A community room, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson assured students that while off-campus housing is a possibility, Georgetown will still remain united as one campus.
“We’re not talking about a satellite campus; we’re talking about a building,” Olson said.
The university will take measures to ensure that students living off-campus can remain part of the Georgetown community, such as running Georgetown University Transportation Shuttles between the satellite residence and the main campus 18 hours a day, every day of the week. Student groups that meet late at night have expressed concern that students would not be able to participate in activities if their ability to get to campus is limited.
According to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey, the decision to live in off-campus housing would be entirely up to students.
“We need some people to be interested, but no one would be forced to live off-campus,” Morey said.
In order to gauge students’ thoughts on housing, Georgetown will conduct a housing survey later this fall.
“We’re looking at the student body as partners in this decision,” Morey said.
Olson added that the administration views on-campus housing as a priority for undergraduate students.
“We agree with you; we want you to be on campus,” Olson said. “The priority for undergraduates is on-campus housing.”
Should the university add a satellite residence, it would likely be converted to housing for graduate students in the coming years, after the university is able to accommodate all undergraduates on campus. As part of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, the university needs to house an additional 385 students by fall 2015. Any lease the university would sign to add a satellite residence would have to be between seven and 10 years.
Although many students at the forum were adamant in their opposition to the idea of a satellite residence, Rebecca Barr (SFS ’14) said that the forum cleared up confusion about administrators’ plans for off-campus housing. Barr said she was initially opposed to the prospect of housing students so far from campus, an attitude she now thinks was due to misinformation about administrators’ plans.
“If this had been an option for me, I would have definitely considered it,” Barr said.
However, Rose Lauricella (MSB ’14), a student involved in the One Georgetown, One Campus campaign, said she fears that the creation of a satellite residence would harm upperclassmen that hold leadership roles in campus organizations.
“This would encourage juniors and seniors to be less involved on campus,” Lauricella said.
Tom DeBow (COL ’15) was especially skeptical of the claim that housing on Capitol Hill would be more convenient for upperclassmen with internships.
“I don’t see why we don’t just amp up GUTS buses,” DeBow said. “It makes more sense for students to live on campus and travel to internships than to live close to their internships and travel to class.”

Ahead of the White House Interfaith Collegiate Conference at Georgetown yesterday, the Jewish Chaplaincy upgraded its sukkah, a hut for the weeklong Jewish holiday of Sukkot, with the help of two award-winning Sukkah architects.
Sukkot, which started Wednesday evening, commemorates Jews’ wandering through the desert for 40 years with the building of temporary structures called Sukkahs.
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner approached architects Henry Grosman and Babak Bryan, who had previously won the People’s Choice Award in the 2010 Sukkah City NYC competition.
“I kind of told them about Georgetown and what an exciting place this is. They got excited about the idea of building something in an interfaith context,” Gartner said. “The joke was they got really excited about building a sukkah for the Pope.”
Gartner initially decided to contact the architects after getting a call from staff at the White House Interfaith Collegiate Conference, which asked whether Georgetown would have a sukkah available for anyone who wanted to use it when the conference came to campus this past Monday.
The combination of interfaith exploration and architectural creativity spoke to both architects. While Bryan is not Jewish, he was intrigued by the specific rules involved in building kosher sukkahs, such as the need for a temporary roof. These constraints differ greatly from those the architects deal with on a daily basis.
In addition to traditional laws for building sukkahs, Gartner specified that the sukkah be reusable, modern and even more open than required. While traditional laws can be specific and challenging to follow, Grosman explained that the most challenging rule of all was building a collapsible, reusable sukkah, which explains its unique design.
“The hardest [rule to follow] was trying to figure out how it could be something really interesting and also taken apart and put into pieces that could be assembled in a relatively simple way,” Grosman said.
In the past, the Jewish Student Association has had a sukkah for Sukkot, but nothing comparable to what Bryan and Grosman have built this year.
“Now we have a formidable structure, … which is really great because it says there is a strong presence of Jewish community on campus that enjoys being able to reflect on their own traditions even though they don’t go to a school that is dominated by people who share the same culture,” Jewish Student Association Co-President Sapir Yarden (SFS ’15) said.
The idea of Sukkot is to dwell in the sukkah. Gartner hopes that everyone will use the sukkah.
Construction began Sept. 17, with an opening reception last Wednesday. This past Friday, Gartner organized the second-ever Shabbat on the lawn, featuring a jazz band from New York and Georgetown University Grilling Society burgers. Some synagogue visitors were invited to stop by Saturday, and the structure will also be available to members of the White House Interfaith Collegiate Conference for the rest of the conference. The sukkah will remain standing through Sunday, a few days after the end of Sukkot and will be stored to be rebuilt for Sukkot next year.

Professor of medical ethics and philosophy Robert M. Veatch called for changing the way that organ transplants are distributed this Friday in the Bioethics Research Library.
The discussion, part of the Big Ideas in Bioethics speaker series, focused on the case of Sarah Murnaghan, an 11-year-old girl who suffered from severe cystic fibrosis and was on the children’s waiting list for a lung transplant for 18 months.
The case gained national attention as Murnaghan’s mother took to social media to plead Sarah’s case. The Murnaghan family won their case, arguing on the basis of age discrimination, and the judge granted Sarah a spot on the top of the waiting list for adult transplants, rather than on the waiting list for children’s transplants, significantly decreasing the time she would wait for a new set of lungs. After a lung transplant, Sarah returned home in August.
Veatch explained why many transplant experts are leery of cases like Sarah’s.
“Politicians and judges cannot grasp the multifactorial principles of allocation,” Veatch said. “Sarah’s mother knew how to manipulate the media in a favorable view of her daughter.”
Veatch debated how far medical professionals should go in prioritizing transplants for children over adults.
“We in the transplant world would not be uncomfortable giving an advantage to kids. We just don’t know how much advantage to allocate,” he said. “If we’re to treat people equally, we need to figure out what equally poor off is.”
Another problem, Veatch said, was in the decision to put Sarah on the adult waiting list. While her chance of receiving a transplant was greater, adult lungs simply do not function optimally in children.
“[The judge] didn’t get to meet the adult, who probably had a greater chance of survival, who died because Sarah got his lungs,” said Veatch. “The fault is not in the mother. The fault is in the judge for not realizing the extent to which his decision affected the lives of others.”
The presentation was followed by a brief question and answer session.
Undergraduate Bioethics Society Treasurer Courtney Choy (COL ’14) encouraged students to attend future speaker series events, which the society co-sponsors once a month.
“What people don’t know is that bioethics doesn’t just apply to the sciences. As seen in today’s discussion, it’s relevant in government, technology, policy, law, etc.,” Choy said. “Understanding these issues in today’s society can give students a distinct advantage.”

One month after opening a larger downtown space, the School of Continuing Studies announced a new master’s program in systems engineering management — its first course of study in a “STEM” discipline.
The master’s program, scheduled to launch in fall 2014, is a partnership with the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., with each school designing half of the 30-credit program. SCS Interim Dean Walter Rankin said that the degree will allow students to further explore the science, technology, engineering and math field, which he believes has not been a focus at Georgetown.
Other STEM-related degrees in the SCS include technology management as well as emergency and disaster management, both of which do not require students to possess an extensive background in math or statistics, unlike the new master’s program.
“The whole university has long been interested in getting into the STEM area,” Rankin said. “We’re such a strong liberal arts institution with such a great tradition there, but we hadn’t done that much with the sciences, and that’s really, really important.”
Georgetown Senior Vice President for Research and Chief Technology Officer Spiros Dimolitsas, who has worked with the Systems Engineering Research Center sponsored by the Department of Defense at the Stevens Institute since 2010, spearheaded the initiative to create the new offering.
“The new master’s program further expands Georgetown’s research capabilities in the applied and integrative research space,” Dimolitsas said in a press release.
Rankin stressed the importance of developing this partnership with Stevens, emphasizing the school’s strength in engineering.
“They have a great background. They clearly know what they’re doing,” Rankin said. “The reason the partnership is so important is that it gives us immediate access to faculty who do research in all levels of systems engineering. They are well known for it.”
Access to Stevens faculty members is a key portion of the new degree program, and experts will commute from New Jersey to Georgetown via train for weekly classes. Practitioners from leading organizations in the Washington, D.C. area will also teach classes in the program.
“Our faculty are excited to engage with the students in this innovative graduate program, underpinned by robust systems research and scholarship,” Stevens School of Systems and Enterprises Dean Dinesh Verma said in a press release.
According to Rankin, systems engineering management, which focuses on cohesive, large-scale management and system manipulation, is a growing multidisciplinary field that incorporates computing systems, financial systems, human resources systems and data systems.
“It seems like such a complex idea, but actually, I think it’s relatively simple,” Rankin said. “There are multiple systems that work with any type of organization, and what this does is help people understand how all of those systems work together.”
The degree was created in response to industry pressure, as Stevens’ official press release reported that the systems engineering management industry added more than 6,000 new jobs to the D.C. metropolitan area in 2011 alone. The SCS’s new downtown location will also give new students the opportunity to develop hands-on experience alongside their classroom knowledge.
Although the degree is a combined effort with Stevens, Rankin stressed that the program will exist entirely within the SCS.
“Even though we are in a partnership with Stevens — it’s a collaboration — the degree will be a Georgetown degree,” Rankin said. “It’s Georgetown-specific.”
Rankin also noted the importance of the new program in furthering the SCS’s mission, which aims to prepare students to enter a changing job market.
“What our school specializes in is finding jobs that are coming up five years from now, 10 years from now, and getting people ready professionally to enter those fields,” Rankin said. “The idea is not that a student would need to be an expert in all of those fields, but rather this is someone who would be able to, once they finish this degree program, understand how all of these systems work together to build a larger, cohesive unit.”

Much fanfare is given each year to ranking the country’s colleges. Yet as Georgetown demonstrates, a greater challenge can lie in ranking the value of these various lists.
While U.S. News & World Report ranked Georgetown at 20th place this year, PayScale, which uses a metric focusing on graduates’ earnings, put Georgetown in a three-way tie for 41st with Kenyon College in Ohio and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.
PayScale has ranked colleges based on graduate salaries since 2008. The company also analyzes salaries to help employees and employers assess what workers should be making. Harvey MuddCollege in California ranks first on PayScale’s list; the California Institute of Technology came in second. Princeton University, the top college according to U.S. News, was ranked 5th by PayScale.
The marked difference between the two lists can be attributed to each ranking’s different standards of measurement.
U.S. News ranks based on peer university evaluations, high school counselor ratings, freshman retention rate, graduation rate, class sizes, faculty pay and credentials, admissions selectivity and financial resources.
In contrast, PayScale ranks colleges based on graduates’ starting and mid-career salaries, as well as their response to the question “Does your work make the world a better place?” PayScale reported the average starting salary of Georgetown graduates to be $53,000, with a mid-career salary average at $103,000. Forty-one percent of respondents answered positively to the survey question. These data prompted a five-place drop on the PayScale system, where Georgetown placed 36th last year.
Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon said that rankings have trouble qualifying the complicated mix of factors present at each university.
“All of [the rankings] are attempting to put into numeric rank very hard to quantify information,” Deacon said. “The problem is that there’s such a huge variety of colleges in the United States. … One school’s strength may not be the same as another and yet how do you put them on the same scale?”
Deacon added that he was wary of ulterior motives behind rankings.
“People are looking for basically a way to make money,” Deacon said. “Rankings in our society sell magazines or sell advertisers.”
Deacon pointed to PayScale’s single-minded focus as a flaw in the rankings system.
“I think it’s a ‘sexy’ poll but of very little value,” Deacon said. “What is the relationship between money and academic excellence?”
Chloe Coughlin-Schulte (SFS ’14) echoed Deacon’s opinion about PayScale, particularly because many Georgetown students end up taking positions in government or at nonprofits.
“There’s a lot more to a college education then how much money you make,” Coughlin-Schulte said. “Honorable positions like being a civil servant or working for the government or being a diplomat are not typically super high-income professions but they’re certainly an honorable line of work, and I think Georgetown produces a lot of people like that.”
In addition, Deacon said he was wary about the validity of the research and data behind ranking systems.
“We’re a little cynical … because we don’t participate in the kinds of games that colleges do play,” Deacon said, referencing the university’s independence from the Common Application.
If Georgetown began using the Common Application, the university would be able to drastically boost its application numbers while maintaining its admit numbers, drastically lowering the university’s admissions rate — what Deacon calls a “game” played by other universities. Switching from early action to early decision would drive up the university’s yield rates, providing similar effects on rankings.
According to Deacon, although Georgetown is in the top 20 in the U.S. News & World Report ranking, the university actually competes academically with the top 10, particularly when recruiting students.
Neal Chaudhuri (COL ’16) agreed and said he did not choose Georgetown based on its ranking.
“I don’t believe in ranking colleges or universities in any way, shape or form through a numbered scale because how can you compare so much diversity and uniqueness between all the schools in the country?” Chaudhuri said.
Deacon suggested that rankings should give broader ranges rather than placing universities at particular numbered ranks. For example, Deacon said that rankings could group schools into groups of 25 in categories. Between those groups of 25, however, it is difficult to differentiate.
“What we hear is, ‘I really love Georgetown, but when it comes down to the final decision in April, [the University of Pennsylvania] is in the Ivy League,’” Deacon said. “That becomes a tipping point, so in the end, how do you measure these very similar institutions? They just have different circumstances.”

To most Georgetown students, a semester away from campus immediately equates to a semester abroad. But some students from other universities instead come to Washington, D.C., for the Semester in Washington, D.C. Program to reap the benefits of District life that Georgetown students often take for granted.
SWP, run through the School of Continuing Studies since 2003, attracts between 200 and 300 students each year. Participants take classes at the SCS campus in downtown Washington, often complete internships and take part in specific programming. Most students live in downtown D.C. in housing at New York University’s D.C. campus.
“We’re having guest speakers come talk to us about things that I find really interesting that I didn’t even know until I came to this program,” Seth Bynum, a junior at Vassar College who is currently enrolled in SWP, said. “It’s extremely helpful in helping us figure out what we want to do with our lives.”
In particular, participants’ semesters often begin with a particular introduction to D.C. This fall, SWP students heard Obama’s and civil rights leaders’ Aug. 28 speeches on the National Mall commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington.
In the past, students have also attended events with entrepreneur Bill Gates and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and have engaged the program’s partnerships with the National Press Club and Politico.
The students, however, have minimal interaction with main campus; Bynum said he has been to the Hilltop only once in the month he has been in D.C. The SCS’s move downtown from its former M Street location this fall has further decreased the likelihood that SCS participants will find reasons to come to the Georgetown area.
But D.C. and its opportunities, rather than the Hilltop, are the main attraction for SWP students, most of whom are juniors and seniors, although the program is open to all college students. Recent years have seen an uptick in international student participation, particularly from China and Latin America.
Applications to the program require transcripts, recommendations and a personal essay about professional development and the program’s connections to students’ courses of study.
SCS Senior Associate Dean and Chief Administrative Officer Jim Parenti emphasized the importance of the program’s ability to connect theory and application by prioritizing the connection between academics and work experience.
“Our program allows students to see that coursework works with internships, rather than on top of them,” Parenti said.
Julie Hutchinson, a junior at Haverford College and an applicant to the program for the spring semester, said this focus on interning was a factor in her decision to apply to Georgetown’s program, as opposed to other D.C. programs.
“You’re doing an internship and having that experience, as opposed to having just classes at another university,” Hutchinson said.
Brian Bentley, a senior from Point Loma Nazarene University who is currently enrolled in SWP, agreed.
“It provides a really good atmosphere to get engaged with work and really build a foundation for networking and professional skills,” Bentley said. “If you take that challenge and you think critically and apply that same critical thought process to your internship, to your classes, the experience starts to build on your knowledge.”
Bentley added that Georgetown’s reputation played a large role in his decision to come to SWP.
“Finding an opportunity to attend Georgetown University for a semester, I didn’t want to turn that down,” Bentley said. “It’s something that most people don’t get an opportunity to do, and I was very blessed.”
Jen O’Neil, a graduate from Boston College who participated in SWP in spring 2011, agreed.
“Having that Georgetown name meant that the people we got to meet were just far superior to anybody else,” O’Neil said.
O’Neil’s original SWP internship with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) turned into her full-time career. She now works as Johnson’s scheduler and executive assistant.
This exposure to future career paths is a hallmark of SWP, compared to more traditional study abroad programs.
“The contacts I have in this program, I’m going to be in contact with them in the long run, maybe for the rest of my life because they want to do the same things I want to do,” Bynum said. “The people I’m meeting … they become professional contacts that I’llable to call on in the future.”
Many SWP participants cite these opportunities as factors for choosing a study exchange program in the United States rather than studying abroad.
“I think it’s a more productive experience — I have friends in New Zealand and Europe who are country-hopping on the weekends,” said Bynum, who was originally going to study abroad in London. “Other than getting the experience of going to another place, there is not much that is productive or will actually help them in the long run.”
Overall, O’Neil expressed satisfaction with her experience at Georgetown and in D.C., although she had originally been hesitant about taking a semester away from her alma mater.
“I wanted to know, that at the end of my senior year, when I graduated and went out to the workforce or decided to apply to grad school, I could say that I took every opportunity to make the best of my four years. I was thinking about staying in school and taking as many cases as I could,” O’Neil said. “But then I found out about the Semester in Washington Program. … Semesters like that are really what I was looking for to make the most out of my college career.”

At least half of Georgetown undergraduates will venture off the Hilltop to study abroad during their college career. But while opportunities in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and France remain popular, more and more American students are exploring less traditional destinations in Asia and the Middle East.
In November 2012, the Institute of International Education announced in its Open Doors Report that China, now ranked just behind those four European options, has jumped in popularity as a study abroad destination. Other countries with significant gains included Brazil, Costa Rica, India and South Korea.
Director of Overseas Studies Craig Rinker said that Georgetown is consistent with the national trend, which he attributed to increased accessibility and the expanded global nature of academia.
“Europe is where study abroad was founded, but as the world becomes smaller, students are drawn to newer locations,” Rinker said. “Particularly as academia becomes more global and more academic disciplines address global issues, students are going to find ways to go to those areas of the world they are studying about.”
To students, emerging study abroad destinations in Asia and the Middle East can be more exciting than their more established European counterparts. For example, Sarah Wang (SFS ’14), who lived with a host family for a year in Tokyo, stressed the “once-in-a-lifetime” chance that many non-traditional study abroad options present.
“Asia is kind of the place where if you have a chance, you should go,” Wang said. “When you talk about it later in your life, it’s really awesome to say, ‘I went to India’ — not that France isn’t [great], but it’s just different.”
Michael Paslavsky (COL ’14), who studied abroad in Dublin, said that although he was satisfied with his experience, he understood the appeal of Asia.
“Growing up, it wasn’t that unusual to go to Europe, so I think Europe is often viewed more like a vacation place,” Paslavsky said. “Japan is so far away, so when you are given the opportunity to go there, it’s Georgetown students doing what they normally do, seizing an opportunity.”
Study abroad destinations are often closely tied to students’ academic interests, particularly foreign languages; those who plan to study abroad in Asia often enroll in intensive programs to gain proficiency in the local language in preparation. These study abroad programs offer cultural and language immersion as a key component for reaching fluency.
“People who study abroad in Asia generally are focused on becoming fluent in their language, but for me I just wanted a different type of people, a different type of culture, and that wouldn’t be defined by a language,” Paslavsky said of his time in Dublin.
But as Asia grows in popularity as a serious study abroad option, Europe’s “touristy” reputation deepens, thanks to its familiarity.
“You kind of know what you’re getting when you go to Europe,” said Matthew Serrone (COL ’14), who previously visited Europe but chose to study abroad in Japan instead. “They often very much cater to Americans who want the European experience without fully diving in. There are definitely cultural differences, but I don’t think they’re as extreme. People, I think, want something more unknown, unexpected.”
Rinker agreed and added that there is sometimes an unnecessary stigma attached to European study abroad programs.
“We have many students on campus who look at what they’re studying and their language preparation and have it intimately tied into Western Europe, for instance, and there’s nothing wrong with that,” Rinker said. “I think oftentimes the thought now is that you can’t be current or the cutting edge by sticking to Western Europe.”
The Chronicle of Higher Education also recently reported that the recent economic downturn in Europe and the relative economic rise in Asia have affected schools’ ability to fund such study abroad programs, both stateside and abroad.
According to the Chronicle, Asian countries have continued to invest in higher education, while European university budgets have been continually slashed as Europe battles its recessions.
“With few exceptions — notably Germany — institutions lack the deep pockets needed to fuel international activities,” the Chronicle reported.
James Burr (MSB ’14), a finance student who studied abroad in Barcelona, chose to study in Europe during the recession, however, to observe the recession’s effects on the region.
But while Burr agreed that Europe has become touristy, he argued that it falls on the traveller and the student to seek the local experience in any city.
“It’s like Washington, D.C.,” Burr said. “If you’re a tourist, you’re not going to find The Tombs.”
Rinker emphasized that Europe still provides a valuable cultural experience.
“There are significant nuances to living in Europe, and I think sometimes because there’s a common language, people devalue those nuances,” Rinker said.
Another unique feature of European study abroad programs is the ease with which students can travel between countries. In contrast, students who study in Asia generally stay in one particular country because they are often limited by transportation methods and cost.
“Asia is not the type of place where you can country-hop on weekends like Europe,” Kristin D’Alba (COL ’14), who studied abroad in Shanghai last fall, said. “You really do stay in the local area, but I like that because you get to really know one city.”
Overall, despite the national trend toward non-traditional areas, Rinker said that Georgetown would continue to seek new study abroad sites based on fit, rather than trend.
“We’re hoping that programs are relevant to what’s currently happening in the world, and there is a demand from students for it,” Rinker said. “Part of the challenge is that you want to ensure that there’s quality and that experiences can be managed in terms of student support and in terms of health and safety. We’re very intentional about the programs that we develop.”
Rinker added that despite the slow move away from European study abroad experiences, Europe will always be a valued player in the world of academia.
“As the world becomes a smaller place, I think more and more students will consider studying in countries that may not have been so prominent 10 or 15 years ago, so I expect Latin America, Asia and Africa to continue to grow. But I don’t think you’ll ever see a decrease in demand for the more traditional locations like Europe,” Rinker said. “Just because Europe is accessible doesn’t mean that it’s easy and that there’s not cultural value there or academic disciplinary value there.”
