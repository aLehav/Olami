The School of Foreign Service is planning to introduce a science requirement into its core curriculum and reduce the number of major course requirements beginning with the Class of 2022, according to SFS Senior Dean for Undergraduate Affairs Daniel Byman.
The changes are set to be announced by the SFS Dean’s Office in late 2017 or early 2018. The specific details of the implementation of each requirement need to be decided before the official announcement.
The Dean’s Office is also considering reducing the number of required economics courses from four to three and giving students the ability to count one- or four-credit classes toward their graduation requirements.
The Dean’s Office may consider adding new minors after these changes are announced.
Senior Dean for Undergraduate Affairs Daniel Byman said these changes resulted from several rounds of talks with members of the Georgetown community in addition to multiple external and internal reviews of the SFS curriculum.
“We put together some proposals and those were vetted through different bodies, including students, alumni, faculty and staff,” Byman said in an interview with The Hoya. “Now we’re in the stage of putting very specific flesh on these proposals.”
The SFS core curriculum currently consists of one freshman proseminar, two humanities or writing courses, two theology courses, two engaging diversity courses, two government courses, three history courses, four economic courses, two philosophy courses, a language proficiency requirement and the one-credit “Map of the Modern World.”
Students are required to gain proficiency in a language before graduating.
The Dean’s Office has yet to decide the exact number of courses to be cut.
Byman said he thinks the most exciting change would be allowing one- or four-credit courses to count toward graduation, which would give students the ability to take a greater variety of elective classes.
“The thing that gets less attention is allowing the one credit classes to count,” Byman said. “What that means is that you can have lots of different types of SFS classes or classes in general.”
SFS Academic Council President Devika Ranjan (SFS ’17) said the science requirement would be designed to align with other internationally oriented SFS core classes and a hard science course like chemistry or biology.
Currently, only students pursuing the science, technology and international affairs major have a science requirement.
“There will also be a ‘science’ requirement — but one that is relevant to SFS, so similar to a STIA class,” Ranjan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “One that is interdisciplinary between science — the environment, geography, etc. — and international affairs.”
While there are no new minors under consideration for the time being, Ranjan said the Jan. 2017 announced Design Your Own Certificate program, which allows students to design a certificate with a dean they select in the SFS, is a way for potential minors to eventually be considered.
According to Ranjan, if enough students register in a certain category, then the Dean’s Office may consider making the new program applicable to the Class of 2019 onward, full-time.
“There are ‘Design Your Own Certificates’ for the Class of 2019 onwards,” Ranjan wrote. “These certificates should be in a field that is markedly different from a student’s major. This is a great opportunity to show the administration interest in certain fields that we want to formalize minors in.”
Taylor Oster (SFS ’17), development and fundraising committee chair for the SFS academic council, said that developing new curriculum requires a balance between innovation and not adding too many core requirements.
“We can’t just keep adding core requirements, so where do we make changes?” Oster said. “The important thing to remember is that with curricular reform we’re trying to make the kind of education you receive from the SFS more applicable to what you will be doing when you leave Georgetown.”

When are they planning to add the “Introduction to Management Consulting” course to the Core?

More than five hundred Washington, D.C. residents and local lawmakers rallied in opposition to federal interference in local District legislation as the House of Representative’s Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued a formal markup of disapproval of D.C. legislation.
With the formal disapproval, which occurred as the Hands Off D.C. rally was happening, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee took the first step toward nullifying Washington, D.C.’s Death with Dignity Act. The markup of disapproval is the fourth time Congress has voted down a D.C. law since the passing of the 1973 Home Rule Act.
The Death with Dignity Act, initially proposed by D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) in January 2015 and signed by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) in December 2016, would allow physicians to prescribe fatal medication to terminally ill patients.
The full House of Representatives and the Senate have until Friday, when the 30-day window for Congress to stop District legislation closes, to vote to block the law.
The rally, which took place at the Atlas Performing Arts Center, was the first gathering organized by Hands Off D.C., a coalition of advocates for increased D.C. independence that prepares D.C. leaders to resist federal plans intervening in District affairs.
Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) organized the Hands Off D.C. rally before the vote took place to assert the belief that the District’s citizens and government should retain the right to make their own laws without interference from the federal government.
The Constitution gives Congress the ability to overturn District laws, but they must acquire passage by both the House and the Senate as well as the president’s signature. On Jan. 24, the House of Representatives also voted 238-183 in favor of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017, which officially prohibited local D.C. tax dollars from funding abortion services, except in the case of sexual assault, incest or endangerment to the life of the mother.
Addressing a crowd of organizers at the Spirit of Justice Park, Bowser voiced her support for the movement, saying that her signature on legislation passed by the D.C. local government should be the final say.
“This Council of the District of Columbia has been duly elected by the people of the District of Columbia, and this council of the District of Columbia passes the laws for us,” Bowser said. “When I put my ‘John Hancock’ on that law, it should be the law of the land.”
Later in the evening, Hands Off D.C. advocates, led by Allen, overflowed the 320-seat Atlas Theater.
House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has been a vocal opponent of the assisted suicide bill. Last week, Chaffetz published an op-ed in The Washington Post describing his moral opposition to the bill and also expressed concerns over the bill’s lack of regulation during the markup.
Chaffetz said during the session Monday night that the bill does not specifically define what qualifies as a terminal illness and does not prohibit insurance companies from funding physician-assisted suicide instead of surgeries or treatment.
“Far too many of its ‘safeguards’ appear to be little more than a facade of protection, rather than actual measures to combat abuse and misuse. The act places individuals in a situation ripe for coercion and misuse and mistakes,” Chaffetz said. “We should be doing everything in our power as legislators to help prevent suicide, not encourage it.”
Committee Ranking Member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said the resolution negates the will of District residents and violates the Home Rule Act of 1973, which grants the District the power to elect its own city council and pass legislation.
Cummings brought up the fact that D.C. has no voting members in Congress. The District has two shadow Senators, as well as Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives.
“With the exception of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, who does a phenomenal job, none of us were elected by the D.C. voters,” Cummings said during the session. “None of us served in the D.C. City Council, where the Death with Dignity Act was approved by a vote of 11-2. None of the members of this committee would stand for congressional interference in their own state and local affairs, and none of us should stand for it in this case.”
Rep. Steve Russell (R-Okla.) also said he was morally opposed to the bill, which he compared to the euthanasia of Jews and other minorities during the Holocaust.
“America, wake up. Wake up. No matter how frayed the fabric of our conscience, we must hold it together to stand against this civilized, organized effort of barbarity veneered as consent, dignity and duly passed law,” Russell said during the session. “I will speak up. We must wake up. We cannot allow the legalization of a system of expanding murder-suicide pacts.”
Norton responded to Russell, stating that the resolution was hypocritical in light of the Republican Party’s typical dedication to limiting the size of government and federal intervention into state affairs.
“The District of Columbia and its residents are accountable only to local officials just as yours are, Mr. Russell,” Norton said during the session. “This markup shows contempt for democracy and flies in the face of what we had always thought to be bedrock Republican principles that we hear on the floor every day: limited government and local control of local affairs.”
Georgetown Students for D.C. Statehood Vice President Maddy Taub (COL ’18) said that as a D.C. citizen, she sees the resolution as a violation of the rights of District residents.
“D.C. citizens have no vote in Congress even though they pay federal taxes,” Taub said. “When the majority of D.C. citizens vote for a law, Congress can immediately intervene despite the wishes of D.C. citizens.”
Georgetown Students for D.C. Statehood member Dylan Hughes (COL ’19) said he was surprised to see Chaffetz’s opposition to the bill after the demonstrations at a recent town hall in Utah, which saw constituents demanding he address more local issues.
“It’s funny that Chaffetz wants to overrule the will of voters of the District, while just having been chewed out by his own constituents for refusing to listen and act on their own concerns,” Hughes said. “Chaffetz should tend to his own business as representative from Utah and chair of the Government Oversight Committee before meddling in the local affairs of the District.”
Bowser expressed disappointment at Congress’ decision in a statement released Monday evening.
“I am disappointed at the egregious action taken by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee today,” the statement reads. “In passing H.R. 27, the House Oversight Committee, led by Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz, has sent a signal to DC residents that Congress has zero respect of concern for their will or the will of their elected officials.”

Two years ago, former Georgetown University Student Association President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) ran a satirical campaign with only two serious platforms on mental health and sexual assault reform. Last year, Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Chris Fisk (COL ’17) entered the race with a platform consisting of over 44 policies.
The two campaigns reveal two disparate visions of GUSA’s role in serving the student body. As this season’s GUSA executive election heads into full swing, The Hoya looks back at how student government has changed on campus in recent years.
Stemming from the Senate
What began for Luther as a satirical campaign to make fun of GUSA soon turned into a real campaign to change GUSA. While parts of GUSA may seem pointless, Luther said he believes in GUSA’s ability to spearhead change.
“We fought for and achieved a campus plan that stopped encroaching on students’ right to be equal members of the community. We gave students New York Times subscriptions. We tried to make GUSA a little less buttoned up with videos, ad campaigns and an ‘Aw shucks’ attitude,’” Luther wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But also, the senate is a pretty silly idea.”
Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16), who served as GUSA chief of staff under Luther and Rohan following her own campaign for president the same year, said that working in the senate was much more individualistic than she originally anticipated.
“Initially I probably thought there were more senate projects, but that depends on who’s involved,” McNaughton said. “The senate does not make you contribute to Georgetown or make something better — it comes on you to take it on yourself.”
According to Khan, the senate under previous administrations was structured in a way that made it largely redundant. Khan served as senate speaker before she came president and advocated for the replacement of the senate with a proposed assembly during a referendum in December.
“My experience with the senate is you get what you put in,” Khan said. “In an institution like the senate, pre-restructuring, I did recognize our work was redundant to what the executive was already working on. Where I was helpful were areas that executives at the time were not putting enough attention into.”
Luther said that GUSA is at its most effective when it engages with the student body.
“GUSA should understand and reflect the priorities, concerns and zeitgeist of the student body and effectively communicate and advocate these positions to the administration,” Luther wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Keep fightin’ for students! Keep engagin’! That’s what GUSA’s gotta keep doin’!”
Insular Yet Representative
Alex Bobroske (COL ’17), who was chief of staff under the Khan-Fisk administration before resigning his post in August, said his first interaction with GUSA as a member of the campaign for Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) and Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15) illustrated the gaps between the student body and the student government.
“Thomas was the president of [G.U.] Pride and Jimmy was in GSP and they had a very different perspective than most of the campaigns that were just white guys in GUSA,” Bobroske said. “That campaign really opened my eyes to how there were two Georgetowns, if not more, that just never interacted with each other.”
Khan said she thinks GUSA has struggled to accurately represent the student population in the past.
“In past years, GUSA was not successful in connecting with different communities on campus,” Khan said. “We are supposed to be the voice of the student body. I don’t think GUSA cared enough to represent those voices. That’s why Chris and I ran, because we recognized that representation matters.”
Matt Gregory (SFS ’17), who ran the Wisemiller’s Hot Chick and Chicken Madness campaign against Khan and Fisk in 2016, said he ran the campaign to underscore the difference in perspectives between the student body and GUSA. The write-in ticket came second in the election, with 725 total votes in the first round and 878 votes in the final round.
“It’s very evident that GUSA does not represent the viewpoints of the vast majority of the Georgetown population,” Gregory said. “GUSA is something that the vast majority of students do not care about at all.”
Gregory said he is not optimistic that the insular nature of GUSA will change any time soon.
“GUSA has made attempts to reach out to a broader base, but I don’t think it has necessarily succeeded,” Gregory said. “Because GUSA keeps hearing the same voices and same ideas, they advance what they believe to be best, but not what the actual student body believes to be best.”
According to Khan, this representation gap is due in part to a lack of opportunities beyond key elected positions.
“When you have elected positions, the issue is certain communities don’t run or they may run and not necessarily win. For example, that happens with women,” Khan said. “If you didn’t win, I think clearly your viewpoint isn’t being represented in GUSA.”
Moving Toward Diversity
Looking back on their team so far, Khan said she and Fisk have tried to create a more diverse GUSA by increasing the ways to get involved.
“We really pushed to our cabinet members to bear in mind intersectionality,” Khan said. “In terms of the executive and policy teams, it’s definitely the most representative that I’ve seen. We tried to recruit people from outside communities and build coalitions.”
According to Khan, a representative student government is vital to address the needs of Georgetown’s diverse student population.
“When you have vulnerable populations on campus, the nature of the work we should be focusing on is different,” Khan said. “I hope the student body elects moving-forward people who care about more than just one demographic on campus.”
Luther said that while efforts made to create a more representative GUSA are commendable, it is not a change that can happen overnight and is instead dependent on the people who choose to get involved.
“No organization will ever exactly reflect the student in its make up or opinion, but, in my time at GUSA, one of our top priorities was engaging with students and especially with groups that had been traditionally turned off by GUSA,” Luther wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Some administrators are more keen to work with students and have students help guide policy. Others are not.”

Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar manipulated the Colombian people as he made billions of dollars from the cocaine trade, according to a Feb. 10 talk featuring Javier Peña and Steve Murphy, the two Drug Enforcement Administration agents featured in the Netflix series “Narcos” for their role in capturing Escobar.
The two retired officers featured as keynote speakers for the Drug Trafficking in Latin America: A Case Study on Colombia and Mexico conference in Gaston Hall, organized by the Latin American Student Association, Georgetown University Mexican Student Association and Por Colombia, which advocates solutions to create a stronger Colombia.
Peña sought to eliminate the myth that Escobar was driven to help the poor in Colombian society. According to Peña, Escobar manipulated the Colombian people.
“He was considered a Robin Hood in Medellín. He gave a lot of money to the poor and donated money to churches and hospitals,” Peña said. “But, Pablo was a manipulator, he used all these tactics and campaigns to provide a positive image. Pablo Escobar is the inventor of ‘narco-terrorism.’ He is responsible for the deaths of 10 to 15,000 innocent people.”
Peña said Escobar’s ability to manipulate local Colombians allowed him to maintain power.
“Pablo had great leadership skills. He would get 300 to 500 young kids from the poorest neighborhoods in Colombia and give them money and affection. In turn, these kids would all kill for Pablo,” Peña said.
Escobar not only had a significant impact on Medellín, but also on the international drug trade, according to Peña.
“One kilo of cocaine was $1,000 in the mid-’80sand to transport it was about $5,000,” Peña said. “That kilo of cocaine in Miami in those days was going for about $80,000; in Europe it was going for $100,000 and these guys were selling 2,500 kilos of cocaine on a daily basis. Money was coming into Colombia by the millions of dollars on a daily basis.”
Escobar was ranked as the seventh-richest man in the world, with an estimated wealth of anywhere from $8 to $30 billion. Murphy further exemplified Escobar’s wealth and the methods he took to reach such a level.
“How was this possible? Through capitalizing on the desperation of other people,” Murphy said.
Exclusive pictures and videos of their time in Colombia accompanied the presentation by the two retired DEA agents, including how cocaine used to be smuggled through borders.
“They would take grapefruits, scoop the pulp out, place balls of powder cocaine back in, glue the grapefruit back together and put it back in the sack, and it would work,” Murphy said. “There is only one thing that limits you when you are smuggling drugs and that is your imagination.”
Murphy and Peña concluded their talk with a video showing the day Escobar was caught and killed by Colombian national police in Medellín, Colombia on Dec. 2, 1993.
According to Murphy, “Narcos” failed to accurately portray Escobar’s capture.
“We’re not the real heroes of this story,” Murphy said. “I wasn’t there regardless of what you see in “Narcos.” That was a straight up Colombian national police operation, nobody else. They are the true heroes of that operation that day.”

Jenny Franke (COL ’18) and Jack McGuire (COL ’18) entered the Georgetown University Student Association executive election race late Saturday evening, after collecting the required 100 signatures within 72 hours of the Wednesday campaign kickoff.
Franke and McGuire are the only ticket that joined the race within the 72-hour petitioning period.
The pair join Garet Williams (COL ’18) and Habon Ali (SFS ’18), Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Jessica Andino (COL ’18) and John Matthews (COL ’18) and Nick Matz (COL ’18) for this year’s executive election, to be held Feb. 23.
Franke and McGuire wrote in a statement to The Hoya that they are excited to enter the race as GUSA outsiders.
“We have had our eyes on this since freshman year,” the statement reads.
Franke and McGuire will be running on a platform of inclusivity, transparency, accountability and change, according to their campaign’s Facebook page.
GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said the newly introduced petitioning period was a success.
“The petitioning period worked well this year,” Willard wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think it gave candidates the extra chance to decide if they wanted to run. The very fact of getting petition signatures probably helped generate some excitement too.”
The GUSA vice presidential debate will take place Wednesday, before the presidential debate takes place Monday. This year’s debates will feature direct questions from the audience, rather than via Twitter.

Airbnb is fighting proposed legislation to restrict home-sharing in Washington, D.C., that was introduced Jan. 31 to help combat the lack of affordable housing in the District.
The bill, if approved, would require hosts to obtain a new category of business licenses and cap the number of nights they can rent out their properties without being present at 15.
Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5) proposed legislation designed to restrict home-sharing companies like Airbnb in the hope of ending “illegal hotels” in Washington, D.C.
If the bill is passed, both noncompliant hosts and business platforms will be fined. Half the fine would be allocated to the District’s Housing Production Trust Fund in order to finance affordable-housing projects. The vote to pass the bill is anticipated to take place within the next two months.
McDuffie’s Communications Director Nolan Treadway said the home-sharing business should be regulated.
“We want to create a process so that people can easily enter this market but do so legally,” Treadway said.
Valerie Ervin, the senior adviser to the Working Families Party, a minor progressive political party, said one of the key motivations for implementing regulation is to help end D.C.’s housing crisis.
“It’s about just enforcing the current regulations and beefing them up and making sure that people who are doing this are following the rule of law,” Ervin said.
Ervin said her group exposed what she called an “illegal hotel.”
After an entire apartment building in Columbia Heights was taken off the market, Ervin said she investigated by renting a room for three nights. She discovered that all the apartments had been repurposed for short-term rental. By the end of her stay, she owed almost $1200.
“The sad truth about the sting is that the amount of money that I paid for three nights is what a lot of families pay for rent for a whole month, especially in that neighborhood,” Ervin said.
According to Ervin, thousands of units that could be used for affordable housing are rented out instead.
Ervin said another practice that inspired the legislation is the renting of “party houses,” or when residential spaces are rented out as venues. These can create several safety concerns including unknown members entering neighborhood communities and dangerous conditions in case of fire. The proposed bill aims to improve safety with more regulation.
Airbnb Press Secretary Crystal Davis said the company takes issue with the legislation, as its proposed restrictions on short-term rental hosting may affect more than just the targeted operators.
“The primary reasons why our hosts are using the platform are to pay their bills, to pay their mortgage, to support their families,” Davis said.
In a statement, Airbnb said the company believes the 15-night cap is too restrictive, though Treadway said the number was generated based on the average number of a worker’s vacation days.
“This current proposal is unworkable and a clear nod to hotel-industry funded organizations eager to attack regular families sharing their homes to protect the industry’s bottom line,” the Airbnb statement reads.
Airbnb reported that on average, its hosts in the District have lived in the city for 13 years and over 75 percent of them rent out their primary residences. Since 2015, Airbnb said it has helped raise $12 million in taxes for the District.
Ervin said the new law would improve the city’s ability to collect taxes and regulate businesses like Airbnb.
“What this bill actually does is just enforces the law, and it makes sure that there is a tracking mechanism put in place so that the city knows who is leasing short term,” Ervin said. “It makes the enforcement important because right now, the District doesn’t even know if they’re getting paid the taxes that are owed to them by these short-term rentals.”
Airbnb has encountered similar experiences in the past. Recently, Arlington County amended its short-term rental regulations. Arlington’s regulations are much more lax than those in McDuffie’s bill. The county has a 185-day rental cap as opposed to D.C.’s 15.
Davis said the company is concerned with the lack of specificity in the legal language of the proposed bill.
“Most of the information that they’ve been providing has been purely anecdotal, and other than like one example, we don’t see the level of heightened concern that they have.” Davis said. “For us, we need them to accurately define what they mean.”
Students have expressed concern that the bill will limit the affordability of alternative housing for their families.
Aoife Croucher (SFS ’19) said if she and her family did not use Airbnb to rent an apartment before she moved into her freshman dorm, she would have likely stayed in a hotel.
“My initial reaction is it seems a little restrictive,” Croucher said. “It is definitely worthwhile to target people who take entire hotels and rent them out using Airbnb because that’s draining the housing supply.”
Gabriela Tew (COL ’20) said Airbnb offers more realistic and affordable options than hotels do.
“For Easter Break, my parents are coming up to Washington, D.C., to visit me,” Tew said. “We found that an Airbnb was less expensive than a hotel and more comfortable.”

More than a year after the university closed Kehoe Field over safety concerns, university officials have not decided on a replacement plan, and it remains unclear when a new field will be built.
The field was closed entirely in February 2016 after club sports teams and university officials raised concerns over safety.
Structural problems have plagued Kehoe Field since its construction in 1942 and then reconstruction on the roof of Yates Field House in 1979. The field was first repaired in 1987 at a cost of $1.8 million before being repaired again in 2002 for $7 million.
The problems with the field stem from the concrete roof, which does not properly drain rainwater. Over time, the lightweight concrete roof deteriorated from pooling water, leading to unsafe field conditions.
Prior to the field’s closing, club athletes had complained about uneven playing surfaces, exposed concrete and large sections of torn-up artificial turf.
At a board of directors meeting Thursday, university officials expressed their commitment to replacing Kehoe but presented no new substantive details on a plan, according to Women’s Ultimate Frisbee Club captain Michelle Carey (NHS ’17).
According to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, university officials continue to study possible solutions.
“We have completed a feasibility study, and are currently working through financial planning to determine the best option to move forward,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We understand the importance to this project to students and to our campus community.”
Several club sports team leaders, including current Advisory Board for Club Sports Chair Daniel Fain (COL ’18), plan to invite club athletes and others to a joint practice on Copley Lawn on Thursday afternoon to call for more field space on campus. The event, “Play to Fix Kehoe,” is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m.
Georgetown Running Club Vice President Jimmy McGrath (COL ’17), who chaired the Advisory Board for Club Sports at the time of Kehoe’s closing, said the university did not initially know what to do with Kehoe after closing. However, McGrath said university officials seemed to conclude later in the semester that repairing the field in the short term was unrealistic.
“As the semester progressed, they basically came to the conclusion that a short-term solution for fixing it was not really financially viable, and they were just going to wait and leave it closed until the larger campus plan would include a bigger shift in changing Kehoe and Yates itself,” McGrath said.
Since the field’s closing, club sports teams have struggled to secure replacement fields to hold practice. Kehoe had previously been the main field for club sports teams, which now have to share Cooper Field with varsity and intramural sports teams.
Men’s Ultimate Frisbee Club captain Perry Cao (SFS ’17) said the options for sports teams are less than ideal. When Cooper Field is not available, club teams are able to use off-campus fields at Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School and the Duke Ellington School of the Arts. According to Cao, this solution came with its own problems.
“It was an imperfect solution, because there are no lights on any of those fields, so we were very limited in terms of practice time. The only time slot we could get was 5 p.m. to dark, and some of the weeks where we were off Cooper, 5:30 to dark was like 5:30 to 5:45.”
According to Cao, the off-campus location and inconsistent practice times made it difficult for many of the athletes to attend. The captains struggled with recruitment and attendance at practices dwindled.
“My biggest frustration is with Georgetown for not planning for the closure of Kehoe, because they knew it was going to happen and they didn’t do anything about it, which is completely negligent,” Cao said. “Not ensuring that [club athletes] have space to practice and run their extracurriculars, I think that’s really negligent.”
As long as Kehoe remains shuttered, according to Cao, Georgetown club sports teams’ frustrations are unlikely to subside.
“All of club sports is really, really furious about it, just because Georgetown has so little field space,” Cao said. “Without Kehoe to practice on, our options are incredibly limited.”

Georgetown is planning to launch a new six-credit, year-long class this fall that allows students to create their own projects to help improve the surrounding D.C. community.
The class, “Urban Studio,” is being led by professors in the English, sociology and anthropology departments. Students will work with professors, community organizers and fellow students to complete their projects.
The class has been developed with Designing the Future(s), a university initiative to design new education initiatives.
The professors leading the project hope that the initiative will not only teach students valuable research, planning and observational skills, but will also connect the students and the university to the surrounding city on a deeper level.
English professor Sherry Linkon, one of the founding professors of the “Urban Studio,” said the course is an opportunity for students of various disciplines to work together on a project to help improve the community.
“Studio-based courses are courses that are built around hands-on projects that students do. They are often of their own design with the idea that students learn by doing the project in a setting where they’re talking with other students, where they’re talking with faculty — both the faculty in the studio and other faculty around campus,” Linkon said.
Linkon said the community involvement and work that this project would entail could help students prepare for a future in working in local government, nonprofit organizations and public policy.
“It will help them develop skills and experience that could enable them to continue doing community work when they leave Georgetown, and to help students prepare for working in local government and nonprofit organizations and public policy and community arts kinds of things because they get that experience,” Linkon said.
The course originated from student requests for more opportunities for community involvement, as well as the popularity of urban studies classes at Georgetown and Georgetown’s lack of an official urban studies department. Several of Georgetown’s peer institutions, including Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania, have urban studies departments and majors.
Sociology professor Brian McCabe, one of the professors involved in the creation of the “Urban Studio,” said the development of the Urban Studio is a step toward expanding urban studies at Georgetown.
“The ‘Urban Studio’ course came from faculty members recognizing the desire among students. The urban studies classes that professor Linkon teaches, that I teach, they’re always full. There are tons of students who are interested in the city as a site of study. It came out of student demand recognized by the faculty, and then the faculty working to creatively come up with a way that we could address that demand.”
Anthropology professor Laurie King, who is also involved in the “Urban Studio,” said the urban studies program will allow students to learn about a wide range of topics.
“It would be bringing people in from the community onto campus to help students learn, and the students going out into the community and continuing to work with those people and form new networks through them, and to learn more about the city, learn more about themselves and learn more about their skills and capacities,” King said.
McCabe said the course is unique among Georgetown courses because of its collaborative nature.
“The real world is collaborative,” McCabe said. “When you go out and get a job and you work in an office you collaborate with other people. At the moment our classes aren’t always set up like that. The studio encourages deep, meaningful collaboration.”
