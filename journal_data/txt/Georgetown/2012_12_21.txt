Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) will join the Georgetown Public Policy Institute as a visiting distinguished professor of public policy in spring and fall 2013.
He will also give the 2013 Whittington Lecture, an annual lecture on public policy created to honor former GPPI associate dean Leslie Whittington, who died in 2001.
Lugar, who will have represented Indiana in Congress for 36 years when his term ends this January, serves as the Republican leader of the Foreign Relations Committee and is a former chair of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee.
“Given Sen. Lugar’s distinguished career in public service and his breadth of experience, we are honored to have him join us in 2013,” GPPI dean Edward Montgomery wrote in a press release. “Our faculty and students will benefit greatly from Sen. Lugar’s expertise in a wide array of policy areas.”
Lugar expressed excitement to join Georgetown next semester.
“I am looking forward to devoting deeper attention to a number of issues that have been a part of my Senate service and working with students and future leaders on how we can solve the world’s most complex problems,” Lugar wrote in a press release. “Working with Georgetown University and cooperating with other institutions, I know I can make a difference.”
