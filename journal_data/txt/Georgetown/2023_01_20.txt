The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) relaunched its website Jan. 1, aiming to improve communication between GUSA and the Georgetown University student body.
The website has not been functional after the previous GUSA administration chose to shift its informational resources to CampusGroups, a campus engagement platform. The website aims to allow students to engage more effectively with student government and access resources provided by GUSA and the university. 
GUSA President Camber Vincent (SFS ’24) said a functional website will provide student government with an effective and necessary method for communication with students.
“The website offers our best chance at easy engagement with the student body, providing a one-stop site for everything they might need — improving the efficacy, reliability, and speed of communication both ways,” Vincent wrote to The Hoya.
First-year Senator Meriam Ahmad (CAS ’26) said a website that showcases GUSA’s accomplishments and ongoing projects will hopefully increase student awareness of the senate’s activities.
“I’m hoping that, by highlighting GUSA’s past, ongoing, and future work, Georgetown students can stay updated on what GUSA’s doing and how to get involved,” Ahmad wrote to The Hoya. “For that reason primarily, it is necessary for GUSA to have a working website.”
GUSA Vice President Alyssa Hirai (SFS ’24) said that though GUSA has repurchased the website’s domain space, GUSA has a long way to go with redesigning the website. GUSA needs to solve the website’s outdated interface, according to Hirai. 
“A major issue with the GUSA website was that our account had been deactivated due to an error and the website became dysfunctional as a result,” Hirai said. “However, we repurchased the website and we will be continuing to redesign it into a platform students can more easily access and interact with.” 
Vincent said he anticipates that the website will be clean of old information by the end of January and closer to fully functional by February.
“The primary issue with the website is that due to some University error the previous administration deactivated our account,” Vincent wrote. “As a result the website has become very outdated. A lot of resources and links do not work, and generally it has fallen into a state of disrepair.”
Potential resources for the website include a project called “Hoya House Hunters,” a website run by Georgetown graduates that helps students find off-campus housing and an engagement form to allow students to provide GUSA feedback, according to Vincent.
“We are working with some previous alums who ran a Hoya House Hunters project website to reintegrate it into our capabilities as a great resource for students looking for off-campus housing,” Vincent wrote. “We also hope to have an ongoing engagement form open with opportunities to sign up to get involved, to offer up ideas, complain about problems, or level criticisms.” 
Georgetown student Kate Arkin (CAS ’26) said that a functional website may improve the perception of GUSA in the student body.
“Having a functional website is critical for GUSA because it will enable GUSA’s constituents to gain a better understanding of what GUSA does and to better reach their representatives,” Arkin wrote to The Hoya. “This in turn may help to heal GUSA’s reputation as a nonfunctional body.”
Vincent said the new website should facilitate an open dialogue between senators and students.
“Ultimately, we’d like it to be a combination of both information and communication,” Vincent wrote.
Vincent, GUSA Chief of Staff Aidan Ng (SFS ’25) and GUSA IT Director Tyler Clough (MSB ’24) currently run the website, and will work in partnership with GUSA’s full communications and leadership teams as the website’s administrators once the website is fully set up, according to Vincent. 
Hirai said the new website will make staying informed of GUSA-related developments more accessible to the greater Georgetown student body.
“Creating a functional GUSA website is an important step to improve communication, increase transparency, and provide students with the resources they need,” Hirai wrote to The Hoya. 
Ahmad said an operational GUSA website is necessary if GUSA is to properly represent student interests.
“Ultimately, GUSA’s only purpose is to advocate on behalf of Georgetown students, so the input and involvement of the student body in the work of GUSA are essential for successful advocacy,” Ahmad wrote. 
Vincent said he hopes the website will facilitate GUSA’s ability to meet students’ needs and increase community involvement with the organization.
“A student government cannot function without having sustained, meaningful engagement with its student body,” Vincent said. “In the past, the website has served as one of the best pieces of infrastructure for meeting that capacity, so it is an important piece of the tasks to undertake in our new administration to meet our campaign promises of increasing communication and transparency.”

A new Employee Resource Group (ERG) for LGBTQ+ staff at Georgetown University held an inaugural meet and greet for potential members over breakfast Jan. 18.
The Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity & Affirmative Action (IDEAA) officially recognized the resource group in October 2022, according to Evan Fossen, the director of events and brand experience at the McDonough School of Business.
The event organizers aimed to introduce the ERG to members of the campus community in an informal environment, said Dash Kees, a senior developer at University Information Services and one of the event organizers.
“We are still growing and trying to make sure that we are reaching to LGBTQ staff and faculty on campus,” Kees wrote to The Hoya. “This event was just a way to bring folks together at the start of the semester, the start of the year, and the start of the ERG itself.”
Fossen said around 30 people attended the event that was available both in person and virtually.
While Georgetown provides several resources for LGBTQ+ students, the new resource group is a milestone for support offered specifically for employees, according to Fossen.
“As far as I’m aware, this is the first LGBTQ+ group specifically focused on employees,” Fossen said.
Rosemary Kilkenny (LAW ’87), vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion, said ERGs are managed fully through IDEAA and human resources to facilitate staff well-being, and the LGBTQ+ group is the newest one.
“We recognize and are grateful that many faculty and staff have long been involved in community-building, mutual support and common service to the university, and we are glad to formally support these efforts through the ERG program,” Kilkenny wrote to The Hoya. 
ERGs are an integral step to creating an inclusive work environment that encourages employees of all backgrounds to do their best work, according to Kilkenny.
“We view ERG’s as a welcome institutional partner as we seek to continue to strengthen the diversity of our workforce and ensure that all members of our community feel welcome and supported,” Kilkenny wrote. 
Kees said they met with a small group of LGBTQ+ employees a few times before campus life became virtual in March 2020. Kees and several colleagues decided to pursue the opportunity later when IDEAA launched the employee resource group program.
ERGs seeking official recognition from the university must have a designated leader, at least five members and a mission that is consistent with university values, according to the IDEAA website. 
Kees, Fossen and the other founding members of the ERG met regularly last summer to discuss the group’s values and draft their charter before submitting it to human resources in the fall, according to Fossen.
“A lot of the conversation was centered around making sure that the group was primarily focused on community building, connecting the LGBTQ+ employees and their allies on campus — to give them a space to network with each other, support each other and just find that sense of community at Georgetown,” Fossen said. “That was kind of the primary driving force.”
Kees said they hope the LGBTQ+ group will interact with other ERGs at Georgetown in the future, particularly to support members who belong to more than one resource group.
“We’re hoping to build an inclusive and affirming environment for LGBTQ+ employees and allies at Georgetown,” Kees said. “But we’re truly hoping that we can be a place where members can come together to build connections and to stand in solidarity with members of other ERGs since we know that the identities represented within our groups are intersectional.”
According to documents obtained by The Hoya, the group’s charter indicates four key elements of its mission: to build a culture of inclusion, to offer employee activities that align with the university’s mission, to provide professional development opportunities and to offer unique solutions to decision-makers within the university.
Fossen said he hopes to eventually expand the reach of the resource group as a way to promote important discussions and bring visibility to LGBTQ+ resources on campus.
“We’re also at some point in the future planning on trying to post campus-wide events where we can bring in someone to talk about a queer issue and have those conversations on queer topics on campus for the broader Georgetown community,” Fossen said.
Kees said they also envision the resource group growing and adapting in the future.
“The last thing I want is for us to become just another committee for people to join,” Kees said. “I hope the ERG becomes something vibrant within the Georgetown community.”

Following months of student advocacy, Georgetown University students, faculty and staff now have free access to The New York Times (NYT) and The Washington Post. 
Lauinger Library staff and the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) collaborated to secure the free subscriptions, which began Jan. 1. The subscriptions provide access to all current stories on the NYT and Washington Post websites, as well as to five articles a day from the NYT archives and all Washington Post stories published online in the last 15 years.
The announcement comes ahead of GUSA’s intended timeline, which aimed to start providing the subscriptions in Fall 2023. The initiative gained momentum last fall, as GUSA began working more closely with Lauinger staff to negotiate alleviating the costs of student subscriptions. 
Amelia Frisbie (MSB ’26) said the new subscription will be helpful in her courses and outside of class. 
“I’m excited by the news that Georgetown is granting students access to the NYT and Washington Post,” Frisbie wrote to The Hoya. “These resources are helpful tools for students to employ when researching for classes, staying informed on current events, and reading leisurely.”
GUSA President Camber Vincent (SFS ’24) said GUSA’s goal for the subscriptions was to give students the ability to read more articles, especially ones necessary for class assignments which would typically be inaccessible.
“Our rationale for the program was to increase student readership in general and provide access to articles relevant to classes or sometimes those assigned by professors that were locked behind paywalls,” Vincent wrote to The Hoya. “This is a great program for our students for the next 6 years and we’re excited to watch the roll-out.”
Jacob Sowers (CAS ’23) said the new initiative gives students access to news outlets that they otherwise would not purchase individually. 
“Although outlets like the Washington Post and the New York Times do have student discounts, many students that I know of, including myself, do not want to spend the money for a yearly subscription if they are just going to be reading an article or two per month,” Sowers wrote to The Hoya. “With this new change, students will be able to use these media sources without worrying about the paywall.”
Harriette Hammasi, the dean of Lauinger Library, said the online subscriptions will be more accessible to students who wish to use them.   
“In a globally focused institution like Georgetown, staying up-to-date on current events is essential for students, staff, and faculty, both to work in their specific fields and to be informed citizens more generally,” Hemmasi wrote to The Hoya. “While these papers were and are available at the Library through print subscriptions, databases, and news aggregators, direct web access will make it much easier and more convenient for Hoyas to read the stories they’re interested in.”
Emma Vonder Haar (CAS ’26) said she appreciates that the university chose to provide access to two papers that are already popular among many students.
“I think it makes a lot of sense as these are two of the most predominant newspapers that are especially relevant to what we do as students,” Vonder Haar wrote to The Hoya. “Being in DC, access to The Washington Post is certainly significant and helpful.”
Dylan Shapiro (COL ’26) said the two newspapers will provide news to students through a more balanced lens.
“Since they’re print outlets, both have a long history of being consistently reliable, and you also have the option of more right-leaning editorials (WashPo) or more left-leaning ones (NYT),” Shapiro wrote to The Hoya. “By giving students a wide variety of choices for where to get their news, it becomes way easier to stay informed.”
Vincent said he hopes GUSA can renew the program in future years and continue to offer free access to additional publications in the future. 
“We hope to continue to work on expanding the program to more publications for the student 
body as time goes on and guarantee an extension on contract when it lapses,” Vincent said.
Sowers, a senior in Georgetown’s journalism minor program, said he’s hopeful the initiative will promote student interest in credible news outlets. 
“I think this new policy is a fantastic opportunity to connect Georgetown students with quality and dependable journalism,” Sowers wrote.

Disability Rights International (DRI), an organization dedicated to ensuring that people with disabilities can fully participate in society, discussed the current plight Ukrainian children with disabilities are facing in the ongoing war with Russia at a Georgetown University event. 
The Jan. 12 event was hosted by Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of International Migration, a center in the Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS) that conducts research on refugee law and immigration. There, DRI Founder and Executive Director Eric Rosenthal (LAW ’92, H ’16) was joined by Quill Kukla, director of the disability studies program, who delivered the closing remarks at the event. 
When Russian President Vladimir Putin began Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, families began fleeing the country to seek refuge in Eastern European countries like Poland and Hungary.
However, many individuals with disabilities had to risk staying behind in Ukraine, according to Rosenthal.
“The people who can’t move, the people for whom accessibility issues prevent them from moving, the kids with the greatest needs were the ones left behind,” Rosenthal said at the event. 
Rosenthal said many families who could not afford to bring their child with disabilities when they fled left their children in institutions in western Ukraine. 
“They dumped the kids from eastern Ukraine into the facilities in western Ukraine,” Rosenthal said. “These were already bad places with segregation and neglect, and then you double the number of kids in these facilities, and you have a terrible, terrible situation.”
At the event, Rosenthal played a video showcasing the conditions of the Vilshany Orphanage, a facility housing over 200 children with physical and intellectual disabilities. In it, several children were lying in beds without medical care, and one child with cerebral palsy was bound to a chair and calling for his family members, who abandoned him while fleeing to Germany. 
Rosenthal met the director of the orphanage years ago, telling the audience that kids should not be placed in those kinds of institutions. 
According to Rosenthal, the war may even be encouraging people to donate to facilities that segregate individuals with disabilities. 
“When Americans and international groups want to go to Ukraine, they’re going to be dealing with people like this director, who are saying ‘isn’t it terrible that it’s so hard to get money to modernize my orphanage?’” Rosenthal said. “That’s the risk. The war is going to be an occasion for more money being put into already bad segregated facilities.”
Rosenthal said international aid can provide a false impression that facility conditions are good. 
One Ukrainian institution receiving aid from an international disability and humanitarian group for physical therapy and massage is still treating children poorly and inhumanely, according to Rosenthal. 
“In the same building, children were lying on the floor, rocking back and forth,” Rosenthal said. “Kids were in the grass outside, eating grass and dirt.”
Rosenthal said that during wartime, people have historically been more concerned with the abuse of political dissidents in psychiatric hospitals rather than people with disabilities who are housed in the same institutions. 
“Given the history of the political abuse of psychiatry in the former Soviet Union, everyone was concerned when political dissidents were put in psychiatric hospitals, but no one was really concerned when people with disabilities were put in psychiatric hospitals, or people who actually needed some form of support were segregated from society,” Rosenthal said.
Moving forward, DRI will be meeting with the United States Agency for International Development in late January to discuss the possibility of providing government aid for disabled children in Ukraine, according to Rosenthal.
“The war has been going on for a year, and we have not been successful yet,” Rosenthal said. “There needs to be a focus on the basic protection of human rights of these children. It needs to be built into our foreign assistance efforts. It needs to be done urgently, and it needs to be done now.”

A Georgetown University professor published the second issue of a research journal on the philosophical study of disability in November exploring the diverse meanings of disability in society.
Professor Joel Michael Reynolds founded the “Journal of Philosophy of Disability” (JPD) in 2021 to bridge a gap in disability studies scholarship and provide a forum for the philosophical discussion of new disability studies research. The second edition of the journal explores different definitions of disability, the role of lived experience with disability in research and the philosophy of disability as a field of study. 
Reynolds said his journal provides a space for disability scholars to share their research, something that has not always existed despite the expansion of scholarship that has emerged in the field in recent years. 
“Disability is central to life, and it is long overdue for those working in academic philosophy to take its study more seriously,” Reynolds wrote to The Hoya. “While philosophical work has been done on disability since the 90s, there has never been a dedicated outlet for scholars to develop their research on its own terms and to engage with others who share similar approaches and expertise.”
Sabrina Leeds (GRD ’25), managing editor of the journal and third-year student pursuing a doctorate in philosophy, said the JPD aspires to define a clearer definition for the philosophy of disability as a field of study. 
“I hope that the JPD sparks conversations about what, exactly, philosophy of disability is and how it is distinct from, but always in conversation with, disabled philosophy, disability studies, philosophy of medicine, bioethics and phenomenology,” Leeds said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Leeds hopes clearer distinction between different subfields in disability studies will increase awareness about scholarship in each subfield.
“I think that clarifying the differences between these areas, examining what each of them can do for us and mapping out the contours of the ongoing conversations between them has the potential to provide us with novel conceptual tools that might be practically useful for the purpose of disability rights activism and the pursuit of intersectional liberatory projects,” Leeds said.
The second edition of JPD features pieces from Thomas Nadelhoffer, an associate professor of philosophy at the College of Charleston, and Quill Rebecca Kukla, a professor of philosophy at Georgetown and director of the university’s disability studies program. Their pieces focus on the impacts of exclusionary discourse surrounding disability and the meaning of disease, respectively. 
Reynolds and his co-editor Teresa Blankmeyer Burke, a professor of bioethics at Gallaudet University, actively seek to incorporate a wide range of academic traditions in the journal, according to Reynolds. 
“We welcome scholarship from all philosophical perspectives, including analytic, continental and pragmatist traditions, the history of philosophy, empirically informed philosophy, non-Western philosophy and other traditions as well as other fields that substantively engage research in philosophy of disability,” Reynolds wrote.
In addition to peer-reviewed research, the journal also publishes book reviews, critical responses, commentaries and occasional special issues, including one focusing on epistemic arrogance. In an effort to construct a more inclusive scholastic environment, Reynolds said the journal has no paywall and is open to the public. The university funded a Creative Commons license for the journal that supports its free distribution, according to Reynolds. Reynolds says plans for future expansions are already in the works.
“More than one scholar has expressed to us that the existence of a journal devoted to philosophy was ‘long overdue’ and that they were ‘overjoyed’ it exists,” Reynolds said. “Submissions to and interest in the journal are very strong, and we may soon be in a position to shift to two issues per year.” 
Kukla said they are thankful Reynolds created a space for researchers to further explore the boundaries of disability studies.
“I have been writing and talking about philosophy of medicine and health for many years, and I am excited to finally bring this discussion to an audience that won’t unreflectively center normally abled bodies, and which is willing to think critically about concepts like disease, normalcy and well-being,” Kukla said.

Over 250 student-athletes attended the inaugural Georgetown Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) Summit to learn about opportunities to build their individual brand. 
The Jan. 12 event was hosted by the Georgetown University Department of Intercollegiate Athletics in partnership with InvescoQQQ, a boutique investment management firm at McDonough Arena. It featured panelists including Dev Sethi, head of sports at Meta, Rebecca Hamilton, the vice dean of the McDonough School of Business and other executives from Invesco, Altius Sports Partners and INFCLR, a content platform for elite athletics. Speakers provided their unique industry perspectives on NIL to students.
Prior to 2020, the NCAA did not give student-athletes the rights to their NIL, meaning no college athlete could create or sell their own merchandise.
Lee Reed, the director of intercollegiate athletics at Georgetown, said the athletics department wanted to organize the summit to help student-athletes navigate the relatively new concept of NIL ownership by individuals.
“NIL is an exciting new element within the landscape of intercollegiate athletics, and we are proud to provide our student-athletes with both professional partnerships and educational programming to assist in their growth,” Reed wrote to The Hoya. 
Organizers intended the summit to serve as a starting point for student-athletes, but actually securing NIL deals also depends on the self-initiative of student-athletes, according to Reed. 
“While it is up to the individual student-athlete to put in the work to succeed in an NIL world, we strive to support their efforts, enabling them to build their personal brands for the future,” Reed said.
Preston Murray (CAS ’24), a defensive back for the football team, said the NIL summit also advised students on how to differentiate branding to attract the interests of companies and how to manage their personal finances.
“I really learned that if you find your niche, whatever it is, or find something that makes you stand out, it’s really going to help you in terms of getting a NIL deal with whatever company it is,” Murray wrote to The Hoya. “I also learned that it’s important to be smart with your money as college students, especially athletes. People are known to be a little lackadaisical. I think the advice InvescoQQQ exec told us about was really helpful and I really appreciated it.”
Dan O’Neil, Georgetown’s deputy director of athletics for external affairs, said that in the push for more NIL accessibility, the athletics department also launched the Hoya Blueprint Exchange, a portal that helps connect student-athletes with business opportunities and NIL partnerships.
“Since the name, image and likeness legislation went into effect, we have been actively working to support our student-athletes who would like to take advantage of this opportunity,” O’Neil said. “The NIL Summit was one more opportunity to get in front of our student-athletes with the resources we offer, as well as welcoming speakers who offered industry best practices.”
Max Norton (MSB ’24), an offensive lineman on the football team, said student-athletes appreciate the support from the university administration.
“To me, it just means a lot that the school cares enough to put something on like this for us,” Norton said in a Twitter video shared with The Hoya. “It’s a great opportunity to learn more about the process and learn from the speakers about the business side of their interests and how they relate to ours and how we can all work together to build this thing and build the brand at Georgetown.”
Even if a student-athlete does not consider themselves to be the biggest name on the field or does not have the largest presence on social media, they still have the opportunity to secure NIL deals, according to O’Neil. 
“While some student-athletes are making large sums of money, there are many who can benefit from a local sponsorship,” O’Neil said. “When done correctly, NIL could range from thousands of dollars to a free lunch. It’s important that our student-athletes understand the full scope, the resources and the process.”
