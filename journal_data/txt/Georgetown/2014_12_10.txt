In response to recent events in Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island, N.Y., University President John J. DeGioia, Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson sent out campus-wide emails to express respect for freedom of expression and encourage discussion within the Georgetown community.
Protests erupted throughout the nation after the St. Louis grand jury’s Nov. 24 decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown and the Staten Island grand jury’s Dec. 3 decision not to indict a white New York police officer in the death by chokehold of unarmed black man Eric Garner.
“Recent events in our country have brought frustration and sadness, anger and despair, as grand juries in two different American cities have shined a bright light on the enduring fault line of our Republic — the persistent legacy of segregation, discrimination, inequality: of injustice. The fabric that we think of as America seems to be fraying,” DeGioia wrote in his email, which was sent Wednesday afternoon.
Over 200 Georgetown students have participated in protests in the past two weeks, including a Week of Action hosted by the Georgetown University Black Leadership Forum. The week, which included a walk-out, HIV screening, a letter writing campaign to Michael Brown’s family and communication with elected officials about police brutality. The week ended with a “die-in” during the annual Christmas tree lighting in Dahlgren Quad on Friday. Students chanted, “No justice, no peace,” “I can’t breathe” and “Black lives matter” before dispersing.
O’Brien and Olson said that they are proud of the community’s efforts to draw attention to injustice in the nation.
“As a Catholic and Jesuit University, we are a community that respects dialogue, affirms the dignity of every individual and respects the rights of freedom of expression and thought,” O’Brien and Olson wrote in an email sent Friday. “In this moment, we are proud of our students, for your mutual respect for each other and your commitment to improving our campus, our nation and the common good.”
DeGioia encouraged students to continue to participate in dialogue about the recent events after they return from winter break.
“Let us use the time during this coming holy season to reflect on the experiences of these past months and to consider again the responsibilities of citizenship—the bonds we share with one another,” DeGioia wrote. “And when we return, let us commit ourselves to continuing these conversations and dialogue and engage in the work of restoring the faith and trust necessary for realizing our promise as a people.”

From T.S. Eliot, a fitting epitaph for the ignorant, infantile and reckless protests of Ferguson et al: “We are the hollow me, headpiece filled with straw.” Happy now?

LEST THE MADNESS BE REIGNITED
FROM THE WASHINGTON POST TODAY, DEC. 3O:
“City officials in Berkeley, Mo. said on Tuesday that several witnesses have told police that 18-year-old Antonio Martin drew a gun and pointed it at an officer before he was shot and killed by that officer last week and provided new details about the encounter meant to undermine vocal protesters who have raised pointed questions about the shooting.”

Around 40 medical students from Georgetown University School of Medicine participated in a protest outside the hospital today as part of a nationwide medical student movement called White Coat Die-In Day.
The gathering, organized by first year medical students Jane Yoon and Michael Pappas along with other medical students in an anatomy lab yesterday, protested racial injustice following the recent non-indictments and accusations of police brutality in the cases of Michael Brown and Eric Garner and attempted to raise awareness about racial disparities in the health care system. The protest was part of a nationwide movement that began at the University of California in San Francisco and included over 70 medical schools.
“As medical students, we see the way that black and brown individuals are disproportionately affected by different illnesses, the wealth and income gap, the education gap,” Pappas said. “And we thought as medical students – there was this national movement already going on, around 70 medical schools were doing it – it should be something that we should be a part of and support.”
The protest included a minute of silence to remember those who lost their life due to police brutality or racial attacks and a die-in along the sidewalk outside the Pasquella building entrance of the hospital. The die-in lasted for four minutes and 30 seconds, representing the four hours and thirty minutes Brown lay on the sidewalk after being shot by Officer Wilson on Aug. 9, 2014.

Pappas stressed the importance of the protest coming from medical students to raise awareness to racial injustices in the health system, in addition to the criminal justice system.
“Specifically we’re here as a medical school and a medical community,” Pappas said. “We’re here to recognize that we work inside a system that’s structurally designed to create a lot of these health disparities that we constantly see.”
“We just wanted to express to the public that as future doctors, we are dedicated to closing the gap, the disparity in health care across different races that they face right now,” Yoon added after the protest.
Pappas also drew attention to the university’s Jesuit identity as fueling the movement.
“We’re here at Georgetown, at a Jesuit university, and we’re supposed to be men and women for others. Being men and women for others, these are things that we should all be concerned about,” he said.
The die-in was chosen by the students for both practical and symbolic reasons.
“On a practical level, people look at a bunch of people lying on the ground in white coats, and they think, what the heck is going on?” Pappas said after the protest. “That’s the point of this: to get people thinking about why. And then the symbolism between how long Michael Brown’s body was left on the ground, the idea of rising back up to address racial inequality in our society, there’s a lot of symbolism that goes along with the die-in.”
The protest comes amid a series of student movements responding to the Ferguson ruling and the Garner case, with undergraduate students conducting their own die-in at the Christmas tree lighting in Dahlgren Quad last Saturday night and students at the law center filing an open letter to criticize the center’s silence on the grand jury decisions. The medical students explained that the protests were all in response to a single societal problem, using the slogan “#BlackLivesMatter” as part of their protest to link the cases together.

In the latest iteration of a long-running tradition, the clock hands of Healy Tower went missing in the early hours of this morning, as the final examination period dawned. The university has confirmed a theft.
“While we are making repairs to the clock system this was not us,” Vice President for Facilities and Management Robin Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “[The Georgetown University Police Department] has initiated an investigation and we are assessing if there was any damage.”
WGTB was the first to report the absence of the hands on social media, posting a tweet, accompanied by a picture, at 4:01 a.m.
“I was working late on Walsh 2 when I got a text … [that] the clock hands might be missing, but there were no pictures yet,” WGTB General Manager Megan Schmidt (COL ’15), a cartoonist for The Hoya, wrote in an email. “WGTB was the first to tweet out the last time the clock hands went missing, so I had a legacy to uphold. I ran to Healy Circle and was already pretty delirious from lack of sleep and high caffeine levels and I kind of just remember laughing like a crazy person and then almost having an asthma attack.”

The clocks hands were last stolen on April 30, 2012, and replaced on May 8. The estimated repair cost to the clock and surrounding area was $9,000. Tradition dictates that the thieves send the clock hands to the Vatican for the pope’s blessing, but there were no reports as to the hands’ eventual fate or the thieves’ identities.
In the 1960s, the hands were stolen so often that the university stopped replacing the hands. In recent years, however, the university has cracked down on the theft, meting out one year of academic probation and 75 and 100 hours of community service, respectively, to Andrew Hamblen (SFS ’07) and Wyatt Gjullin (COL ’09), who stole the hands in 2005, and confessed. The estimated damage from that incident totalled $25,000.
Today, though, the university capitalized on the heist, sharing pictures on Instagram and Facebook.
“#TimelessTradition,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said in an initial statement to The Hoya, reflecting the captions on social media.
Pugh did not comment specifically as to the whether the university had changed its stance on the theft, but did later confirm that there is an ongoing investigation as to who removed the hands.
At 4:19 a.m., there was a darkened police vehicle stationed at the front gates, as well as an SUV in Healy Circle, but no security personnel were evident.
“We are still investigating the theft at this time. Anyone with information should contact us at 202-687-4343, through the GUPD Anonymous Tip Form or through the LiveSafe App,” GUPD Chief Jay Gruber wrote in an email.
Although various social media postings enjoyed wide popularity among students and alumni, Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., expressed disapproval.
“I’m not a fan of traditions that are secretive and exclusive, and that disrupt the lives of our facilities personnel,” Steck wrote in an email.
Schmidt, however, said that while WGTB should be ruled out as suspects, the timing of the heist provides some positives during finals season.
“I find this act to be very motivational,” she wrote. “I mean, hell, if someone can navigate and scale the clock tower, I think I can write a five-page paper by tomorrow at midnight.”

Tradition? says 
December 10, 2014 at 8:39 pm
I’m with Steck–there is no motivation to be found here–some idiot damaged the oldest building on campus and caused what will probably be a few thousand dollars worth of damage to steal the hands off a clock.  Furthermore, the PR department seemingly condoned the heist by tweeting a picture and creating a hashtag while DPS launched an investigation.  If that isn’t a statement about how disjointed the administration is, I don’t know what is.  Call me crazy, but it’s time to find a new “tradition.”

Lighten up a bit. It’s a university prank.

You're just plain wrong says 
December 11, 2015 at 10:40 am
“some idiot damaged the oldest building on campus”…
That’s just flat out wrong. Remembrance/McSherry (1792), Freedom Hall/Mulledy (1833), Old North (1795), The Observatory (1844), Gervase (1848), and Maguire (1855) are all older than Healy (1879). 
Not that I disagree with you, but your claim loses credibility when it is flat out wrong.

The Congressional spending bill released yesterday night includes a provision to prevent the implementation of Initiative 71, which would legalize marijuana in the District.
“None of the funds contained in this Act may be used to enact any law, rule or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, Controlled Substances Act or any tetrahydrocannabinols derivative for recreational purposes,” reads the omnibus spending bill.
The provision, known as a “rider,” was inserted into the bill by Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) and, though it does not specifically mention the District, it does prohibit the usage of any federal or local funds to legalize marijuana. Congress authorizes D.C.’s budget.
“The fact is the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate oversight about what happens in the federal district,” Harris said to The Washington Post.
Initiative 71 passed with 69.4 percent support in the November election. The initiative permitted adults over the age of 21 to possess up to two ounces of marijuana, grow up to six marijuana plants and give freely one ounce of the substance to other adults. The language in the spending bill could also erase marijuana decriminalization, which occurred in D.C. in June following congressional authorization.
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), the District’s non-voting representative in Congress, promised to offer an amendment later today striking the rider. She also noted that the language in the spending bill did not necessarily prevent marijuana legalization.
“The omnibus rider does not block D.C. from ‘carrying out’ enacted marijuana policies. D.C.’s Initiative 71, it can be argued, was enacted when it was approved overwhelmingly by voters in November,” Norton said in a press release. “Therefore, it can be argued that the legalization of small amounts of marijuana can proceed.”
The potential interference of Congress in D.C. affairs drew virulent criticism from District officials and advocates.
“It is disheartening and frustrating to learn that once again the District of Columbia is being used as a political pawn by the Congress,” Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) said in a press release. “To undermine the vote of the people — taxpayers — does not foster or promote the ‘limited government’ stance House Republicans claim they stand for; it’s uninformed paternalistic meddling.”
Negotiations behind the scenes were ongoing until the last minute with rumors released yesterday that the Democratic and Republican leadership had reached a deal to permit legalization under Initiative 71 but to prevent the enactment of a sales-and-tax system in the future.
D.C. Cannabis Campaign Chairman Adam Eidinger, who submitted Initiative 71, said yesterday to The Hoya that protests were planned if legalization was blocked entirely.
“We’re calling for a protest [Wednesday] at the Department of Justice at 5 p.m.,” Eidinger said. “If the language actually overturns the initiative, we’ll have a huge protest, walking from there to the Capitol.”

“None of the funds contained in this Act may be used to enact any law, rule or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, Controlled Substances Act or any tetrahydrocannabinols derivative for recreational purposes,” reads the omnibus spending bill.
Technically, since marijuana was already legalized before passage of this bill, it may make weed legal and regulated in the district.
