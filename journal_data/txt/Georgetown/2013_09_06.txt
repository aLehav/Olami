Faith, spirituality and politics are popular food for thought and discussion on campus. But a select few have extended their contributions to these debates to a broader audience through The Washington Post’s “On Faith” blog.
The blog, which is managed by Elizabeth Tenety (COL ’07), has featured the writing of a handful of Georgetown students and professors, including Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., and Director of the Program for Jewish Civilization Jacques Berlinerblau.
Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs Director Thomas Banchoff announced the partnership in July 2007.
“The fit is excellent. ‘On Faith,’ the leading online conversation about religion, brings together thought leaders and the public for vibrant exchanges,” Banchoff wrote on the blog. “Georgetown, the oldest Catholic and Jesuit University in America, welcomes students of all faith traditions and is a global leader in the interdisciplinary study of religion and its role in world affairs.”
Tenety worked for the Berkley Center while majoring in theology and government at Georgetown and said she encourages faculty and students to write about their thoughts and ideas on the blog.
“Frankly, Georgetown students are often very politically, theologically and journalistically aware. They are already saturated in those questions,” Tenety said. “For me, it was a natural fit at the Post because of the environment I had at Georgetown studying religion and politics.”
Tenety considers diversity of content a main priority in her editing role.
“Not only are we diverse in terms of having all the faith traditions represented as well as talking to atheists, agnostics and humanists, we also strive for diversity within those traditions,” she said.
O’Brien first wrote for “On Faith” in May 2009 at the request of On Faith founder Sally Quinn. O’Brien has since written four articles for the blog.
“I like writing for both The Hoya and ‘On Faith’ because I like to seek a wider audience on matters of faith and spirituality, to reach a lot of people I wouldn’t reach here at Georgetown,” he said. “I want to reach people who are thirsting for very good questions about faith and who are thirsting for some thoughtful answers. I hope that I can, if not provide answers, help keep the conversation going and help the conversation become deeper.”
O’Brien has encouraged reflective Georgetown students to contribute to “On Faith,” helping them form and edit their ideas, as well as offering his expertise during the writing process. He recently assisted Jordan Denari (SFS ’13) in writing an article on finding Jesus at Georgetown, which was published in June.
“I was encouraging Jordan because she’s a great writer,” O’Brien said. “I had her in class and her perspective on interreligious dialogue is unique. She really found her voice.”
Denari said she appreciated the chance to share her ideas.
“The Post has a very wide readership, so of course it is an honor to be published there, alongside other bloggers like Desmond Tutu and other famous leaders,” she said.
Denari said writing for “On Faith” was a natural fit.
“Because of my passion for both interreligious dialogue and my desire to share my own experiences regarding Muslim-Christian relations, I wanted to look for outlets in which to publish outside of my personal blog,” she wrote in an email. “Because I write about religion and because I lived in D.C., the ‘On Faith’ blog was a natural choice.”
O’Brien appreciates the depth of “On Faith,” which he said helps reach Millennials in its online format.
“There are a lot of sites that are looking at questions of faith, but I think what The Washington Post brings is the reputation of The Washington Post as well as a commitment to writing that is provocative, deep and meaningful,” he said. “There are a wide variety of voices on the blog.”
Tenety emphasized that “On Faith” is a news organization that looks at today’s headlines through a religious lens.
“My goal is to make sure that this site is relevant to digital users,” she said. “We’re trying to not only represent the real conversations that are happening inside church buildings about religion and values but also the conversations that are happening online.”
Denari has written three articles for “On Faith,” which has recently granted her a more permanent blog presence due to the success of her stories.
“Student writers have so many venues for writing these days, thanks to the blogosphere. More and more I see friends writing for New York Times blogs, PolicyMic, Slate,” she wrote. “For those who want a voice, there are so many options. What’s important is having something unique to say and pitching it to an outlet that fits.”
Tenety works with young writers such as Denari on their proposals. She said that young writers should draw from their own experiences and insights to write in a voice that is purely their own.
“I think one of the important things for students to think about when they are pitching is what can they say that they’re an expert on,” Tenety said. “What I want people to do is to write from their own wealth of wisdom. It’s figuring out what you can offer this conversation.”
Tenety hopes that Georgetown’s relationship with “On Faith” will continue to flourish as both entities support each other.
“As someone who’s been on the Georgetown side as well as the ‘On Faith’ side of this, I know that we deeply value the expertise, the effort, the insight from a number of people at Georgetown,” she said. “There’s been a sort of symbiotic relationship going on that’s been very constructive, I hope to our readers as well.”

Six years after deeming Kehoe Field unfit for varsity practice, the university is conducting a semester-long study to determine the best way to repair the field, which has deteriorated into a minefield of safety risks.
The preliminary survey will not be completed until the spring, and students who regularly play on the field said that the conditions worsened over the summer.
A large section in the northeast area of Kehoe is torn up, and there are patches of exposed concrete where the artificial turf is missing. The field, which is used for club and intramural sports, has an uneven surface on which twisted ankles are commonplace.
“Large sections of the field are simply unplayable,” said Luke Carter (COL ’14), Georgetown University Student Association undersecretary for athletic affairs and president of Club Ultimate. “Most of the field is not safe to play to the fullest extent.”
Yates Field House allocates a portion of its budget for minor annual repairs, and some renovations will continue this semester.
“These repairs have helped in the past, but now we’ve reached the point when spot repairs cannot realistically mitigate the deteriorated condition of the field,” Yates Assistant Director of Intramurals and Special Programs Tim Smith wrote in an email.
The field, located on top of Yates, is worsening due to structural factors that will eventually require a complete renovation, according to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Vice President for Facilities and Planning Robin Morey.
“Replacing the field is one thing, but we have an underlying superstructure there that also needs work as well,” Morey said. “We certainly would not want to replace the field without addressing really the reason for the deterioration of the field, which is the structure below.”
Morey said he did not know how much repairs would cost and could not specify a prospective timeline.
Because the field will not be replaced for at least another year, club teams will have to continue practicing on areas that many consider unsafe. Former Athletic Director Bernard Muir decided that Kehoe Field posed too high a risk and was unsuitable for varsity athletics in October 2007, and conditions have worsened since then.
“It is definitely dangerous,” Advisory Board for Club Sports Chair Alex Skarzynski (SFS ’15) said. “I have knee problems, and when we’re on Kehoe, they tend to be a lot more exacerbated and hard to deal with.”
Skarzynski, who is on the club rugby team, said that many of his teammates have also suffered injuries.
Olson, however, said that the field remains safe for recreational use, citing the greater intensity of varsity sports compared to club and intramural sports.
GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) is pushing for the university to prioritize club sports.
“Now we have a field which a lot of teams use that has been deemed unsafe for varsity athletics, and yet it is still apparently safe enough for club athletes,” Tisa said. “That’s a contradiction.”
Many club teams alter their playing style on Kehoe due to the field’s conditions. Ultimate Frisbee, for example, does not allow its players to dive — what’s normally a fundamental move in the game. The club rugby team bans contact when playing on the field, and the club lacrosse team has stopped playing on Kehoe altogether.
“Anyone who has just looked at the field knows that it’s not really safe for a lot of those different things,” Carter said.
Smith and Club Sports Advisor Lauren Gagliardi sent out a survey to gauge feedback on students’ use of Kehoe, including any injuries stemming from the field’s conditions. Smith and Gagliardi could not yet specify the implications drawn from the survey’s 1,529 respondents, but the pair plans to use the survey to demonstrate the urgency of repairs to upper-level administrators. Olson has seen the survey’s preliminary results.
“We care about student perspectives [and] we’ve gained a lot of those through this survey,” Olson said. “We are actively pursuing [repairs]. We know it’s an important priority and we’re looking at it in the context of our master planning.”
ABCS has also pushed to hire athletic trainers for club sports teams, but the board was denied GUSA funding last spring. This semester, ABCS is working to begin an athletic training pilot program with funding independent of GUSA.
Tisa, who was in office when the GUSA Finance and Appropriation Committee decided to deny the request for athletic trainers, nevertheless said that trainers for club sports should have been a budget priority.
“When you talk about safety, part of the need for an athletic training program came from the fact that the facilities, including the field on top of Yates, Kehoe Field, are so poor and undermaintained,” Tisa said.

Amid tight budget cuts, University Information Services has adopted a series of changes to simultaneously modernize and cut costs for Georgetown’s wireless network.
“With the constrained budgets that all of us are operating under, we had to find and drive efficiencies in how we were doing the business of IT,” Chief Information Office Lisa Davis said. “Through those efficiencies we were able to find those savings to reinvest those savings into modernizing campus.”
The modernization efforts include streamlining Georgetown’s mobile device application, transitioning from the aging mainframe to a cloud system, switching from GUmailstore to Gmail and changing staffing.
In total, the modernization efforts saved UIS $2.25 million, or approximately 10 percent of their nearly $30 million dollar budget.
“Most of it went to Wi-Fi. We actually provided increased research licenses for our medical community,” Davis said.
Davis said that some of the saved money funded Drupal, an open-source software, and UIS mobile app developments, such as NextGUTS.
Davis noted that many of these modernization efforts revolve around centralizing services on campus.
“Finding ways to centralize services helps us lower costs,” Davis said. “Wi-Fi is the biggest example of that.”
Georgetown, which has struggled with campus-wide Wi-Fi in the past, is scheduled to have ubiquitous Wi-Fi by December.
Davis said that the budget for fiscal year 2014 is even tighter, and will call for even more cuts. To that end, UIS will introduce two new money-saving programs.
“We just launched our unified help desk, increasing coverage to 24/7. Instead of having to call separate help desks there will be one number to call for assistance,” Davis said.
UIS also hopes to unveil a revamped printing network within 18 months that will give students access to mobile printing.
“Everyone wanted printing like [the McDonough School of Business],” Davis said. “We’re just finalizing a contract deal with Xerox. With mobile print, you have all the locations of [on-campus] printers on your device and you’ll be able to choose where to print things. We’re one of the first universities to offer this modern and mobile printing.”
Even though UIS is cutting costs, Davis stressed that none of the changes will decrease service quality.
“I see easier access, faster response,” Davis said. “It’s not just about saving money, it’s about increasing performance or we just won’t do it.”
Long term, Davis said it will be crucial to address Georgetown’s aging, 25-year-old network.
“One of our top issues continues to be addressing Georgetown’s network infrastructure,” Davis said. “We have tweaked and leveraged that network to its full capacity to the point where we have multiple points of failure on the network.”
In the case of an outage, this could prove problematic for campus.
“We have no redundancy on our network. This is a problem. If we have an outage, it would be serious — you wouldn’t have access to data, applications or Wi-Fi,” Davis said. “I’ve spent the last year-and-a-half trying to address and modernize the network infrastructure.”
UIS has charted that the modernization project would cost approximately $2.5 million, which the team has broken down over five years. The department is looking to see if any of its corporate partners would be interested in owning the university’s network.
“We know what needs to be done. Now we’re trying to identify a funding strategy,” Davis said. “We’re looking at alternatives of how we may fund a project like this. We’re integrating our strategy with master planning.”

Three Georgetown professors highlighted the similarities among the maturing democracies of Egypt, Turkey and Brazil at a panel discussion Wednesday.
Government professor Charles King, international relations professor James Vreeland and government professor Diana Kapiszewski spoke at the event, which was co-sponsored by the Mortara Center for International Studies, the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies and the Center for Latin American Studies.
While seemingly variant, all three countries have featured some form of civil unrest in recent months.
“With respect to the emergence of democracies, we do see some association between democracies emerging and poor economic performance in an autocracy,” Vreeland said. “When an autocracy is struggling, its economy is not growing and discontent is more likely to lead to the overthrow of a regime.”
Additionally, Vreeland suggested that countries with oil stray from democracy, while countries with highly unequal societies are more likely to revolt.
Turning to Egypt, Vreeland said that while the country’s economic growth has decreased substantially since 2010, its economic state is not beyond redemption at approximately $5,000 per capita.
“The single most important predictor of the survival of a democracy is probably per capita income,”Vreeland said. “No democracy has ever fallen with an income above that of Argentina in 1975, which was about $8,000 per capita.”
King continued the discussion with the role of social media in uprisings in Turkey, where citizens protested a plan to raze a park in Istanbul over the summer. Police responded to the protests withteargas and protesters alleged police brutality.
King stressed that it is important not use an outdated lens to view such a complex situation.
“Our categories don’t quite match the reality of what is happening in the street,” King said. “We talk about regime, we talk about regime transition, we talk about consolidation of democracy, but those really look like such 1990s concepts compared to what’s actually happening on the ground.”
“We don’t have a very good way of talking about how democracies behave,” he added.
Kapiszewski spoke about Brazil, where 250,000 citizens protested a 9-cent increase in public transportation fares. Kapiszewski explained that the demonstrations stemmed from a burgeoning, wealthier middle class, which is calling for a better government with less corruption.
According to Kapiszewski, the fare increase was only the short-term cause of the desperate riots. She said the real anger is rooted in Brazil’s financial inequality and citizens’ disgust with politicians.
Manassinee Moottatarn (GRD ’15) enjoyed the comparative discussion.
“It encompassed a bunch of different countries and continents but the common thread was the thread of not consolidating democracy while making interesting comparisons with the U.S.,” Moottatarn said. “It was a very informed discussion and it was very interesting.”

To address confusion about available resources for students with disabilities, the Georgetown University Student Association’s Office of Disabilities launched “No Wrong Door,” an initiative to provide a comprehensive manual for navigating university and D.C. area disability resources.
The 35-page manual will include information about housing and academic accommodations, legal aid, community resources and internships for students with disabilities.
No Wrong Door stemmed from what GUSA saw as the absence of a consolidated and accessible resource hub for disabled students at Georgetown. Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14), GUSA deputy chief of staff for diversity and one of the leaders of the No Wrong Door initiative, recognized the discrepancy of information between minority Georgetown communities.
“I think the disability group as a community is marginalized on campus,” Peterson said. “If you look, we have the women’s center, the LGBTQ center, but there’s no sort of comparison for students with disabilities.”
No Wrong Door Chief Coordinator and GUSA Undersecretary for Disabilities Lydia Brown (COL ’15), who is autistic, pointed out that the initiative shares its name with state-level policies that guarantee universal access of certain services to disabled citizens.
“In a state that has a No Wrong Door policy, a person with a disability, one of their family members or a caregiver could go to any state office, and … be able to access the services [they need],” Brown said. “They can enter through any door, so to speak.”
The GUSA initiative provides students and faculty with a similarly thorough list of resources and contacts from such resources to provide services for students with disabilities. Peterson said that one of the university’s main problems, historically, has been a lack of publicity for its disability services.
“Georgetown does have good accommodations for students — they just don’t know about them — and that’s our concern,” Peterson said.
Brown shared Peterson’s concern for the accessibility of resources.
“The reason for creating No Wrong Door is that students don’t often know what resources are available, so hopefully this will empower staff and the university to provide this information to students,” Brown said. “Everything that’s in here is already something that exists, but what this is intended to do is provide a central hub of information no matter who you are and what you did for the information before.”
Drafted iterations of the policy have been posted on the GUSA website, and a finalized version will be made available to the public in the next few weeks. Additionally, GUSA has coordinated the initiative with Assistant Dean for Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr, Director of the Academic Resource Center Jane Holahan and Counseling and Psychiatric Services.
The initiative’s list of contacts builds upon current, well-established university resources such as the ARC and CAPS to include additional groups and services within the D.C. area.
Although the initiative focuses on empowering disabled students, both contributors see No Wrong Door as applicable to all Georgetown students.
“I think it’s more of an overall [resource],” Peterson said. “I think we have included things that the community as a whole can use. We’re trying to create a comprehensive resource for all people rather than trying to segregate disabled students into separate categories.”
Peterson said that GUSA hopes to distribute the finalized version of the document at New Student Orientation in coming years.
“Even though the people and personnel will shift, I think the document will be very viable next year and the years after that,” Peterson said.

Student leaders shared their visions for the future of the university at “Georgetown in Five Years: A Conversation with Student Leaders” on Tuesday.
The event, sponsored by The Hoya, was moderated by Evan Hollander (SFS ’14), chair of The Hoya’s board of directors. The panelists acknowledged the work the administration has done to include students in planning the future of Georgetown, but said that there were still challenges ahead.
“The [2010 Campus Plan], I think, has been challenging for everyone to deal with — students, administration and the surrounding community as well,” Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said. “I think in five years, we’re going to be in a much better position than we are now.”
Students of Georgetown Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lizzy MacGill (COL ’14) said that when The Corp was building the Classy pre-registration website, there were occasional disagreements between students and the administration.
“It’s a good example of how there’s this conflict between The Corp’s mission, which has always been kind of ‘no adults allowed,’ and things the university can’t release,” MacGill said.
Students of Color Alliance Co-Chair Aya Waller-Bey (COL ’14) added that the bureaucratic nature of the administration hinders student group operations.
“We wanted to bring an outside speaker to campus, and it took about three months,” Waller-Bey said, noting that the speaker ended up not coming. “Just having opportunities to have speakers I find extremely difficult because of the processes and the difficulties and the bureaucracies of it all.”
The panelists did agree that students could do more overall to make the university aware of concerns.
“I think that in five years, when we really look forward, I think we can do a lot more as a student body,” School of Foreign Service Academic Council President Kyle Zhu (SFS ’14) said. “We Georgetown students are ambitious and we want to run things.”
Tisa concurred, citing the importance of recognizing student initiative.
“The more we can convince the university that we’re people who should be treated not like minors, but like adults … the better off we’ll be,” Tisa said.
MacGill pointed to an evolution in the student-administration responsibility balance.
“The university has done more to include students along the way,” MacGill said.
The student panelists agreed and said that they want to engage a wider population of students in improving life at the university.
“One thing I do want to stress the importance of is that students who aren’t the same visible leaders in the community get involved,” Waller-Bey said. “I think it’s also important … that we have a diverse amount of opinions contributing to the conversation.”
Tisa stressed the need for creating impetuses to amplify student engagement.
“We need projects that will get the conversation away from these people up here and to the people who are sitting in their dorm rooms right now and not going to events,” Tisa said.
Waller-Bey said the university should work harder to embrace diversity, possibly through academics.
“I think that’s one of my biggest disappointments about Georgetown is this lack of consistency,” she said. “We say diversity and we say we want to recruit a diverse group of students, and we have these conversations, but after NSO they just die.”
The panel finished its discussion by offering advice for younger students on how to make a difference during their time at Georgetown.
“Advice I wish I’d heard is start slowly, with something you’re sure you’ll like and build relationships with older students who are involved with those groups,” MacGill said.
Zhu cautioned selectivity.
“Don’t do too much at once. Don’t do what I did, which is sign up for five clubs, and burn out,” Zhu said. “Find what your passion is.”

When students voted to pass the Student Activities Fee Endowment reform in February 2012, their votes had an impact far beyond campus by creating the Social Innovation Public Service Fund. The first SIPS grant winners did service projects abroad with the funds they received.
The SIPS Fund awarded its first grants last fall from a $1.5 million endowment that was established by the SAFE reform. SIPS has awarded grants ranging from $1,000 to $13,000.
SIPS provided funds to Kristen Trivelli (NHS ’14) to travel to Guwahati, India, last winter. Trivelli initially became interested in volunteering with Operation Smile, which treats facial deformities in children but ended up also volunteering at an orphanage for girls and the Pratiyasha Foundation, which brings meals to the slums of Guwahati.
Trivelli said her work with Pratyasha was life changing.
“It was amazing, because literally we spent $12 and we fed over 80 kids every Sunday,” Trivelli said. “They are the most honest kids you’ve ever met. … You’re hugging and playing with them, and you’re like, ‘How do they have so much joy when they have nothing?’”
Trivelli has continued to work with Pratyasha since returning and plans to raise funds by selling laptop cases made from fabric she bought in India. The ongoing involvement was an important part of the SIPS application process.
“It was something we always talked about, how to take my experience and apply it to the Georgetown community,” she said.
Nitya Ramlogan (SFS ’13) travelled to Oaxaca, Mexico, on SIPS funds with a plan to market the crafts of local artisans to Georgetown students.
Ramlogan connected with a community partner in Oaxaca, which has now hired her as a consultant.Ramlogan is working to bring the Oaxaca artisans’ goods to the Georgetown Farmers Market.
“The project has even exceeded the boundaries I originally had in mind, and become a broader project, but the connection with Georgetown will be a lasting one,” she said.
Alumni are also eligible to receive SIPS funding.
Claire Charamnac (SFS ’11) is the co-founder of Women LEAD, which works to empower young Nepalese women through intensive, yearlong programs focused on real-world skills, leadership and confidence. She described the SIPS grant, awarded to Women LEAD earlier this year, as the largest her organization has received.
“SIPS is a critical part of our success,” she said. “They’re our biggest partner at this point.”
Women LEAD is now working to lengthen the program from one to two years and to expand the program to other countries.
In addition to project assistance, the fund provides programming, including lecture series and innovation labs.
SIPS Development Director Michael Grasso (SFS ’14), who is a former director of personnel for The Hoya, said that the majority of SIPS-funded projects are international because that is where students’ interests tend to lie. The organization also aims to expand its domestic efforts. SIPS tries to go beyond just paying grantees’ travel expenses.
“What SIPS does is it provides this extra layer of providing resources, connections and funding,”Grasso said. “Our preference is always to support and fund the programmatic aspects of an applicant’s project, meaning materials and support for them. We prefer to partner them in what they’re actually doing on the ground, instead of just getting there.”

The Georgetown colony of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority held its pledge ceremony Sunday, making it the first National Panhellenic Conference sorority at the university.
The colony was founded by Carrie Cosgrove (NHS ’16),Bayla Pidgeon (SFS ’16) and Katie Steininger (MSB ’16) and has 25 members in its inaugural pledge class. Last spring, the founders started looking into bringing KKG to Georgetown.
“We all really loved Georgetown but felt like something was missing,” Pidgeon said. “We lucked out because we all felt that Kappa was the right organization for us. … We got in touch with Kappa. They were really eager to start a colony here.”
Like all social fraternities and sororities, KKG will not be recognized by the university.
Cosgrove, Pidgeon and Steininger reached out to friends on Facebook to gather interest in a sorority.
“A lot of girls did respond and wanted to form the initial interest group,” Cosgrove said.
Margaret Krackeler (NHS ’16) expressed interest in joining over the summer and is now part of the new colony.
“It just seemed like a good way to get to know people who I probably wouldn’t have met otherwise,” Krackeler said. “Hopefully it won’t be too stereotypical a sorority.”
The original founders have been in close contact with the KKG alumni network in Washington, D.C., who are working to gain national affiliation for Georgetown’s chapter.
National Fraternity President of KKG Julie Leshay expressed enthusiasm for the new chapter on the KKG website.
“The interested women at Georgetown share a desire to have a community with their female peers,” Leshay wrote. “We are thrilled to welcome the interested women at Georgetown into Kappa, and to provide them with an infrastructure to support their aspirations.”
Members of Georgetown’s other two sororities, Delta Phi Epsilon and Adelfi, will be allowed to join KKG in addition to their current groups.
“It’s a bunch of girls from different organizations and different places on campus, from around the country and the world, who have different interests and come together despite these differences,” Pidgeon said.
The first class, formed entirely of girls from the original summer interest group, began their eight-week pledge program last weekend. The program will culminate in an initiation at the end of October.
Like Panhellenic sororities and fraternities across the country, new members will be required to pay dues each semester. Members of KKG declined to share the size of the fee for the fall semester.
“Our first semester will always be a little more expensive, mainly because you have to pay a new member fee,” Pidgeon said.
The sorority has no plans to partner exclusively with fraternities on campus.
“We are really eager to program with all the organizations on campus, not just Greek ones,” Pidgeon added.

The trek from the Hilltop to Chinatown for Georgetown men’s basketball games has been blamed for lackluster student attendance, and three athletic department initiatives this season aim to help fill up seats at Verizon Center.
A direct busing program from campus to the arena, a mobile ticketing service and a minor expansion of student section seating at games will all be instituted this basketball season.
The shuttles — operating on a pilot basis this season, with potentially expanded service in the future — will supplement the regular practice of increased Georgetown University Transportation Service buses running on game days. Because D.C. traffic patterns are expected to make bus travel slower than Metro travel on weeknights, the program will operate primarily for weekend and holiday games.
However, not all students will be eligible to participate in the pilot program. In an apparent effort to incentivizeattendance at non-conference games, the athletic department will offer bus vouchers only to students who attend either two out of the first three games or half of all non-conference games.
“Eligible students will be notified via email and given three to five days prior to game day to pick up their direct bus voucher,” said Pete Kirschner, the athletic department’s senior director of marketing.
Kirschner left the door open for expansions of the program, provided that it’s successful this year.
“It is important to note that this is a pilot program that, if found to be enjoyed by the majority of student season ticket holders, can be expanded in the future,” he said.
Once they arrive at the arena, students will notice a change at the door: For the first time, students will be able to gain admittance using their iPhone, Android or Windows smartphones instead of theMyHoyas season ticket card, which will not be continued this season. Students without smartphones will be able to either print out tickets or download tickets to credit or debit cards — an option that was available last season. Students will still be able to transfer individual game tickets to other students’ accounts, which became available last year.
Executive Director for Ticket Operations and Donor Relations Steve Alleva compared the new smartphone system to those used by airlines for mobile check-in.
“We’ll be creating user-friendly how-to guides,” Alleva said. “You’ll go to your online MyHoyas account through your smartphone, and that will bring up a QR-like code that will be scannable at the Verizon Center.”
The third change instituted this season concerns the student section itself. In an effort to make a “more intimate” atmosphere, the seats allocated to students will include all of sections 105 and 106 — commonly known as the “non-pep band” side — as well as rows CC-KK in section 117 — the “pep band side.”
This represents little change from past years, except that the athletic department will not close off the pep band side during games not anticipated to draw large crowds, as it has done on occasion in the past. Excess students will continue to be placed in sections 424-427, and no student will be denied the opportunity to buy season tickets.
“We’re students. We want the student section to be as intimate, as rowdy, as fun as possible,” Hoya Blue Vice President Rachael Augostini (COL ’14) said. “I think the team will appreciate that as much as the students do.”
The new initiatives this season sprouted from talks over the summer between athletic department officials, Hoya Blue and the Georgetown University Student Association.
The bus conversation in particular arose after GUSA Vice President and former Hoya Blue board member Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) realized how popular the idea was during the 2012 GUSAexecutive campaign. Rather than attempting to start a new system through GUSA, he talked to his contacts in Hoya Blue and the athletic department to see how older, failed attempts at direct busingcould be revamped in a successful way.
“It was the first time that GUSA had somebody with previous ties to the athletic department,” Ramadan said. “And the athletic department had an infrastructure in place. So rather than reinventing the wheel, why not take advantage of what we already have, and make more students aware of it?”
The athletic department has a clear impetus for making games more appealing to students this season in particular: This year’s schedule, partially due to the conference move, lacks many of the big-draw games from years past.
With the marketability of games against Butler, Creighton and Xavier an unknown quantity — and juggernauts like Louisville and Syracuse off the schedule — Hoya Blue and the athletic department are banking on a simplified approach bringing in more fans. Ramadan, for one, thinks it’s a winning bet.
“We’re in kind of uncharted territory, but I’m personally very excited,” Ramadan said. “I think the busing is a home run — it’s just a matter of making sure student know about it.”

The Old Georgetown Board received a presentation justifying the selected location of the university’s planned Northeast Triangle Residence Hall at their monthly meeting Wednesday morning.
The meeting also included discussion of Georgetown’s plans for the Intercollegiate Athletics Center.
In July, the OGB requested more information regarding why the grassy area between Henle Village and the ReissBuilding was selected for Northeast Triangle as well as any alternative proposals.
Gregory Janks, a principal planner with architectural firm Sasaki Associates, stressed that the site and the building’s design were conceived with student convenience and concerns in mind and did not present any alternative locations.
The location on the north side of campus is particularly intended to reinforce existing pedestrian networks across campus, increase the density of the campus and strengthen existing student life communities within the front gates.
“The north [community] is the one that’s lacking that critical mass,” Janks said.
The Northeast Triangle Resident Hall was first presented to replace the planned renovation of the Leavey Hotel and Conference Center into a dormitory in March 2013. While the university planned to add 385 beds to the Leavey Center, further exploration found that the location would isolate students and harm a facility that has been performing well financially.
Ultimately, the northeast location, which will house 230 beds in suites or semi-suites, was considered the least encumbered site. However, the architects acknowledged that the location does have some shortcomings.
“The biggest hurdle that the site has to overcome is that it does have limited construction access,” Janks said.
Today’s presentation was part of a months-long process working toward the ultimate approval of the planned building by the OGB and the D.C. Zoning Commission.
While there were more than 2,700 responses to the MyCampus survey sent by the university in April to include student and faculty input in the university’s long-term master planning, Sasaki has yet to incorporate the consolidated data and further student feedback from town halls into its design plans.
OGB members were critical of the residence hall designs thus far, questioning how the university would reach its commitment to house 90 percent of all students on campus by 2025 and if the location allows for enough open exterior space.
“It would be great if the new dormitory has its own outside space for student activity,” OGB Chair David Cox said.
According to Janks, Sasaki Associates has identified the Kober-Cogan Building and Harbin Terrace as the next-most feasible sites for student residences. With the conversion of these two areas, the university would then reach its voluntary minimum of housing 90 percent of the student body on campus.
While the OGB was cautious about the plans for the Northeast Triangle, it reacted positively to the design developments for the new Intercollegiate Athletics Center presented by the university.
The tweaks, which create a more consistent architectural approach for the center, responded almost directly to comments by board members at previous OGB meetings. This time, members suggested that the university revisit its current design for the proposed atrium over the entrance to McDonough Gymnasium.
“Coming together from what was previously there, I think this it’s a major improvement,” Cox said.

In a city notorious for political gridlock, the elected body that oversees neighborhood of Georgetown, Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, has voted almost exclusively with unanimity in the past year.
Between September 2012 and April of this year, only two of the 67 resolutions passed by the commission have received a down vote. No resolutions have failed to pass in the last 12 months.
Monthly meeting minutes for May through September have not been posted online, and the ANC did not provide these records after repeated requests from The Hoya beginning July 5.
Following a hotly debated redistricting of the ANC last year, two single-member districts were formed with almost entirely student residents, all but guaranteeing two student seats. When Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14) and Craig Cassey (COL ’15) joined the eight-member commission in January, it marked the first time in a decade that the student body saw dual representation on the board and was widely regarded as a victory for students after a period of acrid town-gown relations.
Of the two resolutions that did not elicit a unanimous vote, only one faced dissent from a student commissioner. Prindiville voted down an April resolution to limit the capacity of the outdoor seating area of Washington Harbour restaurant Farmers Fishers Bakers to 85, though it still passed with a 6-to-1 vote. The other non-unanimous resolution, which concerned the capacity of the summer patio at Old Glory, an M Street bar, also passed 6-to-1, with Charles Eason of SMD 07 voting “no.”
Although Cassey did not vote against a resolution between September 2012 and April 2013, he said that he voted against a resolution at the meeting this Tuesday that would stop the installation of an American flag and an elevator on the top of the Dog Tag Bakery, a new bakery staffed by veterans studying at the School of Continuing Studies set to open on Grace Street in February.
Several of the commission’s resolutions concern only simple administrative matters, such as the approval of each meeting’s minutes and agenda. But the past year has seen more significant resolutions, including one that limits the construction of windows and another that rejects the construction of a bowling alley in the former Shops at Georgetown Park. Prindiville and Cassey were aligned with their fellow neighborhood commissioners in both instances.
According to Prindiville, the reason for the consensus lies in the way the ANC votes on resolutions. Rather than voting on line items, ANC commissioners re-evaluate and edit each resolution until commissioners can all agree on the resolution’s contents.
“It is a conciliatory body in many ways, and we try to make our resolutions reflect all our opinions,”Prindiville said. “It’s not an up-down vote on issues. I can think of many times when I’ve had concern with an initial draft. I expressed my concerns to my colleagues, and often times, they understand my concern and incorporate my concern into the resolution to the point to where I feel comfortable voting in the affirmation.”
In July, The Hoya reported that Prindiville and Cassey had both supported a resolution recognizing Jennifer Altemus (COL ’88), former president of the Citizens Association of Georgetown, for her “sustained contributions to the community,” eliciting concern because of Altemus’s outspoken opposition to the university’s 2010 Campus Plan.
Prindiville defended his vote, stating that the recognition was for civic service, not political views.
“I don’t agree with anything she said about students … [or] her positions about the university, but I think the important point here is that it’s not an award — it’s a commendation for service,” Prindiville said. “I think that the ANC, students, the university, the community as a whole, should be supporting and valuing civic engagement.”
“If you read the text of the resolution, there is nothing in there about supporting her views [regarding] … the campus plan,” he added.
Cassey agreed, adding that former student commissioner Jake Sticka (COL ’13), who was often at odds with the commission, was also honored for his service to the community after leaving his post.
“If there were ever a student who would not be commended, it would be Sticka,” Cassey said. “But we still made special note of his work during a tumultuous time.”
Prindiville said that, despite the apparent voting consensus, he is in a unique position to represent students’ interest in the commission.
“I really do believe that I’m a unique voice … I think I’m the highest dissenting voice — I’ve dissented the most times. It might not be many, but it proves something,” Prindiville said. “I genuinely believe in the consensus model … but I think my voting record proves that if I’m not able to change the wording of the resolution enough to reflect the views of my constituents, I’m not afraid to vote no.”
Cassey echoed that statement.
“I don’t feel pressured — I wasn’t elected to go sit alongside them and vote,” Cassey said. “I’m elected to work with them, make progress and help reunite two communities that were at odds.”

As part of his recent push for more affordable higher education, President Barack Obama recommended that law schools would be more cost effective if they offered two-year curriculums instead of the traditional three-year programs.
“Can law schools maintain quality and keep good professors and sustain themselves without that third year?” Obama asked. “My suspicion is, is that if they thought creatively about it, they probably could.”
The speech, which was part of Obama’s college affordability and financial aid tour, highlighted the president’s concerns about increased education costs coupled with increasingly competitive job markets.
Obama, a former constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, criticized law schools for maintaining high-cost programs while the legal job market is diminishing. A 2012 American Bar Association report said that only 56 percent of the Class of 2012 had found full-time, long-term employment.
“Myriad services are now being outsourced (often abroad) to non-lawyers, and the number of positions with large firms is dwindling, making it harder for graduating students — many of whom are saddled with six-figure student-loan debts — to find work at the outset of their careers that can even begin to pay off their obligations,” New York University Law School professor Samuel Estreicher, an outspoken advocate for two-year law schools, wrote in a New York Times op-ed in January.
Obama added that third-year students would benefit more from clerking or practicing at a firm. Despite the low wage paid to clerks, Obama argued that the cost would still be lower for the student.
Georgetown University Law Center Dean William Treanor disagreed with Obama’s proposed solution.
“As the demands of the legal profession continue to change, I don’t think [what] legal education needs in today’s world is a two-year program,” Treanor said.  “If we are concerned with educating lawyers who will contribute to society, our focus should not be on cutting back on what they learn; our focus should be on providing them with the education they need.”
Nevertheless, Treanor agreed that today’s lawyers need more hands-on training, but not at the expense of a third year of education.
“Students today should learn to be better writers, and they should learn subjects like management, finance and accounting,” Treanor said.
Diego Soto (LAW ’16) said he would be appreciative of a lighter tuition load.
“Assuming cost of attendance does not rise significantly in direct response to the lost year, I would graduate from law school with less debt,” Soto said. “This would make accepting a lower-paying job in some sort of public interest work more realistic and less risky. While there [are] options for law school graduates who want to take these types of jobs … [those programs] never lift the heavy burden that debt places on law students from the first day those loans are disbursed.”
Soto added that Obama’s opinion regarding legal education should be respected.
“He said himself … that he understands the importance of a quality legal education, so his proposal to cut law school down to two years is not one made with merely saving money in mind,” Soto said.
Kevin Barber (LAW ’14), however, stressed the importance of hands-on third-year work.
“This coming year, I’ll be doing a clinic, which is basically where you work on actual cases for actual clients,” Barber said. “So for me, I do not think my third year will be a waste of time, but I do understand people who aren’t doing something like that might feel like it’s a waste of $50,000.”
Overall, Soto said that even if law school remains a three-year institution for years to come, law schools must do more to alleviate the challenges recent graduates face in the job market.
“Law schools would have to seriously improve their career services … in order to keep up,” Soto said.

SAT testing will be free for all juniors and seniors at public and charter high schools in Washington, D.C., this year, Mayor Vincent Gray recently announced.
The new program, which will affect more than 7,000 students this year, is funded through the Office of the State Superintendent of Education in partnership with local education agencies and the College Board’s SAT School Day initiative, which allows students in participating areas to take the test in a familiar environment and provides SAT preparatory materials for one year prior to the exam.
“I’m so pleased that we are able to make this crucial college-entrance exam more accessible to all our students, making it easier for them to gain admission to institutions of higher education across the country,” Gray said in a press release.
The test, formerly known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test, is traditionally offered only one Saturday morning each month during the school year at select testing centers. The registration fee is $51, although students who are unable to pay can apply for a fee waiver. It is unclear how many D.C. students would have needed to apply for a fee waiver without this new program, but D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson said that cost was often an issue for students.
“The SAT is the gateway to college for many students, but too often the cost is a tremendous barrier,” Henderson said in a press release. “Making the SAT more accessible is great news for our students and their future success.”
Junior and senior students in the District will receive vouchers from registration coordinators at their school, which they will then use to register for the exam online. Vouchers for the ACT are also available, but only for eligible low-income students. All other exams must be paid for at students’ own expense.
Ricki Eshman (COL ’14), the president of Georgetown Strive for College, an organization that connects low-income high school students with Georgetown student mentors to work on-on-one through the college application and financial aid processes, said that the announcement was a step in the right direction.
“Waiving the fee is leveling the playing field for the students we work with by allowing them full access to tests that can bring them one step closer to a brighter future through higher education,” Eshmansaid.
Nevertheless, Eshman stressed that the test fee was just one aspect of eliminating education inequality.
“One of the greatest limitations for many students is the financial burden of higher education,”Eshman said. “While this program is a step closer to reducing part of that burden, there is still a lot of work to be done to lower tuition costs and make college fully accessible to people from all backgrounds.”
