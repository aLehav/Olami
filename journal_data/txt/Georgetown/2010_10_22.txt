Tales of adventure, romance and nuns join the manuscript volumes Lauinger Library in its new exhibit, “Portraits in Piety: Women Saints and Women Religious from the John Thatcher Collection.”
Opened last week, the collection pores over the lives of religious women since the 16th century – lives that often defy stereotypes.
“You definitely have some really interesting characters [in the collection],” said Barbara Mujica, a professor in the Spanish department and curator of the exhibit.
Featuring some highlights from the John Thatcher Collection, the exhibit features a grouping of more than 1,500 religious manuscripts that Georgetown purchased last year.
“After seeing the collection, I knew – we wanted it for Georgetown,” said John Buchtel, head of the library’s special collections. “Some of these books are rare, some are very rare.”
The purchase was funded in large part by a $50,000 grant from the B. H. Breslauer Foundation.
Mujica began curating the acquisitions in the spring, sorting through the books to pick the final 103 documents that are now on display.
“It was a very slow process,” she said. “You really have to look very closely at them. People have written in them, people have used them.”
The books present different aspects of women’s spirituality, are written in several languages and date back to the 16th century. What unites the artifacts in “Portraits in Piety,” Mujica said, is that they all contain spiritual portraits – whether visual or verbal.
“I chose that title because books are portraits in many ways,” Mujica said.
And for many students, the characters have been the biggest draw to the exhibit.
The portraits paint pictures of women who, besides their religious devotion, were also brave, intelligent and even sensual. Colby Howard (SFS ’12) said his favorite piece in the exhibit was a collection of love letters (now widely considered fictional) from a Portuguese nun to a French naval officer.
“It was that side of it that I didn’t expect, and I found really interesting,” he said.
The depictions evolve over time, from images of nuns kneeling at the cross, to women spinning and doing everyday tasks to the eventual portrayal of women performing courageous deeds.
One of the portraits shows a woman attacking soldiers who persecuted her father.
“It really challenges our perception of what religious women were, and even are today,” said Jovana Zujevic, a graduate student in the department of Spanish and Portuguese. “They were religious women, but they were also women.”
Mujica said she was surprised by the enthusiastic student response, but added that between the historical, religious and artistic aspects of the collection, there is something for everyone.
“Different students will get different things out of it,” she said. The collection will remain at Georgetown permanently, and Mujica said she hopes to put the exhibit up again during the summer. She also hopes to create other exhibitions focusing on other aspects of the Thatcher manuscripts.
“It’s just a tremendous collection,” she said.
“Portraits in Piety” will be on display at the Howard W. Gunlocke Rare Book and Special Collections Room in Lauinger Library until Oct. 22.”

Charles Smith (CAS ’89), a member of the Georgetown men’s basketball team from 1985 to 1989, was shot twice in the chest inside his Bowie, Md. home Thursday afternoon.
He was hospitalized and is in critical-but-stable condition after undergoing surgery later in the day, NBC News4’s John Schriffen reported.
Prince George’s County police are searching for a lone gunman whom witnesses identified as a man wearing a red hat. Law enforcement sources said the shooting could have stemmed from a gambling debt.
Smith, a guard, was Big East player of the year and a second-team All-American his senior season, averaging 18.7 points and 5.1 assists for the Hoyas en route to a berth in the NCAA tournament where Georgetown lost to Duke in the East Regional final.
Smith went undrafted in 1989 but signed with the Boston Celtics, for whom he played until 1991. That March, after the Celtics’ fifth game of the season, Smith’s car struck and killed two Boston University students late at night on Commonwealth Avenue. He was convicted a year later on the charge of vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of a crime. Smith served two and a half years in prison.

D.C. Public Schools is embarking on a new effort to simultaneously reduce hunger and improve academic achievement. Ten thousand students enrolled in the District’s public schools will now have the opportunity to eat three free meals per day.
Eighty percent of DCPS schools now offer dinner for free or at reduced costs to underprivileged students in a special new program, according to The Washington Post. The program is part of the Healthy Schools Act, signed in to law last spring by Mayor Adrian Fenty, which seeks to improve the nutritional value of the food served in D.C.’s public and charter schools.
Students have been able to enjoy free or reduced-cost breakfasts and lunches for a long time, according to the Post, but officials hope that with the new dinners more parents will enroll their children in after-school programs, according to The Washington Post. The program also has the more concrete goal of improving nutrition as 43 percent of black children in the District are underfed, a necessary step according to Nathanial Roloff, director of D.C. Reads.
“The economy has affected the east side of the city the hardest. . That means that many of the kids are suffering in various ways, including food insecurity,” Roloff said. “In few, but some, of the homes in D.C., the children are the most responsible people in the house. All those things require, if we expect kids to learn, some food support.”
The new meals are expected to adhere to higher nutritional standards. In addition, cafeterias must make more meals from scratch rather than serve defrosted foods. Schools should also create health profiles to monitor their progress.
“I have heard a lot of reports from adults saying that it was great for the kids, and some saying it is too healthy and that they don’t like it,” Roloff said. “Realistically, it is great for the students to get some extra needed nutrition.”
The program is expected to cost $5.7 million this academic year and will be subsidized by the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program.

On Oct. 20, several Georgetown alumni returned to the Hilltop to discuss their work for Teach For America in the panel True Life: I Teach For America.
Teach For America, a program that selects recently graduated college students to teach in low-income schools, is highly popular among Georgetown graduates. Forty-one members of the Class of 2010 joined its ranks, adding to a community of an estimated 364 alumni who have taught in TFA or are connected to the national service organization.
The middle and high school students that receive aid from the corps are often years behind in their studies. Members have dealt with eighth grade students at fourth grade reading levels and worse. Corps members may also encounter students with special needs or with severe disciplinary problems, such as chair throwing. TFA corps members work as teachers for two years before going on to use their expertise in education or another sector entirely.
The panel was moderated by Georgetown alumnus Anthony Pena (SFS ’10), who is in his first year of teaching in Baltimore. Pena knew firsthand about the problems faced by D.C. schools, and was enthusiastic to do something about them. “It’s always about the kids, bring it back to the kids,” he said, before introducing the panelists.
The panel opened with comments from Daniel Porterfield, senior vice president for strategic development at Georgetown. Porterfield has previously been involved with TFA and taught several of the panelists during their time at Georgetown. A strong advocate of the program, Porterfield said he the quality and depth of Georgetown’s applicant pool to the program was one of its greatest strengths. He also discussed the unique opportunity provided by TFA – an avenue not generally open to the new graduate.
The panel included Kari Chong (MSB ’09), Nkiruka Ogbuchiekwe (COL ’09), Mike Griffin (COL ’05), Jessica Smyth and Monica Escobar (COL ’07).
During the Q-and-A session, the panelists recalled the intensity of their roles beyond the classroom. The majority of the panelists said they made house and phone calls concerning their students, forming personal relationships with their students. They also said they immersed themselves in the community by attending events and sports games, for example. For the students, Griffin said, TFA corps members may be the first teachers to ever care about their well-being and performance. “[Teachers that] did not just cared about them but believed that they could be successful,” he said.
Though the panelists hailed the shared resources TFA offers – including forums for advice and sharing of lesson plans – they also said they recognized the individual nature of their work. The teachers often start with TFA tools but tailor them to their classrooms and teaching styles.
Brian Cook, a corps member in his first year of teaching, acknowledged that there are other programs doing work similar to TFA but that he chose TFA because he wanted to “sprint,” not “jog.”We don’t have time to jog,” he said.
Cook acknowledged many still have issues with the program. But according to Amanda Mills, TFA senior recruitment director, TFA retains 92 percent of its members. This is a steeper rate than the 84 percent retention of regular teachers in low-income schools and the 86 percent national average rate of all new teachers. Mills added that TFA closely monitors teacher satisfaction levels by conducting a yearly survey of member satisfaction, professional development and feedback.

A recent study heralds good news for Georgetown students: College graduates are going to be a hot commodity in the U.S. economy through 2018.
A Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce study, “Help Wanted: Projections of Jobs and Education Requirements Through 2018,” published by Anthony Carnevale, Nicole Smith and Jeff Strohl, predicts that the United States will be short 300,000 workers with associate’s, bachelor’s degrees or better by 2018.
Georgetown’s Career Center took the report on employment options in stride, sticking to its philosophy on the importance of the individual job search.
“Despite these encouraging employment numbers for candidates with college degrees, I still think that each student must take an individualized approach to their career when choosing between employment or graduate school after graduation,” Mike Schaub, executive director of the Georgetown Career Education Center said.
With a shortage of workers, why does the unemployment rate – currently at 9.6 percent according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics – remain high? According to the report, the modernization of jobs once dependent on workers is behind the statistic.
“Hundreds of thousands of low-skill jobs in manufacturing, farming, fishing and forestry have been permanently destroyed because the recession has further prompted employers to either automate those positions or ship them offshore to take advantage of cheap labor,” the report said.
As the U.S. economy continues to move away from manufacturing and agriculture, about 63 percent of all jobs will require secondary education by 2018. This presents a clear advantage for current college students, but leaves few options for those without a post-secondary education. “High school graduates and dropouts will find themselves largely left behind: unemployed, underemployed or likely stuck in jobs that don’t provide middle-class wages in the coming decade,” said Smith, co-author of the report.
Despite favorable projections, students are not celebrating their competitive edge just yet.
“While there are certainly more jobs than in years past, unemployment is still high and the market is still quite competitive,” Caitlin Maguire (COL ’11) said. But moving into the coming decade, the report, which also predicts trends in job growth by industry, stresses not simply the pursuit of a post-secondary education, but the hunt for training in high-demand jobs.
“It is probably smart to think of preparing for occupations that are forecast to have high growth potential,” Smith said. “Broadly defined, they include health care professional and technical occupations, education occupations, science technology, engineering and mathematical occupations and community services and the arts occupations.”
And Georgetown students see the potential in this.
“More jobs won’t hurt,” said Michael Lonie (COL ’11), who has considered a variety of options after graduation including Teach for America, working right away and graduate school. “I think [the need for college graduates in the job market] will take the pressure off a lot of college students who are looking right now.”
Regardless of the industry chosen by today’s college student, there will still not be enough college-educated workers to meet the demand of the U.S. economy over the next decade. According to the report, U.S. colleges would need to increase the number of degrees they administer by 10 percent each year in order to keep up with demand. Meeting this demand, at least in part, the report insists, “is not a challenge we can afford to ignore.

With less than two weeks to go until midterm elections, students aren’t the only ones on campus engaged in the political process. Georgetown employees and professors have donated over $70,000 to politicians across the nation in the past two years, with the overwhelming percentage of the contributions headed to Democratic contenders.
According to OpenSecrets, 77 university employees – including faculty, associate vice presidents and even men’s basketball Head Coach John Thompson III – together donated 142 times in the past two years, accruing a total of $74,565.
Over 70 percent of the funds went toward Democratic candidates. $39,700 was given directly to the candidates, with an additional $12,665 donated to Democratic committees or political action committees affiliated with the Democratic Party.
Only 10 donations totaling $3,900 were made to Republican candidates, while two donations totaling $2,500 were given to Republican-affiliated PACs and Republican committees. Nonpartisan organizations received more than Republicans – almost $13,000 – from Georgetown employees, with much of the money going to professional medical associations.
Despite these trends, Georgetown’s Vice President of Federal Relations Scott Fleming, who made personal campaign contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, said that he did not believe the numbers indicated any institutional bias.
“When I came to Georgetown, when a Republican administration had just taken office, I was not asked about my political beliefs nor do I believe they were in any way a consideration in my hiring,” Fleming wrote in an email.
Fleming added that many participants in congressional races are Georgetown alumni, which spurs employee donations to friends or acquaintances.
Geoffrey Bible (COL ’12), chairman of the Georgetown University College Republicans, was not surprised by the statistics.
“Universities are well known to be bastions of liberal policies and politicians. I am happy to see that there are a few members of the faculty and staff donating to Republican candidates, but I do not think this will have any effect on the upcoming election,” Bible said in an email.
Bryan Woll (COL ’12), president of the Georgetown University College Democrats, said he saw it as a positive sign.
“I think that the fact that our distinguished faculty chooses to support Democrats speaks volumes about our party and its candidates,” Woll said in an email.
Georgetown employees have not donated nearly as extensively as those at peer universities, however. The University of California system’s employees have donated $483,981 over the past two years and Harvard’s contributions totaled $424,478.
At every educational institution in the top 10 of donating employees, a majority of the funds donated were given to Democratic candidates or committees, according to OpenSecrets.
Public universities tended to give more proportionally to Democrats, with the University of California donating 86 percent of funds to Democrats, and the University of Texas giving 83 percent. Among private universities, Harvard donated 77 percent to Democrats, Stanford 75 percent and Columbia 72 percent.
Among the top educational organizations that gave a majority of their donations to Republicans, four of them come from traditionally southern states, such as Alabama, Kentucky and Georgia.
Notable recipients of funds from Georgetown employees include Tom Perriello, one-time Democratic incumbent from the conservative 5th District of Virginia; Moveon.org, the noted liberal nonprofit organization; Russ Feingold, embattled incumbent senator from Wisconsin; Al Franken, first-time senator from Minnesota who engaged in a long-term legal battle to win his election last year; and Sander Levin, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.”

Former President of Colombia Alvaro Uribe Velez’s presence on campus continues to incite opposition in the form of student protests, combined with vocal dissent from some members of the Jesuit community.
Demonstrations against Uribe’s appointment as a Distinguished Scholar in the Practice of Global Leadership are expected early next month, following protests upon Uribe’s arrival in early September.
Nico Udu-gama, an organizer for the School of Americas Watch and a key player in the public dissent at Georgetown, said plans are in the works to hold a speak-out in Red Square on the afternoon of Nov. 3.
Charity Ryerson, a student at the Law Center, heads the coalition of human rights organizations that is a part of the Law Center’s broader Georgetown Human Rights Action group, which is helping organize the Red Square event.
According to Ryerson, stations will be set up around Red Square prior to the arrival of speakers on Nov. 3, each detailing many of Uribe’s policies cited by opposition groups. The demonstration is slated to occur while the former president delivers a lecture in the Intercultural Center nearby.
“When we win this campaign and Uribe is forced to leave Georgetown, a message will be sent that our community does not condone the model of politics Uribe represents,” Ryerson added.
The group of protesters accuses the former president of human rights violations and violence, including his involvement in the “false positives scandal,” which alleged that members of the Colombian military recruited citizens to engage in killings, according to a 2008 report in The New York Times.
Colombian Jesuit Javier Giraldo Moreno expressed his concerns in a recent letter to another Jesuit priest in the United States, anti-war activist Fr. John Dear, S.J. The letter was later reproduced and sent to University President John J. DeGioia with the signatures of over 150 scholars.
Dear was once a part of the Georgetown community when, with Daniel Porterfield, senior vice president for strategic development, he helped to found the D.C. Schools Project in 1984.
“I am totally appalled that Georgetown University has welcomed this mass murderer. I think he should still be disinvited today. [His presence on campus] makes a mockery of any Jesuit ideals or Christian values. By having him here, Georgetown is saying that we support the teaching of mass murder instead of peace and the teachings of Jesus,” Dear told THE HOYA.
Dear said he contacted the Office of the President, as well Fr. John Langan, S.J., the rector of the Jesuit community and Dean Carol Lancaster of the School of Foreign Service to express his concerns over the matter in the beginning of September.
“Most of them did not return my calls. Those, however, whom I spoke with expressed ignorance to the war crimes and history of Uribe,” he said.
While many have welcomed the opportunity to hear from a global leader and to engage in dialogue with the former president, Dear said he believes the discussion should not be welcomed.
“That is an old argument that [former University President] Fr. Tim Healy used to say to me when I lived at Georgetown and [helped to found] the D.C. Schools Project. We need all viewpoints,” he said, recalling his time at the university. “Would we welcome Hitler? That would be the epitome. In my mind, let other schools do that. But, for a Jesuit university, we are supposed to teach the gospel.”
In his interview with THE HOYA, Dear expressed particular concern for students in the SFS community. He said he thinks they should not be learning the nuances of international affairs and war resolution from “murderers,” but rather from peacemakers the likes of Ghandi and Martin Luther King Jr.
“As a Jesuit, I am embarrassed and shocked,” he ended. “Georgetown needs to repent in its complicity with bringing Uribe here.”
The university, however, continues to defend its decision to hire Uribe.
“Georgetown is not endorsing the political views or government policies enacted by an individual, but realizing the value in allowing a world leader’s experience to be part of campus dialogue,” said university spokeswoman Julie Bataille in an email.
“Students are given the unique opportunity to inquire themselves about the decisions made during President Uribe’s time in public office and gain a better understanding of current international affairs.”
She also noted that Uribe’s role in the faculty is unique: He is neither tenure-track nor a full-time member of the faculty and was not hired through a formal search process.
“He is a distinguished scholar in the practice of global leadership and as such, is on campus four times per year (twice a semester) to participate in seminars and lectures,” she said.
At a rally in Red Square in early September, protesters held signs and later conducted sit-ins during some of the former president’s lectures on campus.
Most recently, according to Newsweek, on Sept. 27 more than 150 scholars including 10 Georgetown professors called on DeGioia to dismiss Uribe by signing the reproduced letter originally sent to Dear.
Contained in the letter were statements denouncing Uribe for supporting and defending paramilitary groups, corruption during his administration and the murder of civilians, among other accusations.
Members of the Georgetown community who signed the letter include: Osama Abi-Mershed, assistant professor of history; Marc Chernick, visiting associate professor of government; Jean-Max Guieu, professor of French; Maurice Jackson, associate professor of history and African-American Studies; Rev. Ray Kemp, senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center; Mark Lance, professor of philosophy; Rev. Joseph Palacios, assistant professor, Center for Latin American Studies; Joanne Rappaport, professor of anthropology and Spanish, and numerous alumni.
Chernick told Newsweek that he is unhappy to count Uribe among his colleagues. “We’re quite dismayed that a man that has this level of allegations against him has been invited to teach and be affiliated with Georgetown,” Chernick said.
On the ground, opponents to Uribe’s posting have said any pushes back against their protest have strengthened their passion for the issue.
While attending one of Uribe’s visits to a comparative politics class in September, Udu-gama was removed from the class by campus police for shouting insults and subsequently arrested by Metro police. Despite spending the night in jail, Udu-gama said he feels his arrest was only empowering.
“It’s not a setback at all. On the contrary, it makes us [activists] more determined that ever to continue speaking out against this appointment,” Udu-Gama said.
Ryerson has held various positions in groups relating to Colombian human rights throughout undergraduate and law school, and said that she committed to this position because she has “many friends who have been victimized in various ways by the Uribe administration and the military under his leadership.”
Following the planned protest on Nov. 3, notable Colombian journalist Hollman Morris is expected to make an appearance and speak with those protesting at Georgetown, according to Udu-Gama. Morris is known to be an outspoken critic of Colombian affairs.
According to The Washington Post, Uribe attached Morris to the largest rebel group in Colombia, known as the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Columbia (FARC).
Previously, Morris was also denied a U.S. travel visa due to the “terrorist activities” portion of the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act of 2001. In a speech last year, Uribe was said to have labeled him an “accomplice to terrorism.”
Udu-gama said that it is a possibility that Morris may also join members of the speak-in during the afternoon in Red Square.

Julie Shuster (COL ’13) was sitting quietly in her pajamas last year when her Harbin resident assistant came into her room to search for alcohol. Though she had two empty beer cans on her desk, Shuster was entirely sober, and she was speaking with a friend, easily visible through the open door.
“She didn’t have any reason to come in,” said Shuster, who says that the RA made her pour out over $50 worth of alcohol that was found.
“The weird part was that she was with some friends, and her friends just came in and made comments about the alcohol,” Shuster said. “It was really awkward.”
RA behavior has come under scrutiny recently as students have voiced similar complaints over what they consider to be overly ambitious RAs on duty. One Henle Village resident and his roommates, all of whom asked to remain anonymous due to the legal implications of their actions, were subjected to several consequences including academic probation and mandatory community service requirements after they were cited on Sept. 11 for having three open beers.
According to one of the residents, four people had been listening to music around 9 p.m. and playing FIFA World Cup with the window open when the on-duty RA approached them about the noise. Although the apartment is on the top level of the complex, the RA reportedly said that he had also seen the residents arranging cups in “a triangular fashion” from outside the apartment.
The citation came just one day after the apartment had been visited by DPS concerning a party. Although one of the residents was not present at the first documentation, all three were put on apartment living suspension, which bars them from applying for an apartment for next year. As mandated by their sanctions, they paid fines, wrote essays and saw alcohol abuse counselors.
“It’s strange that they would even suggest a substance abuse counselor. They didn’t really look at the situation, they just gave me blanket statements,” one of the residents said. “My sanctions weren’t high-risk behavior, and I wasn’t endangering anyone around me.”
According to Stephanie Lynch, director of the Office of Residence Life, RA documentations are meant only to enforce university policies. After the write-up occurs, punitive measures are administered by the Office of Student Conduct.
“University policies are generally set for legal considerations, health and safety and community living,” she said. She also observed that there is no quota for documentations.
“RAs would be considered for rehiring even if they didn’t come across situations that warranted documentation,” she said in an email.
With the policies set in place, RAs are left to decide whether stringently enforcing the rules is really the best policy. Alumna and former New South RA Mollie Schmitz (COL ’10) did not consider her approach to be overly lenient on students, but she never saw her RA duty as purely a policing job.
“I felt my job as an RA was to make my residents’ first year at Georgetown as good as possible, never to make it worse,” she said.
“Junior year, I documented one freshman,” she said. “He was being silly, to say the least. He had poured rock salt down the hallway. The kid was cool, and he knew that he was asking for it.”
Schmitz said that some RAs are very strict, but that most are fair.
“You have to have some RAs who lay down the law so that you are taken seriously, and there are RAs that try to party with their kids, but most have a pretty good balance,” she said.
While residents are often understanding of the duties that an RA has to perform, those RAs who seem to make restrictions their primary concentration frustrate some students. Mike Garza (COL ’12) complained about a Henle RA whom he sees as invasive.
“He knocked on my door to tell me to turn down the TV,” he said. “I mean, come on.”
Tommy Muller (MSB ’13) said that he knows that “the rules are the rules,” but that he thinks Residence Life and Student Conduct should not take the consequences too far.
“I think there is a place where [RAs] have to be strict, if alcohol becomes an issue in controlling the dorm,” he said. “There should be a way to handle the rules without people losing housing.”
Cognizant of the need to enforce the rules, many students still observed that RAs are students themselves, and that they would hope to get a little sympathy from their peers when caught in compromising positions.
Ultimately, Schmitz said that the RA-resident relationship is one of respect.
“I tried to be respectful of them and encourage them to have fun, while still ensuring that the noisier residents were mindful of their neighbors who wanted some peace and quiet,” she said in an email. “If you have a good relationship with your residents, then I think that they respect you and make your job easier.”

The GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee proposed a new reform to funnel the entirety of the $100 per-student mandatory Student Activities Fee toward student groups, in a move that could more than double organizations’ funding to between $650,000 to $700,000.
“We want to do a better job of addressing student need in the short run,” said committee member Tyler Sax (COL ’13) during a press conference held by Georgetown University Student Association’s Finance and Appropriations Committee Wednesday night.
Currently, half of the Student Activities Fee paid by all undergraduates is allocated to student groups, while the other half is placed into a special endowment.
Since it was established in 2001, the endowment’s accrued interest has been placed into a separate account as a result of a university clerical error. Currently, this interest totals about $500,000.
The endowment was originally intended to reach $10 million, at which point the interest would be enough to make the reserve self-sustaining. According to GUSA, however, due to the recession and the undelivered promise of a $3 million startup contribution from the university, the endowment now totals $1.9 million and will probably not reach the $10 million goal for several decades.
Members of the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee (Fin/App Committee) said that the current policy governing the fee and endowment is not functional. They presented a series of proposals at their press conference, the first and most influential of which would be to put all of the Student Activities Fee toward funding student groups.
“There’s no question over past years, the fee issue has been messy, but we [are] dealing with reality of today,” committee member Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) said.
The Fin/App Committee also proposed increasing the fee on a yearly basis to match the rate of inflation.
The Fin/App Committee hopes to maintain the current $1.9 million endowment as it is, without directing any new student fees toward the pool. Instead, the proposed plan is slated to take the money gained from interest and place the amount of inflation back into the endowment. For example, if the interest was 5 percent and inflation was still 3 percent, 3 percent of the interest would go back into the endowment while 2 percent of the interest would go into the Student Activities Fee.
Senators did not discuss how they would use the $1.9 million endowment, but said the matter would be treated at a later time, following passage of the referendum.
Members of the Fin/App Committee stressed that this proposal was only the first step toward more extensive changes.
“This is a starting point,” said Committee Chairman Greg Laverriere (COL ’12). We want to put something out there so that people can have a rough understanding of the possibilities.”
The next step to this reform is a series of two town halls to gauge student response. The first of the two meetings will take place on Oct. 27 at 8 p.m. in Reiss 112.
After fielding input from students, the Fin/App Committee will reconvene to discuss the feedback. For approval, the legislation will first need the support of two-thirds of the Fin/App Committee, followed by two-thirds of the Senate.
The Fin/App committee, along with six student chairs of the advisory boards, originally gained control over the student activities fee funding through the 2006 Accountability and Reform referendum. Last year, GUSA passed sweeping legislation to make the seven members of the Fin/App Committee the sole voting members.
As for the actual timeline of the legislation, Laverriere said that the deadline for the referendum is the budget summit next spring, but that GUSA hoped to complete the process sooner.
If the referendum is passed, GUSA will evaluate the proposals of student groups to determine the allotment of the interest fund and student activities fee. Laverriere said that SAC and club sports were high on the list for funding increases.
“If the referendum goes forward, hopefully a lot of people will support it, but it should be important to note that this is not just opening the floodgates, there will still be a very responsible allocations process,” Malkerson said.”

A laptop was stolen from a Village A residence early Saturday morning. There was no one in the residence at the time and entry to the apartment was not forced.
The suspect entered through an unlocked door and stole the laptop out of a bookbag, according to a Public Safety Alert sent out by the Department of Public Safety on Wednesday evening. The theft occurred at 12:45 a.m. on Oct. 16, according to DPS Sgt. David Ruiz.
There are no leads on the suspect and the investigation is ongoing, Ruiz said.
In the face of the latest burglary, DPS urged students to be more alert and lock their doors. Three similar crimes have occurred on or near campus this semester. On Sept. 9, a suspect entered an unsecured residence on the 1400 block of 37th Street and stole a laptop. On Sept. 29, an unknown male entered an apartment in Henle Village through an unlocked door and stole a laptop and various other electronic items while the residents sat in the living room of the apartment. On Oct. 7, a laptop, two televisions, credit cards and other items were stolen from a house on the 3800 block of S Street while one of the residents was asleep; the suspect also entered through an unlocked door.
“Students just can’t leave their doors unlocked. Crime happens, and students need to be more conscious and lock doors,” Ruiz said.
Other burglaries this semester have occurred as a result of forced entry, however. On Sept. 17, a suspect broke into a house on the 3600 block of T Street and stole jewelry, cash, a laptop and other personal items. On Sept. 26, an unknown suspect broke into a house on the 1300 block of 35th Street and stole various electronic items and an undetermined amount of cash.”

Currently, as is the case every fall, undergraduates have the opportunity to make a lasting impact on Georgetown through the Re-Imagining Georgetown (RIG) Partnership, which awards up to $10,000 in grants to those with a vision for improving student life on the Hilltop. A collaborative effort among The Corp, GUASFCU and THE HOYA, RIG has given rise to such popular campus traditions as the annual Run For Rigby and 25 Days of Service.
The three organizations, each active in the Georgetown community for over 20 years, contribute their respective publicity, financial and planning skills as well as $5,000 each in annual contributions to ensure that students have the money and support necessary to implement their proposals. A rotating chairmanship gives members of each group the opportunity to head the initiative every third year and bring their unique expertise to the table.
“We’re all a part of the Georgetown community and we all have ideas to make it better. As responsible members of the community, we want to make sure these ideas have the financial backing to make them realities,” said GUASFCU CEO and current RIG chair Arjun Mehta (SFS ’11).
The competition for RIG grants typically draws about 20 applicants each year, a field that is eventually narrowed down to anywhere from one to four finalists who are announced in mid-November. Past winning projects have included Address Unknown, a fine arts initiative celebrating the D.C.’s homeless population by facilitating storytelling through theater, song and spoken word poetry. Even closer to home, The Saxa Service Feast brought students and faculty together to raise money and awareness for various campus groups and nonprofits.
2009 grant recipient Joel Ziebell (COL `10) used his appropriated funding to finance Jack Wings 2010, a wing-eating contest whose proceeds went to charity. According to Ziebell, “Applying for and receiving a Re-Imagine Georgetown grant is a pin-point example of why Georgetown is unique. The fact that student organizations fund the grant and thus enable the student body to create and carry out their own project highlights the close-knit community, family that Georgetown is.”
Daniel Alexander (MSB ’11) proposed and received approval for his project to advance the alternative music scene on campus during the 2009-2010 round of grant applications. A year later, he is preparing to host the first show of the Georgetown Alternative Music Series, to be held Nov. 12 in Leavey’s Bulldog Alley. The grant money he received will be covering the costs of the equipment, artists and space necessary to provide Georgetown students exposure to great live music.
“The Re-Imagine Georgetown Initiative truly captures the entrepreneurial and philanthropic spirit that makes Georgetown an amazing community. The three entirely student-run organizations that provide the grants have proven their ability to both provide students with a needed service and give back to the community,” Alexander said.
ehta explained the application process. “Basically, all applicants have to be undergrads, and the idea that they’re pitching needs to re-envision Georgetown. Applicants need a concrete idea, not something nebulous, which involves a plan, contacts, and previous research.”
This year’s applications are due by Nov. 12 and all students are encouraged to contact RIG via email at reimaginegeorgetowngmail.com.

While Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) may have most likely sealed her re-election as the D.C. voice in the House of Representatives by winning the Democratic primary, she will still face an eclectic mix of candidates in the general election.
On Nov. 2, Norton, who has served as a delegate in the House for 20 years, will be running against Republican Missy Reilly Smith, Rick Tingling-Clemmons of the D.C. Statehood Green Party, and Sandra Queen Noble, who is running for the minority party Helping Equal Rights Opportunity She’s Helping Equal Rights Opportunity.
Smith, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary, but has not been officially endorsed by the Republican Party of Washington, D.C., has made abortion the key issue of her campaign.
“I believe that the family is the nucleus of society, and that the government should adopt policies that protect children and the family at all stages of life,” Smith wrote in the District of Columbia Voter Guide.
To garner more support for her cause, Smith’s campaign committee paid for two graphic abortion advertisements that she is attempting to have aired on major D.C. television networks. According to Politico, it would be against federal law for the stations to refuse to broadcast them.
Tingling-Clemmons is running as the official candidate of the D.C. Statehood Green Party, a group that is seeking to have D.C. inducted as the 51st state into the union. Tingling-Clemmons, who has worked with famed Green Party candidate Ralph Nader on multiple occasions, claims Norton has not pushed strongly enough for statehood.
“The treatment of statehood has been just short of a mockery … To be ruled by committee and have a 30-day approval for all laws passed by our council is an affront to self-governance,” Tingling-Clemmon wrote on his campaign website.
Noble, on the other hand, is running for Congress representing the H.E.R.O.S.H.E.R.O. party, officially labeled as a “Minor Party” by the District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics.
Noble, who has run for president five times and three times for mayor of Cincinnati, claims that the government stole her babies in Hollywood, and is currently suing the “Stolen United States of America,” Kenneth Lewis and the Bank of America, for $994 trillion.
It is highly unlikely that these candidates will be unable to defeat Norton, however. Norton won the Democratic Primary on Sept. 14, with 90 percent of the vote. In addition, 78 percent of registered voters in D.C. view Norton favorably, according to The Washington Post. Around 78 percent of D.C. voters are registered or lean Democratic, according to a Gallup Poll. “
