The university is making headlines in the technology community following the release of a case study on the efficacy of telecommunications and videoconferencing in university classrooms.
Since 2008, the Hilltop has been home to a “global classroom,” featuring cutting-edge audiovisual communications technology, which students and faculty use to interact with their peers at the School of Foreign Service campus in Doha, Qatar.
The study, titled “Immersive Telepresence Solutions and Managed Services at Georgetown University,” was recently released by Glowpoint, the international video communication services provider that oversees and provides tech support for the global classroom. It details the educational and monetary benefits the university has been experiencing since the global classroom got its start at Georgetown two years ago.
The product of the collaborative efforts of the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship and the university’s technology staff, the global classroom stemmed from frustration over several failed trial runs with technologies that lacked the clarity and workability essential to the day-to-day functioning of the typical university classroom. Since 2000, CNDLS’s mission has been to integrate technology and pedagogic theory into new tools to improve the learning process for both teachers and students.
“We were trying to develop some classes that would take place both on the D.C. campus and on the Doha campus. The one thing that we really wanted was for a faculty member to walk into the room and not have to think about anything but teaching the class, so it would be basically seamless to connect,” said Randy Bass, the executive director of CNDLS.
After several experiences with technologies that produced less than satisfactory results, Bass put together a working group charged with finding a product that would allow students on both continents to feel like they were in the same classroom. From a functional standpoint, Assistant Director of Classroom Educational Technology Services John Steitz emphasized the need for the new international classroom to be accessible to faculty. “You want a system [in which] the faculty don’t have to know how it works. [If] they can work their own laptop, they know about as much as they need to use this room.”
Reflecting on her first experience with the global classroom, professor of international migration Susan Martin admits, “At first it was a bit intimidating to use the Telepresence classroom, but it is actually quite easy. The challenge was to integrate the two sides of the classroom. After only a couple of classes, they really relaxed and began to function more as a classroom.”
The students have had an equally positive reaction.
“You get to learn from people of different cultures that you wouldn’t normally meet, and I think this type of technology really opens means of communication between different people, between different groups,” Claudia Triana (SFS ’11) said.
“You learn so much in a classroom from the other students. When you can really use a global classroom to get students with completely and utterly different perspectives, it adds a whole new understanding of the readings and what you’re discussing,” Julie Walz (SFS ’10) said.
The benefits stretch beyond an overwhelmingly positive response from students and staff the university has saved thousands of dollars in travel costs that were once used to bring guest speakers to campus.
“[With] the level at which it is used and the value it gives back both in terms of education and in terms of business solutions, there is no question that it’s worth everything we have spent on it, and I don’t think anyone regrets it,” Bass said.

Georgetown researchers at Lombardi Cancer Center may have discovered a cancer-killing treatment that implements a cold virus in the destruction of cancer cells.
The virus, known as reovirus, is known to cause gastrointestinal problems and infect the respiratory tract. When interacting with tumors, however, it evolves rapidly and destroys them.
A team of researchers, headed by Deepa Subramanium, interim-chief of the Thoracic Medical Oncology Program, has begun preparing for an upcoming clinical trial focused on a certain type of cancer: “advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer with a specific tumor profile.”
This kind of cancer is particularly vulnerable to viral attack, making reovirus an ideal solution.
“This is a subset of cancer [for which] we haven’t had many successes in terms of finding drugs that extend life after diagnosis. This trial represents an attempt to seek and destroy cancer by choosing a treatment based on specific tumor characteristics,” Subramanium said.
Participants in the clinical trial will be treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin, as well as reovirus. According to a press release, the researchers have genetically altered the virus so that it will not infect healthy cells. This virus will only grow in tumor cells, hopefully destroying the cancer-infected cells. Researchers are looking to see if the virus effectively reduces tumors, as well as any side effects of the two other medications. The clinical trial is sponsored by Oncolytics Biotech, Inc.
It is not known when results of the trial will be available.

Georgetown University Student Association passed a bill Sunday to allocate a budget for small discretionary spending by its committees in order to avoid consulting the Finance and Appropriation Committee for small amounts of money.
This bill will allocate $1,000 per year to the three committees besides Fin/App, with $250 each going to the Academic Affairs and Student Life Committees. The Community Building and Outreach Committee will receive $500 in order to account for the added expenses incurred due to town halls and tabling.
“I believe today’s bill will make it easier for the other committees in the senate to accomplish issues on their agendas. By giving them a budget, it means they don’t have to come to the [Fin/App] Committee for every small expenditure,” Fin/App Chair Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) said.
“Giving committees a budget will allow them to accomplish more throughout the year and streamline the way the senate does business,” Laverriere said.
The senate voted to add an amendment, which stated that if a committee exceeds the allocated sum, it may present an itemized list of expenditures to the Fin/App Committee for additional funding.
The bill passed with an overwhelming vote of 20-1.
GUSA also announced that its new website would be launched in two weeks. The new page will feature senator profiles, complete with pictures and short mission statements. The web address will remain the same as the current GUSA website, gustudentassociation.com.
“The new GUSA website will enable students to get involved with the organization through increased participation and communication, helping us become a more transparent and effective body,” said senate speaker Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12) in an email.
Additionally, GUSA Vice President Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) announced the possibility of introducing Zipcars to the Georgetown campus.
He said that GUSA and representatives from Zipcar were in the process of discussing ways in which it may be possible to bring the service to campus.
“Zipcars are an innovative campus service that will make our campus more accessible, connecting students with the surrounding area and downtown D.C.,” Mortillaro said.
According to Kluger, the Zipcars could be parked in the homes of students in Burleith, or at student apartments, many of which have driveways. Zipcar would pay Georgetown students for the use of the spots; the contracts would be formed on a monthly basis.

In an interview with student press today, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and university spokeswoman Julie Bataille addressed a number of lingering questions surrounding Saturday’s drug lab incident in Harbin Hall.
When asked about the disciplinary status of John Romano (COL ’14) and Charles Smith (SFS ’14) – the residents of Room 926, where a DMT lab was found early Saturday morning – Olson declined to comment in depth on the ongoing investigation by the Office of Student Conduct, citing confidentiality concerns.
At an arraignment today at U.S. District Court of D.C., Romano was released from custody and relieved of all charges. Smith and campus visitor Joseph Perrone face federal charges of \”conspiracy to manufacture\” and \”possession with intent to distribute\” the drug DMT and are being held without bond.
“The students are not on campus at this time . We take matters like this very seriously,” Olson said.
Olson made clear that disciplinary action may be taken against any students found to have been collaborating with the suspects.
“We are certainly trying to get as full of an understanding of this situation as we can,” Olson said.
Officials from various emergency response teams searched Harbin on Saturday to clear the residence hall of hazardous and illicit materials. When asked about repercussions for any students found to be in possession of contraband items or other drugs, Olson said consequences could be in store.
“I would not rule that out. When there are legitimate reasons to search a residence hall space . and illegal drugs are found, that can lead to Student Conduct action,” Olson said.
Olson also confirmed earlier reports by The Hoya that the initial triggering of Harbin fire alarms to alert students of the evacuation failed. According to Olson, the residence hall’s alarms underwent a routine inspection just last week and passed fire safety standards along with other on-campus buildings. Though the alarms did not sound at first, Olson said internal mechanisms succeeded in alerting Department of Public Safety and Office of Residence Life staff, who evacuated Harbin residents around 6 a.m.
“We certainly were concerned about [the fire alarms failing to sound]. We’ve had technicians looking at it but they have assured us it was a one-time problem,” Olson said. Bataille confirmed that the alarm system in Harbin passed an inspection by the D.C. Fire Marshals today.
Acknowledging Saturday’s emergency response was a “complex situation,” Olson said he felt the university’s reaction demonstrated coordination among involved parties, even as many Harbin residents and other students voiced concerns on Saturday over effective communication by the university. Olson’s first email communicating with Harbin residents, many of whom were evacuated without time to grab their laptops or personal belongings, was delivered at 1:31 p.m., over seven hours after the first evacuation of the freshman dorm. The greater student body was forwarded the same message by Olson shortly after 2 p.m. Saturday, as Hazmat, MPD and Drug Enforcement Administration teams worked to respond.
“We believed that the focus and the central need was to work with Harbin residents,” Olson said. Bataille added, “Immediate safety concerns were to make sure that Harbin got evacuated.”
Neither the HOYAlert system – the university’s emergency notification system – nor the Campus Alert System – a series of steam whistles that signal to the university community to take shelter when activated – were utilized by the university on Saturday. Olson said that he and other officials were not concerned about the threat to wider on- and off-campus areas.
“It was clear to us from all the guidance we were getting that there was not a threat to the broader community. There was not a safety risk to the broader community,” Olson said. According to Olson, road closures in the area Saturday morning were unrelated to the discovery of the clandestine drug lab, but instead were due to a 10-mile road race occurring on Sunday.
As national and local media outlets began to pick up on reports of an undercover drug lab at Georgetown, the university reported to news media that the discovery was an \”alleged\” methamphetamine or drug lab; news outlets, however, later narrowed down the drug in question to meth. Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Hugh Carew confirmed early Saturday afternoon that the lab was intended for manufacturing an illegal hallucinogenic drug called Dimethyltryptamine (DMT).
Olson closed the meeting by commenting on the university’s interaction with the families of the suspects. \”The university looks to support and communicate with family members in difficult situations such as this,\” he said.

Ninth-graders from two D.C. public high schools paid a visit to the Hilltop on Friday as part of D.C.’s College Awareness Month.
Students from Columbia Heights Educational Campus and Phelps High School were greeted by Georgetown student volunteers and were guided in several activities including a discussion with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, lunch at O’Donovan Hall and a campus tour led by Blue and Gray.
The event, which was organized by a 17-person student committee in conjunction with D.C.’s Double the Numbers coalition and Georgetown’s Ward 7 Initiative, was meant to expose inner-city high school students to a university setting and encourage them to pursue higher education. According to DTN, only 9 percent of ninth-graders in D.C. public schools graduate high school in five years and continue on to graduate college, a number that amounts to less than half the national percentage.
“This is a looming crisis for them and all of us,” the organization’s website states.
Ryan Wilson (COL ’12), a student co-chair of the Awareness Day committee, noticed the grim college prospects for D.C. students last year while working on the president’s Diversity Initiative. He suggested the college awareness event and has worked on it with co-chair Cassandra Locke (NHS ’12) for much of the year.
“We wanted to encourage college and the idea that all the students should attend college,” Wilson said.
According to Wilson, the day began with a forceful first activity.
“They did a really powerful icebreaker that asked them to think about the sort of things that could prevent them from going to college,” he said.
In D.C. Public Schools, there is no shortage of obstacles, either. Teachers and parents have been known to be apathetic, and a Washington Post exposé from 2007 noted that the learning environments themselves are often hostile to learning.
“Across the city, nine violent incidents are reported on a typical day, including fights and attacks with weapons. Fire officials receive about one complaint a week of locked fire doors, and health inspections show that more than a third of schools have been infested by mice,” the article said.
Georgetown already has several programs in place in order to encourage members of the D.C. community to overcome these obstacles and pursue college. The Ward 7 Initiative supports a partnership between the university and D.C.P.S., offering programs through the university like DC Reads, After School Kids and the D.C. Street Law High School Clinic. The College Awareness Day added yet another project to Georgetown’s cache of aid programs.
Despite all of this aid, however, DCPS students still face lower acceptance rates than Georgetown’s total average.
“It is a bit lower than the national average. I’d say it’s a 15 to 18 percent round estimate over the last few years,” said Kamilah Holder, senior assistant director of the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions.
For high schoolers just beginning the process, last Friday’s event was much more concentrated on the positives of college rather than the difficulties of getting there. At the very least, the event demonstrated to students the benefits of hard work in high school, and brought the kids outside and away from their own classes for a day.
“They seemed to really enjoy it. All the feedback that we received was really positive,” Wilson said. “Overall a great event, a great opportunity for Georgetown to reach out to students in Ward 7.”

The acceptance rate for legacy students is significantly lower at Georgetown University compared to peer universities, though legacy students still gain a 10 percentage-point boost in the admissions proceedings taking place in White-Gravenor Hall this fall.
According to Charles Deacon, dean of undergraduate admissions, the acceptance rate of legacy students, defined as students whose sibling or parent attended the university, is around 30 percent. The overall acceptance rate to Georgetown for the 2009-2010 school year was around 20 percent. The disparity is much higher at peer universities, however.
At the University of Pennsylvania, 28 percent of legacies are admitted, double the overall acceptance rate of 14 percent, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian. Princeton University admitted 42 percent of legacy students for the Class of 2013, as opposed to 9 percent of non-legacy students, according to The Daily Princetonian.
“[The difference between acceptance rates] is largely because [legacy students] are very strong candidates,” Deacon said. In addition, Deacon pointed to the fact that the children of Georgetown alumni often display the same abilities that led to their parents’ acceptance.
Despite this advantage, many legacy students feel that the status does not harm them once they arrive at Georgetown.
“Undergrads tend not to know who is a legacy,” said Kelly Butler (COL ’14), whose parents and relatives attended Georgetown.
The current freshman class consists of about 9 percent legacy students.
Still, both the university and legacy students insist that a legacy student does not get an easy ride to the university.
“As long as [legacy status is] considered part of a big package, then I think that is legitimate, as long as the student is academically qualified,” Butler said.
Additionally, according to students, admitting legacy students is important to the university.
“I think that it’s important to have legacies on campus to keep a sense of community,” said Amy Esposito (COL ’14), a legacy student. “But I do not believe they should be given any special treatment by the admissions office,” she said.
According to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, there are no specific strategies to recruit legacy students.
“The primary thing is the position of the applicant [in the applicant pool],” Deacon said.
At Georgetown, legacy students are simply another group on a very diverse campus.
“There is a certain bonding that takes place with Georgetown, and by accepting legacy students, we’re forming a student population that’s going to be a very loyal part of the community,” Deacon said.

American University professor Sue Marcum was found murdered in her home Monday morning.
arcum was 52 years old and lived in Bethesda, Md. On Monday, police found her dead in her home, where there were signs of a forced entry and struggle. The case is being treated as a homicide, Montgomery County Police Public Information Officer D.J. Friz told The Eagle, American’s student newspaper.
arcum taught in the Kogod School of Business since 1999 and served as director of the Master of Science in accounting program.
“Professor Marcum was a beloved member of the Kogod community and her sudden death is a tremendous loss to her students and colleagues. A member of the Kogod Accounting faculty, she was a dynamic and engaging teacher,” American University Provost Scott Bass wrote in a message sent out to the campus community on Monday afternoon.
While no Georgetown faculty have been murdered in recent years, there is precedent at other universities. In 2001, two Dartmouth College professors were brutally murdered in their home by two teenagers. In 2009, an anthropology professor at SUNY-Binghamton was murdered; a doctoral student has been indicted on charges of second-degree murder.
