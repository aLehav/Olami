An African-American led market reopened at the Shiloh Family Life Center in Northwest Washington, D.C., on Nov. 25, the first time since the pandemic started in 2020. 
The market will be open every Saturday until Dec. 24. The market is titled “BZB Shop til ya Drop,” an homage to BZB International, a Black woman-owned public relations firm operating more than 100 D.C. businesses. 
In 1990, Juanita Carol Britton, nicknamed “Busy Bee,” started the market, which primarily features Black business vendors selling products including Black dolls, funky earrings and hand-crafted soy candles. 
Britton’s inspiration for the market came after she visited the Brixton Market in London, where she saw a large community of Caribbean artists selling handmade items. 
Esther Iverem, owner of Legacy Quilts and Art — an art studio that will sell its items in the holiday market — said she is excited that BZB is returning to support local artists. 
“With BZB starting up again, it gives a lot of people an opportunity to display and exhibit their work and just find customers,” Iverem told The Hoya. “I think a lot of businesses there do not have a brick-and-mortar location.”
The pandemic disproportionately hit Black businesses, with Black business ownership declining more than 40% between February and April of 2020.  
Iverem said her inspiration for quilting grew after she made a memory quilt for her 16-year-old son. The quilt was made from the bottoms of her son’s jeans, cutoffs, camels, khakis, old jerseys and t-shirts. 
“After that, I continued making things out of reclaimed pants, mainly, reclaimed jeans,” Iverem said. “So in addition to doing wall art and quilts, I created a series of dolls made out of reclaimed pants. That led me to explore all types of issues around denim and fashion.”
Arvid Lee, who runs Stained Glass by Arvid Lee, a stained glass portrait company, will also display his work at the BZB market. He said he will participate in the BZB market because guests there are more likely to purchase his work than at other markets like flea markets. 
Lee said he looks forward to the social aspect of the event. Lee said he is also excited to see familiar faces in artists and customers. 
“The people who attend know it is going to be there every year,” Lee told The Hoya. “I have people who come to the event specifically for me.” 
Lee said he began his journey as an artist in doodling. Lee said he originally worked on pastels, before shifting to the art of stained glass.  
“Even when I would attend art shows in the area, I would see that many artists had the same kind of thing,” Lee said. “I used to doodle a lot. I thought, ‘How can I implement those doodles and do something that is different from what is on the art scene?’ I happened to see a stained glass class. I enjoyed it.”
Lee said that since the start of the pandemic, small business owners have started exploring more creative avenues like social media to share their artistic work.
“What people are doing now is trying to be more creative with marketing, doing more on social media,” Lee said. “They may be looking to see on Etsy or in galleries. They are trying to spread out.” 
Britton was intent on bringing the BZB market back this year to display the work of artists like Lee and Iverem, receiving over 800 calls from people inquiring about the show. Britton predicts that the event, which is expected to host thousands of customers, will bring in around $500,000.
Iverem said the U.S. is facing many economic challenges, but she hopes that with the holidays, many buyers will be able to purchase art from the event.
“Not everyone has money,” Iverem said. “We still have tremendous economic challenges in the country. But, we hope that when people come to the holidays, they may have a few extra dollars that they have set aside.”

Georgetown University students held a vigil to honor the lives lost in an apartment fire that led to the deaths of 10 people in Xinjiang, an autonomous territory in northwest China that is home to the ethnic minority of the Uyghur people. Many have blamed the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) restrictive COVID-19 lockdown policies for the deaths.
Over 50 community members gathered in Red Square on Nov. 30 to commemorate the lost lives by lighting candles and holding up protest banners with slogans like “Stop Lockdown, Free China” and “We Demand Freedom Now.” Since the tragedy, which killed 10 and injured nine, a wave of protests has occurred around the world and, more notably, inside China itself, a rarity in the state considering potential government retaliation.
Protesters believe Chinese President Xi Jinping’s “zero-COVID” policy, which mandates routine lockdowns and community-wide testing, obstructed timely evacuations and prevented rescue teams from accessing the building. The incident sparked further controversy because Uyghur families comprised the majority of victims.
Beijing has arbitrarily detained over one million Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims since 2016, according to the Human Rights Watch. Detained individuals report experiences of torture, sexual abuse, cultural persecution and high level surveillance in the CCP’s reeducation camps, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. 
Protester Howard Xuan (SFS ’23) said the Chinese government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates existing oppression of minority groups.
“The zero-tolerance COVID policy has been an abominable policy. And that combined with the persecution that’s going on in Xinjiang makes it practically doubly as condemnable in front of the CCP,” Xuan told The Hoya.
Yen-Han Chen (COL ’25), a Taiwanese national, said he appreciated the opportunity to practice freedom of speech at the Red Square protest. 
Chen said he participated in the vigil to pay his respects to the victims and express his discontent with the CCP.
“Whether you’re Taiwanese, Hong Kong or anything else, Chinese state violence has always faced someone,” Chen told The Hoya. “And I’m so glad that right now there’s more people who see this as a serious issue, the harm that it causes.”
Chen said a familial history with CCP corruption sparked his interest in the issue.
“For me, the reason is a little more personal. I never got to meet my grandfather. He was a nuclear scientist, and he contracted cancer, likely from his line of work, and there was very little transparency. So I guess, in a way, there’s always this sort of resentment with a state that devalues human rights and human life,” Chen said. 
Several demonstrators also spoke about the importance of public expression and told their own personal stories. One Uyghur graduate student, who asked not to be named in order to protect their identity, said their family witnessed the chaos that erupted in Xinjiang the night of the fire. 
David Song (COL ’26) said the global social media attention on the state’s abuse against Uyghurs prompted him to attend the protest.
“I’ve been following all the protests and the situation on social media,” Song told The Hoya. “I follow a couple of accounts that have posted protest visuals from various cities across the world.”
As dissidents of the CCP often face serious penal consequences, many attendees at the Georgetown vigil wore masks to conceal their identities. 
One international student from China who attended the demonstration, but declined to be named, said they are optimistic about the future of global intervention in China.
“I’m so glad there’s so many people out here to commemorate this tragedy,” the student told The Hoya. “There is racism and discrimination everywhere in the world. But as long as you have progress, as long as people care, that’s the first step to resolving it.”
Xuan said that even if the vigil cannot enact sweeping change, there is value in the shared experience of mourning and protesting together.
“The pessimist in me says that a couple of college students protesting on a U.S. campus somewhere, even if there’s some Chinese people there, might not have much effect,” Xuan said. “But I think maybe just drawing more eyes and ears to what’s going on in China is a benefit in and of itself.”

The Society of Physics Students (SPS) recognized Sophie Taylor (COL ’24) on Oct. 8 for her research on nanoparticles.
Taylor, a physics major, won the award at the Physics Congress, which is held every four years by the SPS in different cities throughout the United States. The SPS is a national professional society for students interested in physics, and this year’s meeting took place in Washington, D.C.
Taylor has worked with Georgetown University physics professor Edward Van Keuren’s lab since May 2021 to validate his theory on the formation of nanoparticles. Taylor’s research for Van Keuren focuses on the effects of certain chemicals on the stability, size and durability of nanoparticles.
Taylor said her research aims to improve drug delivery methods, or the ways that medicines reach necessary locations in the body.
“The way I try to explain it is we are trying to make Advil liquid gel capsules, but super small,” Taylor told The Hoya. “Then the hope is that they will break down at a targeted point in the body to deliver medicine to a specific point, rather than having to have a bunch of medicine coursing through your bloodstream.”
Taylor briefly explained the experimental process applied in her research in a Georgetown College press release.
“On the most basic level, we inject a concentrated solution of different polymers, or chemicals, into a rapidly mixing water,” Taylor said in the statement. “Then, the polymers disperse in such small amounts that they form nanoparticles. We are interested in the mechanisms that govern this so we can create recurring, planned results.”
According to Taylor, the particles she and Van Keuren make right now are created with only one specific polymer. The capsules have a solid shell and a liquid core, and eventually, they hope to be able to switch out the interior of the capsule with various pharmaceutical drugs. 
Eventually, Taylor hopes that her research will lead to the development of capsules that can more effectively deliver drugs to specific areas of the body.
“Right now, the particles we make are made with one specific polymer, and the end goal would be to change out the components of the particles that we’re making and encapsulate a pharmaceutical drug and then have the outer core of the particle be something that would break down at a specific point in the body,” Taylor said.
Van Keuren said that Taylor’s research could potentially help to broaden the helpful uses of nanocapsules, as well as create nanocapsules that are scalable for mass manufacturing.
“The nanocapsules that Sophie has helped develop could have a number of applications, primarily as food additives or in pharma,” Van Keuran wrote to The Hoya. “For example, drugs for treating various conditions could be loaded into the liquid core and then be released in a controlled fashion once administered.”
In the Georgetown College press release, Van Keuren said Taylor has grown as a researcher throughout her time in his lab.
“Sophie has done an outstanding job with her work, and has really progressed into becoming an accomplished researcher,” Van Keuren said in the statement. “She has also gone from just following my instructions to becoming an integral part of the research, suggesting new experiments we could try or models to help us understand the results.”
Taylor said she also plans to present her research at the annual meeting of the mid-Atlantic congregation of the American Physical Society, which will take place from Dec. 2 to 4.
Taylor said she feels grateful for the award and is excited to continue her research in the field. 
“I was super grateful to receive the award,” Taylor said. “It was the first competition that I had entered with my research, and since I had been working on it for about a year and a half now, it was just really cool to have that experience.”

The Paul F. Pelosi Scholars Initiative (PSI) awarded 15 scholarships for the summer of 2023 to Georgetown University School of Foreign Service (SFS) students for their scholastic and extracurricular achievements. 
PSI has recognized the work of 10 to 15 SFS sophomores and juniors who are interested in public service. The program pairs students with mentors who are public service professionals, offers skill training and networking seminars and funds summer internships through stipends to help selected scholars find post-graduate opportunities.
The PSI Program Director Elizabeth Boesen said the selection committee weighs a comprehensive set of factors based on the ideals of public service to assess the large number of applicants.
“The interview panel primarily considered students’ commitment to careers in public service, as evidenced by their community service, internships, coursework and their application essays and letter of rec,” Boesen told The Hoya. 
The 2023 cohort consists of students from a variety of different backgrounds and areas of study. 
Jack Gasdia (SFS ’24), an international politics major, previously volunteered on President Joe Biden’s 2020 New Hampshire primary campaign, and worked at Research and Advisory on International Affairs, a youth-led think tank on international affairs.
Gasdia said he hopes the Pelosi Scholarship will help him further his interest in public service.
“I was not really sure exactly what I was interested in studying or doing with my career, and I still was not even sure if public service broadly defined was what I was interested in,” Gasdia told The Hoya. “But this year, after doing a lot of soul-searching, working at that think tank for the first half of the year and in doing public service work through them, I decided to apply.”
Recipient Sophie Coste (SFS ’24) volunteered at a hospital in Kenya during her gap year in 2020. 
Coste said her first-hand experiences witnessing the hospital’s challenges with local government sparked her interest in preventative healthcare treatment.
“I was able to see a lot of the public policy challenges that governments struggle with just because of their capacity and the money that they have, but I was also able to see how concrete policy solutions can really prevent suffering, deaths and illnesses,” Coste told The Hoya. “That perspective really helped me see the value in public service because it’s more about prevention rather than treatment.”
Sanjana Ranganathan (SFS ’25) worked on a redistricting coalition, as well as an American Legion Auxiliary (ALA) Girls State program, a civic leadership initiative.
Ranganathan said she valued the mentorship component of the PSI program the most when applying, and she is looking forward to learning directly from public service experts about their work experiences.
“My family is primarily engineers, so I do not know anyone who has ever really attempted the public service path other than my peers,” Ranganathan said. “I just am really excited for the opportunity to talk to someone and get advice from someone who has worked in the field and kind of knows a thing or two.”
Fellow cohort member Logan Richman (SFS ’25) is mostly interested in communications, human rights and civil liberties. His prior work as a member of the Free Speech Project and Georgetown Global Consulting sparked his passion for public service. 
Richman said he most looks forward to giving back to the Georgetown community through the program. 
“Being part of a Pelosi Scholar community is something that I was really interested in because I love having that opportunity to be someone that younger students can come to bounce ideas off of, hear about my experiences and engage with them,” Richman told The Hoya. 
Gasdia said he appreciates the program’s institutional support, both in securing internships and helping him connect with peers of similar interests.
“I haven’t finalized exactly what I am gonna be doing, but I am really looking forward to whatever form that takes,” Gasdia said. “But in the meantime, I am just really excited to get to know the other people in my cohort a little bit more and connect with them, talk about similar interests and different interests and really develop those interpersonal connections.”

Disabled individuals sued Washington, D.C., on Nov. 21 for allegedly violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) with the construction of new protected bike lanes.
The Nov. 21 lawsuit filed in federal court alleges that D.C.’s redesigned bike lanes, which lie between sidewalks and parking spots throughout the District, prevent wheelchair users from safely accessing curbside parking, using sidewalk ramps and crossing streets. The D.C. Center for Independent Living (DCCIL), a nonprofit organization that assists disabled D.C. residents, is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. 
According to the lawsuit, new bike lanes on 17th Street NW block disabled residents from entering or exiting parked vehicles. Richard Simms, the executive director of DCCIL, said 14th Street, U Street and P Street are other locations with problematic lanes. 
Simms said the design of the new protected bike lanes will cause safety issues with visually impairments individuals from safely reaching bus stops. 
“What you have to do is you would have to come off the sidewalk, cross a bike lane and go to the bus stop,” Simms told The Hoya. “It is just a tremendous disadvantage to blind people.”
Simms said the DCCIL received several phone calls from disabled District residents complaining about these protected lanes. One phone call detailed a blind woman hit by a bicycle while crossing a protected lane.
D.C. pledged early this year to build ten miles of new protected bike lanes in the next three years, adding to the District’s existing 24 miles of bike lanes. Simms said it is possible for D.C. to build protected bike lanes without harming disabled residents.
“I do think they can coexist with the disability community, but they cannot exist at the expense of the disability community,” Simms said. “All we want to do is give some careful thought to how you implement this stuff.” 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 22% of D.C. adults have a disability. Disabled adults in the District experience significant health disparities and are three times more likely to smoke and have heart disease.
Quill Kukla, a philosophy professor at Georgetown University and the director of the university’s disability studies program, said accessible infrastructure is a basic human right.
“Mobility rights include the right to move through public space, and these are core components of autonomy,” Kukla wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Public life for everyone is enriched when everyone is able to participate in it. An inaccessible space isn’t actually a public space at all, in the morally important sense.”
Amy Kenny, the associate director of Georgetown’s Disability Cultural Initiative, said she wants D.C. officials to give a greater voice to people with disabilities when building new projects.
“22% of adults in D.C. are disabled, and I hope that city officials work with disability advocates to ensure we can live, work and thrive in our city,” Kenny wrote to The Hoya.
Kukla wrote that D.C.’s bike advocacy groups need to be more considerate of the disability community. Kukla wrote that these advocacy groups need to keep in mind that streets are for everyone and should serve a variety of needs. 
“I think cyclists and bike advocacy groups are used to fighting the idea that streets are first and foremost for cars, so they feel righteous when they claim street space for themselves, especially since biking is generally healthier and more environmentally friendly than driving,” Kukla wrote.  
Simms said the issue of accessibility applies to all District residents — not just disabled residents.
“At any point in your life, something can happen,” Simms said. “Does that mean that we can’t have concern for those who are currently disabled? Don’t they have a right to freely access this beautiful city like everyone else, without impediments, without obstacles, without making it a chore to come out of your door?”

Georgetown University’s School of Continuing Studies (SCS) is partnering with Coursera, an online learning platform, to offer a virtual Bachelor of Arts in liberal studies.
The partnership, which was announced Nov. 17, is the first online bachelor’s degree completion program at Georgetown. It aims to offer an affordable and flexible way for adults who want to work full time and cannot attend an educational institution in person to complete their degrees. Applications will open in early December 2022, and the program plans to accept 450 students before classes begin in the summer of 2023. 
The most recent on-campus cohort comprised 62% students of color and 40% military-connected students, according to a Nov. 17 statement by Betty Vandenbosch, the chief content officer at Coursera.
SCS Dean Kelly Otter said the Coursera degree aims to target learners that don’t fall in the traditional 18- to 22-year-old demographic of students pursuing undergraduate degrees. Educational institutions often overlook degree-seeking students outside this age group, according to Otter.
“With the huge influx of veterans and women going to school and adults realizing they needed a college education, we needed to make a new offering,” Otter told The Hoya. “The traditional college experience did not work as well for people who were working full time.”
The core curriculum will focus on developing students’ written and verbal communication skills before they specialize in a particular discipline, according to an SCS statement. The degree program merges a liberal arts education with professional development tracks, allowing students opportunities to apply their learning from each course to the workplace.
Otter said the SCS Bachelor of Arts in liberal studies was established in 1974 as an in-person program, but enrollment has been on the decline since 2014. According to Otter, an internal SCS analysis found that the enrollment decrease was a result of price increases and the fact that the program was only offered in person.
The SCS decided to move the program online to bring down the price and lower barriers to enrollment. Each credit hour is priced at $400, which Coursera said is 22% more affordable than the average online credit hour rate at comparable private colleges. This rate is approximately 80% less expensive than a traditional undergraduate degree from Georgetown.
Students who complete the degree can choose from a variety of concentrations, including business, international relations or communications, according to the statement by Vandenbosch.
“The program combines the best aspects of online learning, such as asynchronous courses taught by renowned Georgetown faculty, with high-touch support services crucial to student success, including academic advising,” Vandenbosch wrote in the statement. 
Otter said that SCS professors redesigned the curriculum to work in a virtual environment, tailoring it to be rigorous and interactive while remaining asynchronous. 
“Every course is being designed from scratch,” Otter said. “A team of experts worked for months on every course to custom design them to be interactive and asynchronous.”
Otter said Coursera’s expertise in academic infrastructure takes the pressure of logistics off of faculty members and allows them to focus on academics.
“Coursera was chosen because they have a good experience doing the kinds of activities that are beneficial to the school and students,” Otter said. “Their infrastructure takes the work off the academic institution so that faculty can focus on the students, the teaching and learning.”
The new partnership with Georgetown is Coursera’s 40th degree program. Students can transfer up to 64 college credits, including military training, to their 120-credit degree requirement, according to the SCS.
In line with the SCS’ commitment to accessibility and college completion, the bachelor’s program does not require any application fee or deposit. Otter said the program aligns with Georgetown’s values by promoting personalized, accessible education.
“This is truly an Ignatian approach, a Jesuit mission in action — meeting people where they are and recognizing that education can never be a one-size-fits-all system,” Otter said. “Ed-tech is helping us see how these advancements can provide more access and more rigor and more engagement within a classroom.”

The Smithsonian National Museum of American History will open a new permanent exhibition showcasing U.S. entertainment culture Dec. 9.  
The exhibit, entitled “Entertainment Nation”/“Nación del Espectáculo,” will be the largest long-term bilingual exhibit, showcasing work in both English and Spanish along the National Mall. The exhibit will include over 225 objects displayed in a 7,200-square-foot space, providing visitors with a variety of cultural artifacts that trace the history of pop culture in the United States. Admission to the museum is free. 
Darren Milligan, the acting director of the Smithsonian Office of Educational Technology and an adjunct lecturer in the Georgetown University department of art and art history, said the exhibition will likely include a variety of objects from U.S. entertainment history. 
“I am sure it will be an engaging and educational experience reflecting diverse contributions to American entertainment,” Milligan wrote to The Hoya. “I am excited to see the space and the objects selected for display and would encourage Georgetown students to make their way down to the Mall once it opens on the 9th of December.”
The museum will feature objects like the suit Ellen DeGeneres wore when receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, Michelle Yeoh’s Star Trek costume and Fred Rogers’ sneakers from Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, a children’s show about forging friendships.
In a December press release, Anthea Hartig, the director of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, said the power of the entertainment industry comes from the diverse voices that have contributed to it.
“For generations, entertainers and athletes have used their platforms to reveal and respond to the nation’s many struggles, challenge injustice and create change,” Hartig wrote in the release. “As the nation’s flagship and largest history museum, we are poised to help audiences better understand the value, role and influence of entertainment as most broadly defined.”
The exhibit will spotlight more than 12 artifacts of the entertainment industry that had a particularly influential impact on society and politics.
The exhibition will also place a large emphasis on digital visual graphics, including movies and music and their role in U.S. pop and entertainment, according to the press release. 
“State-of-the-art Dolby Atmos immersive sound will enhance the experience through a custom playback system designed to transport museum visitors into the exciting world of the movies,” the press release reads.
The exhibition will follow an open-gallery concept and feature three micro-galleries that each focus on comedy, music and television. The objects in the exhibition cover over 150 years of U.S. entertainment history. 
In addition to visually analyzing the objects in the exhibition, the museum said viewers are encouraged to consider the broad political implications of entertainment within society during and after their visits. 
“Visitors to the open-concept gallery can examine how various types of entertainment provoked conversations about the invasion of Native lands, Reconstruction, civil rights, immigration and more,” the press release reads. 
One of the objects in the exhibition is a necktie that former NFL player Randy Moss wore to commemorate the lives of 15 victims of police brutality. The exhibit will also feature Ruby Slippers, the shoes that Judy Garland wore in The Wizard of Oz, to spark conversations on society and politics.
Visitors can learn more about the exhibit through videos, podcasts and stories posted on the gallery’s companion website. The companion website also includes design ideas from project curators.  
Smithsonian Books also published a companion book titled “Entertainment Nation: How Music, Television, Film, Sports, and Theater Shaped the United States” on Nov. 1, which highlights the history of the objects in the exhibit as well as several essays on controversial and celebrated moments in pop history.
According to the release, the museum’s simultaneous online and in-person offerings invite viewers to participate in different ways. 
“Through online resources as well as exhibitions on the National Mall such as Entertainment Nation, the museum will continue its mission to engage audiences in new and expanding ways,” the press release reads.

Producers of the Battleground Poll discussed their book on political polarization in the United States and solutions for the country’s political divide with Georgetown University students.
Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics) hosted the Nov. 29 event. GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) provided a foreword for Ed Goeas and Celinda Lake’s book, titled “A Question of Respect,” and spoke at the event alongside the pollsters. 
Goeas and Lake –– a Republican and Democrat, respectively –– explained the United States’ divisive political climate through the book, published Nov. 29, and its analysis of recent elections and public opinion poll results. They have produced the Battleground Poll for more than 30 years.
When asked about the motivation behind the book and its title, Goeas said the rhetoric of former President Donald Trump influenced the book’s importance on emphasizing civility. 
“I wanted to show that political discussion can occur without being at each other’s throats,” Goeas said at the event. 
Lake said that growing up in an environment that prioritized collaboration molded her mindset to respect others in politics.
“I think coming from families, not perfect families by any means, but a ranch family where you had to work with your neighbors and a military family where you often have to work in life-or-death situations as a team really gave us a fundamental core belief in respect,” Lake said at the event.
The Battleground Poll is a national survey that samples registered voters from across the political spectrum to gauge a bipartisan view of current public opinion. In the most recent poll, the average respondent said the United States is three-fourths of the way to civil war, according to Elleithee.
Goeas said the poll showed that both Republicans and Democrats largely agree that democracy is currently under assault, though the two parties hold very different reasons for this belief. 
“People agree across the ideological spectrum that the increasingly violent behavior in our society is a threat to democracy,” Elleithee told The Hoya. “But then you start to see some distinctions. For example, an overwhelming number of Republicans, mainly Fox viewers, believe that voter fraud is a huge threat to democracy. Democrats believe that voter suppression is a huge threat to democracy.” 
According to Elleithee, recognizing the root causes of partisan disagreement is an overlooked dimension of political analysis. 
“Our belief is that that understanding is critical if we are ever going to find reconciliation and strengthen our democracy,” Elleithee said. “Different people believe there are different threats. We have got to reconcile that if we’re going to come back together.”
Lake said that respondent answers reflect the belief that Americans expect this polarization to continue into the future. 
“People are still pessimistic that division is very, very high, and they are very frustrated at that,” Lake said. “They think that division is a bipartisan problem.”
Elleithee said that accepting the role both parties play in creating America’s political climate is necessary for progress to be made. 
“What this poll and the democracy question show is that we tend to blame the other side, but until we all take some responsibility for understanding where other people are coming from, we are going to have a hard time finding real reconciliation,” Elleithee said.
Looking forward, Elleithee said he is hopeful that the next generation of politicians and leaders will help solve the country’s divide with an attitude of greater open-mindedness. 
“It is up to your generation whether or not we can actually turn the corner,” Elleithee said. “Are you guys going to be as bad as my generation has been, digging in our heels and not even listening to where other people are coming from, or are you going to listen to where the other side is coming from so you can make a better, more compelling argument?”

Rangila, Georgetown University’s annual South Asian dance showcase for charity, celebrated its 28th year of performances with the theme “Growing the Roots,” paying homage to the rich history and culture of the South Asian diaspora while raising over $25,000 for a charity that supports underprivileged communities overseas. 
The Nov. 18 and 19 performances included pieces influenced by numerous dance and music styles found across the Indian subcontinent. Rangila is a months-long effort of the GU South Asian Society (SAS) and the larger South Asian community at Georgetown to honor heritage and celebrate cultural diversity.
Rangila coordinator Ananya Amirthalingam (COL ’23) said she aimed for the theme of this year’s show to emphasize the importance of South Asian representation to the Georgetown community.
“Our theme this year, ‘Growing the Roots,’ reifies our commitment to learning from our heritages and histories while also boldly welcoming change and transformation,” Amirthalingam wrote to The Hoya. “’Rangila: Growing the Roots embodies personal growth from individually honoring our roots and communal growth, as we move towards consciously prioritizing diversity and broader representation of the South Asian diaspora.”
Over 350 student dancers and choreographers participated in this year’s performance, according to Amirthalingam.
As a philanthropic showcase, the organization selects a philanthropic partner to raise money and awareness for each year. The Rangila philanthropy board selected Distressed Children and Infants International (DCI), an organization that provides support to underprivileged communities in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Nicaragua through educational support, health care, eye care and other projects.
Komal Samrow (SFS ’25), director of internal outreach for Rangila’s philanthropy board, said the board chose to support DCI because of its dedication to service in vulnerable South Asian communities.
“In selecting a philanthropic organization to partner with this year, we really wanted to select an organization that embodied Georgetown’s emphasis on service, especially for marginalized populations — a key focus of DCI’s work,” Samrow wrote to The Hoya. “We also looked for an organization that serves throughout South Asia, as a testament to the diversity of our South Asian community here at Georgetown.” 
Before the show, the Rangila team held several other philanthropic events on and off campus to support DCI, according to Samrow. In addition to fundraisers at Chipotle and Crepeaway on Nov. 2 and Sep. 29 respectively, the Rangila team sold custom candles and wooden roses that audience members could gift to dancers and choreographers. Rangila also collaborated with other Georgetown student organizations, including GU Bubble, to sell chai boba at the GU Farmers Market and The Corp to sell specialty food and drink items at their storefronts.
Samrow said that while these efforts were successful on the fundraising front, it was less effective than the showcase in raising awareness for Rangila’s cause, an equally important goal. 
“We hoped to raise at least $25,000 dollars this year, and we are extremely proud to have exceeded that goal by several thousand dollars,” Samrow said. “Beyond the money, however, as a philanthropy board one of our primary aims was to ensure that Rangila’s philanthropic mission was well known and communicated to the community this year.”
The show consisted of ten dances and a musical program called Studio Rangila. Many of the dances featured popular South Asian styles such as Desi Hip Hop, Bharatanatyam and South Indian folk dances, with a twist of hip-hop, modern and Afro-Latinx styles incorporated into the performances, according to the event’s program. This year’s show also included the first Nepali-inspired dance in the show’s history.
SAS President Nikash Harapanahalli (SFS ’24) said they felt it was important for Rangila to offer a complete representation of the breadth and diversity of the South Asian diaspora.
“Those dance styles meant not just taking the heritage of a South Asian past, but breathing it into an innovative and dynamic present to build a more inclusive and representative future,” Harapanahalli told The Hoya. “That future was seen when we heard our first-ever Nepali song and dance on the Gaston stage.”
Harapanahalli said they hope members of the South Asian community at Georgetown walked away from the show feeling proud of their culture and the way it is reflected at the university.
“For me personally, growing our roots meant not just seeing myself grow as an individual or grow as a South Asian but to grow as a member of the Georgetown community,” Harapanahalli said. “This was the first time where I was able to meaningfully share my culture with a non-South Asian community and it was also the first time where I really learned from other South Asian communities.”
