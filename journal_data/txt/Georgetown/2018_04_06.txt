Many of us at Georgetown don’t often take the time to look at what goes on around us on the Hilltop every day. We rush from one class and activity to the next, not noticing what surrounds us. On April 4, a team of 10 photographers set out to capture an ordinary day at Georgetown. This is the story of 24 hours at Georgetown, captured between the chimes of Healy at midnight starting and ending a day.
Project Lead: Will Cromarty
Photographers: Will Cromarty, Ali Enright, Amber Gillette, Anna Kovacevich, Hannah Levine, Subul Malik, Caroline Pappas, Sheel Patel, Richard Schofield, Amanda Van Orden

Ten Hoya photographers use 50 pictures portraying 24 hours of life on the Hilltop. Now wouldn’t it be expected that at least one of the ten would have thought to include a shot of the chapel our the parish church, either of which would have most truly reflected the essence of every day at Georgetown and the mark of every grad for 129 years. P.S. The photos were outstanding.

A fire occurred in the electrical room of Georgetown University’s Laurel Data Center in Maryland on Wednesday afternoon, resulting in campuswide Wi-Fi outages and the shutdown of services like SaxaNet and educational platforms such as Blackboard.org.
Most services were functioning by 6 a.m. at the main campus and services were restored at the Georgetown University Law Center by 10 a.m. on the Thursday, according to Judd Nicholson, vice president for Information Technology and Georgetown’s chief intelligence office.
Yet, some services were still not yet operational at 1 p.m. on Thursday, according to a university-wide email sent out by Nicholson. The university intends to examine the causes of the fire, which are currently not known, in the coming weeks after it ensures services are stable.
Nicholson said the event is most likely isolated and should not have any long-term consequences.
“I think this is just a very unfortunate, isolated incident, and we should have no long-term effects by it,” Nicholson said.
The fire caused the main and backup power systems at Georgetown’s primary data center to fail, which led to the systemwide shutdown.
Within an hour of the first report of the fire, a HOYAlert with information about the fire was sent out to the Georgetown community at 1:54pm. A second HOYAlert was sent out at 2:54pm.
Following the release of the first HOYAlert, many people called GUPD’s emergency line, leaving GUPD unable to take emergency calls. According to Nicholson, the second HOYAlert was sent out to clarify that the outages were related to the fire at the data center so people would stop calling the GUPD emergency line.
Once the fire department allowed the University Information Services department into the data center Wednesday, the university partnered with electrical contractors and a maintenance company to begin restoring power to the building. Power was restored at the data center at 6 p.m. Wednesday.
“Once power came on, we systematically and very methodically start bringing up both the physical servers and virtual servers,” Nicholson said.
The university will soon be switching its primary data center to another site in Asfhord, Va., as part of the university’s modernization strategy. This decision was made before the fire.
“It’s just a natural transition for an institution of our size to move from a data center that wasn’t quite fitting our needs to a more, to a larger, state-of-the-art data center is just part of our modernization strategy,” Nicholson said.

The erosion of democratic norms and public trust under President Donald Trump’s administration threatens U.S. democratic institutions, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said at a Wednesday evening event cosponsored by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and The New York Times.
Yates said she is worried by the “relentless attack on democratic institutions and norms” coming from the administration, which she said may result in a long-term decline in public confidence in government. These concerns, she said, are more serious than typical partisan disagreements.
“With this sort of barrage that we experience every day, in a defense mechanism if nothing else, we tend to normalize this, because it’s kind of exhausting to stay in a state of constant outrage,” Yates said.
Yates pointed to Trump’s attempts to discourage the prosecution of Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who faced charges for profiling Latinos in July 2017 as an interference with the justice process.
“Whether that actually has an impact on the decisions that are made at DOJ or not, the damage is done by the public’s loss of confidence that the Department of Justice is acting independently,” Yates said.
Yates, a distinguished lecturer at Georgetown University Law Center, served as deputy attorney general under former President Barack Obama and briefly served as acting attorney general in Trump’s administration. Trump fired Yates in January 2017 after she refused to defend his first travel ban executive order, which restricted travel from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days.
Yates recalled her short time in the Trump administration at Wednesday’s event: She said the Justice Department had just 72 hours to analyze the ban’s legality and anticipate legal challenges, because the rollout of the order was not coordinated with government agencies.
Once she and her team decided the travel ban discriminated against Muslims, she knew she could not defend the order, Yates explained.
“It became apparent to me that to defend this, we would have to advance an argument that the travel ban had absolutely nothing to do with religion,” Yates said. “That meant, from our perspective, that we would have to advance a defense based on a pretext, we would be doing that not just on some tangential issue, but on a core, defining value of our country: religious freedom.”
The event was moderated by New York Times reporter and adjunct Georgetown professor Matt Apuzzo. Apuzzo asked Yates if she had considered resigning her position when she disagreed with the ban; Yates replied it was worth attempting to fight the executive order from within the department for as long as she could.
“Do I just resign and say, ‘OK, I’m not going to be part of this,’ or do I direct the department not to defend?” Yates said. “From my view, that would have protected my personal integrity, but it wouldn’t have protected the integrity of the Department of Justice.”
Though Yates condemned Trump’s disregard for democratic norms, she declined to comment on the legality of his interference or his role, if any, in the ongoing investigation about Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
Yates defended the DOJ against Trump allies’ accusations that the department committed abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to obtain a surveillance warrant for Carter Page, who had previously served as an aide to Trump’s presidential campaign.
The FBI’s surveillance of Page was approved by a FISA court because of Page’s contacts with Russian individuals, according to declassified summaries of the FISA order. The circumstances of the surveillance have come under fire from Republican members of Congress and Trump himself.
DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced March 28 he will investigate the matter.
Yates said she has no reason to suspect improper behavior in the FBI or the DOJ, however, because of the nature of the individuals who work for both institutions.
“The career men and women at the DOJ and FBI are the ones who initiate FISAs, not from the top, but from the bottom up,” Yates said. “They take the obligations they have incredibly seriously.”
Noting the widespread recognition Yates received for her defiance of the Trump administration — from praise in the media to “Sally Yates 2020” t-shirts — Apuzzo asked Yates if she considered herself a leader of the resistance against Trump and his administration.
Yates said she viewed standing up to the administration as just doing her job.
“I don’t view myself as a hero at all, and this is not in an ‘aw shucks’ kind of way. I did my job. That’s not being a hero,” Yates said. “Am I troubled by some of the actions of the administration? Yes. Do I speak out, in selective ways, about those? Sure, I do. I think that this is not a time for us to admire the issue, but rather to stand up and speak out about those things that we think are wrong or unjust.”

I can only hope GU invites others who would represent opposing points of view. Students need to hear varying opinions.

Students without documentation at Georgetown University were met with an unpleasant surprise Easter Sunday morning, after President Donald Trump fired off a flurry of tweets signaling the end to a potential deal to pass a legislative replacement to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, further thrusting the future of nearly one million students into uncertainty.
After wishing the nation a happy Easter early Sunday morning, Trump denounced what he called weak immigration policies. He referenced a caravan travelling through Mexico containing students without documentation who may be seeking asylum in the United States. He also criticized the U.S. “catch and release” program, a policy that allows illegal immigrants deemed to not pose a security risk to be temporarily released in the country in order to free up space in detention centers
He ended his tweeted remarks by blaming Democrats for failing to come to an agreement on an immigration reform bill, urging Republicans to “go Nuclear” and pass a Senate bill with a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than reaching the current 60-vote threshold.
“Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. ‘Caravans’ coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!” Trump wrote in a tweet Sunday morning.
Trump published another tweet later that morning proclaiming, “These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act!”
DACA is an administrative program established by former President Barack Obama that provided work authorization and legal protection to about 800,000 immigrants without documentation who entered the United States as children. It applies only to immigrants who were under the age of 16 when they arrived in the United States in 2007 or earlier.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the rescission of DACA last September. Trump gave Congress six months to create a permanent replacement.
Trump’s comments on the elimination of a deal to replace DACA were felt strongly on Georgetown’s campus.
Luis Gonzalez (COL ’19), a student with documentation and member of UndocuHoyas, found great trouble in the president’s remarks.
“This happened right after he wished Americans a happy Easter,” Gonzalez said in an interview with The Hoya. “The compassion and empathy that you associate with Easter was lacking in his tweets. Instead, he’s rallying up his base and throwing ‘Dreamers’ under the bus.”
Ultimately, Gonzalez sees a future without DACA, or a program that is similarly structured, as a disastrous one.
“You’ll have 800,000 people that will eventually not have status and have to go back into the shadows,” Gonzalez said.
Aware of the growing concern of students without documentation, Georgetown University Student Association President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) are seeking to allay fears, assuring the student body that they “stand in solidarity” with students without documentation.
“As we noted during the campaign, the rights of Undocumented Hoyas are the rights of every Hoya,” Nair and Rahman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are working with the University to make sure that Dreamers on campus know that we stand with them and will do everything we can to protect them. I can’t imagine how undocumented students feel about these comments.”
Despite floating the prospect of extending a pathway to citizenship for immigrants without documentation, some of whom were previously protected by DACA, Trump has also embraced the option of denying them such status.
Scott Fleming (SFS ’72), Georgetown’s associate vice president for federal relations, is optimistic about the effects Trump’s recent tweets will have on advocacy in favor of DACA protections.
“There are members of Congress on both sides of the aisle eager to pass a legislative solution that protects Dreamers,” Fleming wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We believe the Trump administration’s recent proclamation will only energize advocacy efforts nationwide to protect Dreamers.”
When the stated deadline to find a replacement for DACA came last month, Congress failed to pass a bill that guaranteed legal protection to the residents without documentation. Congressional deliberations were further stagnated by a ruling by the Supreme Court that prohibited the Trump administration from denying new renewals.
“Just as the March 5 deadline initially set by the administration to end the program drove Congress to consider a number of legislative proposals, the recent proclamation will hopefully do the same,” Fleming wrote. “We hope advocates and students will remain engaged throughout the summer.”
The programs and policies in place at Georgetown aim to provide a sense of security to students without documentation, providing them resources to feel at home on the Hilltop and thrive, according to Associate Director for Undocumented Student Services Arelis Palacios.
“Whether it be free legal services through our partnership with Catholic Charities Immigration Legal Services or on-campus advising, we remain fully dedicated to supporting our undocumented students and the unique challenges they face,” Palacios wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Despite the growing concern over developments in the political arena, Gonzalez said such efforts on campus gives Georgetown students without documentation a sense of security, protection and hopefulness.
“I think the university has done a phenomenal job of doing as much as it can to protect Dreamers, and I think it’s gone out of its way through the variety of resources that it’s put together, everything from hiring Arelis as the Associate Director for Undocumented Student Services to partnering with Catholic Charities to ensuring that we have the support that we need,” Gonzalez said.

The Georgetown Solidarity Committee, a worker’s rights advocacy group, delivered a letter  on March 27 outside University President John J. DeGioia’s office to protest the administration’s efforts to change Washington, D.C.’s Universal Paid Leave Amendment Act of 2016.
The university has engaged in lobbying efforts to change certain parts of the bill, which is intended to provide paid family leave for District residents through the creation of a social insurance fund run by the District Department of Employment Services. Georgetown’s current lobbying efforts advocate system and pay out leave claims with their own policies already in place.
The act, which became effective on April 7, 2017, provides covered employees with 8 weeks of paid parental leave, 6 weeks of paid family leave, and 2 weeks of paid personal medical leave. The paid leave will be funded by a 0.62% increase in DC employer payroll taxes.
GSC wrote a letter condemning these actions, which was co-signed by 12 other student groups, including the Georgetown University Student Association, H*yas For Choice, the Black Student Alliance and GU Pride.
GSC member Logan Arkema (COL ’20), who recently ran a satirical ticket in the GUSA executive election, said GSC’s campaign efforts is meant to keep the university’s actions in check.
“[GSC members] have a history of being willing to call the university out when we feel like it strays from its publicized values, and we feel like this is one of those instances,” Arkema said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’re just reminding the university that we’re watching them, and that we think that this is antithetical to what being a university for others and caring about the broader community means.”
University Media Relations Manager  Matt Hill said Georgetown already provides benefits superior to those that would be available with the new legislation.
“Georgetown supports the DC Council’s efforts to provide paid leave. Georgetown already provides benefits in a number of areas that are more generous than most provisions of DC’s Paid Leave Law,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown supports a model that would allow employers with a proven track record of offering these types of benefits to continue to administer paid leave so long as they meet or exceed DC’s minimum levels.”
Yet many student organizations claim that the university’s lobbying would undermine paid leave for employees both within and outside of the Georgetown community.
The GUSA Senate unanimously voted in favor of a resolution in support of university and D.C. workers on March 18. According to the resolution, Georgetown’s adjunct faculty, graduate assistants, subcontracted employees, part-time university employees, full-time male university employees, and male tenured faculty members do not currently receive paid parental leave.
The bill is currently slated to take effect with a 0.62 percent payroll tax to large employers, including Georgetown, on July 1, 2019 for leave claims to become available on July 1, 2020.
GUCD Chair Maria Cornell (SFS ’20) said the university is engaging in delay tactics to stall the bill’s implementation.
“By lobbying for changes to the bill, the university is trying to delay its implementation, which would prolong the timeframe that workers throughout D.C. would not have access to the paid leave that many of them desperately need,” Cornell said.
In addition the support from GUCD, this issue has support from undergraduates on both sides of the aisle, Arkema said
“This is a very broadly supported undergraduate issue — it passed the GUSA senate unanimously, there are board members of the College Republicans in GUSA senate that voted for this, and other people who identify to the right,” Arkema said.
GSC concerns do not only affect workers within the Georgetown community, according to Arkema.
“Even if we [students at Georgetown] might not be workers now in the District, a lot of us will be, and for the best majority of us will be better if the bill stays the way it is,” Arkema said.
Beyond the potential harm for workers in the area, the university’s lobbying efforts are a waste of resources better spent on student-focused programs, Cornell said.
“The administration has chosen to make a poor investment of the university’s limited resources by lobbying for changes that wouldn’t benefit students and would hurt D.C. workers and their families,” Cornell said.
Arkema echoed Cornell’s view and said that the university is prioritizing its self-interest over the well-being of students and workers.
“They’re not using our resources to fix our Henles,” Arkema said. “Instead they’re paying lawyers to go undermine the interests of workers just so that the university might have a bit of an easier life.”

Eight to 10 Georgetown students will be selected to travel to Mexico this summer to observe the country’s 2018 general election as part of a trip organized by Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service.
GU Politics, with support from the School of Foreign Service, will sponsor and fund the trip, covering the costs of housing, airfare to Mexico City from Washington, D.C., local transportation and most meals for each of the attending students.
Students are set to arrive in Mexico the week leading up to the July 1 election and head back to the United States the morning after the election.
Applicants must be available from the morning of June 24 through the evening of July 12, according to the GU Politics website.
GU Politics Chief of Staff Hanna Hope and Office Assistant Jennifer Solorio will lead the trip, titled #HoyasinMexico.
The goal of the trip is to provide students with the opportunity to observe the workings of an election firsthand, Hope said.
“We are so excited that once again we can offer Georgetown students a chance to have a behind-the-scenes look at a major political moment,” Hope wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Students will have the opportunity to interact with candidates, campaign staffers, party leaders and journalists during their visit.
“The week before any election is an exciting time,” Hope wrote. “We wanted students to have a chance to experience the final days of campaigning in the run-up to the July 1st vote.”
Mexico’s general election includes a presidential election for a six-year term and elections of 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies and 128 members of the Senate. It is set to be one of the largest elections in Mexican history with 18,000 seats open overall at local, state and federal levels. The incumbent president, Enrique Peña Nieto, is not eligible for re-election.
The leading presidential candidate, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, is the left-leaning former mayor of Mexico City. Lopez Obrador promises to combat inequality and corruption, and leads his nearest opponent, Ricardo Anaya Cortés, a former leader in the Chamber of Deputies running with the support of a coalition of conservative and center-left groups.
An important aspect of the trip is the participation of students in sharing their experiences to social media, according to Hope. Students will use GU Politics social media accounts, as well as their own, to produce and share articles and videos for platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat.
GU Politics has held similar trips to observe party conventions and elections for students in the past.
GU Politics sponsored students to attend both the Republican National Convention and the Democratic National Convention in summer 2016, and brought groups to observe both a Georgia special election and the snap general election in the United Kingdom last year.
Any student with an interest in learning more about a moment in Mexican politics and travelling with their peers is encouraged to apply, according to Hope. Any student who is currently enrolled at Georgetown and plans on enrolling at the university in the fall is eligible .
“I hope that our #HoyasInMexico will develop an understanding of Mexican politics, create once in a lifetime memories, and develop wonderful relationships with their fellow Hoyas,” Hope wrote.

The redesigned SAT is yielding higher average scores than both the old SAT and the ACT, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (COL ’64, GRD ’69).
Released in March 2016, the new SAT tests students on more curriculum-based content, combines reading and writing into one 800-point section and makes the essay section optional. The point distributions for the verbal and math sections on the new SAT still each range from 200 to 800, together constituting a 1600-point scale, rather than the previous scale of 2400.
After compiling the initial scores, the College Board released concordance tables translating ACT and old SAT scores to their new SAT equivalents. According to the tables, medium scores of 500 on old SAT sections translate to scores of 530 on the verbal and math sections of the new SAT.
The 30-point increase represents a larger nationwide surge in SAT scores, which partially accounts for the growing number of students applying to Georgetown and other elite universities, according to Deacon.
In total, 22,897 students applied to Georgetown’s Class of 2022, and 3,327 of them were admitted. The applicant pool is the university’s largest ever, breaking the previous record of 21,459 applicants set last year, according to university documents provided by Deacon.
“The scores are much higher, which means more people have moved toward the top and therefore see themselves as being in the running for these tops schools,” Deacon said.
Among Georgetown applicants, score improvements in the math section were more significant than those in the verbal section. In this year’s applicant pool, 2,548 applicants scored between 790 and 800 on the math section, while only 292 applicants tested within that range on the verbal section.
Deacon said that the university’s specific admission policies, which include a Georgetown-specific application and three recommended SAT subject tests, have historically kept its application rate lower than that of similar-caliber schools. The size of Georgetown’s applicant pool remained steady between 2012 and 2016 and only began rising after the new SAT was introduced in March 2016.
“We don’t know for sure why our pools have been going up in the last two years, but it certainly statistically tracks with the up increase in the SAT,” Deacon said. “The correlation between our jump in applications and the test scores is pretty clear.”
The university’s 2015 applicant pool had an average verbal SAT score of 672, while the 2018 applicant pool had an average of 692. The average math score over these two years jumped from 677 to 702.
The SAT scores of recent applicants to Ivy League schools mirror this upward trend. The percentage of freshmen who scored between 700 and 800 on the verbal and math sections of the SAT has increased steadily each year following the release of the new SAT, according to their Common Data Set information.
Deacon said that the general increase in SAT scores has led even more students to take the SAT over the ACT, a choice that pushes them toward top-tier schools.
“The most competitive colleges have primarily used the SAT as their triaging tool for the admission pool because it has more points than the ACT,” Deacon said.
Receiving more eligible applicants requires admissions officers to factor student interest in Georgetown into their admissions decision, Deacon said.
“Because more and more people are falling into that narrow range of top schools, there’s an increasingly reasonable chance that they’ll get into lots of schools because their numbers are high, so now we’re going through a period of having to predict yield,” Deacon said.
As more applicants cluster to the top, high test scores do not carry as much weight in the admissions process, which has subsequently become more holistic.
“Whereas testing used to be one of the things you could use to triage your pool, personal qualities now become even stronger because more people are meeting the high end,” Deacon said. “The whole person becomes a greater differentiating factor.”
Nonetheless, Georgetown applicants with high scores on the new SAT were more likely to be admitted than their peers. Students in the last application cycle who received perfect scores on their verbal and math sections had admit rates of 46 percent and 32 percent, respectively. For applicants who scored between 600 and 649, the chances of admission dropped to 8 percent and 6 percent, respectively.
Deacon also emphasized the continued weight of SAT subject test scores, or the SAT II, in the admissions process.
“We still encourage three SAT IIs, which are much more predictive than anything else,” Deacon said.
However, an increase in test scores among first-generation college students is a positive outcome of the new SAT, Deacon said.
“A subset of that population scoring higher on the SAT — the first-generation, low-income kids — did much better and probably benefited even more from a curriculum-based test than say, kids who went to elite schools in Manhattan,” Deacon said. “And we talk in terms of upward mobility as being our goal.”
The growing applicant pool has helped positively shape the university’s student body, according to Deacon.
“I’m happy about our pool being higher,” Deacon said. “I truly do think it is the most competitive, and it’s probably more interesting of a student body because personal qualities did play an increased role.”
