Two Georgetown undergraduate students have been elected to seats on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) and will represent Georgetown University’s campus and surrounding areas in decisions on a variety of local issues, according to the ANC’s Nov. 29 announcement of the midterm election results. 
The ANC system, which was established in 1973 by the D.C. Home Rule Act, divides Washington, D.C.’s eight wards into 296 single-representative districts and aims to ensure that residents have a voice in District governance. John DiPierri (SFS ’25) and Joe Massaua (SFS ’25) will serve as representatives of ANC 2E, a region with eight districts that makes up the Georgetown, Burleith and Hillandale neighborhoods, starting Jan. 2.
The ANC promotes substantive dialogues and initiatives within local politics, according to DiPierri.
“There’s an old saying that all politics is local,” DiPierri told The Hoya. “Having those individual conversations — talking to people who are concerned about taxes or roads — are very small things in the grand scheme of politics. We talk so much about big issues in the political sphere, but really, it’s having those conversations with people that can make the most impact.”
DiPierri said he ran on a platform of creating cohesion between the campus and its neighbors, collaborating with local businesses and ensuring that Georgetown students are not unfairly fined for parking near campus. 
Having run unopposed, DiPierri said candidates win the election as long as they win a majority of the votes cast. In his district, 2E08, there are 40 to 50 active voters out of approximately 2,000 total residents. DiPierri held a write-in campaign in which most of his efforts centered around talking to voters.
Massaua said the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) typically chooses and supports candidates for both of Georgetown’s ANC 2E seats. Since GUSA did not endorse Massaua, he said he aimed to build a campaign platform that highlighted his lack of affiliation with the university and advocates for underrepresented student issues like food and housing.
“It felt really internal to me, and I was sort of surprised by the whole process,” Massaua told The Hoya. “I just really wish that the administration and people were more open and transparent with how the whole race is carried out. So, my platform was just being a listening voice to Georgetown students in the community, especially those from difficult socioeconomic backgrounds.”
According to Rohan Patel (COL ’25), who also ran for the 2E04 seat, the Commission provides a valuable opportunity for Georgetown students interested in policy and government to engage with local politics. 
Patel, who has previously held congressional internship positions, said serving on the ANC enables commissioners to build and pursue their own agendas.
“I want to do something policy-based, which could be in government, but I’m not quite sure yet,” Patel told The Hoya. “It’s like a good opportunity to get a better understanding of what actually happens in local government and see if that’s something I’m interested in further on.”
Arnav Kumar (SFS ’23), who currently holds the ANC 2E08 commissioner position, said it gave him the opportunity to work on a range of local issues, from water infrastructure to art installations. 
“Often you hear people, especially around election time, making a point about how it’s important to vote in the big races — but it’s also important to vote on local races because those often are the policies affecting you on a day-to-day basis,” Kumar told The Hoya. “Localizing things is very important.”
DiPierri said he is looking forward to serving in an organization that seeks to elevate the voices of all D.C. residents.
“We have a district that’s so densely populated with so many different voices, lived experiences and communities involved that the ANC serves a very unique function,” DiPierri said. “We have so many representatives from so many different interest groups and areas, all in one place to have conversations.”

James Reardon-Anderson, a longtime professor of history and the founding dean of the Georgetown University Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS) in Doha, Qatar (GU-Q), died Nov. 27. He was 78.
Reardon-Anderson leaves behind a legacy marked by his care for students, commitment to Georgetown’s missions and global contributions to the university. A specialist in modern Chinese history, Reardon-Anderson joined the university faculty in 1985. 
Before spearheading the establishment of GU-Q from 2005 to 2009, Reardon-Anderson served as chair of the SFS faculty council, director of the Asian Studies program, interim dean and senior associate dean of the main-campus SFS and director of the Georgetown University Master of Science in Foreign Service (MSFS) program. Reardon-Anderson returned to GU-Q to serve again as dean from July 2016–August 2017. 
Reardon-Anderson was honored with the Patrick Healy Award, the highest honor bestowed by the alumni association upon individuals who are not alumni but have made significant contributions to the university, at an April 2016 ceremony in Rome.
Reardon-Anderson served as a mentor to many, including SFS Senior Associate Dean and Director of the SFS Undergraduate Program Mitch Kaneda when he first joined Georgetown as an assistant professor in 1994. 
Kaneda said Reardon-Anderson’s legacy is institutional.
“He has affected so many students, professors, deans, especially at the Qatar campus, and he started that from scratch,” Kaneda told The Hoya. “For me personally, he guided me in my own formation from my assistant professor days until now.”
The advice Reardon-Anderson gave Kaneda in his early career has continued to resonate for decades, Kaneda said. 
“‘Mitch, just be yourself.’ I can still hear him saying it. He must have told me that 20-plus years ago, but that still keeps on coming back at many junctures in my professional and personal life,” Kaneda said. 
Department of Government Chair and SFS Professor Anthony Clark Arend (SFS ’80) worked with Reardon-Anderson when he returned to the Hilltop to serve as senior associate dean of the MSFS program while Arend was director. 
Arend said Reardon-Anderson was a brilliant leader and a true supporter of the university’s mission.
“He really helped me work through a whole series of important issues as we were moving MSFS and School of Foreign Service to the next level,” Arend said in an interview with The Hoya. “He was very, very instrumental in that, very committed to the students of Georgetown. He was personally supportive of me in a number of activities I did including when I was director of MSFS, and I’ll forever be grateful for his support and his encouragement.”
SFS Dean Joel Hellman said Reardon-Anderson represented the very best of the school throughout his more than 30 years of service to the university, according to a statement posted on the SFS Instagram Nov. 30. 
“To put it simply, Jim shaped the modern SFS. And in all his roles, he was deeply respected for his fairness, his essential goodness, his commitment to the people of SFS, and his unwavering dedication to the values of our school,” Hellman wrote in the statement. 
One of Kaneda’s earliest memories of Reardon-Anderson was when Reardon-Anderson invited him to attend the undergraduate student reception for the Asian Studies department, which Reardon-Anderson was the director of at the time. There, Kaneda witnessed Reardon-Anderson, the top-ranking faculty member at the event, walk around the reception and speak to every student in attendance.
Kaneda said Reardon-Anderson’s respect for students at the individual level has stuck with him throughout his career. 
“He was going to every student to introduce himself personally, and that really conveyed to me who he was, and the value at this institution that we care about each and every student,” Kaneda said. “That was like an indoctrination for me that, over the years, shaped why I do this, how I continue to teach and guide the students.”
Kaneda said he distinctly remembers being present at the first-ever commencement on the Doha campus, which Reardon-Anderson played a foundational role in creating.
“When he was recognized, the applause just did not end,” Kaneda said. “It was everyone — the entire community, not just students and faculty. Staff members, security staff, dining hall staff, janitorial, everyone was there applauding for him.”
Reardon-Anderson is survived by his wife Kathleen, daughter Jane and sons Peter and William.

Academic researchers discussed the work of Brazilian Photojournalist Sebastião Salgado to analyze the power of his pictures to inspire environmental activism at a Nov. 29 event. 
The virtual event was the latest installment of the “A Bent but Beautiful World” series of lectures on art, literature and the natural world hosted by the Future of the Humanities Project at Georgetown University, a multidisciplinary initiative exploring issues at the intersection of the humanities and public life. Tim Howles, a junior research fellow in political theology at the University of Oxford, headlined the event to share his insights on Salgado’s work from an environmental ethics perspective. 
Salgado is best known for his photos chronicling groups in distress in developing countries, including the lives of Rwandan and Kosovan refugees, as well as Cuban sugar-cutters.
Howles said Salgado’s photos immortalize global stories of human hardship that are often overlooked.
“Human beings laboring in harsh or inhumane conditions, the plight of refugees and forced migrants and indeed, the horror of genocide and war,” Howles said at the event. “Salgado’s work has represented these violent dramas, depicting people and their struggle against the political and economic situations in which they find themselves.”
Howles said Salgado’s graceful and refined photographic style aids his ability to comprehensively capture such distressing events.
“I would suggest that while Salgado’s photographs are harrowing in content, they are quite brilliant in execution,” Howles said. “That is to say, Salgado records tragic and painful events in a format that is stylized, aesthetically self-conscious and, if I could even put it this way, beautiful.”
His 2013 project “Genesis,” the centerpiece of the event, features photos of vast deserts, glaciers, forests, wildlife and indigenous peoples.
Howles said many of the images in “Genesis” focus on the world before the disruption of human activity. 
“Salgado turns from the world of humans, the world that humans have damaged and exploited in so many ways, to a world that lies beyond the realm of human impact,” Howles said. “Landscapes of sublime beauty, majestic animals and indigenous people apparently in symbiosis with nature.”
Salgado’s environmentalist work has the ability to inspire viewers to take action by showcasing new perspectives of nature, Howles said.
“I’m going to suggest that Salgado’s work moves us beyond a naive representation of the planet as undisturbed by humans, and compels us to acknowledge the moral relationships with other species in which we find ourselves inexorably entangled,” Howles said. 
According to Howles, Salgado achieves this impact through the use of novel techniques, including by deliberately highlighting the way a photographer affects the scene they capture.
“In Salgado’s photography, we find animals apparently disturbed by the photographer’s presences,” Howles said. “These photographs complicate the idea of a nature beyond the reach of humans and foreground, albeit symbolically, with the fact of human intrusion into their space.” 
Howles said Salgado’s portrayal of indigenous peoples focuses on their peaceful relationship with nature. 
“Salgado is also notable for his depiction of indigenous people,” Howles said. “The human subjects that Salgado depicts, on the one hand, can be read through the lens of innocent, natural simplicity.”
Salgado’s work provokes inquiry into how art should best depict marginalized communities, such as indigenous peoples, from an outsider’s perspective, according to Howles. 
“And yet here too, we find self conscious hints of the Western gaze into their lives,” Howles said. “This invites us to ask questions about the way we represent indigeneity.”
Howles said he hopes Salgado’s work will motivate individuals to recognize their role in taking care of the planet. 
“I’ll leave you with this final image and suggest that as we engage in that story, maybe we can hear that call from Salgado’s art, to be energized as responsible characters to play our part,” Salgado said. “So, the story of this earth can indeed flow forward in time and be there for future generations.”

D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) reached a tentative agreement with the Washington Teachers’ Union (WTU) that is expected to increase teacher wages over the next four years. 
The Nov. 23 agreement comes after three years of negotiations that followed the 2019 expiration of their previous contract. Earlier this month, DCPS teachers held demonstrations in front of at least five local schools to push for a new contract that offers more staffing, smaller classes and guaranteed lesson planning time. 
The new contract is set to include a 12% salary increase over four years, an additional 4% signing bonus and a significant increase in administrative premiums, according to a joint Nov. 23 statement from Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, Chancellor Lewis Ferebee and WTU President Jacqueline Pogue Lyons. 
In the statement, Bowser, Ferebee and Lyons said the District has a great appreciation for its over 5,000 educators.
“We love our teachers, and we want Washington, DC to be the number one city for teachers—a city where teachers stay at their schools and live in our city. Beyond pay and benefits, it was important for this agreement to reflect the respect the District has for teachers and the work they do for DC’s students,” the Nov. 23 statement reads.
This new contract aims to improve DCPS not just for teachers, but also for students, according to the same statement. 
“Together, we want to thank all of our DCPS teachers for consistently making DC proud, building and keeping the trust of our families, and above all, loving and empowering our young people,” the statement reads. “We believe this tentative agreement is fair for teachers and good for students.”
DCPS Press Secretary Enrique Gutiérrez said the District will benefit from teachers receiving more competitive wages and back pay for their work during the pandemic.
“With this new contract, we hope to not only retain our incredible educators, but also attract new teachers to the system,” Gutiérrez wrote to The Hoya. “As Mayor Bowser has said, we want DC to be a city for teachers.” 
The contract, which has been publicly celebrated by the WTU, will help DCPS recruit talented teachers by offering wages that are competitive with other districts, according to the statement. 
The statement also expresses hope that WTU members will vote on the contract in the next few weeks. The contract will then be sent to the Council of the District of Columbia for approval, likely in December.
WTU acknowledged the work of not only the contract negotiators but also members of the public who advocated for educator raises in a Nov. 23 tweet. 
“We are thankful for you, for your letters and calls to the mayor, and for waking up early with us to march. And we’re thankful for a fair contract,” WTU wrote in the tweet.
Other community members and groups including EmpowerEd, a local organization that is working to make DCPS more equitable, have expressed their support for the tentative contract. 
According to a Nov. 23 statement from EmpowerEd, the new contract is only the first step in appropriately compensating DCPS teachers for their work. 
“A raise in wages and a fair contract is the very least owed to our phenomenal educators who have done so much to serve our students and families over the past few years,” the statement reads. “Now it’s time for city leaders to finally address the root causes of DC’s teacher turnover crisis.”
EmpowerEd also said increases in the salaries of DC public charter school teachers, paraprofessionals that provide instructional and behavioral support to students and teacher aides are also needed to improve DCPS teacher retention rates.
The new contract conveys the overwhelming gratitude the District has for the work teachers do for the local community, Gutiérrez said .
“We know the indelible role our educators play in creating loving, nurturing school environments that ensure our students are successful in the classroom and in life,” Gutiérrez wrote. “This contract sends a signal to our teachers that we value them and are grateful for their service to our school communities.”

Georgetown University Law Center will no longer contribute internal data for the national ranking of law schools by U.S. News & World Report, a media outlet known for its annual analysis of higher education institutions.
The Nov. 18 announcement came after three other Top 14 law schools — including Yale, Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley — withdrew from the ranking system earlier in the week. By pulling out of the system, the Law Center will stop sharing private data about its spending and post-graduation employment outcomes with U.S. News.
Georgetown Law Dean William Treanor said the school decided to withdraw from the ranking system because the metrics that U.S. News prioritizes do not align with Georgetown Law’s values of holistic evaluation and public service.
“More than any other top law school, we have graduates who go into public interest careers, and we devote resources to making that possible,” Treanor told The Hoya. “We also have a commitment to access — to making sure that students, regardless of need, can come to Georgetown Law. These are really at the core of who we are, and my hope is that over time, U.S. News will come to recognize the value of the core commitments that define us as a law school and as a university.”
Treanor said he disagrees with the way U.S. News prioritizes large endowments and high standardized test scores in its ranking formula, not the principle of ranking itself.
“I think rankings have real value,” Treanor said. “But what’s become clear to me over time is that the U.S. News rankings are very flawed and give bad information to prospective students.”
Chelsea Clayton (LAW ’24) said the U.S. News rankings provided a helpful reference point for her when she applied to law schools, especially as a first-generation law applicant.
“Although the ranking system may be flawed, it can provide valuable information for students when deciding which schools to apply to,” Clayton wrote to The Hoya. “One of the major issues is that law students tend to overvalue the importance of the rankings and rely solely on a school’s status and prestige.”
Treanor said that he had made complaints to U.S. News about its measures of educational quality for nearly a decade, but saw an opportunity to participate in creating systemic change following the withdrawal of peer institutions from the ranking system.
Prior to Georgetown Law’s withdrawal, U.S. News ranked the Law Center No. 14 in its list of “Best Law Schools.” According to Treanor, it is possible that Georgetown Law’s ranking could drop as a result of its decision to withdraw from the rankings, though he does not expect the move to significantly impact admissions and student employment opportunities.
U.S. News plans to continue ranking law schools that have decided to no longer provide internal data through the use of publicly available data, according to a U.S. News spokesperson, who directed The Hoya to a Nov. 17 statement.
“U.S. News has a responsibility to prospective students to provide comparative information that allows them to assess these institutions,” Robert Morse, the chief data strategist at U.S. News, wrote in the statement.
Treanor said he spoke with university leadership, members of the Law Center’s Board of Trustees, faculty, alumni leadership and students before announcing the withdrawal. The decision has received widespread support from members of the Georgetown community.
Clayton said she supports the law schools that have withdrawn from the U.S. News rankings, including Georgetown, but she is less certain of the trend’s potential impact.
“I genuinely hope that law schools are committed to looking at students more holistically and increasing the socioeconomic diversity of law students,” Clayton wrote. “However, I am unsure if this new movement will substantially impact the unhealthy reliance on rank and prestige amongst law schools, especially when these law schools have already benefited from decades of sitting in the hallowed group known as the ‘T14.’”
Treanor said he can see Georgetown Law returning to the ranking system in the future if U.S. News implements several changes, including removing the metric of spending per student, acknowledging the Law Center’s fellowships as full-time jobs and factoring in loan forgiveness when measuring student debt.
“If the U.S. News system were to be reformed in a way that makes a real measure of educational quality and preparation for the bar, I would certainly be open to going back to the ranking system,” Treanor said.
CORRECTION: This article was updated Dec. 2 to reflect that Georgetown Law was the fourth school to withdraw from the U.S. News rankings.

At an event hosted by Georgetown University’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, panelists spoke about a recent increase in anti-Muslim discrimination in India. 
Speakers at the Nov. 21 webinar, titled “India and the Rise of Islamophobia: Why and Why Now?” included Berkley Center Senior Fellow Jocelyne Cesari and Kalpana Jain, senior journalist and senior ethics and religion editor at The Conversation U.S., an independent, nonprofit publisher that focuses on news stories and research reports. Cesari and Jain discussed the effects of India’s fluid stance on religious tolerance and the increase in power of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India’s pro-Hindu political party, in the country’s government. 
Cesari said that although religious tensions have always been present in India, the BJP’s rise to power, combined with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, has intensified the issue.
“The reason for our conversation comes from the very alarming situation of continuous attacks against Muslims in India: lynching, discrimination, attacks on people,” Cesari said at the event. “This is not something that has been absent completely from Indian society, but it really raised in the last mandate of Modi, and it even was exacerbated by the pandemic.”
In India’s 2014 elections, the BJP won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s bicameral Parliament, and Narendra Modi became prime minister.
Jain said Modi’s government demonstrated they would not allow criticism by dismissing reports of lynchings and attacks on Muslims for eating beef, a practice against Hindu dietary restrictions. 
According to Jain, in the past few years, the BJP-controlled Indian government has increasingly censored dissent in the media. In 2020, the government arrested almost 70 journalists, citing sedition and counterterrorism laws.
Jain added that certain groups like Durga Vahini, a Hindu nationalist organization, have played into people’s fears that Muslim leaders will force out Hindu traditions and culture in India.
She said these groups attempt to present Islam as a threat to Hindu culture in India. 
“They’re indoctrinating them into a very different version of history, which is a very Hindu nationalist history,” Jain said at the event. “In conversation with them, what they revealed, to a certain extent, were a lot of the fears that they are being made to think about and that are playing into their mind and even joining this organization.”
Citizens worry that Islam will take over India, that Hindus will have no land left and that women will marry into and convert to Islam, according to Jain.
However, Jain said there has been pushback against Modi and the BJP. In the 2021 West Bengal State elections Trinamool Congress (TMC), an oppositional Indian political party, won a majority of the vote against the BJP. TMC now holds the majority in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, a unicameral legislature in charge of passing laws for over 90 million constituents.
Jain said that in many ways, the BJP is actually losing ground in India, as they have lost the support of some major states including Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. 
“People want more than religion,” Jain said. “We have to also acknowledge that people are smart enough to see, ‘are we being fooled in the name of religion?’”
Cesari said India’s diverse political and sociocultural landscape makes it a compelling subject for an analysis of political power. 
“So when we turn to India, it’s quite an interesting composite,” Cesari said. “It’s a subcontinent. It covers multiple languages, ethnicities, local tradition.” 
This diversity tends to play into religious tensions, specifically at the local level, due to the country’s decentralized structure, according to Cesari.
Jain said that globally, other states are encountering similar religious tensions.
“It is an erosion of civil liberties of all its citizens,” Jain said. “It’s an erosion of the freedom of the media that we’ve seen all this way. We’ve seen people arrested and killed, who are not just Muslims, but it extends to other religious groups as well.”
