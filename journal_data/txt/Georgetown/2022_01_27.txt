CW: This article references/discusses genocide and  sexual  violence . Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Georgetown’s Center for Jewish Civilization hosted an event for International Holocaust Remembrance Day to commemorate the six million Jewish people and other minority groups who were killed in the Holocaust.
The virtual event, held on Jan. 25 and titled “The Holocaust and Genocide: Memorialization and Activism,” was led by University of Edinburgh professor Donald Bloxham, who specializes in mass atrocities studies. The event focused on atrocities of the Holocaust, relationships between memorial and activist approaches to the Holocaust and the parallels to recent genocidal events in countries around the world. The discussion was moderated by Professor Anna Sommer, an Associate Director and professor at the Center for Jewish Civilization. 
Bloxham said although the Holocaust is often singled out from other genocides, the world must continue to remember its abhorrent events. 
“It is very unusual even amongst genocides and this is therefore supposed to do something to the world. We need to remember it not just for its own sake, but because remembering it will somehow help us as moral agents in the world in whatever way that might be,” Bloxham said at the event.
Antisemitism is still widely prevalent in western society, according to Bloxham.  
“I do think that in western civilization antisemitism is entrenched so deeply,” Bloxham said. “I think it’s very difficult to say that the advances that have been made in some countries as regards to ending antisemitism — it’s difficult to say that they’re not reversible because they clearly are and the abiding stereotypes of Jews and anti-jewish thinking is present.”
Antisemitic attacks have risen across the United States and the world since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the past year, nearly one in four Jewish Americans have reported facing antisemitism.  
Studying the Holocaust can help identify and prevent future atrocities, according to Bloxham.   
“One can detect the connection between the growing interest in hands-on, neighbor-on-neighbor violence of the Holocaust in the killing fields of Eastern Europe that began in the nineties and the similar violence of the Rwandan and Yugoslavian genocides of the same decade,” Bloxham said at the event. “The study of the sexual violence of those recent genocides has also gone alongside a growing in the issue of the Nazi.” 
During the Rwandan genocide, women were subjected to sexual assualt by the Hutu militia groups, who were encourged to commit acts of sexual violence. In the Yugoslavian genocide sexual violence was widespread, and the majority of these victims were Bonsian Muslims.  
Events of mass genocide, including the Holocaust, frequently follow similar patterns of development and have historically comparable agendas. In the 1994 Rwandan genocide, armed militias slaughtered nearly one million people belonging to the ethnic Tutsi population in the country. Similarly, the Bosnian genocide saw the systemic murder of 100,000 Bosnian Muslim and Croatian civilians by the Bosnian Serb forces backed by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army in the 1990s.
It is critical to realize genocides are not isolated issues and impact the treatment of future populations, according to Bloxham.
r
Bloxham said he is discouraged by the lack of awareness of recent genocides.
“It’s become a very safe, very easy topic because Holocaust deniers are absolutely marginalized — quite rightly. There’s no one out there saying that the Holocaust is a good thing or a justifiable thing,” Bloxham said. “Its not like, in that sense, the Armenian genocide where you’ve got deniers and people justifying — there’s none of that.” 
Currently, there are a number of countries under Genocide Watch, including China for committing atrocities against Uyghurs and other minority ethnic groups. Turkey, Syria and Iraq, where the Kurdish minority population is considered to be at risk of genocide under the authority of the regional powers, are also listed.
Bloxham also commemorated the non-Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
“In some of these instances, some of the things closest to the Holocaust, i.e. other groups persecuted and murdered by the Nazis, have sort of been removed out of the picture. Yet, we’re also supposed to be looking at the Holocaust as a way to something much bigger and more significant and more general and often further detached from the Holocaust: general issues of human rights abuses in the world today,” Bloxham said.
An estimated five million non-Jewish people were victims of the Holocaust. The groups targeted included Roma people, people with disabilities, Jehovah’s Witnesses and gay people. 
Bloxham urged individuals to remember all victims of the Holocaust and to work toward preventing future atrocities.
“I also want to think about another kind of duality, not quite an opposition, but what we might call on the one hand the relationship between thinking about the Holocaust’s intrinsic significance and thinking about its instrumental significance. By instrumental, I mean really its significance for helping us think about other things.” Bloxham said.

Georgetown students, faculty and other community members gathered at the recent Teach the Speech virtual teach-in to reflect on Martin Luther King, Jr.’s 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech.
The teach-in took place Jan. 11 and featured keynotes from state Senator Jennifer McClellan (D-Va.) and Neonu Jewell (LAW ’04). Veronica Williams (COL ’23) also spoke at the event, the second student to do so. 
The event was part of the Let Freedom Ring! initiative, and was co-hosted by the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching, and Service (CSJ), the Center for New Designs, Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), the Doyle Engaging Difference Program and the Division of Student Affairs.
The speakers contextualized King’s speech in contemporary discourse on race, according to Ijeoma Njaka (GRD ’19), professor and senior project associate for equity-centered design and inclusive pedagogy at Georgetown.
“The guest speakers situated the speech in our current moment and the rise of folks being afraid of critical race theory and the controversy and the misappropriation of critical race theory and the misappropriation of King’s quotes on social media or the ways in which King’s words get invoked in a way that undercuts the radical nature of his messages and his life’s work,” Njaka said in an interview with The Hoya. 
After the speakers’ presentations, the three participated in a Q&A session with community members that Njaka facilitated.
Williams said she found her own educational experience left out Black history beyond slavery or the civil rights movement. 
“In my reflection, I discussed that growing up throughout my K-through-12 education that Black history overall wasn’t mentioned a lot outside of slavery, segregation, civil rights movement and Dr. King’s ‘I Have A Dream,’” Williams said in an interview with The Hoya. “Then, everything was fine after that — there’s no more racial oppression, nobody’s racist anymore. That was kind of the frame throughout my education in high school.”
Contextualizing King’s words from his “I Have A Dream” speech is important to maintaining the spirit of his work, according to Williams.
“I was finding that Dr. King’s life, legacy and words were being used for certain things that he had not intended for them to be used for. Not just that people have been twisting his words in media recently, but a lot of politicians, for instance, have used his words to try to attack critical race theory,” Williams said. 
The event provides a space for members of the Georgetown community across schools to reflect on King’s work, according to CSJ director Andria Wisler. 
“Every year diverse faculty and staff across the University — from Law to Med to SCS to GU-Qatar to Main Campus — incorporate the Dr. King speech into their educational spaces (classroom teaching, meetings, etc.),” Wisler wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This cross-campus co-curricular project offers an opportunity for members of the GU community to spend time with Dr. King, meeting King again, through listening to and reflecting on his speeches.”
Teach the Speech emphasized that maintaining the original meaning of King’s words is essential to reading his speeches today, according to McClellan.
“As our nation deals with politically motivated attempts to limit the teaching of complete and accurate history, it’s critical that we understand the full context of Dr. King’s words and his work to build the Beloved Community,” McClellan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Dr. King spent his life working to redress inequity and making the reality of our nation match the promise of its founding principles. With civil rights and voting rights now under attack, we must retain the fierce urgency of now to act on Dr. King’s vision.”
While in previous years there have been more opportunities for hands-on workshops or conversations, the keynote speakers remained a highlight of this year’s program, according to Njaka.
“Because of the pandemic, the omicron surge, and trying to be cognizant of Zoom fatigue, this was a little bit shorter of an event that focused more on the keynotes as opposed to also trying to include a longer explicit workshop,” Njaka said. “I’ve always enjoyed the keynotes. Across the years that I’ve been at Georgetown and been able to attend Teach the Speech, that feels like a consistent piece of the program that has always been there and that I’ve always enjoyed.”
This article was updated on Jan. 28 to correct a detail about the event.

The School of Continuing Studies (SCS) annual Dean’s Report emphasized Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) efforts.   
This year’s report, which summarizes achievements and themes in the most recent academic year, was released in December, and conveys the many manifestations of DEI at the SCS, weaving testimonials from administrators and professors as well as current students and alumni. The report highlights major developments of the past years, profiles and perspectives of students and faculty. 
The SCS Dean’s report for the 2020-2021 academic year focused on creating communities during virtual instruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the 2020-2019 report was centered on creating lifelong networks. 
Dean of the SCS Kelly Otter said the SCS focused on DEI for this year’s report given the rise of social justice movements across the country. 
“While it has been nearly two years since the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the events of Summer 2020 continue to reverberate and make a profound impact on our School: from the founding of the Diversity, Equity, Belonging, and Inclusion Council (DEBIC) to the launch of DEI-focused programs and certificates,” Otter wrote.  
The SCS continues to work on integrating DEI into the Georgeotwn community on a daily basis, according to Otter. 
“For a topic as complex as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), it was important to us to enable diverse stories and voices to be heard from different parts of the School,” Otter wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The team first met with key department heads—ranging from our degree programs to professional certificate programs to summer programs—for recommendations about key DEI-related initiatives in their respective programs, or students and alumni doing inspiring work in this area.” 
Since fall of 2021, Vice Dean for Education and Faculty Affairs at the SCS Shenita Ray has collaborated with the events team, online operations, academic officers and program roundtables to design and evaluate a framework to thoroughly integrate Jesuit values with DEI standards into the SCS. 
This initiative would facilitate dialogue, alter habits and empower the community to cultivate change, according to Ray. 
“A key takeaway from the SCS Dean’s Report is that it features articles reflective of writers across the School’s diverse programming,” Ray wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is inclusive of a range of perspectives within the SCS community (students, faculty, staff, alumni).”
One graduate highlighted in the report is Terrell Hawkins (GRD ’21), who pursued a master’s degree in professional studies in higher education administration (HEA). Hawkins now works as a coordinator for English language programs at Georgetown University, a U.S. State Department-funded exchange program and aspires to start a mentorship program geared towards Black American men. 
This initiative would begin in twelfth grade and provide a support system through the completion of college, according to Hawkins.  
“While my current position isn’t directly involved with students, these transferable skills have allowed me to spearhead diversity initiatives at my current organization through targeted HBCU/MSI outreach, advertising with organizations specifically for underrepresented populations, developing partnerships with affinity groups and increasing gender and cultural representation in our promotional materials,” Hawkins wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
While completing his HEA degree, Hawkins said he acquired the knowledge and practical skills necessary to create change in his community. He attributes this to his exposure to diverse classmates as well as access to transformational courses, such as a class titled “Diversity and Social Justice in Higher Education.”
“As someone aspiring to increase access and diversify the landscape of higher education, I’ve identified myself as an educator with a mission to engage students in experiential learning opportunities to foster their academic, personal, and intellectual growth,” Hawkins wrote. 
Though the Dean’s Report serves to highlight successful implementation of DEI in the SCS, it is crucial to recognize that there are still areas for improvement, according to Otter. 
“As a community we know there is still much work to do in order to become a truly inclusive and equitable School,” Otter wrote. “However, with the Dean’s Report as a starting point for discussion, we should acknowledge our progress to date and moreover, we should keep holding ourselves and each other accountable.”

Cynthia Chavez Lamar will become the first Indigenous woman to serve as the director of a Smithsonian museum when she assumes the role at the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) on Feb. 14.
Chavez Lamar is a member of San Felipe Pueblo and also has Hopi, Tewa and Navajo lineage. While the museum’s past two directors have been Indigenous, Chavez Lamar is the first Indigenous woman appointed to the role. Chavez Lamar currently serves as the museum’s acting associate director for collections and operations, a role she has held since January 2021.
The Hoya sat down with Chavez Lamar on Jan. 26 to discuss what the role means to her, what she hopes to do as director and how she will use her position to spotlight Indigenous communities. 
According to Chavez Lamar, the outpouring of support from past coworkers and the idea of inspiring others to see themselves in positions like hers has been rewarding.
“I’ve felt really, really supported throughout this time because I’ve received so many messages of support from a lot of different people,” Chavez Lamar told The Hoya. “Some of those have included former staff members that I’ve worked with, interns that I’ve worked with, and it has made me feel really good to know that they do see this particular situation that I’m in as inspiring for them, in terms of that it could possibly be them in this position in the future.”
The Smithsonian Institution announced Chavez Lamar’s appointment Jan. 19 after Kevin Gover, who previously served as the museum’s director, became the Smithsonian’s under secretary for museums and culture in January 2021.
Chavez Lamar’s appointment comes as a part of a broader movement to include Indigenous voices in museum work, according to Lonnie Bunch, secretary of the Smithsonian, in a Jan. 19 press release.
“Dr. Chavez Lamar is at the forefront of a growing wave of Native American career museum professionals,” Burch wrote in the press release. “They have played an important role in changing how museums think about their obligations to Native communities and to all communities.” 
Chavez Lamar’s research interests include Southwest Native art and the methodologies and practices involved in collaborating with individual Indigenous communities, according to the press release.
Chavez said her family in New Mexico inspired her future academic interest in Indigenous art and culture.
“Growing up in a family with an artist really influenced me when I was young,” Chavez Lamar said. “And of course, my family participated in art markets, they knew artists, so it was just really a big part of my life.”
Prior to her renewed tenure at NMAI in 2014, Chavez Lamar was an intern in 1994 and served as an associate curator from 2000 to 2005 at NMAI.
According to Chavez Lamar, her experiences working at NMAI in the early 2000s helped shape her conduct when working with Indigenous communities.
“NMAI is where I learned the practices and ethical principles of collaboration with Indigenous people,” Chavez Lamar said. “That was really ingrained in me when I was at NMAI, and when I left NMAI, that was very much a part of the way that I continued to work with Indigenous people.”
Chavez Lamar also served as the director of the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center in Albuquerque, N.M., following her departure from NMAI in 2006 before becoming the director of the Indian Arts Research Center at the School for Advanced Research in Santa Fe, N.M., in 2007, a position she held until returning to NMAI in 2014 to serve as assistant director for collections. 
One of the priorities throughout her tenure as director of NMAI will be continuing collaborations with Indigenous groups and spotlighting Indigenous communities, according to Chavez Lamar.
“I have a deep commitment to collaboration and partnership with Indigenous people,” Chavez Lamar told The Hoya. “I know that the museum as a whole has historically, up into the present day, has had that commitment, so I’ll continue to emphasize that.”
Assuming a position of this magnitude is a challenge, but it is one Chavez Lamar is determined to meet.
“It still really hasn’t completely sunk in that I’m going to be the director of the National Museum of American Indian, and I think that sort of the enormity of it has not really fully hit me yet,” Chavez Lamar said. “If anything, I really want to be able to continue to support the excellent work of the staff so that we can amplify Indigenous perspectives and voices through the educational offerings of the museum.”

Professors at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service (SFS) were appointed to the Biden administration’s Defense Policy Board.
The Defense Policy Board, a subset of the U.S. Department of Defense below the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy made up of 19 members, provides informed advice to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. New appointees to the board include former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Victor Cha, vice dean for faculty and graduate affairs and holder of the D.S. Song-Korea Foundation Endowed Chair in the department of government and SFS; and Michael O’Hanlon, professor in the Center for Security Studies and senior fellow and director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. 
Former Secretary of State Albright was sworn in as chair for the board in Nov. 2021 after being removed from the board by the Trump administration a year earlier. 
The Defense Policy Board provides an opportunity for independent, private citizens to provide expertise and perspective to assist the Secretary of Defense in defense policy decision making, according to O’Hanlon.
“Based on the first meeting, and based on my expectations of what this kind of a board can usefully accomplish, I will use words like friendly skeptic, tough love and second set of eyes to convey the notion of a group of individuals that would like to see Secretary Austin and the United States and the Department of Defense do well, but may or may not agree with him on everything, may or may not agree with each other on everything, but still are hopeful there’s some utility in the group getting together,” O’Hanlon said in an interview with The Hoya.
Though the U.S. should remain apprehensive of other threats, the most concerning matter in defense policy for the Biden administration is dealing with Russia and China, according to O’Hanlon.
“The whole point here is to try to bear in mind that the world does interfere with your plans and your strategies,” O’Hanlon said. “The idea that you might think Russia and China should be your main concerns, but something else changes that dynamic altogether — that’s always a possibility. At a purely conceptual and historical level, I would say that those are the two greatest concerns, and they will remain that.”
Cha has been a member of the Georgetown faculty since 1995 and has taught a broad range of courses in international relations, foreign policy and Asian studies. He is also currently the senior vice president and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.
Cha hopes to work alongside fellow Defense Policy Board members to provide advice to U.S. Department of Defense officials.
“It’s an honor to serve on the DPB and humbling to do so under the leadership of Secretary Albright. The purpose of the DPB is to provide advice to the senior leadership of the Pentagon and there is no better senior statesperson to do that than Secretary Albright. I hope to support her and the DPB in any way that I can,” Cha wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Albright, along with teaching courses in diplomacy at Georgetown in the SFS, is chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, part of Dentons Global Advisors, and Albright Capital Management LLC. She also chairs the National Democratic Institute, serves as the president of the Truman Scholarship Foundation and is honorary co-chair of the World Refugee Council.
Georgetown is proud to see its professors serve as real-world leaders in foreign policy, according to Joel Hellman, dean of the SFS.
“SFS faculty live our SFS values through their commitment to public service,” Hellman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We welcome the appointment of such accomplished professors as Victor and Michael O’Hanlon to the Defense Policy Board. They represent the best of SFS.”

A new grant will allow the Asian Studies and the African Studies programs to collaborate in researching and discussing diplomacy, trade and development between the two regions. 
The Africa-China Initiative, a joint project funded by a $50,000 year-long grant from the Henry Luce Foundation, will offer a series of coordinated events geared toward members of the Georgetown community, policymakers and the public. The events will consist of speakers with expertise in Africa-China affairs. The program will also oversee the creation of a policy working group composed of experts in the field.  
The state of international politics makes it impossible to separate the two regions from one another, making increased joint research on Africa-China relations a priority, according to Helena Kolanda, director of the Asia Program at the Henry Luce Foundation.
“One can’t think about China and the United States in a bilateral context anymore,” Kolanda said in an interview with The Hoya. “Both countries are global powers and have connections and impact all over the world. Part of the interest in this initiative was the fact that it was going to be working across the China-Africa, Africa-China space.”
The goal of the speaker series and the policy group is to clarify the narrative surrounding Africa and China, according to Yoon Jung Park, professor in the African Studies Program and program director of the Africa-China Initiative. 
“Both of these activities ultimately have the aim of correcting some of the misconceptions, myths, and rumors around Africa-China engagements and foregrounding African views and experiences,” Park wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The events will be co-sponsored by other Georgetown departments, as well as external partners like Howard University’s Center for African Studies, and will consist of speakers with expertise in Africa-China affairs. Additionally, the policy working group will conduct outreach to targeted policymakers and practitioners. 
The significance of cooperating on African and Asian studies is that stereotypes will be corrected, according to Park. 
“We want to ensure that our audiences are aware that there are multiple perspectives and priorities that may not necessarily align with US- or European-centered views,” Park wrote. “As Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche has stated, there is much more than ‘a single story.’”
Adiche is an author and speaker from Nigeria who has delivered two popular TED Talks, “The Danger of a Single Story” in 2009 and “We Should All Be Feminists” in 2012. The former focuses on dispelling the monolithic view that all Africans have the same story, something that the Africa-China Initiative aims to correct. 
By engaging in joint research and discussions through the Africa-China Initiative, studies in each individual region will be strengthened, according to Michael Green, director of the Asian Studies Program.
“We can learn quite a bit about the variables shaping China’s development approaches going forward by appreciating the agency of African leaders and citizens,” Green wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This will also help us broaden our study of global China, and the interaction of China with other major powers like Japan or France in outside of the usual East Asian and European areas of focus.” 
Similarly, the joint program will explain China’s policies and engagement in Africa through a lens that takes African perspectives into account, according to Park.  
“African agency is another topic that has received quite a lot of attention in recent years,” Park wrote. “My own area of work focuses on migration and race relations, both in African countries and in China; we will explore this as another possible panel or roundtable event.”
According to Kolanda, the Africa-China Initiative will offer valuable perspectives by expanding its participants beyond academia.  
“Knowledge is not the purview of academics alone,” Kolanda told The Hoya. “There are practitioners in the NGO sector, civil society, business and government who are all touching upon these issues and have knowledge that needs to be shared.”

When Samantha Deutsch (SFS ’25) returned to campus after winter break, she found water gushing from the ceiling of her Harbin residence hall. 
“As I was walking toward the room, I noticed that there was water on the floor,” Deutsch said in an interview with The Hoya. “Water had flooded in through the ceiling, from the sprinkler pipes, into my room and the three surrounding rooms. In fact, two of the rooms were much worse than mine.” 
Over the past six weeks two flooding incidents recently occurred in Harbin and Copley Hall — both of which are first-year residence halls. The first incident occurred in Copley on Dec. 18, one day after the end of the fall semester. The other occurred in Harbin on Jan. 11. The university’s responses and handling of these incidents have sparked frustrations from students who complain the university did not leave rooms in livable conditions or adequately communicate about repairs made to affected rooms.   
The damage in Harbin that affected Deutsch went unresolved for multiple days; after spending the night at a friend’s apartment, Deutsch said she found that there were still damages to her room when she returned the next day.  
“When I came back into the room, it was very wet. It was really humid. So there was water dripping from the ceiling, and my windows were all fogged up,” Deutsch said.  
Deutsch also said some of her belongings, including shoes and clothing, were destroyed by water damage. 
Damage made to sprinklers during repairs caused flooding isolated to the four Harbin rooms, according to a university spokesperson.
Carolina Permuy (SFS ’25), whose Harbin room was affected during the same incident, said the water from the sprinklers was brown and discolored her bedding. 
“I’ve washed it three different times, it was white and now it’s brown, so I’m using that for now because it’s technically clean, but it’s just kind of gross,” Permuy said in an interview with The Hoya.  
Students should report property damages to the Office of Risk Management, according to an email sent to affected students from Krista Haxton, the Director of Housing Operations. 
Lucy Cullen (COL ’25), Permuy’s roommate, said her room was unlivable even after  maintenance personnel vacuumed up the water..   
“The first night when we got an email from Residential Living, they said that facilities said that our room was livable like we could stay in our rooms at night, which was completely false, there was no way we would be able to stay in a room with no bedding and it was just so gross and musty,” Cullen said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Although there are no existing damages, the roommates are nervous that mold growth could develop due to the water, according to Cullen. Additionally, the roommates had to repeatedly ask the university for a fan and dehumidifier for the room, Cullen said.  
Due to the incident dehumidifiers and dryers were placed in hallways and affected rooms to help mitigate damages, according to the email.  
The incident coinciding with the start of the spring semester created unnecessary stress, according to Cullen. 
“I was kind of having a rough day like leaving home and then on top of that, it was the flood and then on top of that I was starting new classes so yeah, it was tough, everything piled on,” Cullen said. 
Simon Mulrooney (COL ’25) said his Copley room flooded two days before the start of the winter break after the toilet malfunctioned. 
“I’m not sure exactly what the issue was, but the toilet flushed continuously and so it would spill some of the excess water that was pouring into the toilet bowl out of the side for about 20 minutes which basically got water all over both rooms,” Mulrooney said in an interview with The Hoya. 
An overloaded toilet, which was reported to Work Management in Facilities Operations, caused the flooding in Copley, according to the spokesperson. 
After the flooding, which left about a centimeter of water on the floor of the doom, the roommates were moved to temporary housing in the Georgetown University Hotel, according to Mulrooney. University maintenance made repairs to the room and there is no outstanding damage to the room, Mulrooney said.  
All impacted students were moved to the hotel, according to the spokesperson. 
Caroline Fleming (SFS ’25), who lives on the Copley floor below Mulrooney, said as a result of the incident water began pouring from a light in her bathroom ceiling.   
Fleming said she immediately called maintenance to assess the situation. However, when Fleming and her roommate returned from winter break, they discovered their room and belongings had been damaged, including their bathroom light which was filled with water, according to Molly Evanko (MSB ’25), Flemming’s roommate.  
“My stuff was all over the place. There’s dust all over my room, and I have allergies. There was paint all over the floor too,” Evanko said. “It was kind of overwhelming.”  
The university is committed to providing safe living spaces for students, according to the spokesperson. 
“Georgetown University strives to provide safe and comfortable living spaces for all students living on campus. Despite routine maintenance managed by the Facilities Operations team, we still experience issues and respond as they are reported,” the spokesperson wrote. 
The university has not informed the roommates of the source of the flooding or offered to pay for damaged property, according to Flemming. 
Evanko said the university should have informed her on the repairs made. 
“I kind of feel like when the University comes into your room, especially when they move things or do major work, I feel like there should be some kind of report that gets sent out by facilities,” Evanko said. “It’s my own personal space.”

Student leaders passed a resolution demanding extended student access times to various campus buildings. 
The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) resolution, which passed at a Senate meeting Jan. 23, calls for the university to extend the hours students can access residential buildings with their GoCards — ID cards provided to students, faculty and staff — to 24 hours a day. Current university policy limits student access to only their own residential buildings after 12 a.m. The resolution also calls for extended GoCard access to the Leavey Center, Regents Hall, the Rafik B. Hariri Building and the Intercultural Center until 3 a.m.
Student access to all campus buildings late at night will increase campus security, according to GUSA Senator Sanjana Ranganathan (SFS ’25), who introduced the resolution at the meeting. 
“In light of recent security concerns over last semester, the goal is that students can easily access any building for safety at any time of night,” Ranganathan wrote. “In addition, from a convenience standpoint, access to the aforementioned buildings will increase late-night studying options for students.”
Multiple intrusions into student residence halls have sparked safety concerns among students. At approximately 1 a.m. on Sept. 19, an intruder armed with a knife gained entry into New South Hall, a first-year dormitory In response to the intrusions, the university has increased security in affected residence halls by stationing student guards in halls and increasing the patrol of the Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD).  
Limiting access to residential buildings ensures the safety of students, according to a university spokesperson. 
“The restricted hours for residential buildings are rooted in safety and are meant to ensure that only residents of each building have access during times when our community is typically sleeping and studying,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Allowing students 24/7 access to all residential buildings would increase the risk of sexual misconduct, according to GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (COL ’22), who cast the sole vote against the resolution. 
“While I support extended access to places where students study such as Hariri, I am worried about giving all undergraduates access to residential dorms,” Flores wrote to The Hoya. “I look back to our campus climate survey, which found that 31.6% of women and 11.6% of men reported experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact since entering college. Without in-person bystander training for the Class of 2024 and Class of 2025, supporting this legislation seemed reckless.” 
COVID-19 related delays in mandatory in-person bystander training for first-years and sophomores, which usually take place in the first weeks of the fall semester, have prompted concerns among students and faculty about the dangers of insufficient education. 
Flores said students have access to other services on campus that can provide safety in a time of need. 
“There are other avenues that could be used such as calling an RA-on-duty or GERMS, other students that are trained in dealing with emergencies,” Flores wrote. 
Extended access to residence halls may increase the presence of GUPD on campus, according to Flores.   
In the past, students have voiced concerns about GUPD’s presence on campus as students of color reported being hyperpoliced. Last fall, GUSA members launched the Georgetown University Police Department Abolition Working Group to abolish the presence of the university police on campus. 
Students concerned about dorm safety should attend GUPD safety talks and be involved in the conversations between GUSA and the administration, according to Ranganathan. 
“I encourage any interested students to attend the safety talks led by GUPD where they encourage student comment on security issues,” Ranganathan wrote. “I also encourage any interested students to get involved with GUSA, either by attending and contributing at Senate meetings or joining on the Executive side to further advocacy.”
Part of the push for increased access will include advocacy to the university for more in person student training, according to Ranganathan.  “As part of the implementation we will definitely be pushing the University to implement in-person training for sophomores and freshmen,” Ranganathan wrote. “While all students have taken the online module, due to COVID the in-person supplemental discussion was canceled. So we will definitely be pushing to conduct that again.”

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced a new pilot program to provide direct cash assistance to new and expectant mothers in Wards 5, 7 and 8. 
The $1.5 million Strong Families, Strong Future D.C. program aims to provide $900 per month to 132 new and expectant mothers for a full year to ease the burden of motherhood in low income areas in the District, according to Bowser’s Jan. 13 press release. 
Raising a young child in the District is more expensive than in any other state, costing over $28,000 annually to provide necessities such as food, housing, clothing, diapers and medical care. 
The program is one more step in the District’s plan to provide support for low-income mothers, according to Bowser.
“This program is about supporting new and expectant moms with cash so that they can have the autonomy and flexibility to make the best choices for them and their baby,” Bowser wrote in the press release. “The Strong Families, Strong Future DC pilot builds on the work we’ve done to address disparities in maternal health outcomes, make high-quality child care more affordable and accessible, and ensure women are at the heart of our equitable economic recovery strategy.”
COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted mothers, who have been burdened with increased child care responsibilities, according to the Pew Research Center. The challenges were heightened for working moms, with 39% reporting increased difficulties balancing work and family responsibilities.
The pilot program is a collaborative effort between the Mayor’s office, the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development and local child development nonprofit Martha’s Table.
During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Martha’s Table used $1.2 million to provide $9,000 in direct cash assistance to 137 D.C. families over a four-month period, according to Whitney Faison, assistant communications director of Martha’s Table.
“Direct cash assistance is a permanent aspect of Martha’s Table’s portfolio,” Faison wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We know this program works. This is our third cash assistance program and the evidence is there.”
Cash assistance positively impacts the wellbeing of lower-income households, helping to pay for everyday needs, according to Faison. 
“It wasn’t putting cash in people’s hands, it was extending the dignity and respect they deserve in a time when it was needed most,” Faison wrote.
Similar pilot programs around the United States have shown progress in the communities they are designed to serve. For example, the Magnolia Mother’s Trust in Jackson, Miss., has provided $1,000 cash on a monthly basis to low-income, Black mothers since the fall of 2018 and has now become the country’s longest-running basic income program. 
Direct cash assistance programs have been successful because they let new mothers use the financial support however they see fit, according to Faison.
Unrestricted cash assistance is routinely used to meet financial needs as each family sees fit, including paying utility bills, making rent payments, paying for transportation to and from jobs and medical visits, purchasing groceries, and funding childcare needs, according to Faison.
“For families in Wards 5, 7, and 8, this level of unconditional support is critical,” Faison wrote. “The first year of a child’s life brings a significant financial strain. This direct cash assistance will help families build a solid financial foundation that paves the way for lasting child and family success.”

Members of the Georgetown community have expressed anger at the university’s decision to once again host the Cardinal O’Connor Conference (OCC), the largest student-run anti-abortion conference in the United States. 
The 23rd annual conference was presented by Georgetown University Right to Life, an anti-abortion student group, and sponsored by the Office of the President. The event took place in Dahlgren Chapel on Jan. 22, with audience members attending virtually. This year’s keynote speaker was Bishop Robert Barron, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, and panelists included Monsignor James Shea, president of the University of Mary, and Helen Alvaré, professor of law at Antonin Scalia Law School. Students typically protest against the conference; this year, they spread awareness on social media. 
The conference is named after Cardinal John J. O’Connor (GRD ’70), a former archbishop of New York. Known as an anti-abortion figurehead, O’Connor also perpetuated homophobic views and policies. For instance, O’Connor staunchly opposed a 1986 New York bill that would grant legal protection to the LGBTQ community. Moreover, he prohibited instruction about contraceptives in AIDS education programs in the Archdiocese of New York in 1987 in an attempt to promote abstinence. 
The OCC contradicts ideas touted by the university, according to Chloe Kekedjian (COL ’22), president of H*yas for Choice (HFC), a pro-abortion rights student group at Georgetown.  
“The Cardinal O’Connor Conference goes deeply against Georgetown values,” Kekedjian said in an interview with The Hoya. “They’ve consistently claimed that they care about the whole person at Georgetown, and then they bring in speakers that advocate views that are homophobic, racist, sexist and generally very problematic.”
In August 2018, Barron wrote an article minimizing the crimes of former Washington, D.C. Archbishop and Georgetown University honorary degree recipient Theodore McCarrick, who was charged with three counts of indecent assault over the alleged sexual assault of a teenage boy in 1974. Barron has also expressed his disagreement with the U.S. Supreme Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage.     
Anna Douglas (COL ’24), a member of H*yas for Choice, expressed concerns about the panelists and speakers at this year’s conference.
“It’s not only a discussion about the pro-life debate, but it’s also a disussion about trying to choose people who are tolerant,” Douglas told The Hoya. 
At this year’s conference, Barron took an anti-abortion stance, likening abortion to murder.  
“It’s no accident that if the sense of God is lost, so the sense of objective moral value is lost,” Barron said at the event. “How come you can light up a building to celebrate the killing of children? Because you’ve lost this sense of God, of objective intelligibility.”
In response to the conference, H*yas for Choice posted an Instagram graphic Jan. 22 highlighting its opposition to OCC and Barron, accusing him of opposing critical race theory and restricting reproductive and sexual healthcare. 
In a Reddit thread in April, Barron wrote responses in which he opposed critical race theory and abortion.
Nadia Sadanandan (NHS ’24) reposted the H*yas for Choice graphic on her Instagram story to express her anger that the university was again hosting the conference. 
“The university definitely should not have held this event but should openly condemn COCC,” Sadanandan wrote in a message to The Hoya. “To me, by holding this event, Georgetown university seems hypocritical and the values it strives to uphold loses all meaning, especially in terms of cura personalis, community in diversity, and social justice.”
This year is not the first time students have opposed Georgetown’s close involvement in the OCC. Last year, H*yas for Choice organized a petition that garnered over 600 electronic signatures from community members calling on the university to condemn O’Connor and the speakers expressing racist, homophobic, transphobic and mysoginistic views.
Public health conditions and the virtual nature of the conference caused H*yas for Choice to emphasize online advocacy, Kekedjian said. 
“Because the conference was switched to online at the last minute we decided to focus on virtual action and spreading awareness to engage the student body,” Kekedjian wrote in an email to The Hoya.  
The university supports an open dialogue where individuals can express differing opinions, according to a university spokesperson. 
“The University works to engage with the plurality of voices that exist among our students, faculty, and staff,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown is firmly committed to the Catholic Church’s teachings and values, including those about the sanctity and dignity of life, and we strongly support a climate that continues to provide students with new and deeper contexts for engaging with our Catholic tradition and Jesuit identity.”
The Hoya asked Matteo Caulfield (COL ’23), co-director of the OCC board, for comment, and Caulfield referred The Hoya to the OCC board’s statement. 
“The O’Connor Conference board understands the value of community in building a culture of life,” the statement reads. “We believe that, in order to create a truly welcoming and diverse community at the Hilltop, we need to be open to dialogue and conversation that is respectful of our differences and celebrates common ground.” 
According to Kekedjian, the ultimate goal of the backlash against the OCC is for the university to reevaluate its role in the conference, which spreads rhetoric that is not representative of the student body. 
“What we want to see from Georgetown is them making an effort to change the name of the conference, to remove the fact that the students on campus are currently paying for it, and to be thoughtful of the speakers they choose,” Kekedjian said.

Hey Yalda, you attend a Catholic University. Call it what it is: pro-life.

Asterisks for choice have no right to declare what is in line with Georgetown’s values when they themselves are not representative of them.

Cardinal O’Connor was anti LGTBQ?   Why is this slur part of an article about abortion?  
Presidents Obama and Clinton opposed gay marriage.  Will The Hoya mention their hatred next time their names are mentioned in an unrelated article?

I have been to a number of Cardinal O’Connor Conferences and they are always interesting and diverse. I am glad GU holds them.

Facing limited resources and underrepresentation on campus, Indigenous members of the campus community continue to advocate for increased support and awareness of Indigenous issues. 
Shelbi Nahwilet Meissner, an assistant professor of philosophy at Georgetown University, and the GU Native American Student Council (NASC) have spearheaded these efforts after NASC circulated a petition in 2019 calling on the university to provide more support for Native American and Indigedous students. In the past, Indigenous students have called for a formal acknowledgement that the university resides on Piscataway and Nacotchtank land, an Indigenous curriculum workshop, and a partnership with College Horizons, a nonprofit that offers college admissions assistance to Native American students.
Georgetown lacks resources for Indigenous students that many other universities offer, according to Meissner, who is one of two Native American professors on campus and an NASC advisor.
“Your average state university tends to have an Indigenous Studies program,” Meissner said in an interview with The Hoya. “Usually some dedicated resources around recruitment and retention of Native American students, dedicated counselors, as well as tribal liaisons — folks who build relationships and maintain relationships between the university and local indigenous communities. Georgetown doesn’t really have any of those resources.” 
Many universities offer support for their Native American and Indigenous students, including the University of Minnesota, which announced plans to bolster Indigenous student enrollment by offering substantial financial aid to those from recognized tribes. Additionally, Dartmouth College is in the process of creating a grant-funded interdisciplinary collaboration to connect students and professors with cultural heritage materials.  
The absence of offices and programs dedicated to Indigenous students, coupled with the small Indigenous population on campus, has strained NASC’s ability to carry out advocacy efforts, according to NASC Vice President Alanna Cronk (COL ’23). 
“NASC is five people, and that is very important to explaining what we’re working on. Georgetown admits an abysmal amount of Native students,” Cronk said in an interview with The Hoya. “Georgetown doesn’t really have any offices for the university to deal with Indigenous issues, so everything having to do with Indigeneity either gets put on Dr. Shelbi Meissner’s desk or comes into our email. So we are incredibly overburdened with last minute requests or anybody, anywhere, wanting anything from us, so it’s actually incredibly difficult for us to have our own initiatives.” 
Additionally, Cronk said although there is an acknowledgment on Georgetown’s Center for Social Justice website that the university resides on Indigenous land, the statement does not go far enough.
“What currently exists is something that one of our members wrote by themselves in a hurry as a very young student, basically from the perspective of the university, and then we put it on the CSJ webpage,” Cronk said. 
The university is open to engaging with the Piscataway, according to a university spokesperson. 
“The university is extremely supportive of exploring opportunities to share our diversity, equity and inclusion values, and reflect the broad interests of our students,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
To address the shortcomings of the land acknowledgment, Meissner has proposed a year-long seminar for students that would center land acknowledgement and advocate that it is an ongoing process rather than a stagnant statement. 
“Various entities around Georgetown, academic departments, student clubs, classes, etcetera, can come together to dialogue about what a meaningful land acknowledgment would look like from the Georgetown community,” Meissner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This process involves building and maintaining lasting relationships with local Indigenous communities, and is infused with Indigenous research methodologies, transformative and restorative justice practices, and community-based participatory research.”
To help relieve the burden placed on NASC, Meissner said there should be dedicated places on campus where Indigedous students can carry out their spiritual and ceremonial traditions.
“Things like having places for Indigenous students to practice their spiritual traditions or their ceremonious traditions,” Meissner said. “We want to be able to advocate for them to have spaces to do that. We would love to be able to advocate for a medicine garden or a place where Indigenous students could come together to either grow or teach about growing traditional medicines, ceremonial medicines.” 
Meissner, who teaches a course on Intro to Indigenous Philosophy, said she is working on organizing an Indigenous curriculum workshop that would connect professors around campus whose work in art, philosophy, English and other fields is tied to Indigenous issues.
“We’re trying to connect this network of folks who oftentimes have a lot of questions about teaching Native American content,” Meissner said. “So that we can all kind of be on the same page, brainstorm together, link our classes, help students have shared experiences between the courses, those sorts of things.” 
While developing initiatives launched by the Indigenous community have the potential to alleviate shortcomings, large gaps still remain in Georgetown’s institutional support for its Indigenous students, according to Cronk. 
“There’s so much,” Cronk said. “How are we all together supposed to make the university admit more students and commit to a process of acknowledging that the land they sit on was violently stolen for their benefit? Those are huge things to worry about, and I’m just a junior, struggling with my classes like everyone else.”

The Georgetown University Choir and Orchestra will perform the in-person world premiere of “Credo,” composed by Margaret Bonds, composer and social justice activist.
Bonds, who was one of the first Black performers and composers in the United States to receive recognition for her work and the first Black soloist to perform for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, wrote “Credo” in the 1960s.  In her life, Black American musicians kept Bond’s name alive while white-dominated and male-dominated systems attempted to erase her presence and devoted efforts to promote other artists including her own students over Bond’s own work. The song draws on the opening text from civil rights activist W.E.B. DuBois’ “Darkwater: Voices Within the Veil,” which highlights the conflict between white and Black workers. 
Georgetown University acquired “Credo” along with other unpublished scores composed by Bonds’ in 2013 and 2016.
Much of Bonds’ musical composition was inspired by the powerful notions of justice and equality outlined by leaders of the Harlem Renaissance and the civil rights movement, according to Fred Binkholder, a professor in the department of performing arts and director of choirs at Georgetown University. 
“It’s a subtle idea of civil rights, of standing up for her heritage.” Binkholder said in an interview with The Hoya. “If you listen to her solo music, even a lot of her piano music, they have these spiritual ideas of promoting the heritage of African Americans in this thematic idea.”
Dr. John Michael Cooper, a professor of music at Southwestern University, who had been searching for compositions of Bonds for years, said he was moved by her music.
“I first heard her music, the ‘Three Dream Portraits’ on texts of Langston Hughes, when I was a Master’s student in the mid-1980s, and I was thunderstruck by its beauty, its originality, its eloquence and passion,” Cooper wrote to The Hoya. “Because it was highly unlikely that anyone who could write that music would be a one-trick composer, I immediately went looking for more. I found dictionary entries and the like that made clear that Margaret Bonds was a prolific composer, but I could only locate a tiny handful of pieces.”
Cooper, who edited over 100 of her compositions, said Bonds’ work is a testament to her musical legacy in a world that systematically erased her. 
“Black American musicians kept her name and her reputation alive, but the White-dominated and male-dominated systems of classical music and classical music criticism in the U.S. devoted all their efforts to promoting Barber, Bernstein, Copland, and even her student Ned Rorem,” Cooper wrote. “And so within a few years younger folk were no longer learning about Bonds; she disappeared from the White circles that write most of the music criticism in the U.S. and most of the music-history textbooks.”
Much of Bonds’ work has never been performed or recorded, according to Cooper.
Margaret Bonds’ musical repertoire is a testament to the contributions of Black Americans to culture and society, according to Kenny Boggess (SFS ’24), a student in the department of choir and orchestra. 
“Just as Black Americans formed the economic backbone of American society, they formed the backbone of our popular art, giving rise to musical and creative traditions that we see in everything from Bonds’ contemporary classical music to jazz and rock,” Boggess said in an interview with The Hoya.
The concert will be centered around Bonds’ music and her diligent artistic work for civil rights, according to Binkholder. 
Beyond performing Bonds’ works, academics have begun to study the newly uncovered scope of her musical genius, according to Binkholder.
“I think it is almost criminal that it hasn’t been performed or accepted before. It is meaningful, and people are starting to delve into it,” Binkholder said. “Now, if you look up Bach, there’s probably 2000 dissertations on Bach’s music. Are there any dissertations on the music of Margaret Bonds? I’m hoping that this is going to open up an entirely new component not only to performance, but also to scholarship.” 
The opportunity to perform a forgotten repertoire highlights an important aspect of American culture, according to Angel Gil-Ordóñez, director of the Georgetown University Orchestra.
“I think one of the reasons for this performance is to show that music of the early twentieth century was extraordinary,” Gil-Ordóñez told The Hoya. “It’s wonderful that the orchestra and the choir are performing classical composers from the 19th century, but this is music that has to be performed. And more importantly, this is music with American roots. This is very American.” 
The concert will be held in Gaston Hall on April 2 and will feature the Georgetown orchestra and choir.

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate unanimously passed a resolution demanding hybrid learning options for immunocompromised students at a Jan. 23 meeting. 
The resolution calls for the university to create hybrid methods of instruction for immunocompromised and other vulnerable students, allow students who are quarantining to attend classes virtually, and gather information on the number of immunocompromised students on campus. 
The resolution aims to better accommodate students who are more vulnerable to COVID-19 and to generally increase student wellbeing, according to GUSA Senator Sanjana Ranganathan (SFS ’25), who introduced the resolution. 
“The goal of this resolution is to increase inclusion on campus for medically vulnerable populations while also increasing student and staff safety on campus,” Ranganathan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We look forward to collaborating with the University health department as well as technology support staff to form a feasible and safe plan for immunocompromised students.”
The resolution also urges the university to gather more data about immunocompromised populations in order to better provide resources for medically vulnerable groups, according to Ranganathan. 
“Another important clause in the resolution is for the university to investigate and publish statistics on immunocompromised populations on campus,” Ranganathan wrote. “Finally, the bill also calls for comprehensive virtual options for any students quarantined due to COVID exposure/infection.”
The university began the spring 2022 semester with virtual instruction but will return to in-person learning Jan. 31. The resolution calls on the university to provide virtual options for students who are immunocompromised or in quarantine as a result of a positive COVID-19 test result. 
The university should learn from its shortcomings from the fall semester and be more receptive to the needs of the student body, according to GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (COL ’22).
“While in the fall semester, professors were instructed to record lectures when it comes to courses, it doesn’t always mean that professors followed,” Flores wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Some professors have chosen to not have an online component at all, and with the spread of the omicron variant, attending in-person classes can be intimidating.”
During the fall 2021 semester, Rohan Williamson, vice provost for education, emphasized that students should not expect to attend an in-person class asynchronously or for professors to provide opportunities for virtual participation in a Sept. 30 email to community members. The email said that faculty were not required to allow students to attend in-person classes virtually, even for COVID-related absences, which caused student frustration. 
While the university is committed to in-person instruction beginning Jan. 31, the health of the community will be prioritized, according to a university spokesperson. 
“​​We will also continue to prioritize the health of our community in all we do, therefore, if students miss class because of COVID-19-related isolation or quarantine it will be handled in a manner consistent with students missing class for illness or other reasons,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “To this end, faculty members have been encouraged to accommodate students by making course materials available to students missing classes due to COVID-19-related isolation or quarantine, or other symptoms and illnesses, based upon course content and pedagogy.”
While a hybrid mode of instruction should be prioritized for immunocompromised students, having a permanent hybrid learning option for all students would be beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the long term, according to Flores.
“This should be an immediate policy due to the pandemic, and I believe that the university should look into making this policy a permanent aspect of a Georgetown education,” Flores said. “Hybrid formats are not only helpful during a pandemic. They help working students with hectic schedules but also protect students from other illnesses — not just COVID-19.”
Students who are looking to accelerate the process of implementing hybrid options should make their voices heard to the university through direct communication, according to Ranganathan. “I definitely encourage students to write letters to the University administration and health department,” Ranganathan said.

If you wanted a virtual education, then perhaps Arizona State University better fits both your desires, and your budget. But for $80k/year, zoom does not provide the experience that most students would prefer, and deserve.
In-person dialogue and communication is essential to a vibrant, engaged, academic community. This determination to perpetuate a virtual classroom environment may have a small degree of validity for those who are truly immunocompromised. But the vast majority of your student body – and the professors – are capable of in-person attendance. Enough of the excuses. Time to get on with living, and learning.

The Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service (GERMS) restarted full-time emergency medical services for members of the Georgetown community Jan. 20 following nearly two years of closures and limited hours. 
GERMS is an on-campus, student-run EMS group that responds free of charge to calls regarding intoxication, illnesses and injuries on campus and in the off-campus neighborhoods of West Georgetown, Burleith and Foxhall. After gradually increasing operations during the fall 2021 semester, GERMS now has enough trained drivers and crew leaders to expand to their pre-COVID-19 pandemic 24-hour service. 
After spending a semester recruiting and training new members, GERMS is fully equipped to increase its hours, according to Julia Foley (COL ’22), GERMS captain. 
“We have a rigorous internal training process to ensure the best quality of care for the campus community, so we spent the majority of last semester internally training our members to take on the roles of driver and crew leader,” Foley wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Every shift includes three to five GERMS members, all of whom are emergency medical technicians (EMT), including one driver and one crew leader, according to Grace Murray (NHS ’22), GERMS vice president of operations.
At the start of the fall 2021 semester, GERMS announced they would not be accepting new members and would only be operating between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, citing a lack of training for members during the pandemic. Several members were trained and promoted to driver and crew leader positions in September, allowing GERMS to expand its operating hours Sept. 30 to span from Thursdays at 8 p.m. to Mondays at 8 a.m. 
According to Foley, it was important for GERMS to return to 24-hour service in an effort to alleviate pandemic related pressures on the wider Washington, D.C. healthcare system. 
“GERMS is a free medical service and we want to be available as much as possible to provide free & accessible emergency medical care and transport to the hospital for the Georgetown community,” Foley wrote. “We felt this was especially important now more than ever with staffing limitations across the healthcare system, including in DC Fire & EMS, due to the recent spike in COVID-19 cases.”
When GERMS receives a student call, its EMTs assess the patient, provide care and transport the patient to MedStar Georgetown University Hospital Emergency Department if necessary. While the services GERMS provides are free of charge, typical ambulance fees in Washington, D.C., are $1,000.  
GERMS will continue to assist the campus community as it returns to 24-hour service, according to a university spokesperson.  
“We are pleased to see GERMS resume its normal operating hours, and return to their role as first responders to the needs of our campus, after working to train and certify additional students and increasing its staff,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.  
GERMS had to recruit and train first-years and sophomores who had never been to campus before the fall 2021 semester before expanding services, according to Murray. 
“Because only half of the campus population had experienced GERMS before, we knew we needed to work hard to ensure that all students were aware of the services GERMS can provide,” Murray wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We know that us not being 24/7 in the fall was abnormal for GERMS, but we are excited to now be able to provide our services consistently to our community.”
GERMS accepted new applicants in December for their spring 2022 probationary class alongside their existing EMT training class, which is returning for the spring. 
While GERMS has yet to reach its pre-pandemic membership levels, with 64 members as opposed to past years of 85 to 100 members, current members are devoted to helping students in need of emergency care, according to Foley. 
“Although we have a smaller membership, our current members are very committed to GERMS which is why we are able to return to 24/7 service despite a smaller membership than we’ve had previously,” Foley wrote. 
GERMS plans on continuing its renewed 24-hour operations for the remainder of the spring 2022 semester, according to Foley.
“We hope students will now know that with our new hours, you can call us at any hour of the day and we will be there to support you,” Foley wrote.

Smithsonian museums in Washington, D.C., are operating on a modified schedule as a result of unprecedented staffing shortages due to COVID-19. 
The Smithsonian Institution announced the changes Jan. 14 following reduced days and hours of operations for its museums from Jan. 5 through 17. A temporary schedule would go into effect starting Jan. 18 until further notice as a large quantity of staff members have been infected with COVID-19 due to the highly transmissible omicron variant. 
The National Air and Space Museum, the National Postal Museum and the Anacostia Community Museum will all be closed until further notice, according to the Smithsonian’s press release. In addition, the National Air and Space Museum will be closed for at least six months beginning March 28 due to renovations. 
The National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of African American History and Culture will continue to operate five days a week. The National Museum of Natural History will operate Wednesday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m, the National Museum of American History will operate Friday through Tuesday 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture will operate Wednesday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.  
Some exhibits may be closed until further notice to reduce the number of staff needed and some museums have limited their number of entrances, according to the press release. 
Closing the three museums will allow the Smithsonian to allocate staff members as needed to keep its other museums open, according to Alison Mitchell, a spokesperson for the National Air and Space Museum. 
“The Smithsonian evaluated operations, staffing needs and public visitation patterns during the first temporary closures and reduced hours at some of the Smithsonian museums that ran from Jan. 5-17,” Mitchell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “That led to the newly modified schedule, which includes the continued closure of the National Air and Space Museum, that reflects the continuing need to reduce operations due to ongoing staff shortages while accommodating the needs of the public by opening more Smithsonian museums on weekends.”
Other museums, such as the National Portrait Gallery and the National Zoo, have shifted their schedules to be open from Thursday to Sunday.
The National Zoo, which is typically open everyday, will similarly follow a Thursday to Sunday schedule to protect animals and staff from exposure, according to Pamela Baker-Masson, a spokesperson for the National Zoo .
“The Zoo remained fully operational throughout COVID to provide quality animal care for the 1,800 animals in our care,” Baker-Masson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We adapted several protocols to keep our staff and animals as safe as possible during this time (wear protective gear, distancing, limit the number of people with access to animals and to other staff etc.)”
Pandemic-related staffing shortages in the District have also resulted in scaled-back bus services, reduced hours for government offices, school disruptions and strains on the county fire department. 
The museum closures have limited opportunities for Georgetown students to take advantage of study spaces across the District, according to Joe Massaua (SFS ’25).
“Essentially the portrait gallery is a great study space but due to covid is only open Thursday to Sunday,” Massaua wrote in a message to The Hoya. “It’s a beautiful museum with an atrium that is perfect to have a coffee and do work in. It’s a shame that the Smithsonian has decided to limit the operating hours.” 
COVID-19 safety measures remain in place to ensure the safety of both employees and visitors, according to Mitchell.
“Since early in the pandemic, the Smithsonian has required face coverings be worn by visitors and staff inside the building, social distancing within the buildings, and has increased cleaning and provided hand sanitizing stations throughout the buildings,” Mitchell wrote.
Although in-person visits to many Smithsonian museums are limited, the museums remain committed to providing virtual opportunities for visitors, such as webcams at the National Zoo, according to Baker-Masson. 
While these museums deal with reduced hours and closures, there is optimism that the museum will reopen soon if the Smithsonian does not experience prolonged staffing shortages, according to Mitchell.
“We anticipate the museum in DC will reopen March 3,” Mitchell wrote. “The Smithsonian is continuing to assess the situation and staffing needs and will continue to adjust the schedule as needed.”

The Georgetown University Mail Services Department has been sending conflicting and delayed messages to students about the status and location of their packages, making it difficult for some students to ship packages to campus at the risk of never receiving them. 
Some notifications from the mail department are informing students of package delivery and expiration simultaneously, posing challenges for students trying to retrieve their packages. 
Students are supposed to receive an email when their package is ready to be picked up, beginning a 30-day period before the package is returned to the sender. But lately, some students have received faulty notifications.
The lack of accurate communication caused problems for Chloe Kim (COL ’25) when shipping her contact lenses so that they would arrive shortly after she returned to campus Jan. 4. 
The Georgetown University Mail Services Department did not email Kim to notify her that her package had arrived until Jan. 18, ten days after it had actually arrived, and the university does not allow students to retrieve packages without an email confirmation. By then, the mail department claimed it had already returned her contacts to the sender, she said. 
Kim had to order contacts again — this time to an off-campus location — to ensure that she would receive them on time and that they would not be sent back.
“I woke up to an email saying that my package had been in the Leavey locker center and that it had been sitting there for two weeks and was about to expire and that I had to go and get it,” Kim told The Hoya. “I frantically rushed there to go check for it, and it wasn’t there.”
A mail services employee acknowledged the recent package notification problems and told Kim to go to the mail distribution center in the Leavey Center Ballroom. 
“He redirected me to the ballroom and said they were having issues with the locker bank in general and that it has been sending out a lot of faulty messages about expired packages and late notifications for packages that have been delivered already,” Kim said. 
She ultimately found her package at the mail distribution center in the Leavey Center Ballroom.
The lack of accurate messages about mail delivery is especially difficult for students who, like Kim, get important health care items shipped to campus. 
“It was frustrating because I had paid for overnight shipping to ensure that I would have them as soon as I got to school and then I ended up getting them around 10 days later,” Kim wrote in a follow-up message to The Hoya. “I also had added frustration because my contacts are a key component of my life.” 
Genevieve Domenico (MSB, SFS ’23) faced similar challenges when recently trying to retrieve her package.
Domenico received six consecutive emails from mail services — the first two of which had different time stamps, indicating they were not sent when they were supposed to be — within one minute of each other Jan. 18. The first set of timestamps was set at 2:38 p.m., while the remaining emails had a timestamp of 8 a.m. The first two emails informed her that she had a package ready for pickup in one of the locker banks, while the next four said her package had expired because it was not retrieved on time. 
“I had no chance, no opportunity — no notification that it was actually there in the locker room until after they kicked it out,” Domenico told The Hoya. “All those emails that would have let me know came the same time the email that it was expired came.”
The messages did not include information about where to retrieve the expired package, which can be confusing when waiting for multiple packages, Domenico said.
“They didn’t say if they were sending it back, nor did they actually explicitly say they were sending it to the Amazon room,” Domenico said. “The only reason I knew they didn’t send it back was because I did get the second email from the Amazon room with the same tracking number. Otherwise, I genuinely would not have known if it was there or not.”
The university resolved two issues affecting package delivery on campus, one of which was a temporary connectivity issue affecting notifications for packages in 24 of the 550 lockers across campus, according to a university spokesperson. 
The spokesperson said that the only packages returned to the senders this academic year — with the exception of packages with issues such as an incorrect address or a damaged label — were those received during the fall 2021 semester that were unclaimed as of Dec. 20. 
This is not the first time that students have expressed frustration with receiving packages from the Georgetown University mailroom. At the start of the Fall 2021 semester, the Georgetown University Mail Services Department received 3,000 packages per day, causing significant delays between arrival date and the date in which students could retrieve their packages; however, an influx of packages is always common at the beginning of the year. 
According to Domenico, it can be risky to mail important packages to the university given past delays and faulty notifications.  
“I genuinely tell my parents never to mail something important to Georgetown,” Domenico said. “It’s not worth it because it’s not a secure system to mail money or personal information.”

The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics) fellows for the spring 2022 semester sat down with The Hoya to discuss what they hope to talk about with students as well as how they plan to strengthen democratic ideals through dialogue in their discussion groups.
This semester’s fellows include Ashley Etienne, former communications director to Vice President Kamala Harris; Alyssa Farah Griffin, former White House communications director for the Trump Administration; Wesley Lowery, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist; Dafna Linzer, former managing editor for politics at NBC News and MSNBC; Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican pollster; and Elliot Williams, former deputy assistant attorney general under former President Obama. The fellows will host events and discussion groups with students throughout the semester. 
The following has been edited for length and clarity. 
Question 1: What is the most important topic that each of you hope to cover in your discussion group, and why that topic?
Griffin: Threats to democracy. I think that we’ve seen them more recently from the right — my party, I’m a Republican — they exist on the left as well, and I think our country hasn’t had to grapple with the notion that this great American experiment is in fact an experiment and something that we’re not promised.
Linzer: My topic is actually trust and government, so what we’re really going to focus on in almost every possible way is the erosion of trust and government and trying to understand what that’s about and how to turn that around. I think participation from students and people really thinking together is what I’m hoping will get us there.
Lowery: My topic is going to be about the institution of media specifically, and I think one of the things I’m interested in is talking to students about their media consumption habits. I think so much of what we’ve done in our industry has been based off of what people inside of our industry think readers and viewers want, with often not much actual consideration of how people are consuming and receiving news today. 
Williams: Jan. 6, for a big reason, because it’s playing out in real time, with Congress investigating the events. Also, the fact that this attack on democracy, literally and figuratively, the response to it has become so partisan, is something we need to explore and pick apart and understand. 
Anderson: One thing I’m excited to tackle with my group that I think is really important is the way that listening plays a role in political communication. A lot of the time there are folks that want to get their message right. They sort of miss that old adage that you have two ears and one mouth, and you should use them in appropriate proportion. There’s a lot of talking that happens in politics but not a lot of listening, and I want to think through with the students, “How is listening a prerequisite for smart political communication?” 
Etienne: My discussion group is going to be discussing the use of power. I’ve had the benefit and the privilege of having a front row seat and watching these really transformative political figures — from Obama to Pelosi to Harris — negotiate the politics of power at the most powerful seats in the world. We’re going to take an examination and a look at how some of the political figures have done it, and then more importantly how it’s being exercised across different industries to discuss the status quo, transform our nation and have a lasting impact. 
Question 2: Given increased polarization in the aftermath of Jan. 6, how will you plan to use your discussion groups to promote and strengthen democratic ideals? 
Anderson: I want to cover what role should political leaders play when it comes to, “Do I listen to what my voters are telling me or not?” If you are a Republican member of Congress on Jan. 6 and your constituents wanted you to vote against certifying the election results, but you knew in your heart of hearts that you should certify them, how do you resolve that tension? 
Griffin: One is tackling polarization and leading by example, being a conservative on a left of center campus and saying, “I want to hear from as many viewpoints as possible.” Secondly, something I will tackle as part of my discussion group is the role that adversary propaganda and disinformation has played in tearing at our institutions and chipping away at our democracy. 
Williams: When we talk about how people consume news and information and some of the problems therein, I don’t think that this is a function of one newspaper or television outlet or words placed in an article or a headline in a certain way. It’s your uncle on Facebook and the manner in which people for years have been able to only select the places where they gather information. I don’t necessarily think that Jan. 6 was a triggering event but a symptom and an extreme example of something toxic that started years before. 
Linzer: I can’t imagine anything that’s more indicative of a lack of trust in government than what we saw on that day. I think it’s important for all Americans, but I think there’s a personal experience for Georgetown students having been a part of this city and the capital in this period. I do hope that it comes up often in the discussions and in interesting ways. 
Lowery: I think that from a media perspective this raises a discourse of questions that have existed. We live in a moment where the most elite media organizations are organizations that have constructed a system that requires them to brand themselves neutrally. Should the Washington Post and the New York Times be neutral on the concept of democracy? Suddenly these questions of values and ethics become several steps more complicated. Jan. 6 is an easy thing to grapple with. What we do tomorrow, how we cover the voting rights legislation, is much more complicated. I think that having those sorts of conversations is really important. 
Question 3: What would you say is the most important thing young people can do to promote democracy given the recent political climate?
Anderson: I’m a big advocate of things like high school debate programs and anything that puts people in an environment where they’re pushed outside their comfort zone. Being courageous enough to be in a place with people who think differently than you is important, and I think that if more people did that, our democracy would be healthier today. 
Griffin: As often as you can, have conversations with people on the other side of the aisle, not even necessarily to change your viewpoint but just to try to better understand theirs and understand that your learned experience brought you to certain conclusions, but somebody is not a bad person because their experience brought them to different political conclusions. Get out of your echo chambers, talk to people you disagree with. 
Williams: Diversify your news and information sources and also your social media, which is a news and information source. Who you follow on Twitter is a big one. 
Lowery: One of the best ways to promote democracy is to participate in it. Writing and thinking and engaging on public policy is a means of participating in democracy, so I think being a news consumer is a means of participating in democracy. And then yelling at the journalists when we get it wrong is a means of participating in democracy. I wonder what might be different if all of us were 5% or 10% more tuned in to the basic functioning of the country where we live.  
Etienne: Political engagement and activity should not just happen around elections. Young people need to stay engaged. Having been in those buildings and those rooms, you get nothing without pressure. I think as young people, I think you have to figure out, “How do you continue to leverage your voice, your power, your influence to hold your elected officials accountable and to get what you want out of the deal?” Linzer: The U.S. citizenship test has a question: “How does one participate in a democracy?” It’s a multiple choice answer for a new citizen, and one of the correct answers is write a letter to your newspaper. I love it so much.

The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics) fellows for the spring 2022 semester introduced themselves to the Georgetown community during a moderated panel discussion at the Fellows Fest on Jan. 20. 
The virtual Fellows Fest, hosted by GU politics, focused on topics including the state of United States politics and the extent to which the media play a role in the rise of ideological polarization. Ashley Etienne, Alyssa Farah Griffin, Dafna Linzer, Wesley Lowery, Kristen Soltis Anderson and Elliot Williams — the spring 2022 GU Politics fellows — are experts in the fields of government, politics, communications, journalism, media and law. They will meet with Georgetown students over the course of the semester in student strategy teams, discussion groups and office hours to discuss politics and ideas about improving the U.S. political system.
According to a Pew Research Center study, 77% of Americans think that the U.S. is more divided than it was before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the Pew Research Center reports that partisan polarization in regards to trusting media services has increased significantly since 2015. 
Partisan news media is driven by the profit it brings in as a result of heightened viewership, according to Lowery, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and correspondent for 60 Minutes+, the streaming version of CBS’s 60 Minutes program.
“When we look at all of the news outlets, we now see an explicitly partisan press that is in many ways the norm,” Lowery said at the event. “As we think about these things, I think we have to grapple with what does that mean in a world where perhaps some level of partisan press is inevitable when it’s what the people want when they vote with their wallets and their clicks.” 
One way to avoid political polarization is to ensure that individuals get their news from a wide variety of sources, according to Linzer, former managing editor for politics at NBC News and MSNBC.
“One of my biggest things that I try to encourage people to do as media consumers is to have a well-balanced diet,” Linzer said. “Don’t just stick to one channel or one outlet. If you really care about a topic, try to find all the different kinds of points of view.”  
The cohort of fellows discussed the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection, in which a group of supporters of former President Donald Trump and extremists broke into the U.S. Capitol building in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. 
According to Farah Griffin, former White House communications director for the Trump administration, the Jan. 6 attack demonstrates the threat of the spread of disinformation to democracy.
“To see our institutions being pushed to the brink because partisanship and hyper-partisanship had run so rampant and because disinformation was spread so wildly is something that we have to tackle,” Farah Griffin said. 
Disinformation was a direct cause of the Jan. 6 attack and continues to fuel political division in the U.S., according to Etienne, former communications director to Vice President Kamala Harris and former communications director to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
“It’s perpetuating this division in our nation, and the forces are internal and external. I think that is a major factor,” Etienne said. “There are people who still dispute whether or not Jan. 6 actually even happened — people who were in the building.”
The way to make progress on social issues and move forward is to end the demonization of political groups and the spread of disinformation, according to Soltis Anderson, Republican pollster and co-founder of Echelon Insights, an opinion research and analytics firm.
“The problem isn’t that we disagree with one another in big ways on things like debt or spending or what the role of government should be or culture or what have you,” Soltis Anderson said. “The problem is that increasingly we view the other side not just as wrong but as a grave threat.”
The spring 2022 fellows will host weekly discussion sections with students beginning the week of Jan. 31.
