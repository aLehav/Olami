After two years, the Healey Family Student Center (HFSC), an iconic community space featuring cozy fireplaces and beautiful view of the Potomac River, fully reopened for student use March 14. 
The HFSC closed for student use after Georgetown University switched to remote operations in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The HFSC contains multiple social and study spaces, including study rooms, event spaces and cafes. The HFSC Great Room has been used as a COVID-19 testing site since Nov. 2020, providing free PCR tests for Georgetown community members through One Medical, a primary care provider.  
Students across campus have spent the week enjoying the reopened space, finding community and enjoying the social atmosphere. 
Nicolas Gardner (SFS ’23) said the HFSC offers great views for studying. 
 “My main reason for liking the HFSC the most is that it has huge amounts of sunlight, and just a lot of good views and scenes, a lot of windows that look onto beautiful views,” Gardner told The Hoya. 
Hilltoss, a student-run salad and coffee shop located in the HFSC, reopened to students last fall and offers additional study space in the building. 
Kyanah-Isabelle Fabre (MSB ’22), who has worked at Hilltoss since spring 2019, said the reopening has brought more students into the shop.
“We’ve definitely seen an increase in foot traffic, which is always good,” Fabre said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think we were in a tougher position earlier in the year just with it being a testing center, and with the university being closed for a year and a half, we lost awareness with the underclassmen specifically.” 
HFSC study rooms reopened early February and are available seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 9:45 p.m. for student use.  
The openness of the HFSC study rooms fosters community, according to Yi Rong Mei (NHS ’23). 
“I think that’s the way it’s designed — to facilitate good conversations,” Mei said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s just the mental boost to be in that space, in comparison to Lau, which is not ideal.” 
Khadija Abid (MSB ’23), who used the HFSC study rooms before the university switched to virtual operations, said she is glad the rooms have reopened.  
“I used to study in the HFSC a lot as a freshman back in 2019-20 and I mostly used the main rooms, but I would occasionally use the study rooms whenever they were available,” Abid said in an interview with The Hoya. “I just think that it has a better atmosphere and made it easier to see people throughout the week, so I’m sort of excited to get that environment back.”
Lia Gilleran (COL ’25) said the HFSC offers the best of the other study spaces on campus, including Lauinger Library and Sellinger Lounge, an open study space located in the Leavey Center.
“It’s nice that there’s a new place to study,” Gilleran said in an interview with The Hoya. “They’re much nicer than Lau — less gloomy, but there’s still some privacy, which is different than Sellinger, which is nice.” 
Gardner said the rooms’ lighting creates a productive and comfortable environment compared to Lauinger Library.  
“A lot of the study rooms on Lau 2 don’t have windows or anything, so at times it just feels like I’m just not receiving any natural light, it feels like I’m in a box and it’s just not very conducive to studying I would say,” Gardner said an interview with The Hoya. “That contrasts quite heavily with the study rooms in the HFSC, where even if I don’t have a direct window in the room, I still feel like it’s very productive; there’s natural light coming in.” 
 The Leavey Center will be the central testing site on campus as the HFSC reopens to the community, according to a university spokesperson.
“In order to provide more study and community space for students on campus, the university consolidated COVID-19 testing on the Main and Medical Center campuses,” the spokesperson wrote. “The space may be used in accordance with the University’s current public health guidelines.”
Gardner said the reopening of the HFSC brings back a sense of normalcy.
“I already know that I’m going to love it,” Gardner said. “I get to walk past the HFSC every single day on the side looking towards the Potomac, I get to look inside and see people working there and it brings me a lot of joy to see that the HFSC is back in business and to see people diligently working there.”

The Russian invasion of Ukraine will have lasting effects on diplomatic frameworks and global economic interdependence, panelists said at a virtual event. 
At the March 17 event, titled “The Impact of the Russian Invasion on the Ukrainian, Russian, and Global Economies,” leading economists discussed the domestic and global implications of the economic crisis fueled by the ongoing war in Ukraine. 
The event was co-sponsored by the Georgetown University Global Economic Challenges Network and the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management. 
The event was moderated by ​​Shéhérazade Semsar-de Boisséson, the inaugural executive director of the McCourt Institute. 
Russian president Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, prompting the biggest military conflict in Europe since World War II. The unprovoked invasion has caused the largest refugee crisis on the continent since World War II, with nearly three million of Ukraine’s 44 million residents fleeing the country. 
The war has revealed how globalized the world is, according to Sergei Guriev, who served as chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 2016 to 2019. 
“The biggest Russian carmaker stopped production because of its lack of access to foreign imports of chips. A lot of Russian companies don’t know what to do because they were reliant on Europe and the U.S. for imports. Even if you think you are safe because your suppliers are domestic, COVID already showed us that supply chains are more complex than we think,” Guriev said at the event. “Maybe you are relying on Russian companies but they themselves rely on foreign companies.”
Many countries have imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. For instance, the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada banned certain Russian banks from SWIFT, a security network that facilitates payments among 11,000 financial institutions in 200 countries. 
Additionally, the United States has barred Russian financial institutions, including the Russian Central Bank, from making transactions in U.S. dollars.
Sanctions imposed on Russia have been a driving force so far, according to Tymofiy Mylovanov, Ukraine’s former minister of economic development, trade and agriculture. 
“The most important thing which happened was the sanctioning of the Central Bank of Russia. The reserves of the central bank were frozen. Since the beginning of the war, even big Chinese banks have been complying with U.S. sanctions,” Mylovanov said at the event. 
Sanctions have prompted the decline of the ruble, leaving many Russians unemployed. 
The extent of the sanctions imposed against Russia  is unprecedented, according to Guriev, the current president of the Kyiv School of Economics and a professor of the University of Pittsburgh.
“If you think about where the Russian ruble should be, even without all these tensions, it should be much stronger. Oil prices have grown a lot in the past year but the ruble has not strengthened. This shows you where the market was before the war, but what happened during the war was a completely different reality. Apparently Mr. Putin started this war without telling the economic policy team,” Guriev said. “They did not know that the West would be so united in its resolve and willingness to go far.” 
Oil and gas prices across the world soared after Russia invaded Ukraine, setting the highest prices since the 2008 financial crisis. The price of gas has begun to steadily decline. 
The international community — especially the EU — must double down on its efforts to end the war through embargoes on oil and gas, according to Guriev.
“We don’t know if this destruction of the domestic economy may be important, but what is important is whether he still has resources to pay for his war. Europe has to join the American embargo on oil and gas. That might close down the light at the end of the tunnel for Putin, destroy the Russian ruble, and the Russian budget. If this oil embargo is in place, President Putin will have a huge budget deficit and will not be able to pay his soldiers,” Guriev said.  
Global leaders must recognize Putin’s lack of sensibility and devotion to the continuation of this war, according to Mylovanov. 
“Our expectations on how President Putin behaves have been wrong because we are surprised time and time now,” Mylovanov said. “Every assumption we thought about the rationality of Putin has been violated. He has been doubling down on everything, and we should stop being in self-denial.”

Georgetown University students and professors traveled to El Paso, Texas and Mexico City over spring break for their course on refugee and migrant children. 
The class, titled “Refugee and Migrant Children: Mexico, the United States and the World,” is taught by Professors Elizabeth Ferris and Katharine Donato. The course focuses on policies regarding refugee and migration law and emphasizes the experiences of Central American asylum seekers in Mexico. Part of the School of Foreign Service’s (SFS) Centennial Labs (C-Lab) program, which explores a specific problem facing a community, the course helps students develop practical solutions and apply their knowledge outside of the classroom.
Students benefited from the immersive learning opportunities presented by C-Lab courses, according to Ferris, a research professor with the Institute for the Study of International Migration (ISIM). 
“It was a powerful experience for all of us, to talk to a human rights lawyer while standing at the wall, to visit Central American migrants in a shelter in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, to experience what it’s like crossing the border,” Ferris wrote to The Hoya. 
Ferris said the class also visited a migrant shelter in El Paso. 
“We also visited a shelter for migrants in El Paso and marveled at the volunteers who help migrants on their way, and were surprised to learn that not only Central Americans are arriving at the border, but also Haitians, Turks, Brazilians and even a few Russians and Ukrainians.”
Prior to spring break, the class was divided into three research teams which studied the drivers of Central American migration, United States-Mexico border policies and Mexico’s domestic responses to migration, Ferris said. Each team studied one of these topics respectively, according to Ferris. 
Ferris said the groups provided crucial context for meetings with policy organizations during the trip. 
“We also met with representatives of the International Organization for Migration, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the director of COMAR, Mexico’s refugee agency,” Ferris wrote. “One of the high points was hearing from the Mexican Coalition for the Rights of People with Disabilities where we learned of the particular risks faced by child migrants with disabilities — and heard about the many children who become disabled on their journeys to the United States.” 
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is a U.N. agency that is mandated to protect refugees, communities that have been forcibly displaced and stateless people. 
Donato, Director of the ISIM, wants students to see beyond the Mexican border’s literal purpose and recognize its cultural significance.
“It is a vibrant place that cuts across communities and families with deep ties to the area, and represents a vibrant and dynamic economy,” Donato wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Students also learn from people on the ground, both at the border and in Mexico City, about how difficult it is to secure the rights of child refugees and migrants.” 
Mariana Casallas Velandia (SFS ’22), a student in the class, said the trip deepened the knowledge she had already gained in the classroom. 
“In class, we had spoken about many deterrence policies like Remain in Mexico and Title 42,” said Velandia in an email to The Hoya. “But being at the border and Mexico City highlighted all the consequences of these policies. It is a system that continues to fail many communities and must be restructured”
Katie Cooper (SFS ’24), another student enrolled in the class, said the trip was a valuable addition to her study of migration. 
“The trip to the border and to Mexico City was fantastic. In class, we discussed and researched child migration, the history of US migration policy, current policies, and public opinion on migration,” Cooper wrote to The Hoya. “Being able to actually visit the border wall, meet with local nonprofits, and talk to migrants in shelters allowed us to witness the human impact of migration policies, which was an amazing experience.”
Opportunities like the El Paso trip allow undergraduate students to partake in formative global experiences, according to Ara Friedman, director of communications for the SFS.
“We hope that engaging with a variety of perspectives and experiences will encourage students to look at things through a slightly different lens to find new and innovative ways to address some of the most pressing issues,” Friedman wrote to The Hoya. 
Donato hopes that this experiential trip allows students to engage further with the real implications of children migration.  
“In Mexico, we met with Mexican government officials as well as UNHCR and IOM, and attended lectures and met students from the Colegio de Mexico,” said Donato. “Combined with our regular class meetings, these experiences go well beyond a traditional class to create deep understanding about the border and children on the move.”

Students have raised safety concerns after Georgetown University announced it will implement a mask-optional policy starting March 21. 
Mask-wearing will become optional in university owned or operated buildings if COVID-19 positivity rates on campus remain low, according to a March 11 email sent to community members from Provost Robert M. Groves. Individual faculty members are not permitted to require students to wear masks while in classrooms, offices, meetings or events, the email states. 
For the week of March 6, the university saw its lowest COVID-19 positivity rate of the spring semester at 1.03%, a decrease from the 6.49% positivity rate in the week of Jan. 9, when students returned to campus from winter break. 
All community members should respect one another’s privacy when deciding whether to wear a mask, according to the email. 
“Please help all members of our community feel welcome and safe, and consider putting on a mask when interacting with someone who is wearing a mask. Do not pressure someone to put on or take off a mask,” the email reads. 
Individuals must continue to wear masks in university health care facilities, including in COVID-19 testing centers, and on university-operated buses. Individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 must wear a mask for 10 days from the date of exposure or infection. 
Students like Katelyn Rickert (COL ’24) are glad the university is turning to a mask-optional policy because similar mandates have been lifted elsewhere.  
“I was happy to see Georgetown follow DC’s removal of the mask mandate, as well as the steps taken by other universities to remove mask mandates when the risk of COVID is so low,” Rickert wrote to The Hoya. “I would have liked to see the mask mandate removed earlier, since almost all places in the country have removed their mask mandate, including other universities.”
Several other universities in the Washington, D.C. area have also dropped their mask mandates, including American University and the University of Maryland, which will lift the mandate March 21. 
Other students, such as Olivia Henry (COL ’24), have expressed concerns over how the policy will impact immunocompromised individuals.
“It would require students and faculty to essentially be like, ‘Hey, I’m immunocompromised, the responsibility is now on me to make sure that I stay safe,’” Henry said in an interview with The Hoya. “If we’re actually caring for others, as the way Georgetown claims, our neighbors shouldn’t have to tell us that they’re immunocompromised, we should just know ‘Hey, let me keep on my mask.’” 
Students whose medical conditions put them at risk under the new policy may seek an accommodation from the Georgetown Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity & Affirmative Action (IDEAA) or the Academic Resource Center, according to a university spokesperson.
 Liam Jodrey (COL ’24) said the high vaccination rate on campus makes him feel safe without wearing a mask. 
“It felt like an overdue decision considering that almost everyone here has had 3 shots for covid, but I understand that the decision was partly in the hands of the DC government,” Jodrey wrote. 
The District lifted its indoor mask requirement March 1 after a decrease in COVID-19 cases in the city. Private businesses can still require mask-wearing, and passengers in District-operated public transportation and private rideshare vehicles must continue to wear a mask. 
Most of Georgetown’s campus community is vaccinated against COVID-19 with 98% of students, 98% of faculty and 97% of staff vaccinated.  
Health experts say wearing a high-grade surgical mask, such as a KN95, can still provide protection against infection even when others are unmasked. 
Sara Fairbank (NHS ’24) who works at Georgetown Medstar Hospital to complete nursing clinicals, said she is concerned about how the new policy will impact patients. 
“Luckily I am not immunocompromised nor is any of my loved ones, but I am a nursing student. I will have to take care of many very sick patients. If I give a patient COVID and they die from it, I don’t know how I’ll cope with the guilt.” Fairbank wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
A mask requirement may be reinstated if positivity rates on campus rise, according to a university spokesperson. 
“As a reminder, the mask-optional policy is dependent on the University’s case load and positivity rate, even in the context of the District having overall low community transmission,” the spokesperson wrote. “Indoor masking and other public health measures may be reimposed as needed, depending on pandemic conditions.”
The lifting of the mandate does not take into account the interests of immunocompromised or disabled students, Fairbank said.
“This change just seems like the university is prioritizing the convenience and comfort of non-disabled and non-immunocompromised people at the expense of disabled and immunocompromised individuals,” Fairbank wrote. “Regardless of the functioning of our immune system, we all deserve to feel that the university is implementing policies that are in everyone’s best interest.”

Arman Analouei says 
March 18, 2022 at 12:10 pm
As someone who is immunocompromised system, this feels like a death sentence. Its insulting to anyone who has been vigilant in masking up and making sure that those around us also help us stay alive.  Georgetown has made it clear that “Jesuit” traditions really just mean selfishness.

Alexis and Laurence Pelosi (LAW ’97) gifted $100,000 to the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics) to support students pursuing unpaid or underpaid summer internships.
This coming summer, the Alexis and Laurence Pelosi Endowed Internship Fund will provide five Georgetown University undergraduate and graduate students with $3,000 in financial assistance to cover living expenses during their summer internship. Students are eligible to apply for the scholarship if they are pursuing an internship in politics, public service or media. 
Alexis Pelosi said the goal of the fund is to expand internship and career opportunities to all students who are interested in starting a career in public service. 
“Laurence and I are proud to support students pursuing public service opportunities,” Pelosi wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “This Fund at Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service will advance opportunities for underrepresented students who want to explore careers in public service, and deepen the impact they can have on our democracy.”
Many internships are unpaid, which is permitted as long as the employer classifies the intern as the “primary beneficiary” of the work. In 2021, 42% of online internships were unpaid, while 35% of in-person internships were unpaid.
Mo Elleithee, founding executive director of GU Politics, said the fund aims to help applicants overcome barriers that inhibit them from participating in experiential learning opportunities. 
“Laurence Pelosi is a proud Georgetown Law alum and has been a big supporter of GU Politics and the McCourt School for several years,” Elleithee wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “After a few recent conversations about the need to support a pipeline of diverse students who typically find public service careers to be inaccessible, he and Alexis generously offered to endow a fund to ease the burden of unpaid and underpaid internships.”
In addition to financial aid, the internship fund will provide workshops and training sessions led by professionals in the area of public service for the student awardees.
The internship fund, coupled with its career-building resources, will help students from marginalized backgrounds capitalize on internship opportunities, according to Anya Wahal (SFS ’23), co-chair of GU Politics’ Student Advisory Board. 
“Low-income students and first-generation students, in particular, will directly benefit from the financial support provided by the Internship Fund,” Wahal wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I also strongly believe that LGBTQ+ students, disabled students, and students of color will benefit significantly from the fund, not only through its financial resources, but also through its career and skill-building support.”
Black students, first-generation students and women are more likely to have an unpaid internship, according to a 2020 report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers. 
Expanding internship opportunities and accessibility makes these fields more inclusive, according to Reed Howard (SFS ’17), director of communications at GU Politics. 
“The Alexis and Laurence Pelosi Endowed Internship Fund will provide financial support for Georgetown University students whose unique background or personal experiences, when evaluated holistically, would contribute to diversifying the fields of politics, public service and media,” Howard wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
The internship fund will help GU Politics expand career resources and opportunities for students beyond its current offerings, which currently includes the McCourt Fund for Student Excellence, which provides financial assistance to students who are furthering their careers with meaningful unpaid summer internships. 
Students can submit an application to the Alexis and Laurence Pelosi Endowed Internship Fund until April 24, and finalists will be notified in May. 
The internship fund will help students begin their careers in public service, according to Wahal.
“The stepping stone offered by the Internship Fund will be critical for students as they continue to navigate their careers and build their skills,” Wahal wrote.

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) mandate and a holistic human rights approach are crucial steps in combating the Taliban’s efforts to restrict Afghan women and children from their basic educational and civil rights, activists said at a panel event. 
The March 15 event, titled “Upholding Women’s Rights as Human Rights in Afghanistan: An Urgent Moment for UNAMA Renewal,” was hosted by the Permanent Missions of the United Kingdom and Qatar on behalf of the Group of Friends of Women in Afghanistan, UN Women and the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security. Former United States Ambassador Melanne Verveer, executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, moderated the event. 
Students and faculty attended the online event via United Nations (UN) Web TV with the in-person panel taking place at the organization’s headquarters in New York City.  
The Taliban are directly responsible for the recent abduction and torture of Afghan female protestors, according to panelist Horia Mosadiq, founder and director of the Safety and Risk Mitigation Organization (SRMO), a London-based nongovernmental organization (NGO) that provides risk mitigation and safety assistance to human rights organizers in Afghanistan.
“When the majority of human rights organizations are not able to operate inside Afghanistan and in absence of key institutions such as Ministry of Women’s Affairs and Afghanistan Independent Women Rights Commision, the presence of an entity such as UNAMA, particularly human rights unit is key,” Mosadiq said at the event.   
Since the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August following the U.S. withdrawal from the country, the terrorist organization has implemented extreme restrictions on Afghan women. While middle school and high school-aged girls in some regions have been allowed to return to school, most women have been prohibited from returning to school, and many female professionals have been fired. 
UNAMA, a special political mission to assist the state and people of Afghanistan in laying the foundations for sustainable peace and development, was established in 2002 and renewed by the UN Security Council on March 17. The 14 members of the 15-member council voted to renew the UNAMA, with Russia abstaining. 
The UN must amend the UNAMA to further support women, according to Najla Ayoubi, the chief of coalition and global programs at Every Woman Treaty, a global campaign for an international treaty to end violence against women and girls.
“The Taliban have god-like power in all settings. They are making all of the decisions on everything in the country. That’s the bottom line. We are urging the international community to step in and support the women’s rights activists,” Ayoubi said at the event. 
The Taliban has also severely restricted press freedom since August. A December 2021 survey by Reporters Without Borders and the Afghan Independent Journalists Association, the largest NGO in the world dedicated to protecting journalists, showed that a total of 231 media outlets were forced to close and more than 6,400 journalists have lost their jobs since the invasion. Women journalists were hit hardest, with four out of five no longer working in the industry.
UNAMA amendments must include policies that support accurate and free media, according to Fatima Faizi, a former New York Times reporter.
“Freedom of press and free media and security of Afghan journalists should be conditional for international engagement for the Taliban and be explained in all international human rights mechanisms,” Faizi said during the event. “With many Afghan journalists no longer able to safely and accurately report, international journalists and media outlets must shed light on human rights abuses perpetrated by the Taliban.”
The Taliban have implemented policies that target different ethnic and religious minorities in Afghanistan. Communities like the Hazara, a Persian-speaking ethnic group in Afghanistan, have faced systemic reductions in their government aid, have experienced targeted evictions and have been forced into exile.
Yalda Royan, the country technical team lead at VOICE Amplified, a feminist organization working to end violence against women and girls in conflict around the world, and a Hazara community member, highlighted the persecution.
“The Taliban is also raising revenue by conducting terrifying raids on Tajik and Hazara homes in Kabul, claiming they are searching for illegal arms and then requiring payoffs to not report families for contraband they have allegedly found,” Royan said at the event. “The Taliban does not just seek to terrorize and control minorities through violence, it is banning the use of our language, Farsi or Dari, in government and universities to further eliminate our identity.”
While the Taliban claimed it would reopen girls’ schools Mar. 21, it is imperative that the UN and the international community take immediate, effective action against the Taliban by upholding these UNAMA amendments, according to Royan. 
“I will be watching, along with Afghans and others around the world, as the council meets on Thursday to consider the UNAMA’s mandate,” Royan said. “Please take heed of our words here today and do not let the people of Afghanistan down. History has its eyes on you.”

Georgetown University produced the second highest number of United States Fulbright Student Program awardees among institutions of higher education, with 26 students and graduates chosen within the past year to participate in the program for the 2021-22 cycle.
The Fulbright Program provides monetary grants for individual research projects in a host country outside the U.S., where recipients have the opportunity to experience and learn from another culture. Awardees from the 2021-22 class will conduct research in 17 countries across five different continents. 
The international academic exchange program, which started in 1946, facilitates stronger cultural relationships between U.S. scholars and people of the host countries by providing experiential learning opportunities. 
Since the Fulbright Program’s beginning, almost 500 Georgetown students and graduates have participated. For 2019-20 and 2020-21, Georgetown was the highest producer of U.S. Fulbright student awardees among nearly 600 peer institutions. 
Peter DiGiovanni (COL ’21), a 2021 Fulbright scholar, started his project in Geneva, Switzerland, where he works at the Geneva University Hospitals with a focus on patient recovery following total hip arthroplasty.
“With this experience I wanted to not just contribute to something in the research community at large, but also continue on my own personal and professional career and aspirations,” DiGiovanni said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Georgetown’s Center for Research and Fellowships works with applicants during the Fulbright Program application process. The center focuses on teaching applicants skills such as personal essay writing, designing a well-detailed research plan and making connections between intellectual passions and the real world.
Georgetown sees many Fulbright Program applicants, and ultimately winners, because the application process prepares students for careers and the program alike, according to Lauren Tuckley, director of the Center for Research and Fellowships.  
“Each applicant walks away with skills that they can adapt when applying for other merit-based opportunities, like graduate school, research funding, and even learning how to write a persuasive cover letter,” Tuckley wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think this model — and our ability to keep the application process fun (!) — allows us to deepen our applicant pool by minimizing the barriers that often prohibit students from applying!”
DiGiovanni said that studying abroad at Georgetown’s Villa Le Balze outside of Florence, Italy, and conducting research at Georgetown’s Italian Research Institute as an undergraduate student prepared him for his time abroad. 
Georgetown’s opportunities for global immersion and studying abroad make its applicants to the Fulbright Program successful, according to DiGiovanni.  
“I think one of Georgetown’s biggest strengths is being an international presence. Part of doing that is having an amazing Fulbright office,” DiGiovanni said. “I cannot give enough credit to that whole team. What they’re doing and how they’re preparing students for this opportunity is really fantastic.”
Fulbright applicants and winners adopt strategies that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives, whether that be for future careers, research or projects, according to Tuckley. 
“Fulbright changes lives in profound ways,” Tuckley wrote. “I’ve seen this transformation happen enough times to know that it doesn’t come from any particular project’s outcome but from what a young person learns from pursuing their passion through the exchange of cultures.”

Seven, a record number of Georgetown University School of Foreign Service (SFS) students and graduates, received the 2022 Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship. 
The selective fellowship, administered by Howard University, awards 45 students with up to $42,000 annually for a two-year period covering tuition, room and board and other expenses to support the completion of two-year master’s degrees in a field related to foreign service work. 
The fellowship also coordinates two summer internship opportunities — one domestic and one overseas — for the students. Upon completion of their master’s degrees, fellows receive appointments in the U.S. State Department’s foreign service, either abroad or domestic, and must commit to at least five years of service. 
Along with the Donald M. Payne International Development Fellowship, which seeks to attract individuals interested in foreign service, and the Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Program, which trains individuals interested in international service, the Pickering Fellowship aims to diversify the U.S. foreign service through support of women, those with financial need and other minority groups that have been historically underrepresented in foreign service. 
This year’s Pickering Fellows include Brenda Coromina (SFS ’21), Desmond Ferrell (SFS ’18, GRD ’21), Ibilola Owoyele (SFS ’17), Arthur Rodriguez (SFS ’20), Laura Romero (SFS ’18), Diana Sosa (SFS ’19), and Julio Salmeron-Perla (SFS ’22). Grant Castle (SFS ’21) will join the Payne program’s 2022 cohort.
The Pickering Fellowship provides a unique opportunity for students to bring their personal backgrounds and experiences into the foreign service, according to Salmeron-Perla.
“I’m a proud Hispanic American, and I’m really proud to be bringing that diversity into the State Department,” Salmeron-Perla said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s kind of like I’m diving into the sea of the unknown, because I don’t know where I’m gonna be sent to, I don’t know what I’m going to be doing just yet. That’s really thrilling, because I think I’m ready to just be thrown into any part of the world.”
Recipients of these fellowships will represent Georgetown values in their willingness to confront today’s global challenges, according to SFS Dean Joel Hellman. 
“At this moment of unprecedented change in the global order, there could not be a more pressing challenge than attracting the nation’s best and brightest into careers of service,” Hellman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Pickering, Rangel, and Payne fellowships ensure that those future leaders will represent the true diversity of our nation in tackling global challenges.”
As a partner school to the Pickering Fellowship, Georgetown has produced 149 Pickering fellows since the program’s founding in 1992. 
The Georgetown curriculum prepares students for careers in foreign service, according to Coromina.
“I’m much more prepared for the kind of work that I’m doing and the kind of work that I will do in the foreign service because of the curriculum at Georgetown,” Coromina said in an interview with The Hoya, “It covers such a broad range where I feel like it’s really prepared me to handle pretty much anything that comes my way.”
Salmeron-Perla looks forward to inspiring future Hispanic American students who wish to work in foreign service. 
“I’m excited to learn more about different cultures, different people and their countries,” Salmeron-Perla said in an interview with The Hoya. “And I’m also excited to be a source of support for future Hispanic American students here at Georgetown who also want to pursue this path later on in life.”

Select Georgetown faculty members received a total of $2.3 million in research grants to support their studies related to technology and digital governance.
The McCourt Institute, an independent organization founded by individuals from Georgetown University and Sciences Po, was established in 2021 and focuses on supporting digital governance and ethical technology. The McCourt Institute’s steering committee selected nine grantees across the Georgeotwn schools for research related to ethics, policy and governance in the digital sphere.
The grants aim to identify solutions to problems associated with modern technologies, according to Michael Bailey, director of the Massive Data Institute at Georgetown and recipient of a grant for his project about the role that social media plays in political and social life.
“Each of the actual grants is doing a different thing, but each grant is trying to use new ways to think about the problems and the solutions and then embed them in a broader enterprise that has a distinctive and quite interesting feel,” Bailey told The Hoya. 
The McCourt School of Public Policy will use a $25 million grant from Frank H. McCourt Jr. (CAS ’75) to continue to hold the annual competition for graduates to complete research regarding the digital era.
The grant demonstrates the McCourt School’s commitment to supporting research for ethical technology, according to Maria Cancian, dean of the McCourt School.
“With the McCourt Institute, we are looking forward to bringing together social scientists, lawyers, computer scientists, and ethicists working together across disciplines, and across institutions, toward the shared goal of shaping technology and digital governance in more ethical, equitable, and inclusive ways,” Cancian wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Laura Donohue, a grant recipient, professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and director of Georgetown’s Center on National Security and the Law, said that the grant will fund her project, “360 Tech & Social Media; Innovation, Security and Governance,” aimed at exploring the ways in which social media is used by foreign nationals and governments. 
“Deep learning, cryptocurrencies, decentralized networks, and the meta verse offer tremendous opportunities but also present profound risks to society,” Donohue wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our goal is to anticipate and to mitigate ways in which democratic governance and societal cohesion can be undermined.”
Micah Sherr, professor of computer science at Georgetown, received a grant for his research about producing open methods of communication. 
“The grant provides funds to transition our idea into hopefully something real,” Sherr wrote. “We’re working on technologies that enable users to more freely access the Internet. This is unfortunately becoming critically important, especially in countries such as Russia, where Internet access is becoming increasingly restricted.”
The grant will also support the Data Co-ops Project, which is led by Kobbi Nissim, chair of the computer science department at Georgetown, and brings together experts from different fields to research how digital platforms analyze user data to manipulate their behavior and access to information. 
“Progress in this research would provide transparency into the ways our collective data is being used to shape the content and opportunities that we are offered; to enable computing over individual members’ personal information while preserving values such as privacy, fairness, and security; and to enable negotiating, overseeing, and enforcing the terms of third parties’ use of the data,” Nissim wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
According to Donohue, the grant provides global research opportunities, which is crucial given the wide reach of the internet. 
“The McCourt grant is a key part of our ability to ensure that our approach is well-informed by the international dimensions of the social media ecosystem,” Donohue wrote.

Over 9,000 people have signed a petition to save Freedom Plaza, a popular skateboarding space located one block from the White House, after the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) introduced a plan to eliminate and replace the space.
The NCPC announced plans to transform Freedom Plaza by creating a new outdoor venue on Pennsylvania Avenue with park spaces, areas for pop-up venues and fewer driving lanes. Signatories of the petition argued to preserve the historic area, which is a national monument and a site for political protests, civic events and skateboarding. 
Brian Aguilar, owner and founder of Crushed Skate Shop in the Shaw neighborhood, started the petition after hearing about the NCPC’s plans to replace Freedom Plaza.
“They were talking about eliminating and replacing it, and it just seemed so immediate and threatening, just having so much history there,” Aguilar told The Hoya. “I started the petition immediately and just started reaching out to people and trying to strategize how I could get our voices heard.”
The Freedom Plaza was renamed in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the site contains a time capsule buried in 1988 that holds his Bible, his clerical robe and recordings of his speeches, as well as a 51-star flag in hopes that Washington, D.C. would become a state. The capsule is set to be unearthed in 2088. 
The renovation of the space presents D.C. with an exciting opportunity for urban modernization, according to NCPC Chair Beth White. 
“All the conversations around where we might be heading in post-COVID-19 urban spaces — the importance of open space, creating inviting outdoor destinations, multi-modal transportation options that focus on people — are all coming to play here,” White said, according to a Feb. 17 NCPC press release. “It’s an opportunity to expand Pennsylvania Avenue as a signature place where we can tell our stories, celebrate and commemorate.”
According to Max Kang (COL ’24), a member of the Georgetown University Skate Club, skate parks like Freedom Plaza are essential cultural spaces.
“Ever since I started skating the way I view the city landscape has changed, because skateboarders redefine and transform public spaces and urban terrain by bringing new life and meaning to city spaces that are otherwise mundane, underutilized, or forgotten,” Kang wrote to The Hoya. “Skateboarders have reimagined Freedom Plaza as a public arena of creation and play, a rebellion against the privatization and policing of so-called ‘public spaces.’”
The renovations on Pennsylvania Avenue will only enhance the public space, the Council of D.C. tweeted March 10.
​​“Freedom Plaza as we know it will be eliminated & replaced with a plaza that’s more welcoming, livable, & people-focused,” the tweet reads. “That’s a good thing. (Though the devil’s in the details, & much public input—especially from locals—is key).”
The NCPC plan will provide opportunities for economic growth in the area where Freedom Plaza currently sits, John Falcicchio, deputy mayor for planning and economic development, said in the press release.
“Reimagining Pennsylvania Avenue is critical to attracting people back to downtown DC and sparking economic development opportunities,” Falcicchio said, according to the press release. “From hosting celebrations for new presidents and championship teams to barbecue battles and night markets, Pennsylvania Avenue has the potential to become America’s play area.”
Aguilar said that seeing landmark skateboarding spots around the world remodeled or destroyed serves as a warning sign for Freedom Plaza’s future.
“This is kind of like a nightmare that I kind of saw coming,” Aguilar said. “It’s like a second home for the skateboarders here in the city. I just hope that we can work together with the city to save such a historic place.”
The NCPC reached out to Aguilar in response to his petition to set up a meeting to discuss the potential renovations and plans for Freedom Plaza, Aguilar said.
Aguilar said Freedom Plaza’s significance to the skateboarding community in the District called for immediate action to preserve the history of the space.
“It’s a place of protest. It’s like a national monument,” Aguilar said. “I’ve spent over 20 years going to Freedom Plaza. There’s so much skateboard history. There’s so much history in general there.”
