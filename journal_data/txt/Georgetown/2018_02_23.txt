Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) have been elected president and vice president of the Georgetown University Student Association by a razor-thin margin of 36 votes.
Nair and Rahman are set to be the third consecutive nonwhite GUSA executive pair when they take office March 9, replacing current GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18). Before Mack and Andino’s predecessors, Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Chris Fisk (COL ’17), the GUSA executive had not been led by two nonwhite students since at least 1998, according to GUSA Historian Ari Goldstein (COL ’18).
The race was tight through four rounds of voting. Josh Sirois (SFS ’20) and Casey Doherty (COL ’20) led in the first round with 1,004 votes, compared with 972 votes for Nair and Rahman. Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) and Richard Howell (SFS ’19) were eliminated first, receiving 281 votes in the first round, followed by satirical candidates Logan Arkema (COL ’20) and Jonathan Compo (COL ’20), who received 350 votes in the first round and ran as the superhero duo Batman and Robin.
Per GUSA’s single transferable vote system, if no ticket receives an outright majority in the first round of voting, a runoff takes place between the top performing tickets. First-choice votes for the least successful candidate are redistributed to the second-choice candidates and so on until one ticket receives a majority.
In the final round of voting, Nair and Rahman received 1,267 votes, marginally surpassing Sirois and Doherty, who received 1,231 votes. Nair and Rahman’s margin is among the tightest in recent memory, with echoes of last year’s election: Mack and Andino won in the fourth round last year by 34 votes after coming in second place in the first round.

Results in the election were delayed Thursday night after the second-place candidates Sirois and Doherty raised concerns with the GUSA Election Commision about Nair and Rahman, alleging Nair and Rahman exceeded the $300 budget limit for executive candidates through their social media expenditures.
Sirois said his campaign does not plan to file a formal complaint with the Election Commission. The campaign did not address emailed questions from The Hoya regarding whether they accepted the election results Thursday night.
On election day, the Nair-Rahman campaign paid for Facebook advertisements and Snapchat filters as part of their campaigning. The campaign provided documentation to the Election Commission reflecting that their expenses came under the $300 campaign limit, but the Sirois-Doherty campaign alleged they had concealed larger payments.
Aaron Bennett (COL ’19), campaign manager for Nair and Rahman, said early Friday morning that the allegations against the campaign are “baseless.”
“We’re incredibly grateful that we earned the majority of the student body’s support tonight. Many thanks to all of our supporters, as well Logan and Jonathan as well as Hunter and Richard — both of whom graciously conceded on election night,” Bennett wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While disappointed in baseless allegations, we are excited to assume leadership of student government at Georgetown and are confident that Sahil and Naba will serve this campus valiantly and effectively as Executives.”
The Sirois-Doherty  campaign released a statement on Facebook on Thursday afternoon saying “we are confident that we will be able to continue advocating for the issues that affect students without an elected office.”
“Though our campaign may be over, we will never quit fighting to move Georgetown forward. We hope that the new administration learns to value GUSA’s work as much as we do,” Sirois and Doherty wrote in the statement, which does not mention Nair or Rahman.
GUSA Election Commission Co-chair Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said the Election Commission had done its job in counting the vote, announcing the election results and making sure all candidates followed election rules. Sirois and Doherty did not provide evidence to convince the Election Commission that the Nair-Rahman campaign had violated any rules, Willard said.
However, he and Election Commissioner Grant Castle (SFS ’21) acknowledged the Election Commission has always had limited capacity to investigate candidates’ finances, particularly in this case when it comes to social media technology.
“There’s an ambiguity that it is, in our opinion, impossible to determine exactly what happened with the social media technology,” Castle said. “We have to act in good faith that they are being honest about what they reported.”
Castle said the GUSA senate should now pass a bylaws resolution to prohibit the use of campaign finances for social media advertisements in future elections. Willard, who has worked on the Election Commission for four years and graduates in the spring, went a step further.
“The whole issue in general of campaign finance is something that is desperately, really really desperately broken and needs to be fixed,” Willard said. “I am of the personal belief that of all the campaigns I have seen in four years … Of the candidates that spent the maximum amount of money, there is a strong chance that some of them just didn’t report additional expenses. Because there’s no way for us to check.”
Willard added, “I’m not sure if this is a widespread phenomenon; I’m absolutely sure it’s been done. And it’s broader than this election. It needs to be really critically looked at.”
Conflicts over election results are not uncommon. The election of former executives Khan and Fisk in 2016 was embroiled in conflict long after election day, and the results of a constitutional referendum were voided by the Constitutional Council in January 2017 after allegations that the referendum did not follow GUSA bylaws.
The GUSA senate will hold a vote to confirm Nair and Rahman on Sunday.
At an election night party in Henle Village, Nair and Rahman heard of their victory in a call from outgoing executive Mack at about 2:30 a.m. Moments after receiving the news, Nair said in an interview with The Hoya that he was pleased to see their inclusive campaign succeed.

“I’m feeling exhilarated and humbled. I’m at a loss for words,” Nair said. “Georgetown made their voice heard and we proved that every voice matters. We proved that it doesn’t matter if you’re a GUSA outsider.”
Overall voter turnout was 39 percent, according to the GUSA Election commission. Rahman said the ticket’s participatory platform incorporated students who would not otherwise participate in GUSA elections.
“I don’t believe this happened, I’ve been looking forward to this moment for the longest time and it’s here and I can’t believe it,” Rahman said. “A lot of people voted for us who don’t usually vote for GUSA and that shows the power GUSA has. We are excited for the year ahead.”
The pair said their first priority in office is reaching out to as many students as possible and fostering effective dialogue.
“We want to be the people’s executive and we’re excited to do that,” Nair said.

A campus-wide referendum proposing reforms to the Georgetown University Student Association senate passed Tuesday night, receiving more than the necessary 25 percent support from the student body.
Members of the GUSA senate will now be elected by class year rather than by geographic location, and elections for nonfreshman senators will now be held in April rather than in the fall after the referendum’s success.
The senate reform referendum passed with 2039 votes in favor and 426 votes against — 83.1 percent and 16.9 percent, respectively. The passage of the referendum is a long-needed win for the GUSA senate, which unsuccessfully launched two previous senate restructuring referendums in the past two years.
A second referendum question, which also passed, codify several protections for student participation in the GUSA constitution. The protections include safeguards for citizenship, gender identity or expression, ability or disability and any characteristics protected under federal or Washington, D.C. law.
The Code of Student Conduct and the Student Organization Standards include similar protections, but the referendum would revise the language in the GUSA Constitution.
2310 students voted in favor of the second referendum question, with 239 voting against it — 90.6 percent and 9.4 percent respectively.
GUSA Senate Speaker Ben Baldwin (SFS ’19) said he is “extremely excited” about the result.
“Third time is the charm, turns out,” Baldwin said. “I think that overall this referendum is obviously better for the student body. I’m more excited about the second referendum in a lot of ways, because that portion of the constitution just needed to be updated. It was long overdue.”
To pass, a constitutional referendum must receive support from two-thirds of voters and at least 25 percent of the student body overall.
A bill to hold the referendum passed last month with 23 senators voting in favor of adding the questions to the executive election ballot on Hoyalink. Two senators voted against, calling the referendum a waste of the senate’s time, and one abstained.
Yesterday’s referendum is the third in a series of referendums proposing reforms to the GUSA senate and constitution in the past two years. An essentially identical referendum appeared on a ballot last spring; it failed to pass after failing to reach the 25 percent support threshold.
Last spring’s referendum came shortly after a more ambitious referendum in December 2016 that received enough votes to pass but was later invalidated by GUSA’s judicial body, the Constitutional Council, which ruled that the referendum was not properly explained to the student body in a timely way as required by GUSA bylaws.
The December 2016 referendum proposed replacing the senate entirely with a smaller legislative body. The new assembly would have focused largely on allocating student activity fees to clubs, a task currently handled by the senate’s Finance and Appropriations Committee.
GUSA senators supporting the referendum said the changes would make the GUSA senate more accountable to the student body.
GUSA senate Speaker Ben Baldwin (SFS ’19) said class-based elections would ensure senators are accountable to their constituents, because they would represent the same ones each year.
“Frankly, under our current system, Senators are not accountable to the students they represent because they most likely will not be living in the same geographic district for more than one year and students cannot vote a second time on whether their Senator fulfilled their promises,” Baldwin wrote in a January email to The Hoya.
Baldwin also said students’ interests align more closely with their class years than with their residential halls.
“The issues that a sophomore or junior face have more to do with major selection, meal plans, their academic futures, or any number of other issues regardless of whether they live in McCarthy or Alumni Square,” Baldwin wrote.
Moving elections for nonfreshman senators to the spring rather the fall would foster better cooperation between the senate and the GUSA executive and give potential candidates more time to prepare their campaigns, GUSA senate Vice Speaker Sylvia Levy (SFS ’18) said.
“Moving the majority of Senate elections to April will increase cohesion between the Executive branch and the Senate — members of both will be able to closely work with one another starting over the summer and through the academic year,” Levy wrote in a January email to The Hoya.
The two GUSA senators who opposed holding the referendum, Sean Lerner (SFS ’20) and Nick Zeffiro (SFS ’18), said they considered the third senate-focused referendum in two years a waste of GUSA’s time.
“If there were any lessons learned from last year’s GUSA Senate, it was that reorganizing referendums are a potentially embarrassing waste of time,” Lerner wrote in a January email to The Hoya. “I came into the year confident that this year’s GUSA Senate would be able to achieve real goals, and that senators would keep their promise of ‘no more referendums’ that many came into the year with. Clearly, this didn’t happen.”

Ben Shapiro, an American conservative political commentator, is slated to speak at Georgetown University in an event hosted by the Georgetown University College Republicans and the Georgetown University Lecture Fund on March 21.
The event is planned to be a discussion on free speech located in Lohrfink Auditorium. Admission to the event is free to Georgetown students and faculty members.
Shapiro is a syndicated columnist, lawyer and author of seven books. He is the editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire, a conservative news website, and host of the podcast, ‘The Ben Shapiro Show.” He previously contributed to Breitbart News as an editor-at-large until resigning in March 2016.
A frequent college campus lecturer, Shapiro made a name for himself as a critic of former President Barack Obama, mainstream media, Hollywood and identity politics, all of which he has written polemic books on.
GUCR President Emerita Allie Williams (SFS ’19) said the organization supports Shapiro’s advocacy for free speech and that having him on campus will be an important opportunity for students to discuss these ideas. (Full disclosure: Williams is a member of The Hoya’s editorial board.)
“For years GUCR members have expressed the desire to host Mr. Shapiro, a conservative commentator whom many college students admire for his free speech advocacy and unabashed conservatism,” Williams wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We feel that this event is a tremendous opportunity for the Georgetown community to engage with Mr. Shapiro, whom many label as the voice of the conservative millennial movement, and demonstrate our commitment to free speech as Hoyas.”
Current GUCR President Jake Lyons (COL ’20) said members of his organization have been pushing for an event with Shapiro for years, and they are excited for their work to finally come to fruition.
“Our members have expressed that they have wanted to host Mr. Shapiro at Georgetown for a number of years now, and we are proud to finally make it happen,” Lyons wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Shapiro’s views on topics ranging from Israel to the status of transgender individuals have made him the source of public debate on college campuses. Student protesters have labelled his rhetoric as hate speech in the past and have called for the removal of his speaking platform, as California State University, Los Angeles students attempted to do in 2016.
Failing to prevent him from speaking, Cal State LA students blocked classmates from entering the building where Shapiro was scheduled to speak. Students formed human blockades, started fights and pulled a fire alarm when his speech began.
Aiden Johnson (COL ’19), chair of the Lecture Fund, said the event is an opportunity for students to engage with ideas that may differ from their own.
“The Lecture Fund continues to exist as a non-partisan organization that deeply values the free exchange of ideas on our campus,” Johnson said. “As is the case with every event that we are involved in, our organization’s support is not an endorsement of any set of beliefs or viewpoints, but rather a commitment to giving students the chance to interact with a speaker and to develop their own beliefs about the topic being discussed.”
Protests of Shapiro’s speech at the University of California, Berkeley in September 2017 were relatively peaceful, though campus police took extensive preventative measures following the violent reaction to a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos, a more contentious speaker, planned in February. Security for the Shapiro event cost $600,000 and resulted in nine arrests of protesters, four of whom were arrested for carrying banned weapons, according to a Sept. 15 article in the Los Angeles Times.
Lyons said GUCR has coordinated with both GUPD and Shapiro’s security team to ensure the safety of attendees and protesters, and has planned for a specified “expression space for protest outside of the venue.”
In the interest of encouraging dialogue between those with dissenting opinions, Williams said that GUCR has invited members of dissenting organizations and has set aside reserved seating for two leaders of these student groups.
“I also want to note that, while Mr. Shapiro was among the first individuals to denounce the alt-right movement as racist and anti-Semitic, we recognize that there are several groups on campus who have views and beliefs that contradict with his own,” Williams wrote. “That is why last night I reached out to these groups, providing them with a ‘heads up’ that the event is taking place, and inviting their membership to attend the event and challenge Mr. Shapiro during the Q&A.”
Lyons corroborated the statement, saying that discussion between those with differing opinions helps make events like this important.
“My predecessor, Allie Williams, and I believe that some of the strongest conversations on Georgetown’s campus are the ones in which students are given the opportunity to examine, question, and hear from speakers,” Lyons said. “We hope that all Georgetown students will help us make this event as impactful and well-rounded as it can be.”

George Mazza, 62-year-old Department of Justice senior counsel, filed a lawsuit against Georgetown University on Feb. 12, raising claims of age discrimination after being denied admission to the doctoral program in theological and religious studies.
Mazza claimed his rejection from the program violates the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 and the D.C. Human Rights Act of 1977, both of which prohibit discrimination from activities and jobs on the grounds of an applicant’s age.
As Georgetown receives federal financial assistance, the university is legally required to adhere to provisions of the ADA and DCHRA.
Mazza applied for Georgetown’s doctoral program in theological and religious studies, an interdisciplinary program created to explore the comparative study of theology and religion, for entrance in fall 2017. Mazza believed that he was denied admission based on his age and not his qualifications, according to the suit filed in the Washington, D.C. District Court.
“Plaintiff Mazza brings this action for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages arising from the Defendant’s refusal to admit him to the doctoral program because of age, notwithstanding his exceptional credentials and qualifications,” the complaint said.
The program offers five years of full funding, including tuition, healthcare coverage and a stipend, according to the program’s website. There are currently 21 students in the program.
When Mazza reached out to admissions for an explanation for his rejection for the program, admissions committee member of the program, professor Peter Phan, allegedly told Mazza that he would not be considered for the position based on his age, according to Mazza’s official complaint.
“No major university would consider [Mazza] for a full-time, tenure-track, position because of this age, and because of that the admissions committee could not justify offering him a position within the doctoral program, despite his qualifications,” Mazza’s complaint said.
Georgetown Graduate Admissions could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.
Christopher Mackaronis, attorney with Stone, Mattheis, Xenopoulos, & Brew, PC outlined Mazza’a requests.
“The Complaint asks that Mr. Mazza be admitted to the program in the fall of 2018 on the same conditions of all younger candidates, along with compensatory damages, counsel fees and costs,” Mackaronis wrote in an email to the Hoya.
Mazza’s decision to file a lawsuit against Georgetown is not only out of the personal desire to receive fair admission, but also to help ease the stigma against older students.
“Hopefully, the suit will force academia to address, and eliminate, the type of stereotypical age discrimination that infected Georgetown’s admission decision in this matter,” Mackaronis said.
Phan allegedly told Mazza that the University chose a younger candidate for the program, Mazza said.
“Two similarly qualified candidates applied for a tenure-track position, and one was thirty-five and the other sixty-five, the Department would clearly prefer the younger candidate,” Mazza raised in his complaint.
In 2013, a similar lawsuit was brought against the Georgetown by former North Dakota Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth. Claiming age discrimination, Spaeth — then 63 years old —  sued Georgetown and five other universities when he was denied an interview during the 2010-11 faculty member recruitment process.
Spaeth cited violations against the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as well as the DCHRA. This suit differs from Mazza’s as Spaeth was applying for a job, while Mazza applied as a student. Spaeth’s lawsuit was eventually dropped, after the claim was deemed to have insufficient supporting evidence. Spaeth later died in March of 2014.
According to Mazza’s complaint, he was encouraged by faculty at Georgetown to apply. Mazza holds a master’s of arts degree from the Divinity School of the University of Chicago, master’s of divinity degree from St. Meinrad School of Theology, a master’s of public administration degree from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a Juris Doctorate from Georgetown University Law Center. Mazza’s research made him qualified for the position, according to the official complaint.
“In April 2016, and again in November 2016, Drs. Leo D. Lefebure and Peter C. Phan encouraged the Plaintiff to apply to the Department’s doctoral program, stating that the course of studies that the Plaintiff was proposing in Christian-Jewish relations was well-suited to the resources and expertise’s of the Department,” the suit said.
Mazza requests the University admit him into the program with full reimbursement for all charges, including lost career opportunities and emotional pain and suffering that he endured, according to the complaint.

The level of animus directed toward the Muslim-American community under President Donald Trump’s administration is unprecedented, Pennsylvania State University law professor Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia (LAW ’99) argued in an event Thursday evening in the Leavey Center Program Room.
Titled “Unpacking the Muslim Bans: A Conversation on Islamophobia in the Courts and the Administration,” the event featured an address in which Wadhia described the details and legality of the executive orders that have attempted to prevent citizens from Muslim majority countries from entering the United States.
Trump signed his first executive order Jan 27, 2017 banning foreign nationals from seven majority Muslim countries from entering the country for 90 days. Several federal judges blocked the ban in its various iterations, including United States District Court Judge James Robart (LAW ’73), who suspended Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order in February 2017.
Since the order went into effect, an additional executive order and presidential proclamation were signed adjusting the restrictions of the ban in March and September respectively. In December 2017, the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration’s request to temporarily reinstate the latest executive order to its full effect as the case against its legality is litigated in court.
The event was organized by The Bridge Initiative, an ongoing research project on Islamophobia based in the university’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. It was cosponsored by the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies and Georgetown University Law Center’s Office of Equity, Community and Inclusion.
A conversation between Wadhia — founder and director of the Center for Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, which provides policy development, legal support and community outreach and education to organizations and individuals seeking assistance — and Bridge Initiative Senior Research Fellow Arsalan Iftikhar followed the address.
Wadhia said one of the main legal arguments against the immigration restrictions is the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which protects freedom of religion in the United States.
“The primary constitutional argument has been that a proclamation violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment states the government cannot favor one religion over another,” Wadhia said.
Trump’s rhetoric against the Muslim community can be used to demonstrate his bias in potential court briefings, Wadhia said.
“His rhetoric could be important. It will be important in the briefings of the court, especially around the Establishment Clause claims, because part of the argument is that his statements on the campaign trail and after the inauguration showed that he had an animus in creating the executive orders,” Wadhia said.
The decision by the Supreme Court to reinstate the ban resulted in confusion over the extent of its application, Wadhia said.
“It partially reinstated the ban for anybody who lacked a credible bona fide relationship to a person or an entity,” Wadhia said. “Immediately, lack of clarity ensued on what is a bona fide relationship and the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security issued guidance in a very narrow way.”
Wadhia said that families, especially those of international students, will face a significant impact from the reinstatement of the ban.
“The human impact on the ground is profound, because it means that, between now and at least June, families are suffering. Iranians who are studying at Penn State cannot have their parents visit,” said Wadhia. “There are practical impacts including family reunification that are front and center with the full force of the ban in effect.”
The recent immigration legislation has also introduced a new process for individuals limited by the immigration ban to apply for a waiver program on a case-by-case basis through their consulate. The program comes with limitations in its practice, according to Wadhia.
“One thing I’ve done along with some other organizations is to document cases where people were denied visas and were never considered for a waiver or were denied a visa and brought paperwork in support of their waivers and the consulate ignored it,” Wadhia said. “We’ve seen more than a handful of cases where this has occurred.”
Iftikhar said there is a need for individuals not directly affected by the anti-Muslim rhetoric and reinstatement of the ban to act as allies.
“It’s going to be someone else tomorrow. That’s why we have to stand up as allies for one another, because even though we might not be affected because we’re not an immigrant or we’re not a Muslim,” Iftikhar said. “We have to act as intersectional allies for one another.”
The courts have the responsibility of holding Trump accountable for his discriminatory legislation, Wadhia said.
“We have an administration that is placing pressure and greater responsibilities on the court to respond and remind the American public that we have three branches of government, and that we have separation of powers, and no President is above the law,” Wadhia said.
Regardless of the court decision later this year, Wadhia finds the pushback against the ban to be a victory itself.
“However the court rules, we know that there has been some type of victory and success in the resistance,”Wadhia said. “A powerful message that these bans are really inconsistent with American identity.”

A coalition of Georgetown University student groups wrote an open letter to University President John J. DeGioia on behalf of Chinese students, requesting that the university publicly disavow FBI Director Christopher Wray’s recent remarks about the Communist Party of China’s potential use of college students and groups to further political goals.
Several students signed onto the Feb. 19 letter, including Georgetown University Student Association President Kamar Mack (COL’19); Gary Sipeng Xie (SFS ’19), GUSA Senator; and Yi Bao (SFS’19), political awareness committee co-chair and Asian American Student Association social co-chair.
Wray testified Feb. 13 to the Senate Intelligence Committee that student groups on American college campuses receiving funding from foreign governments may have ulterior motives.
“The use of non-traditional collectors, especially in the academic setting — whether it’s professors, scientists, students — we see in almost every field office that the FBI has around the country,” Wray said. “And I think the level of naivete on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues.”
During these remarks, Wray directly identified China as a threat to the United States.
“One of the things we’re trying to do is view the China threat as not just a whole of government threat but a whole of society threat on their end,” Wray said.
The letter to DeGioia accused Wray of attacking America’s Chinese population and fear-mongering against Chinese international students.
“What Wray created was in effect, a witch-hunt fueled by Dreyfus-style xenophobia and McCarthyist craze,” the letter read.
The letter noted the university’s appropriate responses to bias-related incidents on and off campus, as well as emails in response to movements in Ferguson, Mo., the Muslim ban that threatened to block entry into the United States for citizens of Muslim majority countries and the multiple swastikas that appeared in residence halls this year at Georgetown, but asked why the university had not yet made a public comment in response to Wray’s remarks.
“Will you merely refrain from injustice or will you accept responsibility and take care of your students. What is your response?” the letter read.
The remarks come after a report that the GU Chinese Students and Scholars Association had received funding from the Chinese government in 2011, Foreign Policy reported on Feb. 14. The funds are neither illegal nor in violation of any Georgetown University policy but have still come under scrutiny from U.S. security organizations.
The CSSA is a national organization, with chapters at universities across the country, some of which have received funding from the Chinese government, according to Foreign Policy. The CSSA, however, has said in previous budget requests that the funds were used to host events, such as Chinese New Year celebrations for students on campus.
The letter alleges that this increased scrutiny is based in bias and prejudice rather than reason.
“When a society cries out national security as an excuse for unorthodox responses, we often see civil rights violations,” the letter read. “When you judge someone categorically based on their race or country of origin, liberty and reason wither in pain.”

Eight Georgetown alumni feature in Forbes’ “30 Under 30 Class of 2018,” a list of 600 rising stars in the business world in 20 different industries.
The magazine recognized alumni including Mike Dee (MSB ’13), Elizabeth Galbut (COL ’11), Raza Munir (MSB ’11), Diana Tsai Rau (SFS ’12), Luke Schoenfelder (COL ’12), Phil Wong (SFS ’15), Ann Yang (SFS ’16) and Arthur Woods (MSB ’10).
Forbes selected these alumni from thousands of nominees in the categories of social entrepreneurship, food and drink, venture capital, consumer technology and education.
Woods, Wong and Yang were nominated for their work in social entrepreneurship. Wong and Yang co-founded Misfit Juicery, a company that makes cold-pressed juice from fruit that would otherwise have been discarded because of minor cosmetic imperfections. Woods cofounded Imperative, a benefit corporation that helps companies cultivate more efficient workforces.
Both said they were not surprised to see so many Hoyas selected for the Forbes “30 Under 30” list.
“It’s a testament to the fact that the good people at the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative are doing their jobs really well,” Wong said in a university news release.
“I was always inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit and work ethic of fellow Hoyas,” Woods said in the news release.
Rau, Dee and Munir said they found formative influences in their classes and professors at Georgetown.
Rau cofounded Veterati, a digital mentorship platform that connects veterans with volunteer mentors and employment opportunities. She attributes the development of her entrepreneurial skill and spirit to Marc Busch, professor of government and business administration, who taught her “Governments in the Global Economy” course when Rau attended Georgetown.
Busch said the news of Rau’s recognition in Forbes came as no surprise to him; Rau had always exhibited an unrelenting drive to succeed in his classroom.
“She at one point explained to me that her presentation was going to go a certain way and that was that, and I was rather struck by her determination to deliver on her vision and she did it,” Busch said in the news release.
Dee, who cofounded Pilotworks, a culinary incubator that provides shared work space for chefs and food entrepreneurs, cited David Post, former professor of accounting, as a particular inspiration for him to pursue entrepreneurship as a career path.
“Accounting 101 with Professor Post was really influential because he shared stories from his own entrepreneurship experience throughout the semester,” Dee wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It was extremely insightful and much more impactful than the debits and credits we learned about.”
A double major in finance and management during his time at Georgetown, Munir says his entrepreneurship class with former professor William Finnerty led him to a greater understanding of success, which helped him create Climb Credit, a student lending company that offers fast and affordable lons for high-quality education programs.
“It’s effectively a teaching on how to become a successful person and achieve your potential, regardless of what you pursue,” Munir wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Schoenfelder, who cofounded a new smart lock system called Latch, and Galbut, a managing partner at a venture capitalist fund named SoGal Ventures that invests in diverse entrepreneurship teams, said they were pleased to receive the nominations, considering it an indication of their success.
“These types of awards are really just byproducts of building things that matter. Focus on that and everything else will fall into place,” Schoenfelder said in a university news release.
“Keep building and scaling your business, and the recognition will follow,” Galbut said in the news release.
Lucy Flinn, director of strategic communications and operations for the Georgetown University Alumni Association, said the post-graduation ventures of all eight alumni align with Georgetown’s vision of leadership.
“Georgetown University strives to prepare the next generation of global citizens to make a difference in the world, and the eight alumni recognized on the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 List embody the Jesuit values of service to others and service to the community,” Flinn said in the news release.
Dee echoed the continued relevance of Georgetown’s Jesuit values in his professional life.
“People for others is a value that applies to my life every day. I care about my work because it helps create opportunity for others,” Dee wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Their success is ultimately my success, and the symbiotic relationship between Pilotworks and our customers is at the heart of what we do.”
Munir said in a news release that the meaningful experiences he gained from engaging with Georgetown’s talented and diverse community showed him the power of a good education.
“Georgetown is one of the best things to have happened to me. I believe quality education can fundamentally change the path and legacy of an individual’s life,” Munir wrote. “Creating a company with the express mission of increasing access to quality education was inspired by my personal experience at university.”
Drawing from their post-graduate experiences, both Munir and Dee highlighted the importance of having a flexible mindset toward setting one’s professional goals. They advise current college students to follow their interests rather than a fixed career path.
“Like most students, I experienced life-aim paralysis while in school. I studied finance and did internships in the field by default. The one thing I did right was decide to go a different direction because I knew that wasn’t a life-long career for me,” Dee wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Rather than focusing on what you want to be, focus on who you want to be. What traits and characteristics define the person you strive to be? Pursue opportunities and circumstances which allow you to become that person,” Munir said in the news release.
Update: A previous version of this article excluded mention of Yang as an alumna recognized by Forbes.

I must say, as very much as I enjoyed reading what you had to say, I couldnt help but lose interest after a while.  Its as if you had a good grasp to the topic matter, but you forgot to include your readers.  Perhaps you should think about this from far more than 1 angle.  Or maybe you shouldnt generalise so significantly.  Its better if you think about what others may have to say instead of just going for a gut reaction to the topic.  Think about adjusting your personal thought process and giving others who may read this the benefit of the doubt.

Construction started on a new 14-gate concourse at Ronald Reagan National Airport this week as part of a broader renovation plan intended to accommodate more passengers this year.
Lanes on the arrivals roadway were closed Monday for the construction of new slip ramps. Further construction to the airport’s interior is set to begin Feb. 27.
The board of directors  of the Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority kicked off the broader $1 billion renovation project, “Project Journey,” in March 2017. The airport, originally designed to handle 15 million passengers annually, has strained to accommodate the 23 million passengers who passed through it in 2016.
Project Journey will attempt to improve passengers’ experience and increase the airport’s capacity, MWAA President and CEO John Potter said in a July 2017 news release.
“Today, more than 23 million passengers travel through the airport—straining its infrastructure, crowding travelers and hampering our ability to provide best-in-class customer service. Project Journey will transform and improve the passenger experience,” Potter said in a March 2017 news release.
In summer 2017, the MWAA began constructing new security checkpoints in terminals B and C. The plan aims to build two new security checkpoints with 28 screening lanes by 2020. The MWAA also plans to replace bus operations from gate 35X and end outdoor boarding by constructing the 14-gate concourse by the end of 2021.
The construction efforts will affect passengers minimally, as they are confined primarily to fenced or walled-off sections of the airport that are separated from public areas, according to the MWAA. MWAA Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Margaret McKeough said the construction will not significantly change passengers’ experiences.
“In many ways, the passenger experience during Project Journey construction will not functionally change,” McKeough said in the July 2017 news release. “Arriving passengers will use the same pathways they use today, but roadway and curbside changes outside the baggage claim level of Terminal B/C will be noteworthy. We will work hard to keep everyone informed of significant events that could affect their journey.”
“Project Journey” includes plans to restructure the parking and roadways to better accommodate many passeners. Paul Malandrino, vice president and airport manager of Reagan National Airport, recommended passengers use the Metro or airport parking facilities to mitigate congestion. Passengers arriving to the airport by car will need extra time to reach the terminal because of congestion, especially during afternoons and late at night, the busiest times of day.
“We advise passengers to consider using Metro or one of our parking facilities to avoid adding to the congestion,” Malandrino said in the July 2017 news release. “Customers coming to the airport by car will need extra time to navigate the roadway system — especially on afternoons and late at night when traffic is the busiest.”
The MWAA also intends to improve dining and shopping choices for passengers after they pass through security checkpoints and to build spacious waiting areas with integrated power outlets.
Passengers can receive updates about construction delays or changes in the normal airport operations from the construction advisories webpage.
“Project Journey” will maintain the airport’s architectural features like exposed metal beams, glass walls and domed ceilings. It will also maximize views of downtown Washington, D.C., and ensure gates are easily navigable. However, “Project Journey” will not expand the airport’s aircraft capacity.

A new five-year financial plan including provisions for renovations to campus buildings and an increase in financial aid received approval from Georgetown University’s Board of Directors at its winter meeting last week, as well as an additional natural science requirement for undergraduate students and a new certificate in Catholic clinical ethics.
Under the new financial plan, financial aid is expected to increase to $209 million dollars in fiscal year 2019, when the plan takes effect. Rachel Pugh, senior director for strategic communications, said the university is committed to providing educational opportunities to students regardless of their financial situations.
The new financial plan embodies the board’s dedication to expanding access to a Georgetown education and strengthening the university’s competiveness, according to a Feb. 15 news release.
“We are actively working to minimize tuition increases, and we maintain our deep commitment to attracting the brightest students regardless of their financial circumstances,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Undergraduate tuition increased to $53,520 for the 2018-2019 school year — a 3.5 percent increase over the previous year — the university announced last month.
According to Pugh, the funds for the increased financial aid included in the five-year plan will come from donations and Georgetown’s endowment.
“The increase in financial aid in the plan is covered by both increasing in philanthropic dollars, both current use and projected payout on endowments and other unrestricted sources of revenue,” Pugh wrote.
New cost-cutting measures will minimize tuition increases, according to the news release. These measures include reducing travel costs, renegotiating office supply and copying agreements and implementing a new one-year waiting period for new employees to receive matching contributions from the university to their retirement funds.
The board also discussed a plan to improve access to mental health resources for Georgetown students, according to Pugh. It is exploring a potential collaboration with MedStar Georgetown University Hospital to make more psychologists and therapists available to students.
A new science requirement for undergraduate students also received approval at the meeting. Students in all four undergraduate schools will have to complete a natural science course, beginning with students entering in the fall of 2019. A course in biology, chemistry, physics, cognitive science or neuroscience would fulfill the requirement, as would interdisciplinary classes like environmental science.
The university’s financial plan for fiscal years 2019 to 2022 also includes provisions for renovations for 19 apartments in Alumni Square. The board also continued to explore repairs for Kehoe Field. Pugh said the new financial plan will increase campus facility renovations.
“We are looking to dedicate a higher level of annual spending in this plan towards renovations and repair of our existing facilities, including residence halls,” Pugh wrote.
Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19), a Georgetown University Student Association representative to the Board of Directors, said GUSA continued to push for Henle Village renovations in the board’s meeting. Though the board did not approve renovations for Henle, Mondolfi emphasized the need for students to advocate for the renovations they want in order to push those renovations to the top of the list of potential projects.
“What we need to do as students, as GUSA, is making sure that we are continuing to lobby for the spaces we want to see renovated first,” Mondolfi said in an interview with The Hoya.
Pugh said the funding for these new renovations will come from the university’s cash flow and the savings it will accumulate over the next five years.
“The funding for these projects comes from our operating cash flow and increased savings over the life of the plan,” Pugh wrote.
The board also approved a new Catholic Clinical Ethics certificate and master’s program. Georgetown University School of Medicine will offer the certificate in the fall in collaboration with the Catholic University of America and the Catholic Health Association. The new certificate was created to address moral medical issues and Catholic ethical challenges in health care, according to the news release.
The certificate will combine Catholic ethics with traditional clinical bioethics to better prepare students to work in Catholic hospitals, according to Dr. G. Kevin Donovan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at the Georgetown University Medical Center.
“[The certificate and degree program] will provide a unique education, balancing clinical bioethics with a strong foundation in traditional Catholic ethics,” Donovan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Those receiving this training will be prepared for various leadership roles in both Catholic and secular health care institutions.”
