CW: This article references the 9/11 attacks and violence in Afghanistan. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The Taliban takeover in Afghanistan and the Jan. 6 insurrection can be tied to the events and aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, panelists said as they reflected on the 20 years after the attacks.  
The event, titled “Discussion on the Twentieth Anniversary of the September 11 Attacks,” was co-hosted by the Center for Jewish Civilization and the Walsh School of Foreign Service on Sept. 2. Elizabeth Stanley, an executive committee chair of the CJC, moderated the discussion between Bruce Hoffman, the group’s director, and Daniel Byman, another executive committee member, on how the global community should reflect on the 9/11 terrorism attacks 20 years later. 
The 9/11 attacks coordinated by the militant group Al Qaeda resulted in the destruction of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan and devastation at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pa., leading to major U.S. initiatives to combat terrorism, which former President George W. Bush dubbed the war on terror. Despite some successes such as key arrests of terrorists, the prevention of subsequent attacks and the toppling of the Taliban, critics argue that war scattered terrorist groups and increased anti-American sentiment, amplifying militant organizations.
Back-and-forth American military interventions were a failure of the war and allowed for terrorist groups to gain strength, according to Hoffman. 
“We never got the balance right,” Hoffman said at the event. “We swung in two opposite directions, either invading and occupying countries with hundreds of thousands of troops, which was unsustainable and unpopular, or having too few troops.”
The United States’ lack of focus on social media communication strategies allowed terrorist groups to spread their message and gain support, according to Byman.
“One thing I would highlight is the broader social media space in the last five years, where groups like ISIS were able to run circles around the U.S. government. And I do think governments were able to organize more effectively against these groups,” Byman said at the event. “But it really took a remarkable amount of time, so many years after 9/11, to realize that this is a significant problem, and that yet again, we see Jihadist groups exploiting new means of communication.”
Islamophobia sparked by the war is harmful to counterterrorism efforts, because unity and support from the Muslim community are condusive to peace, according to Byman. 
“Huge numbers of plots have been foiled because a member of the community called the police or the FBI and said, ‘There’s a problem,’” Byman said. “The community itself wants to make sure there are not trouble makers within its ranks.” 
White supremacists attacked the U.S. Capitol building Jan. 6 to protest the results of the 2020 presidential election, demonstrating the divisive nature of current U.S. politics. Political divisions have become more prominent in the U.S. since the immediate unity following the 9/11 attacks and can be indirectly tied to the Jan. 6 insurrection in the U.S. Capitol building, according to Hoffman. 
“It led to a lot of the lack of trust in elected leadership, which is pervasive now,” Hoffman said. “It is exactly the environment which terrorists thrive on.”  
The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 in response to the 9/11 attacks and officially withdrew all forces Aug. 30 of this year. According to Hoffman, the withdrawal will only further destabilize the region and provide opportunities for U.S. adversaries. 
“Wherever the United States has withdrawn, it has not only led to more terrorism but it has also provided an opening for our rivals, particularly Russia or Iran, to gain footholds,” Hoffman said. “Now I think the same phenomena will happen in Afghanistan.”
While the world is in a far different place from where it was before the 9/11 attacks, there is a need to learn from the past and recognize that the threat of terrorism still exists in order to prevent a repeat of history, according to Hoffman. 
“However much we have weakened our terrorist adversaries, they have not given up thinking and hoping and marshalling their resources to try to attack the United States,” Hoffman said. “What changed is that we are becoming increasingly more complacent.”

A coalition government that includes both Taliban and non-Taliban entities is essential to ensure the political and economic survival of Afghanistan, former Acting Minister of Finance of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Khalid Payenda said in a panel event Wednesday. 
The event, titled “Afghanistan: On the Brink of Collapse,” was sponsored by the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and moderated by SFS Dean Joel Hellman. A limited number of Georgetown students, faculty and staff attended the hybrid event in person while the remainder of students and staff accessed the panel through a Facebook livestream. 
Less than three weeks before the event, Payenda resigned as Afghanistan’s acting finance minister due to personal reasons. On Aug. 21, only nine days later, Taliban militants took control of Kabul after former Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai fled the country, effectively leaving control to the Taliban.
For Paydena, Ghani’s flight from Afghanistan was particularly disappointing and went against previous assurances from the administration.
“I was extremely shocked and saddened by the president’s departure because of assurances he gave to everybody that he would stay and fight till the end,” Payenda said at the event. “It was a shock, something that is still sinking in, for not just me, for a lot of people, millions of people. A country that despite its problems on a trajectory that was upward to suddenly undo 20 years of work — it was a shock.” 
Ghani’s flight came after Taliban forces captured several cities in provincial capitals throughout Afghanistan. Despite the increasing Taliban military victories in cities around the country, the former Afghan government had enough finances to ensure the government could survive for a few more years until a peace deal could be reached with the Taliban, according to Payenda.
Given the chaos currently unfolding in the country, a government with different political perspectives is the key to ensuring Afghanistan’s survival, according to Payenda, who cited the exclusion of a Taliban perspective in the 2001 Bonn agreement, which attempted to establish a new Afghani constitution protecting the rights of women and minority groups, as a crucial misstep in Afghanistan’s attempt to restructure the country after the events of Sept. 11, 2001. 
As a new government is formed, Payenda hopes the Taliban will consider negotiating a compromise government despite the past. 
“I hope there is a talk on forming a government. We should learn from the 2001 Bonn agreement where we left out the Taliban. I think that was a historic mistake,” Payenda said. “For the Taliban to repeat it to the other side would still be a mistake. An inclusive government is important.”
For Payenda, as the nation rebuilds, it is also important to address the issues of the previous government, including corruption, in order to ensure the safety and well-being of Afghan citizens.
Corruption in the customs sector of the financial ministry directly led to the disintegration of the Afghan government and subsequent economic instability, according to Payenda. The Afghan government was historically corrupt, with government officials frequently taking multimillion dollar bribes. 
To address corruption, the Afghan parliament worked in conjunction with the World Bank, which was responsible for the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, a multi-donor trust overseen by the World Bank, to safeguard international donor funds and provide public services to the Afghan people. Taliban forces, however, have closed banks and frozen financial budgets, reopening the door for corruption, according to Payenda. 
“Without continuation of the grants and donations, no matter no matter how well you re-equip these institutions, it’s going to be impossible,” Payenda said. 
Despite the uncertainty over the future of Afghanistan and its government, for Payenda, the United States and international humanitarian groups can still play important roles in ensuring the future of Afghanistan.
“I believe the situation could be somehow salvaged with the leverage that the international community still has because the Taliban know they cannot run a government without the finances and the technical assistance that comes from other countries,” Payenda said.

The Georgetown University Graduate Student Government is set to vote on a proposal to permanently represent the School of Continuing Studies in its ranks, paving the way for expanded advocacy across Georgetown’s graduate campuses.
Under the proposal, the SCS will be able to fully participate in GradGov activities, allowing students in the school to run for executive board positions, attend meetings and run for senate seats. Though the GradGov Senate is expected to vote on the proposal at its upcoming Sept. 17 meeting, the decision is also awaiting approval from an SCS student body referendum, which does not currently have a set date. 
The inclusion of the SCS will give a voice to students and significantly enhance GradGov’s ability to advocate for graduate degree seekers at Georgetown, according to GradGov President Jonah Klempner (LAW ’22).
“This constitutes a seismic shift in the graduate student community, one that was achieved with unprecedented expediency,” Klempner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Not only does it correct a longstanding mistake in the structure of the university that has long left SCS voiceless, this treaty will lead to a 50% increase in our constituency, Senate, and budget.” 
The School of Continuing Studies, which offers graduate programs in professional and liberal studies, professional certificates and a part-time bachelor’s degree program, is housed on Massachusetts Ave. NW, largely outside of Georgetown’s main campus and has been separated from GradGov in the past. 
The students in the SCS are often demographically different from those in other graduate schools and have not been as actively included in student advocacy, according to Henry Watson (GRD ’24), GradGov chief of staff and former GradGov president.
“I guess that they were presumed to be a bit of a different population since the School of Continuing Studies tends to be more professional, evening students who hold jobs and are also pursuing graduate education,” Watson said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We’re excited to bring their perspective into our senate.”
With the addition of the SCS, the number of seats in the GradGov Senate will increase from 100 to 150, with 44 of the new seats added specifically allocated to programs within the SCS. Candidates for the SCS seats were able to file to run in the election beginning Aug. 30, despite the vote on SCS addition to GradGov expected to take place two weeks after the general elections. Seventy-three SCS students have already started the process of running for the new seats, and GradGov expects that 42 of the 44 SCS seats will be filled in the upcoming elections, according to Klempner. 
The move to add the SCS to GradGov will promote inclusivity and make connections between graduate schools at Georgetown, according to Coulter Tallent (GRD ’22), who first began to advocate for the SCS’s inclusion in GradGov last fall and is now running for a Senate seat.
“The reason why I wanted to do this was because not only does it make the Georgetown community more inclusive, but it also affords Georgetown SCS students the same academic and extracurricular opportunities,” Tallent said in a phone interview to The Hoya. 
GradGov will be a better means of representation for Georgetown’s SCS students and help integrate students further into the graduate community, according to SCS Dean Kelly Otter.
“SCS students are always eager to engage with the larger Georgetown community, and I’m pleased they will finally have an opportunity to do so through GradGov,” Otter wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The elected representatives will be an important voice for SCS, and I am confident they will make an immediate positive impact in the coming academic year.”
The move to include the SCS in GradGov comes as part of a larger series of reforms enacted by the group in April when a new constitution was ratified by the GradGov Senate, which outlined the expansion of GradGov to cover the SCS. Other reforms in the new constitution included reforms to standardize the representation of graduate programs within the senate, including the School of Continuing Studies, as well as steps to centralize the election process for both the senate and executive.
Many of the reforms are aimed at building a broader graduate identity across schools and programs, according to Watson.
“A big overarching goal is we want to have a better sense of the graduate student community on campus,” Watson said. “So, we want people to feel like, ‘I’m not just a member of my program, I belong to this community that is Georgetown graduate students.” 
While the move to include the SCS in GradGov has not been finalized yet, for Tallent, the inclusion of the SCS is a positive step for graduate students as a whole.
“This is the direction to make us one community, one school,” Tallent said. “This is one step toward that direction but we still have more to go.”

CW: This article references violence in Afghanistan. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The collapse of the Afghan government was brought about by diplomatic failure, according to a panel of Georgetown University professors who discussed possible solutions to the humanitarian crisis. 
The Aug. 20 virtual event, titled “The Crisis in Afghanistan: A Panel Discussion,” was hosted by the Masters of Science in Foreign Service Program, the Security Studies Program and the Department of Government. The event followed the Taliban’s recapture of Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, after withdrawal of American troops in early July. This follows nearly 20 years of conflict in the United States’ longest-running war. The panel was moderated by director of the MSFS program George Shambaugh and featured three Georgetown professors with expertise in security, international affairs and anti-corruption practices.
In the early 2000s, the Bush administration suppressed intelligence and released misleading public statements about the losing war in Afghanistan. After Bush’s withdrawal from the region, the Taliban sought refuge in Pakistan, which allowed them to return stronger to Afghanistan in 2005. 
Christine Fair, professor of security studies, highlighted how subsequent administrations struggled to recover from this comeback and continued to implement a back-and-forth policy that gave the Taliban space to take over.
“Pakistan will not give terrorists nuclear weapons because nuclear weapons are their primary coercive tool,” Fair said at the event. “Pakistan is the most stable instability. Our continual willingness to be coerced by them, really speaks to our failure as an alleged superpower.”
Corruption also destabilized the region and rendered citizens unable to enact meaningful change in their government, according to panelist Jodi Vittori, professor of global politics and security. 
“When you have your security sector and the corruption in it, that is part of what is leading to state weakness. That is part of fueling the insurgencies,” Vittori said at the event. “That is the security problem.”
From 2003 until 2014, NATO led the United Nations-mandated International Security Assistance Force, which coordinated the troops of 42 nations in empowering the Afghan national security forces to defeat the Taliban.  
The inefficacy of international cooperation also destabilized the region, according to Paul Miller, panelist and professor of global politics and security, who cited NATO and the United Nations’ involvement in the region. 
“I guess this is a good case study for how not to organize a large-scale international intervention, whether for humanitarian purposes or state building purposes,” Miller said at the event. “The military talks about the need to maintain unity of effort, and we did not have unity of effort in Afghanistan.”
Despite the conversation focusing on the path forward, Miller expressed concerns about the next steps.
“In one scenario, we try to isolate Afghanistan with sanctions by depriving them of any economic assistance,” Miller said. “Maybe we support some effort to get in a monitoring group to shine a light on the Taliban’s human rights violations. But that’s about it.” 
The fall of Kabul raises concerns of international terrorism and democratic failure in other unstable regions, according to Miller.
“When Afghanistan fails in its effort to achieve democracy, this is one small chink in the liberal international order,” Miller said. “And I worry, how many more chinks can we survive before it shatters?”

Georgetown University students joined thousands of people protesting in favor of national voting rights and Washington, D.C. statehood during a march to the National Mall on Aug. 28.
Students and organizations including Georgetown’s chapter of Students for D.C. Statehood called for the passage of several bills related to suffrage at the March On for Washington and Voting Rights. The march also featured speeches from activists addressing voting rights as well as D.C. statehood and the importance of ending police brutality.
The fight for voting rights and racial equality must remain a primary focus for D.C. activists, according to Taylor Kahn-Perry (COL ’23).
“​O​ne of the major messages I heard was that there’s been so much bloodshed and so many folks who have lost their lives for the cause of voting rights,” Kahn-Perry wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are doing a disservice, not only to Black communities today, but to the long struggle for justice in this country by failing to be outraged by the attack on voting rights.”
Marchers advocated for bills including the For the People Act, a federal bill to establish national voting standards, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a second federal bill to work to dismantle racial voting inequalities, as well as the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, which would pave the way for D.C. statehood.
Currently, all three bills are awaiting votes in the U.S. Senate, though none of them are expected to pass because of Republican opposition.
The bills are also not expected to pass because of structural problems in Congress, according to Mia Young (NHS ’23), director of programming for Georgetown Students for D.C. Statehood.
“The DC Statehood bill, the For The People Act, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act are being held up due to attachment to arcane procedures in the legislative process,” Young wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The march, which was organized by March On, a nonprofit organization of women-led and grassroots political advocacy groups, was held on the 58th anniversary of the civil rights movement’s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The original March on Washington called for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Organizers called for a new March on Washington after state legislators around the country introduced hundreds of bills restricting voting rights. Speakers referenced recent laws enacted by the Georgia state legislature and Texas state legislature, which have been considered the strictest of recent voting laws passed on the state level by voting experts.
Speakers at the march included D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson, the families of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and several other activists and D.C. residents.
Events like March On for Washington and Voting Rights will hopefully help raise the profile of the D.C. statehood movement, specifically among Georgetown students, according to Allegra Lubar (COL ’23), who attended the Aug. 28 march.
“I think most Georgetown students, at least that I’ve talked to, would be in favor of statehood,” Lubar wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I also think DC statehood is becoming a more well-known and slightly more realistic cause in general, so Georgetown students will probably start hearing more about it.” 
Advocacy efforts around D.C. statehood have intensified in recent years. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Washington, D.C. Admission Act on Apr. 22, though the legislation has stalled in the Senate. The legislation comes after the House voted to grant statehood to D.C. on June 26, 2020, the first time either chamber of Congress voted to approve D.C. statehood. 
Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) pledged the university’s support for D.C. statehood in a letter to congressional representatives in 2019.
While passage of national voting rights laws and D.C. statehood may not happen soon, events like the march will hopefully bring widespread attention to these issues, according to Young. “Our hope is that the marches all across the country made it known that this is not acceptable to voters and that voting rights needs to be a top legislative priority,” Young wrote.

From taking a photo with John Carroll to struggling to find Maguire Hall, first-year and transfer students enjoyed a quintessential return to the Hilltop with the first in-person New Student Orientation since spring 2020. 
This year’s NSO, which commenced Aug. 20, initiated Georgetown University’s return to in-person instruction after more than a full year of virtual operations. Over the course of five days, new students participated in in-person and virtual activities to introduce them to the Georgetown community. 
The opportunity to interact with peers in person helped to make campus feel more welcoming, according to Mackenzie O’Connor (COL ’25). 
“I know a lot of my friends from high school had fully online and virtual orientations,” O’Connor said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “And being actually able to meet people rather than seeing them on Zoom and actually getting to walk around campus with them, it definitely made a difference in welcoming me.” 
Last year NSO was held virtually after the university moved to remote operations for the fall semester. While coordinators organized online programming for incoming students, they faced a variety of issues, including technical problems and logistical issues with panel events. 
Annika Swanson (COL ’24), an orientation advisor, found NSO is key for fostering community among first-years. 
“When I did NSO online I didn’t feel very connected when I would join the panels because cameras were off and people were missing,” Swanson said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “But here, there’s a lot more participation and a lot more attendance. It was a lot easier to communicate in person with in-person discussions and seeing everybody and spending time together and showing them around D.C.” 
In-person activities for students included small group meetings with orientation advisors, a welcome back barbeque for students on Healy Lawn and a New Student Convocation Ceremony on Copley Lawn. Students also attended virtual panels held on Zoom on racial justice, Jesuit values and health and wellness. 
Despite being held virtually, the events were informative and engaging, especially the panel on Jesuit values, according to O’Connor. 
“I didn’t realize that there were so many different religions represented on campus. There was an imam, an orthodox priest, a rabbi,” O’Connor said. “I didn’t really understand the true abundance of resources Georgetown had for religious life here. That was one thing that really shocked me.” 
The panel on racial justice — which discussed a variety of topics, including the GU272, the sale of 314 enslaved people in 1838 by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus — was important to help students become empathetic, well-informed community members, according to NSO Student Coordinator Brendan Omaña (SFS ’23). 
“Learning and engaging with the topic of racial justice is essential to be a well-rounded citizen of the world, much less a well-rounded college student (particularly relevant at an institution like Georgetown with its deplorable, but unfortunately often overlooked, history with enslaved people),” Omaña wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We want to ensure that every new student has the opportunity to delve into this topic, especially if they haven’t before arriving on campus.”
All students participating in NSO were required to adhere to the university’s COVID-19 guidelines, including taking a COVID-19 test upon their arrival to campus. Additionally, at all NSO events, students were required to be masked regardless of vaccination status. The decision to require masks at all events and split students into smaller groups was made to keep students and NSO staff safe, according to Omaña. 
“With so many students coming together in a short time period and arriving to campus from disparate locations, we took this measure to ensure that our staff as well as the new students were as safe as possible during the transition back,” Omaña wrote. “As well, during indoor staff training modules we mandated our staff stay in “pods” of 7-8 students to minimize cross-group interaction.” 
For Faith Lynnette Garza (SFS ’25), who completed her senior year of high school online, the COVID-19 precautions at NSO helped to ease the transition to in-person activities. 
“It felt a little more normal, and it also kept it safe to be in a smaller group,” Garza said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I felt that it was less nerve-racking to be stressing out over the huge amount of people at first. It made it feel a little more comfortable talking to everybody. It felt safer to have our NSO leader be so clear about the precautions being taken, and it just felt safe; it didn’t feel like we were jumping into anything too fast.” 
Despite the looming threat COVID-19 poses to continued in-person activities , the atmosphere at NSO generated anticipation for the coming year, according to Garza.
“I am most definitely excited beyond any other feeling. I love walking around campus and seeing where my next class is going to be,” Garza said. “I’m also of course apprehensive, but I feel so excited.”

After two weeks of in-person campus operations and over 10,000 COVID-19 tests, Georgetown University will begin testing random pools of campus students, faculty and staff for the coronavirus.
Beginning in early September, a random pool of vaccinated campus community members will be selected weekly for asymptomatic COVID-19 testing, according to an Aug. 27 email from Dr. Ranit Mishori, Georgetown’s chief public health officer. Selected individuals will be notified on Mondays and are asked to complete a test by Thursday of the same week. 
The new protocols adjust the university’s initial COVID-19 testing guidelines, which required all individuals to receive a test upon moving onto campus, regardless of vaccination status. Individuals who are not fully vaccinated must be tested twice per week as set out in the original guidelines, according to the email. 
The university will continue to monitor the public health of the campus community and will adjust guidelines if needed, according to a university spokesperson. 
The decision to change testing protocols comes amid concern about future COVID-19 cases, according to the email. The university saw a slight uptick in the number of positive tests in the past weeks, with 58 individuals testing positive for a positivity rate of 0.55% in the week of Aug. 22. During the week of Aug. 15, 34 campus community members tested positive for a positivity rate of 0.53%. 
Individuals who test positive for COVID-19 will be contacted by Georgetown’s COVID-19 Care Navigator team, a team of contact tracers who contact and provide guidance for both positive individuals and those who come into close contact with them, according to a university spokesperson. 
“The Care Navigator team works as quickly as possible to determine who was in close contact with this person and then notifies and provides guidance to those individuals, typically within hours of learning about the positive case,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
In addition to testing protocols, the new guidelines will also require all students, regardless of vaccination status, to fill out a daily COVID-19 symptom checklist through the GU360 app effective immediately, according to the email. Many students report they have not filled out the checklist but can still access main campus buildings using their GoCard, a student ID and access card. 
According to District of Columbia Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto (LAW ’17), Georgetown’s new testing protocols display the university’s commitment to the greater Washington, D.C. community.
“I support Georgetown’s decision to supply randomized testing to students as one way to help reduce further spread of the virus, and it can be especially helpful in locating and isolating asymptomatic and positive cases,” Pinto wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As we continue to come together as a community to beat this virus and make a full recovery from the pandemic, I am especially grateful to the Georgetown University community and thank them for their partnership in this effort.” 
Testing students as they return to an in-person learning environment is crucial in controlling the spread of COVID-19, according to Pinto.
“As Georgetown University welcomed back thousands of students and staff to an in-person learning environment, it is vitally important to ensure safe protocols are followed to keep the entire community safe and limit the spread of COVID-19. Testing is a critical part of preventing and slowing the spread of COVID-19 particularly in academic settings,” Pinto wrote.
While an increase in mandated testing of the campus community is positive, these new protocols do not go far enough, according to Lauren Gaetano (COL ’23), who volunteered in a hospital amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Jan. to May 2021. 
“It does feel like they’re trying, but as someone who has worked in the pandemic, volunteering in hospitals and in vaccination and testing clinics, I would like to see maybe a little bit more robust testing, especially given that not all the Georgetown population is vaccinated,” Gaetano said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
Although she currently feels safe on campus, Gaetano said that may change if cases continue to rise. 
“I have been fully vaccinated, and I wear my mask all the time, even outside, but obviously that might change if we start to see a rise in cases, and I would feel more comfortable if the university was doing more testing,” Gaetano said.

The Georgetown Health Officials should look into the protocols they established at the start of this epidemic if it  is followed. We have non GTU people who are allowed to work in the university  in student dorms and  student common areas.  I am talking about un-vetted people who are pushed into the workforce to undermine the GTU employees. They are not known by GTU-360 nor they follow the established Covid-19 protocol.  They do not have a badge and we do not know if they are vaccinated. I am not sure why a high ranking Work management person allow this to happen. They are putting the life of employees and students in danger, Someone need to say something about this.  The GTU health protocol should be followed strictly. No Director or General Manger should undermine the rule . We are concerned contracting Covid-19.   I am not sure what the agenda of the manager is to give this a blind eye.  There are over five to six thousand students living in the campus. To bring twenty to thirty workers without proper vetting procedure is crazy. HR don’t know about this and I am not sure if the President and student life people know about this

The School of Foreign Service announced a new partnership Aug. 12 that will pave the way for high school students to participate in a well-known international affairs course offered by the university.
In partnership with the National Education Equity Lab, an organization that facilitates connections between historically underserved communities and universities, 150 to 200 students will be able to take the renowned geography course for SFS students, “Map of the Modern World.” These students come from select Title I high schools in Florida and New York, at which at least 35% of students qualify for free or reduced lunch. 
The collaborative program will help high school students develop an interest in international affairs while preparing for college, according to Vice Dean for Undergraduate Affairs Mark Giordano, who teaches “Map of the Modern World.”
“The reason for doing it is partly to help get the message out to high school students earlier about the importance of global understanding,” Giordano said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It’s an opportunity for these students to earn Georgetown credit they can transfer elsewhere, and partly we’re hoping it expands the type of students that are going to apply to Georgetown.” 
Students will be able to integrate the coursework into their daily high school experience by watching lectures asynchronously. In addition, students taking the course will meet virtually once a week for a discussion section with a teaching assistant. Teachers from the qualifying high schools will also be trained to support their students with technological and content-related issues.
Connecting high school students with these opportunities highlights the university’s Jesuit value of engaging with the world as people for others, according to Dr. Scott Taylor, vice dean for diversity, equity and inclusion in the SFS.
“There are so many great, smart and capable high school students from diverse backgrounds out there who will have so much to contribute to international affairs,” Taylor wrote. “Some will be future SFS students; others will go elsewhere. It is extremely rewarding to assist with cultivating their interest, and their talents, through these outreach programs.”
In addition to the coursework, the collaboration will also feature information sessions about Georgetown and panel discussions with students and deans.
The extracurricular programs offered by the program will provide students with an enriching experience, according to Melissa Karakash, admissions coordinator for diversity, equity and inclusion at the SFS.
“We also plan to supplement the course with opportunities for the students to virtually meet with professionals in global affairs to expand their perceptions of what a degree in international relations can allow them to do,” Karakash wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We hope to help students gain a deeper understanding of the world and the forces and influences that are fundamental to its functioning.” 
While the enrollment for “Map” will increase to include sections for participating high school students, the partnership will not change how the class operates, according to Giordano. 
“There will be no impact on how we do things on the main campus because the whole class is online this semester, or at least the lecture part is online,” Giordano said. “I hired extra TAs who will work with the high schools, so it’ll have no effect on the main campus.”
The collaboration with NEEL builds on the work of the SFS diversity, equity and inclusion committee in establishing the Future Global Leaders Fellowship scholarship program this summer, which distributed education funds to 20 students from the Washington, D.C. area. Students selected for the scholarships were able to enroll in one of two week-long high school summer programs at Georgetown, “International Relations Academy” and “Washington & the World Academy.” 
The goals of the FGLF program have much in common with  those of the NEEL collaboration, according to Carla Koppell, senior advisor for diversity, equity and inclusion at the SFS.
“The partnership with the Equity Lab was really born of that commitment to try to broaden interest and awareness of international affairs and of Georgetown University in communities that otherwise might not have the kind of contact or introduction,” Koppell said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
The two initiatives come as part of the SFS’ broader efforts to promote global anti-racism within the study of international relations under its office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. The DEI office was established after students, staff and faculty called on the university to address racial injustice on campus amid nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd in May 2020. 
Programs like the FGLF and the SFS’ collaboration with NEEL are emblematic of the SFS’ missions and will positively impact the lives of many students, according to Taylor.
“This is Georgetown and SFS at their best: people for others and fulfilling our mission of service,” Taylor wrote.

CW: This article references violence in Afghanistan. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Shouts of “Biden, protect Afghan women!” and “Don’t abandon Afghan women leaders!” echoed down 16th Street en route to the White House during the Aug. 29 March for Afghan Women. 
A crowd of over 200 protesters gathered in Lafayette Square last Sunday to demand the United States support the evacuation of vulnerable women from Afghanistan following President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from the country by the end of August. The march was organized by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security along with several other international women’s organizations and Afghan advocacy groups.
According to Sarah Rutherford, the director of communications and external affairs at GIWPS, the organization plans to continue advocating for Afghan women after the protest.
“We continue to call on the US Government and international community to support Afghan women, whether through evacuations of the most at-risk women leaders or ongoing assistance to those who remain in Afghanistan under Taliban rule,” Rutherford wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Under Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001, women in Afghanistan were given limited freedoms, facing bans from working or attending school and harsh punishments such as beatings, torture or execution if they disobeyed. Despite the Taliban’s recent assertions that they would uphold the same women’s rights as under the previous Afghan government implemented in 2001 following the U.S. invasion of the country, activists fear the reemergence of the same oppression due to recent acts of Taliban violence against women.
Shoalia Samadyar, an Afghan woman who lived under the first Taliban government, expressed deep concern about women’s safety. 
“My heart is bleeding right now,” Samadyar said in a speech at the protest. “I am worried about the little girls and women in Afghanistan that are going through what I went through 20 years ago. Every 20 years we cannot go back to zero.”
Zainab Salbi, founder of Women for Women International, an aid organization that helped implement the march, listed several demands for the Biden administration during the event, including the provision of visas and priority evacuation of women journalists, activists and other professionals.
“Our Afghan sisters have been betrayed. They have been abandoned. They became ministers and lawyers and judges and prosecutors and teachers and principals and journalists and everything. And now, these same women’s lives are at risk. Here we are today to demand that this government prioritize the evacuation of our Afghan sisters right now,” Salbi said at the event.
Trinity Johnson (MSB ’23) was inspired to join the march by her childhood best friend, who immigrated to the United States with her family from Afghanistan. 
“Her family welcomed me in, and I got to learn about their culture, their language and their life and experiences,” Johnson said in an interview with The Hoya. “To see the heartbreak in her family has moved me even more toward wanting to see peace in her country.”
The partnership of several women’s and Afghan organizations made the march more impactful, according to Alyse Nelson, president and CEO of Vital Voices, a women’s advocacy group that was one of the march’s organizers.
“What was incredible about the gathering was that it was between major women’s organizations who came together to speak out,” Nelson said in an interview with The Hoya. “In some ways that’s unusual, you usually have only one or two organizations, but we wanted to reach out to every single network.”
Between the emotional speeches criticizing the U.S. government’s withdrawal and demanding action for Afghan women, an important question arose regarding how advocates should be speaking about the situation. Multiple speakers, as well as Nelson, stressed the same message: Don’t eliminate the agency of Afghan women. 
“Afghan women in the 1960s were wearing mini skirts. It is not like we liberated them somehow in 2001,” Nelson said. “These women are survivors, they are leaders, and they should be treated as such. They absolutely do not need to be saved; their voices need to be amplified.”
Facing the White House with a bullhorn in hand, Noorjahan Akbar, an Afghan activist, highlighted the message of the day.
“This is not about saving Afghan women!” Akbar said. “This is about holding your government accountable!”

After over 500 days of shuttered doors and empty aisles, The Corp has begun the process of reopening their on-campus locations as Georgetown University transitions to in-person operations. 
Between Aug. 23 and 25, The Corp reopened four locations across campus, providing community members with increased food options and a return to pre-pandemic campus life. The Corp will open the rest of their on-campus locations throughout September, marking the first time the organization will function fully in-person since the university began virtual operations in March 2020. 
Reopening the storefronts was a daunting yet rewarding task for The Corp to undertake, according to Matt Davis (SFS ’22), CEO and President of The Corp. 
“It was a lot to put on and honestly when we were planning it out, we felt confident, but we had never done this before so we didn’t know if it was actually going to be pulled off,” Davis said in an interview with The Hoya. 
As of Aug. 25, four Corp locations have reopened with full operating status for the fall 2021 semester: Vital Vittles, a grocery store in the Leavey Center; Hoya Snaxa, a convenience store in Southwest Quad; Uncommon Grounds, a coffee shop in the Leavey Center; and More Uncommon Grounds, a coffee stand located in the Intercultural Center. 
This is not the Corp’s first time navigating a reopening; last winter, the Corp reopened two locations on campus with reduced operating status: The Corp Cafe at Grounded, a breakfast and coffee shop in the Healey Family Student Center, and Vital Vittles. The decision came after students in on-campus stability housing raised concerns about limited food options. However, this is the first time The Corp has reopened with full operating status since closing due to COVID-19 restrictions. 
The reopening of Corp locations has made campus feel like it used to before the pandemic, according to Maeve Williams (COL ’22), an undergraduate student who frequents Corp locations. 
“Yates opened recently and now with The Corp opening, it’s like, wow, things are really getting back to normal, and things are kind of going back to the Georgetown that those of us who were here pre-COVID, that we remember and it’s exciting,” Williams said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Davis said the reopening of Grounded and Vittles in Jan. 2021 helped to prepare The Corp with the reopening process for this fall. 
“We had never done contactless pick up, everything had been in person and very physical,” Davis said. “To go from that to having to be totally contactless for the university to allow us to open was a big challenge, and that was all tested back in February.” 
During the spring semester, The Corp offered online ordering for students; while this service is no longer available, Davis says the organization is considering bringing the program back. 
The Corp expands campus dining by providing students with food and drink options not connected to official Georgetown dining locations. While The Corp accepts the use of Flex Dollars — money allocated in meal plans that can be used at Georgetown dining locations — the organization is not managed by Hoya Hospitality or Aramark, the university’s food service provider. 
Helen Martin (COL ’22), Director of Uncommon Grounds, said she is excited the Corp can provide more diverse food options for Georgetown community members. 
 “I think a lot of it has to do with just the limited food access on campus, so the fact that Uncommon Grounds can help fill that void is really exciting for us,” Martin said. 
Currently, The Corp’s largest locations on campus — Hilltoss and Grounded, a salad shop and coffee shop in the Healey Family Student Center, and Midnight Mug, a coffee shop in Lauinger Library — are closed due to understaffing issues created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Midnight Mug is scheduled to reopen Sept. 20, while Hilltoss and Grounded will reopen Sept. 27. 
Increased community engagement is one of the biggest markers of success for The Corp, according to Davis. 
“I think the real barometer of judging how successful it’s been is seeing just how the community has received it and to see people excited and wanting to go to The Corp,” Davis said. “In my mind that shows that we’re doing our job of serving students serving the community.”

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate unanimously passed a resolution demanding cheaper meal plan options for all undergraduate students at an Aug. 29 meeting.
The resolution also called on the university to allow juniors and seniors to be exempt from meal plan requirements with a refund of their meal plan charges, as well as resolve the long lines, overcrowding and lack of food options at Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall. 
The current meal plan policy, first announced by the university in June, requires all students living on campus to enroll in a meal plan, except for seniors living off campus. First-years and sophomores are limited to the most expensive All Access 7 Plan, which allows for unlimited meal swipes at Leo’s and costs $3,260. The new university policy differs from prior years, where underclassmen could enroll in the cheaper meal plan that includes 14 meals per week and costs $2,978. Additionally, junior and senior students were not required to enroll in a plan in prior years. 
According to GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (COL ’22), who introduced the resolution, the new requirements are a burden on students’ finances.
“Meal plans at Georgetown, in general, are very expensive, and if you are a freshman or a sophomore, this means spending $3,200 on a meal plan that you’re not likely going to use to its full extent,” Flores said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Essentially, it is just a line cost to the tuition. It’s like paying for a service you’re not going to use.”
Students who receive financial aid will have their meal plan cost included in their overall cost of attendance, a factor that determines the amount of financial aid each student receives. 
Students can apply for a meal plan exemption if they have religious or medical dietary restrictions. However, students who have dietary preferences such as vegan or vegetarian diets will not be considered for exemptions.
Georgetown introduced the new requirements to improve students’ food access, according to a university spokesperson.
“To support and promote a healthy living and learning community where all students thrive, we offer a number of nutritious, flexible and affordable meal plan options for students on campus and, this year, we are introducing a new meal requirement for all students living on campus,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to the Hoya. “We have seen a significant increase in student-reported satisfaction with the program across the board, including in variety and quality.”
Due to reduced hours for several dining options on campus, students have experienced long lines outside of Leo’s and other dining spots, as well as congestion inside during meal times. 
According to Flores, the meal policy does little to improve food insecurity and exacerbates existing problems, such as overcrowding in Leo’s. 
“I think it is an awfully implemented policy in general. I know that the rationale behind it is to solve food insecurity on campus, but I think it has an opposite effect and is causing food insecurity,” Flores said. “You have 5,000 students now required to go to Leo’s to just eat, and I think having one dining hall that serves 5,000 students is not sustainable.”
Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24) also said that in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, overcrowding in the indoor dining hall poses a health risk to both students and workers. 
“We have problems with Leo’s, we have problems with food, and I really think that even if we aren’t talking about food insecurity, getting Leo’s to be less crowded might be better with COVID and I think this is legislation that is desperately needed,” Gordon said at the meeting. 
The university enforced a similar meal plan policy in January, requiring all on-campus students to purchase the All Access 7 meal plan, despite financial and dietary concerns raised by students. This decision came amid the COVID-19 pandemic, when the university provided housing for roughly 500 students who did not have other options for stable housing. 
The GUSA resolution urges the university to alleviate the long lines outside of Leo’s and several other dining options on campus, as well as food shortages and technical issues with the GrubHub app, an option students can use to order ahead and pick up food instead of eating inside. 
According to the resolution, the long lines at the dining hall — which stretched all the way to Cooper Field — pose issues for students with dietary restrictions and allergies and add to the significant number of students already facing food insecurity on campus.
“Students have experienced long lines into the dining hall, which extend alongside McCarthy Hall and into Cooper Field, and as a result, have also expressed concerns regarding a lack of options for students with dietary restrictions and allergies,” the resolution reads. 
The GUSA Senate plans to meet with the university to discuss reversing the meal plan policy and is hopeful for change, according to Flores.
“We hope to have a meeting scheduled this week or earlier next week because this is a crucial issue that needs to be solved immediately,” Flores said. “I would say I am pretty optimistic. This is something that occurred in the past and was solved fairly quickly. I honestly think that it can be resolved as quickly as an email being sent out to students.”
