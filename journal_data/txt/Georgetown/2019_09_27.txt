Stephen Semprevivo, who paid $400,000 to get his son admission to Georgetown University as a fake tennis recruit, was sentenced to four months in prison Sept. 26.
Semprevivo is the third parent to be sentenced this month in a Boston federal court and is among 15 parents who pleaded guilty for taking part in the college admissions bribery scandal. In addition to the four-month prison term, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani sentenced Semprevivo to two years of supervised release, 500 hours of community service and a $100,000 fine, according to the Department of Justice news release.
(Full disclosure: Semprevivo’s son, Adam Semprevivo, previously served as a cartoonist for The Hoya.)
In April 2016, Semprevivo, a California businessman, used a family trust to pay $400,000 to a charity run by William “Rick” Singer. Singer led the national college admissions scheme by using his company, Edge College & Career Network, as an intermediary between officials at prestigious universities and parents hoping to give their children an admissions advantage, according to court documents. 
The Department of Justice brought charges against 50 defendants in total. 
Semprevivo pleaded guilty in federal court in May 2019 to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.
Semprevivo’s actions are worthy of strong punishment despite his admission of guilt, according to a Sept. 19 memorandum filed in the U.S. Massachusetts District Court.
“Like the child who murders his parents and then pleads for mercy because he is an orphan, Semprevivo defrauded Georgetown, and then sought to hold Georgetown accountable (with damages) for not discovering his fraud,” assistant U.S. attorneys wrote in the memorandum. “Semprevivo wants credit for contrition and acceptance of responsibility, but he exhibits neither.”
Talwani also sentenced actress Felicity Huffman to two weeks in prison for her role in the scandal Sept. 13 and businessman Devin Sloane to four months in prison this Tuesday. Huffman was sentenced to two weeks in prison for paying Singer $15,000 to aid her daughter in cheating on standardized tests. Sloane had pleaded guilty to paying $250,000 for his son’s admission to the University of Southern California as a fake water polo player, according to court documents.
Georgetown dismissed two students in May 2019 following a review process. The university is also reviewing the records of former students who may be connected to the scandal, according to a university spokesperson.
“Each student case was addressed individually and each student was given multiple opportunities to respond and provide information to the University,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our review focused on whether students knowingly provided false information to the University during the admissions process.”
The university holds the right to dismiss current students or revoke degrees of former students if a review finds a violation of Georgetown’s policies, according to a university spokesperson.
“If the University finds that an individual submitted inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information to the University, or if they engaged in improper activity during the admissions process, the University can take action, up to and including rescission of admission and revoking the degree granted from the University,” the university spokesperson wrote.
In May 2019, Adam Semprevivo filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block his dismissal from the university, arguing that he was unaware of the steps his father took to gain his admission in 2015 and 2016. Semprevivo said he had been a student at Georgetown in good standing with a 3.18 GPA and accused the university of denying him due process. Semprevivo dropped his suit in July 2019, partially to focus on his academics moving forward. 
While Stephen Semprevivo was sentenced to four months in prison, prosecutors had sought 13 months in prison, as well as a year of supervised release, a $95,000 fine and a restitution payment to Georgetown of over $100,000 to cover the university’s legal fees, according to the DOJ press release. Semprevivo’s legal counsel asked Talwani for a sentence of probation and community service.
Semprevivo’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.
When authorities announced the college admissions scandal in March 2019, they charged former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst with racketeering conspiracy. Federal prosecutors alleged that Singer paid Ernst more than $2.7 million in bribes over several years in exchange for Ernst designating 12 applicants to Georgetown as tennis recruits. 
Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other crimes and is cooperating with federal investigators, while Ernst has pleaded not guilty. 
Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez were also implicated in the college admissions scam, having paid a fraudulent proctor to sit alongside each of their daughters as they took their college entrance exams, according to court documents. The parents also bribed Ernst to designate their older daughter, Isabelle Henriquez (COL ’20), as a tennis recruit, according to federal attorneys. The Henriquez parents chose not to enter a plea at an initial appearance in a Boston federal court in April.

Chronic understaffing at the Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Residence Hall Office has created conditions that have led to overworked staffers and violations of university rules. 
Many student employees worked more than 20 hours per week and worked shifts alone, which violates university rules, according to an email from RHO employees to administrators obtained by The Hoya. 
Julia Lo (MSB ’21) sent an email, signed by Arrupe RHO staff members, to university administrators Sept. 22 demanding a solution despite previously having expressed concerns to their direct supervisor. 
Arrupe RHO employees sent the message to Residential Services Coordinator Jessica Scibetti, Residential Education Executive Director Ed Gilhool, Director of Residential Services Bill Huff, Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs Stephanie Lynch, Assistant Director for Assignments Krista Haxton and the Student Employment Office. 
Currently, the Arrupe RHO has 12 staff members, making it the least-staffed RHO despite receiving the most packages.
“The past month’s package statistics have shown that we have received a total of 23,695 packages across campus with Arrupe RHO processing 6,355 while East Campus, Kennedy, New South, and VCW have received 3,599, 4,367, 4,200, and 5,173, respectively,” according to the students’ email. 
The email included complaints about excessive working hours, long lines of students waiting to receive packages and frustrations with Office of Residential Living administrators.
“It is quite demoralizing to arrive at work to a line of impatient customers who claim we work too slowly,” the students wrote. “The hours we are asked to work in order to have a semi-filled schedule are absolutely ridiculous and the way our concerns have been dismissed is unacceptable.” 
Lexi Tiemann (SFS ’21), Maya Hambrick (COL ’22), Caroline Hyer (SFS ’20), Gabriela Gura (COL ’21), Caroline Connor (COL ’20), Cassidy Pregil (COL ’20), Allan Navarro (SFS ’22), Arrey Salyards (NHS ’20), Alexis Stapleton (COL ’20), Claudia Canales (MSB ’22), Cassidy Palmer (COL ’21), Cailin Brady (COL ’20) and Lo signed the email. 
(Full disclosure: Navarro serves as co-senior editor of The Guide, The Hoya’s arts and culture section.)
Changes in hiring procedures and unexpected rejections of job offers caused delays in hiring new staff members, according to Huff. In spring 2019, Residential Living took on most of the responsibility of screening and selecting applicants. Previously, RHO managers led the hiring process. 
The updated procedures and consequently slower process led to the Arrupe RHO to begin the year with only 11 staff members and two managers, compared to the typical 18 to 22 staff members, according to Brady, the Arrupe RHO manager. Staff members and managers have separate responsibilities, and staff members assist with sorting and distributing students’ packages.
A 12th staff member began working at the Arrupe RHO this week, despite being hired at the beginning of the semester, according to Navarro. 
“This year there’s a new process going on with the hiring and different committees and how the applications are being evaluated,” Brady said. “The applications have been moving through the process much more slowly.”
The reduced workforce has forced more than half of the RHO staff members to work over 20 hours per week, interfering with employees’ responsibilities, and negatively impacted the RHO’s package processing efficiency, according to an Arrupe RHO employee who requested to remain anonymous for fear of employer retribution.
The SEO recommends that students not work more than 20 hours a week during the academic year. 
“I worked 23½ hours two weeks ago, and I just don’t have time for that. It’s getting to the point where Cailin [Brady, Arrupe RHO student manager] can’t keep putting people into the schedule because they have other jobs, they have papers, they have class,” the employee said in an interview with The Hoya. “Some people are single-staffed at the RHO and when you have like four carts, that’s 300 packages coming in and a line of students in from Darnall.”
When Huff received the students’ email, it was the first time he was contacted about any scheduling issues, he wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“While I was aware the Arrupe RHO team has several vacancies, I first heard from team members about the negative impact scheduling was having on their work experience via an email on Sep. 22,” Huff wrote. 
Employees began vocalizing complaints at the beginning of the academic year and reached out to Scibetti, according to Brady and the anonymous Arrupe RHO employee. Scibetti is the direct supervisor of RHO student employees. 
“I think we started directly tagging Jessica in our GroupMe like two or three weeks ago, like ‘When are we going to start getting more new hires, we have other things we need to be doing,’ and she was like, ‘We’re working on it. Bill is hiring people,’” the Arrupe RHO employee said. 
When contacted for comment, Scibetti referred inquiries to Huff. 
Huff met with the student who sent the original email, as well as one of the Arrupe RHO managers, the day he received the message, Huff wrote in an email to The Hoya. Huff also informed the RHO staff members that offers to fill the vacant positions in all RHOs were sent to applicants on Sept. 24. 
“They shared their experiences and I shared updates on current hiring process,” Huff wrote. “I offered to reach out to other RHO Assistants in Arrupe but the concerned team member who emailed me and the RHO Manager stated they would pass along the updates.” 
The staffing issues are not isolated to the Arrupe RHO, according to a Kennedy Hall RHO employee who requested to remain anonymous for fear of employer retribution.
“It’s something we’ve been dealing with across campus this semester,” the Kennedy RHO employee in an interview with The Hoya. “Arrupe just happens to be the hardest hit with it.”
The RHO is not the only campus office struggling with filling positions. A lack of university communication and inconsistent shift times this semester led to frequently unmanned student guard posts. 
Delayed RHO hiring could be caused in part by a new video application component, according to the Kennedy RHO employee. 
Students who applied to work in any RHO had to submit a video component as a part of the new hiring process, as opposed to holding face-to-face interviews, according to the RHO application. However, the application incorrectly stated that students should put their video as “unlisted” rather than “private” on YouTube. This error has since been corrected. Students who set their videos as unlisted, however, were at a hiring disadvantage when their videos were unviewable by the hiring committee. 
“The video portion represented 33% of the total score for each applicant, so those whose videos were unviewable were at a severe disadvantage,” the Kennedy RHO employee wrote in a message to The Hoya.
To the employees knowledge, candidates who used unlisted videos were not contacted to correct the error. 
All RHO managers have weekly meetings with Scibetti, their direct supervisor, according to the Kennedy RHO employee. Like staff in Arrupe, the Kennedy RHO employee conveyed their concerns without receiving immediate solutions. 
“It’s been one of those things they’ve said they’ve been dealing with and they haven’t been,” the Kennedy RHO employee said.

RHO employee says 
September 27, 2019 at 4:08 pm
The residential living department is the epitome of incompetence at Georgetown. Jessica scibetti does not care for the students or RHO staff whatsoever. She is rude, demeaning, and grossly incompetent. She ignores all logical concerns and suggestions and instead chooses to use bullshit procedures aimed at shifting the blame and responsibility onto the students and away from the residential living staff. She continuously tries to scare and shame student stuff into blind submission, rather than use logic and reason to create good procedures. Working as an RHO employee has been one of the worst experiences because of this.

During ongoing political turmoil in Hong Kong, continued public demonstrations are necessary to emphasize democratic values, activist Jeffrey Ngo said in an event Sept. 25.
The event, titled “History Before Your Eyes: Chronicling Hong Kong’s Summer of Discontent,” was part of the Asia in Depth Series hosted by the department of history. Ngo, a Hong Kong native and second year Ph.D. student in the department of history, discussed his own experience as a protester in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, introduced legislation in February that would allow the extradition of criminal suspects from Hong Kong to mainland China, which ignited large scale protests across the city as well as discourse about the topic on Georgetown’s campus. Lam has since withdrawn the bill, but protestors have issued broader demands for institutional reforms in Hong Kong, such as addressing police brutality and increasing democratic freedom. 
Hong Kong fell back under Chinese rule in 1997 after more than 150 years of British colonial rule, and currently functions under a “one country, two systems” policy that allows the region a significant level of autonomy. The extradition bill concerned Hong Kong citizens because of the Chinese government’s history of political encroachment in the region, according to Ngo. 
“Hong Kong’s autonomy being eroded by Chinese interference has been on the back of Hong Kongers’ minds for some time now, so when the extradition bill was proposed, Hong Kongers were worried,” Ngo said. 
After recognizing the ineffectiveness of peaceful protests, demonstrators turned to more drastic tactics, including throwing bricks and petrol bombs at police, Ngo said. Escalated tactics, adopted after Lam suspended the extradition bill without fully withdrawing it, have been more effective, according to Ngo. 
“For so long, the protests in Hong Kong have been known for being peaceful. Not a single piece of glass would be broken, nor would a car be burned,” Ngo said. “If you stick with peaceful protests, the government won’t listen. If you’re willing to take further steps, then that’s what is going to change the government’s mind.”
The 2019 Hong Kong protests were preceded by numerous pro-democracy demonstrations in earlier years. In 2014, a three month demonstration dubbed the “Umbrella Revolution” included thousands of civilians who clogged major roadways to protest a candidate pre-screening policy for the region’s 2017 chief executive election introduced by the Chinese government. 
Earlier this month, Ngo authored a series of back-and-forth chalk messages left in Red Square surrounding the Hong Kong protest. The messages helped bring awareness of the protests in Hong Kong to campus, according to Ngo. 
The lack of hierarchy in the organization of the Hong Kong demonstrations has also contributed to their effectiveness, Ngo said. 
“This is going to be a movement not based on hierarchies, but based on networks,” Ngo told the audience. “You can do whatever you want, and I’m not going to criticize you and vice versa because we can all pursue the same goal with different methods as long as we know what we have in mind and as long as we support each other in that way.”
On Wednesday, hours before Ngo spoke, the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees approved the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would impose sanctions on Chinese officials accused of debasing Hong Kong autonomy. Ngo collaborated with legislators on the bill. 
The original movement has evolved into a broader petition for structural reform in Hong Kong, Ngo said. 
“The movement has moved so far beyond just one person, hence no one calling for her resignation now, and is so much more than the extradition bill, hence no one really caring whether the bill is dropped now but about structural change in Hong Kong,” according to Ngo. 
Hong Kong citizens have a responsibility to shed light on the authoritarian practices of the Chinese government due to the region’s relative autonomy, Ngo said.
“Hong Kongers must use our relative freedom to other places that are under repression of the Chinese authorities to show the world what is happening,” Ngo said.

More than one in four North American birds have disappeared since 1970, signaling the development of potentially deeper ecological problems in the region, according to a new study co-authored by director of the Georgetown Environment Initiative Peter Marra.
The study, published in Science magazine on Sept. 19, tracked populations of more than 500 bird species across multiple ecosystems and found that there has been a decline of 2.9 billion breeding adult birds in North America in the last 49 years. 
The combination of citizen and professional scientists participating in bird-watching, in addition to more than 10 years of data from NEXRAD, a network of weather radars operated by the National Weather Service, paints a clear and bleak picture, according to Marra, who is also a professor in the McCourt School of Public Policy. 
“Just in the last 10 years, we are seeing this decline,” Marra said in an interview with The Hoya. “By incorporating all of these different types of data, it made us depressingly confident in the results.”
Birds are an indicator species, meaning they reflect the overall health of an ecosystem and can serve as a warning sign for larger ecological problems in the future, according to Marra.
“When something is going wrong with them, that means something below them in that complex food web is also going awry,” Marra said. “That means that there is something unraveling in the ecosystem.”
Marra’s research included one of the largest surveys of bird populations to date, as the analysis incorporated data from citizen scientists, professional surveys and weather radar to track migration patterns. The study was authored by Marra and researchers at seven North American institutions, including Cornell University, the American Bird Conservancy and the National Wildlife Research Centre.
Many co-authors of the study, including Marra, are advocating for the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act of 2019, a bill that allocates $1.4 billion for state and territory developed conservation strategies. The bill is sponsored by Rep. Deborah Dingell (D-Mich., SFS ’75, GRD ’98) and was introduced in the House of Representatives in July 2019.
“We need bold solutions that will put forward state-based conservation efforts and safeguard wildlife from further decline. RAWA is that bold solution,” Dingell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Supported by more than 100 Members of Congress, this bipartisan legislation will provide financial resources for state agencies so those in the field can do everything possible to protect species most at risk.”
Conservation requires infrastructure changes in addition to policy action, according to Michael Parr, president of the American Bird Conservancy and co-author of the study.
“Among other priorities, we’ve got to manage our public lands better for nature, restore laws that protect birds, and massively increase support for habitat conservation outside the U.S. to protect tropical forests where many of our birds winter,” Parr said in a Sept. 20 news release.
The most devastating finding in the study is the decline in common birds, which are integral to their ecosystems, according to Marra.
“We all made this commitment to keep common birds common. What this report says, unfortunately, is that it’s now the common birds that have declined the most,” Marra said. “These species have now declined significantly, suggesting that there are these broad-scale things that are eating away at the avifauna.”
While the study did not examine causality explicitly, it is important to consider the role of climate change in habitat destruction as a major factor in the population decline, according to Marra.
“Drying patterns in the Caribbean are totally changing when birds leave,” Marra said. “Birds that are migrating farther distances are leaving the wintering grounds in poorer condition, and there’s higher mortality on those birds.”
Marra noted the importance of conservation efforts in everyday life in supporting the bird population, emphasizing the potential for conservation on Georgetown University’s campus.
“We need to minimize these general threats that are impacting birds and other organisms,” Marra said. “Even in human-dominated landscapes like the Georgetown campus, making sure that we are doing things here that are environmentally friendly.”

After follow-up lead testing conducted by a third party consultant found elevated lead levels in three water sources in Georgetown University buildings, the university installed water filters in three White-Gravenor Hall sinks. 
After graduate students discovered concentrations of lead in multiple water sources earlier this month, the Office of Environmental Health & Safety contracted with an unspecified third party consultant to collect and test water samples in dozens of locations inside five campus buildings, according to university spokesperson Rachel Pugh. The university did not specify which buildings beyond White-Gravenor were tested. 
Three sinks on campus tested above detection limits, according to Pugh. The detection limit of lead designates the minimum measured concentration of a substance that can be confidently reported as distinguishable from blank results, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Following the discovery of these elevated levels, the university installed filters in one sink on the fourth floor and two sinks on the fifth floor of White-Gravenor, according to Pugh. Besides these sinks, other locations tested by EH&S yielded undetectable lead concentrations, Pugh said. 
“All other locations tested, including locations previously tested by graduate students, and all water fountains tested, showed levels that were below detection limits,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
EH&S will continue water testing in other buildings as appropriate, according to Pugh. 
Earlier this month three second year masters students, Julie Oh, Tianze Pan and Misti Persaud, conducted a lead study under the advisement of Professor YuYe Tong. The students are a part of Georgetown’s environmental metrology and policy program, which focuses on measurements science of environmental toxic chemicals resulting policymaking.
The graduate team tested water from 11 buildings on campus: White-Gravenor Hall, Lauinger Library, O’Donovan Hall, the New South Hall facilities office, Reiss Science Building, the Intercultural Center, Copley Hall, the Car Barn and Regents Hall. Around 75% of the water sources tested yielded lead counts below 1 parts per billion, which is below the EPA’s action level of 15 ppb. However, several of the water sources tested in the study, specifically water sources in Reiss, the New South facilities office and White-Gravenor, showed lead counts near the suggested EPA action level, and one tested above the action level. 
While water filters may or may not effectively control the lead quantity without further study, they would presumptively lower the concentration levels, according to Tong.  
“As to whether such filters are enough to reduce the concentration of lead and keep it at lower than the EPA’s action level, only a scientific measurement can tell,” he wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
In the original study, one sink on the fifth floor of White-Gravenor concluded a lead concentration of 18.02 ppb in sample one, a number above the 15 ppb action level, and 12.72 ppb in sample two. Elevated levels, but not levels that exceeded the action level set by the EPA, were also found within the Office of Planning and Facilities Management, located on the lower level of New South, with samples that yielded a lead concentration of 13.67 ppb. 
The university did not work directly with Tong, and he has not seen the results of the measurements taken by EH&S, Tong wrote in an email to The Hoya. However, the graduate student study did prompt EH&S’ follow up testing, according to Tong.
“I knew for a fact that the Office of Environmental Health and Safety was informed of Misti et al’s results (not by me) which led them to conduct some additional water quality measurements around the campus,” wrote Dr. Tong in an email to The Hoya.
To resolve the lead problem, the university should replace lead piping on campus and be transparent with students and faculty about the potential contamination, Persaud, one of the graduate students who worked on the original study, wrote in an email to The Hoya earlier this month. 
Despite the lead study’s findings, the original team will not proceed with more lead research this semester following the first study, according to Persaud. 
“As of now we are not concentrated on the lead study for this semester,” Persaud wrote in an email to The Hoya this week. “However we are hoping that in the future the program continues this study to evaluate water levels of buildings with high lead levels and/or test new buildings.”

Family members and supporters of Austin Tice (SFS ’02) led an advocacy campaign at the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 23 as a part of the new “Ask About Austin Tice” campaign launched this August. 
After completing his second year at Georgetown University Law Center, Tice was kidnapped in Syria in 2012 while traveling in the country to report on the escalating civil war between the Syrian government and rebel forces. 
Tice is believed to be a captive of an affiliate of the Syrian government. Five weeks after he was scheduled to return home, a video posted online titled “Austin Tice is Alive” showed Tice alive and surrounded by unidentified armed men, according to The Family of Austin Tice website. Tice is the only American journalist currently being held overseas, according to the National Press Club Journalism Institute, an international free press advocacy organization.
Increased public awareness of Tice’s situation would help encourage members of Congress to take action to secure Tice’s safe release and return, according to Julie Moos, executive director of the NPCJI. 
“When our elected representatives know that their communities care, it’s even more impactful,” Moos wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I hope every American will Ask About Austin until he’s safely home.”
The “Ask About Austin Tice” campaign was launched this past August on the seven-year anniversary of Tice’s disappearance. Last Monday, campaign volunteers visited every congressional office on Capitol Hill to ensure that members of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate are aware of Tice’s situation, according to the NPCJI website. 
Dean of the School of Foreign Service Joel Hellman encouraged students to attend the campaign visit to the Capitol and reiterated Georgetown University’s support of Tice and his family in a Sept. 19 email to SFS students. 
The university remains hopeful that Tice will return to Georgetown, Hellman wrote.
“Over the last seven years, Georgetown has stood with Austin’s family pressing for his release and return. Those efforts continue,” Hellman wrote. “We look forward to welcoming Austin back for his final year at Georgetown Law and celebrating his commitment to raising the world’s awareness of the human costs of war in the true spirit of SFS and Georgetown.”  
The #FreeAustinTice movement gained significant traction on Georgetown’s campus in recent years. In 2015, the movement featured a social media challenge for individuals to post pictures of themselves wearing blindfolds stating “Free Austin Tice” and challenging others to post the same message. 
In 2016, students and individuals associated with Reporters Without Borders, an international nonprofit organization that aims to protect journalists and that has been working with Tice’s family since September 2012, gathered outside the White House and walked around holding signs and wearing blindfolds that said “Free Austin Tice.”
Ann Oldenburg, assistant director of the journalism program at Georgetown, reiterated the need to continue to advocate and spread awareness of Tice and his situation.
“Every day that goes by without Austin coming home is heartbreaking.” Oldenburg wrote in an email to The Hoya, “It’s important that we all remain vigilant in helping the Tice family to maintain the awareness and importance of ensuring his safe return.”
Negotiations for Tice’s release reportedly took place in 2015 with an American diplomat, a Czech diplomat and the Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister in Damascus, Syria. However, State Department officials did not release information surrounding the negotiations at the time.
The Reporters Without Borders North America Bureau, a partner in the Ask About Austin campaign, was present at the Sept. 23 visit to the Capitol.
Tice’s situation is representative of how risky international journalism can be in today’s world, according to Dokhi Fassihian, the executive director of Reporters Without Borders North America Bureau.
“This is a dangerous time to be a journalist, both in the United States and abroad,” Fassihian wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our organization is more committed than ever before to ensure journalists can work safely and independently, and that those who attempt to silence them are held to account.”

The U.S. federal government will inevitably regulate social media companies, but the extent of this regulation is still up for debate, technology journalists, lawyers and a Facebook representative said at a panel event Sept. 23.  
The Georgetown University Free Speech Project hosted the event in Gaston Hall Monday. The Free Speech Project is a nonpartisan, independent initiative that assesses the condition of free speech in American education, civil society and government. The Knight First Amendment Foundation at Columbia University, which aims to defend freedom of speech and press through litigation, research and public education, co-sponsored the event. 
Social media companies are analogous to cities without effective regulation, which poses a problem for user safety, according to Kara Swisher (SFS ’84), a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times and founder of Recode, a technology-focused publication.
“Everybody thinks that these companies, that Twitter, is a public square or Facebook is a public square, or Reddit or any of these sites,” Swisher said. “The fact of the matter is that most of them are public squares owned by and to the benefit of billionaires so it is not a public square. So what we do is we extend them the rights of a public square, but they aren’t taking the responsibilities of a public square.” 
Katie Fallow, a senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, Sarah Jeong, the lead technology writer for The New York Times’ editorial board, Jeff Kosseff, an assistant professor of cyber security law in the U.S. Naval Academy’s cyber science department, and Lori Moylan, a member of Facebook’s external affairs team for public policy, also participated in the panel discussion. Free Speech Project Director Sanford Ungar, moderated the event. 
As the 2020 presidential campaign season ensues, Democratic candidates including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have called for the federal government to break up big technology companies. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also supports antitrust legislation because he feels that many big technology companies stifle conservative speech. 
Much of Monday’s panel discussion pivoted around the antitrust debate and whether Google, Facebook and Amazon should be regulated. 
Although every panelist agreed that the federal government will eventually regulate big technology companies through antitrust or privacy legislation, big technology’s acquisition of smaller companies can also be valuable, according to Moylan. When Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012, it catapulted the smaller social media company to an improved profit model and user experience. 
“When Facebook acquired Instagram, it literally didn’t have a business plan to monetize. It didn’t have spam filters,” Moylan said. “While yes, we are proud that it is an incredible, lucrative company that many, many, many people around the world enjoy, we feel that it is the synergies with Facebook and the systems that we’re able to incorporate into the app that has turned it into the success story that it is today.”
Alternatively, breaking up big technology companies would enable the smaller companies to explore new problem-solving routes, according to Swisher. 
“I think the point of antitrust from my particular side and the people I interview — and I interview a lot of people on this topic — is to break them up to allow more companies to thrive,” Swisher said. “The concept is if you break them up, you create much more innovation and so the day you pull, say you pull YouTube off of Google, maybe YouTube will go: ‘Maybe we should bill ourselves as a safe place for people to be.’” 
Looking ahead, citizens concerned about their privacy should contact their government representatives and express their anxieties because the time to enact privacy legislation might be limited, according to Jeong.
“I think that the moment for privacy legislation might be slipping away,” Jeong said. “But a lot of the stuff that we’re talking about derives from corrupt financial incentives that have really poisoned our democracy.”

Sarah Jeong is a huge anti-White racist.  Just Google her.
That Georgetown would bring her to talk in Gaston Hall shows how corrupt and left-wing and fake Georgetown’s Free Speech Project is.  
And they were silent on the GUCR disruptions and they certainly don’t want to protect Jack Wagner’s right to free speech.
Hypocrites.

The Woodstock Theological Library is commemorating the 150th anniversary of the founding of Woodstock College, the first Jesuit seminary in the United States, with an exhibit showcasing various artifacts of the college’s history and legacy. 
The exhibit will be housed in the Woodstock Theological Library, located in the lower level of Lauinger Library, until December, but there may be some exhibits on display in Wolfington Hall, according to Fr. Leon Hooper, S.J., director of the Woodstock Library. The exhibit will include historical documents, photos and theological publications.
The 150th-anniversary exhibit celebrates the Jesuits educated at Woodstock College, which became an important site for Catholic scholarship, according to Adrian Vaagenes, the Woodstock Theological Library’s archivist and librarian. Woodstock College was located in Woodstock, Md., about an hour north of Washington, D.C. 
The exhibit will celebrate the legacy of Woodstock College by displaying selected items from its rare book collection and the Woodstock archives related to the college’s history, according to Vaagenes.
“The aim is to honor the lives of those who called Woodstock College home, and to educate students on the history and influence of the college, an impact which continues to be felt today through the library and the scholarship it fosters,” Vaagenes wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Woodstock College, established in 1869, faced financial trouble and ceased operations in 1974. Its collections, because of their historical and cultural value, were transferred to the lower level of Lau and formed the foundation for the Woodstock Theological Library. Many of the collections were used and expanded by fellows of the Woodstock Theological Center.
The Woodstock Theological Center was a Jesuit-run research institution housed on Georgetown’s campus from 1975 to 2013. Over the several decades it was housed on campus, three priests credibly accused of sexual misconduct worked at Woodstock Theological Center and all three lived in the Woodstock Theological Residence, two blocks away from the university’s front gates.
Woodstock Theological Library, used by both Georgetown students and the Washington Theological Consortium, an organization of regional universities and interfaith institutions, is a valuable resource with a rich history, according to Vaagenes.
“Much of the collection was left intact, though its purposes and collections expanded, as a resource for Georgetown students and faculty, for other theological programs in the Central Atlantic region, and the fellows of the Woodstock Theological Center,” Vaagenes wrote.
Before Woodstock College’s formal closure, the school was the oldest Jesuit seminary in the United States, and its collections were considered invaluable, according to Vaagenes.
“The Library also became a repository for the many rare books and manuscripts that had been scattered throughout the Maryland and New York Provinces since the 17th century,” Vaaganes wrote. 
Jesuit leaders believed Georgetown’s location in D.C. and its relationship with neighboring institutions would allow the library to engage with public policy and religion and serve as a resource for theological scholarship. Today, Woodstock Theological Library maintains a strong relationship with the Washington Theological Consortium. 
“One of the major reasons to bring the collections down here [to D.C.], is to have a workable research collection belonging to the consortium,” Hooper said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The center developed in the lower level of Lau, adopting the name Woodstock Theological Library. The library is owned by the Maryland and New York provinces of the Jesuits and is a resource containing 190,000 circulating volumes, 700 periodicals and a reference collection, according to the library’s website. 
The legacy of the college continues through the resources offered at the current library, according to Vaagenes.
“When the college closed, a number of institutions (Yale, Fordham, and NY Stony Brook) vied for the collection due to its rare and research holdings, with Georgetown finally selected as the new location,” Vaagenes wrote. 
Woodstock College educated many notable theologians, such as John Courtney Murray and Gustave Weigel, and left a lasting legacy in the form of Woodstock Theological Library, according to Vaagenes.
“The library is honoring the 150th anniversary of Woodstock’s educating young Jesuits, and more generally, honoring Jesuit scholarship in America,” Vaagenes wrote. “The influence of Woodstock College continues to be felt today in the lives of its former students and in the scholarship it fostered.”

Gerard Mannion, 48, a Georgetown University theology and religious studies professor and senior research fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs died of a heart attack Sept. 21. 
Mannion taught at Georgetown as the Joseph and Winifred Amaturo Chair in Catholic Studies in the department of theology and religious studies and co-founded the university’s Global Irish Studies Initiative alongside fellow Georgetown professors Coilin Parsons and Irene Jillson. 
Mannion’s personable, engaging and hardworking personality made him an excellent teacher and peer, Parsons said. 
“I had no idea what a generous colleague he was and how much he was doing because hewas humble, soft-spoken, very self-deprecating and yet an absolute machine, incredibly generous to all of his colleagues,” Parsons said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
As the founding and network chair of the Ecclesiological Investigations International Research Network, Mannion organized an international on-campus conference in 2015 entitled: “Vatican II: Remembering the Future” which featured prominent Catholic cardinals and bishops, according to an email Provost Robert Groves sent to the Georgetown community Sept. 25. 
Parsons fondly remembers Mannion arranging conference planning meetings over dinner and drinks with coworkers. The intimate environment Mannion fostered allowed peers to get to know each other and share vibrant intellectual conversation, according to Parsons. 
“He was a great one for a party, I think everyone would agree with that, but it is also just a sign he is a confluent host and beyond generous, a great conversationalist, always willing to bring people into the conversation,” Parsons said. 
Mannion was the president of the International Network of Societies for Catholic Theology from 2017 to 2019. In this position, Mannion worked to keep the Catholic Church accountable, calling in 2015 for the institution to reform the Institute for the Works of Religion, commonly referred to as the Vatican Bank, according to a Berkley Center news release. In a 2018 TIME Magazine article, Mannion also criticized the actions of American bishops in the wake of the 2018 Pennsylvania grand jury report documenting clerical sexual abuse.
Mannion took the time to take interest in his coworkers’ personal lives and connect with them during gatherings, according to the Berkley Center’s Associate Director for Programs and Outreach Claudia Winkler (GRD ’13).
“He kind of made it a point to come and spend some more time with the staff just as people and was just always really jovial and friendly and personable and had personal conversations with people,” Winkler said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Mannion published books on ecclesiology, ethics, public theology and other fields of systematic theology and philosophy, and was a huge rugby fan in his free time, according to Parsons. Mannion was looking forward to watching Ireland play in this weekend’s Rugby World Cup, Parsons said. 
Immensely proud of his Irish heritage, Mannion’s Irish history and theology classes were always popular, according to Parsons and Jillson, who both guest lectured in one of Mannion’s classes. 
“The class was wildly oversubscribed,” Parsons said. “I met his students and I was so impressed with how engaged they were, not only with the material itself but with the scholarly and intellectual arguments about the materials. They were embedded in a conversation and that, for me, is the sign of the best kind of teaching.” 
Before coming to Georgetown in 2014, Mannion was the director of the Center for Catholic Thought and Culture and a theology professor at the University of San Diego, according to Groves’ email. He also worked at the University of Oxford, University of Leeds, University of Liverpool and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. He held a BA from King’s College Cambridge, followed by an MSt and a DPhil, British graduate degrees, from New College at Oxford.  
Although Mannion was a fundamental member of the Irish Global Studies Initiative, the organization will continue to educate students while honoring Mannion’s legacy, Jillson said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
“He would really want us to persevere so one of the things that we are going to do, Coilin and I, are going to continue discussions about how we commemorate his role in some very specific ways,” Jillson said. “It is really important that people know that Gerard played such a vital role — that is essentially an understatement — in the realization of this dream.” 
Hoya Staff Writer Myroslav Dobroshynskyi contributed to this reporting.

Whilst at Uni (Leeds) I suffered a nervous breakdown. I became terrified and paranoid of every person including my loved ones. My life shattered. I won’t go into the details but Dr Ged Mannion helped me start to fight back against what was felt like an unconquerable fear. Thank you Dr Mannion. I will always remember you.

Addressing the pervasive role of rape culture and toxic masculinity through facilitated dialogue is the best way to prevent sexual assault and violence, panelists agreed at a screening and discussion of the film “Roll Red Roll” on Sept. 26.
The event was hosted by the Georgetown University Gender+ Justice Initiative alongside Men Can Stop Rape, an organization that mobilizes men to create cultures free from violence against women. Following a screening of the film, Nancy Schwartzman, the documentary’s director and producer, was joined in conversation with Jeremy Hardy, training and technical assistant coordinator for Men Can Stop Rape and Karla Lozano Medina, advocate for healthy relationships and recent high school graduate.
“Roll Red Roll” tells the story of the high-profile sexual assault of a young woman at Steubenville High School in Ohio by members of the school’s football team. The film demonstrates the influence of rape culture on the reactions of students, parents and coaches in Steubenville to the case, as well as their subsequent treatment of the perpetrators and the victim.
The film takes a new approach to talking about rape culture and sexual assault that recenters the focus of the story on how a larger community is affected by a sexual assault case, according to Schwartzman.
“I wanted to explore the issue of sexual assault but make a film that really looked at perpetrators and bystanders. So often the narrative around rape hinges on the victim,” Schwartzman said. “If we want to shift the culture — which I do, and I’m sure people in this room want to — I think we need to look at rape culture in general.”
Men Can Stop Rape was founded in 1997 by a group of men who intended to reshape conversations about gender violence prevention to shift the responsibility away from women. The organization takes a public health approach to violence prevention in its workshops and programming, with a three-part framework focusing on public education, technical assistance training and development, Hardy said. 
Documentaries like “Roll Red Roll” can be constructive tools for promoting conversations about toxic masculinity, according to Hardy.
“A film like this, and all the great work that Nancy and her team have done, is contributing to the resources that we as an organization use, really, in changing social norms, which is our main goal,” Hardy said.
Georgetown’s inaugural 2016 Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey showed that 31% of female undergraduates reported experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact on campus. The university administered its most recent climate survey this year from Feb. 1 through March 15 and intends to release the results in fall 2019, according to the university website.
Sexual assault prevention organizations should work towards providing education to members of all communities in order to make progress, Hardy said.
“It really feels like it takes a certain kind of personality to choose to confront violence as a way of living,” Hardy said. “And yet, at the same time, I wish that we all had the skill set to that. It’s one of those things that we have to teach on an ongoing basis in order to really significantly decrease violence in any given community.”
Exposing and fighting taboos around rape culture is also key to preventing sexual assault, according to Schwartzman.
“When you show it writ large, as ugly as it is, it doesn’t have to be inevitable,” Schwartzman said. “We’re just learning now it doesn’t have to, we can change it and dismantle it.” 
Lozano Medina, who graduated from Calvin Coolidge High School in Northwest Washington, D.C., in spring 2019, is a sexual assault survivor and activist who has worked with groups including Break the Cycle, a group that works to educate young people about healthy relationships and abuse prevention, and Men Can Stop Rape.
Sharing stories of resilience can inspire and bring people together through common experiences and struggles, Lozano Medina said. 
“Being able to express my story and just see how people resonate with that, it gives me hope, and it gives me a reason to continue to do what I do,” Lozano Medina said. “I say this from the heart: as a survivor of sexual assault and a witness of domestic violence, no one should ever feel left out. It is in unity that we find our strength.”

The Council of the District of Columbia passed emergency legislation allowing public school students with medical marijuana licenses to be treated with the substance on campus grounds Sept. 17.
Twelve of the 13 Washington, D.C. councilmembers approved the Student Medical Marijuana Patient Fairness Emergency Amendment Act, with one remaining neutral and voting “present.” Unlike ordinary D.C. legislation, which requires congressional review, the bill will immediately go into effect because of its emergency status once it is signed by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), who has expressed her intent to sign it. 
The bill was introduced by Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) (LAW ’01) due to confusion over schools’ policies on medical marijuana. Because minors with conditions such as epilepsy can be effectively treated with marijuana, Grosso proposed the legislation to ensure students with such needs could feel safe in schools, according to The Washington Post.
Students in the D.C. medical marijuana program were being denied on-site medication at school because medical marijuana use had previously been limited by law to medical treatment facilities, according to Grosso. Different schools were unclear about the law, according to The Washington Post, and the legislation aims to eliminate the confusion. 
“That is the reason for this emergency legislation, which would clarify the law to allow students who are participating in the medical marijuana program to receive their medication at school,” Grosso said in his introductory statement Sept. 17.
D.C. Public Schools will comply with the legislation, according to DCPS Deputy Press Secretary Ashlynn Profit. 
“Students who qualify for medical marijuana can be administered medical marijuana from a health professional in a school health suite,” Profit wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Implementing procedures appropriately limiting medical marijuana exposure and protecting school communities is critical as the policy goes into effect, according to Profit. 
“A parent or guardian would have to go through proper protocols with a school to allow for administration to occur,” Profit wrote. “Protocols for protecting students, families, and staff from exposure must be in place so that the health, safety, or welfare of others is not adversely affected.”
The emergency legislation amended medical marijuana policies passed in 1998 and 2007 by mandating that medical marijuana is permissible to administer in schools for individuals whose ability to fully participate in school would be affected without treatment.
Bowser announced through a spokesperson her intention to sign the bill, which would take effect for 90 days before it must go through standard legislative procedure, according to WAMU.
The amendment authorizes schools to allow students to be treated with marijuana only in nonsmokable forms and it permits the federal government to influence schools to disallow medical marijuana on their campuses.
“A public school or charter school could cease to authorize the administration of medical marijuana on its campus if the federal government indicates that it will withhold federal funding from the District or the school if the school continues to authorize the administration of medical marijuana,” according to the bill.
As the possession of any marijuana is prohibited under federal law, the policy of the District — which legalized medical marijuana in 2011 and decriminalized recreational marijuana in 2014 — often conflicts with federal authority.
Despite the passing of the emergency legislation, Georgetown University confirmed it would not change the Code of Student Conduct because it receives federal funding, according to Director of Student Conduct Judy Johnson.
“As a recipient of federal grants and funding, Georgetown is subject to the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act,” Johnson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While the District of Columbia has changed marijuana laws in recent years, possession of marijuana, including marijuana, remains illegal under federal law.”
Georgetown continues to have a zero tolerance policy for marijuana on campus due to federal regulations. The university’s Code of Student Conduct stipulates that the “possession, use, manufacture, or distribution of marijuana, including medical marijuana, is prohibited.”

The Law School Admissions Test transitioned to a fully digital platform starting last Saturday, as part of an initiative to increase the exam’s security and accessibility.
From Sept. 21 and onward, every student taking the exam will use a LSAC-provided tablet. The transition is the biggest change in decades to the LSAT, the most widely taken law school admissions exam, according to a Sept. 12 news release by Kaplan Test Prep, a major provider of standardized test preparation services.  
The switch comes after a successful test run in July, when about half of the test takers took the exam on a tablet and half on paper, according to the news release. 
The switch to a digital platform will allow the Law School Admissions Council to administer more tests per year and return LSAT scores more quickly than they were able to with the previous pencil and paper version of the exam, according to LSAT instructor and Senior Manager for Instructional Design at Kaplan Glen Stohr. There will be nine or more exams per year with the digital exam, compared to the previous four times per year. 
The increased availability of the test could contribute to an increase in law school applications this season, Stohr said. 
“I think the additional number of [exam dates] makes it easier for students to take the test and makes it easier for any student to find the right time to take the test,” Stohr said in an interview with The Hoya. “That might make for a few more people sending in applications.”
Students took the LSAT on Saturday using tablets with features including an onscreen timer, software to flag questions and single-click answer selection, Law School Admissions Council Senior Vice President of Technology Products, Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer Troy Lowry wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The helpful new features made aspects of testing easier than the paper version, according to Jacob Maiman-Stadtmauer (COL ’20), who took the digital exam on Saturday.
“It allows you to constantly be aware of how much time you have left,” Maiman-Stadtmauer said. “Also it’s nice to not have to worry about mis-bubbling.” 
On the paper and pencil LSAT, test takers could circle or cross out answers in the test booklet, but they did not get credit for an answer unless the answer was accurately bubbled on the answer grid. Users of the digital interface only have to click on the correct answer. 
The LSAT is the last of the graduate level standardized tests to transition to a digital platform. Unlike other graduate exams like the GRE and Medical College Admission Test, however, the LSAT did not make any changes to the content of the exam when transitioning to digital, according to Peterson’s, an educational services company. 
The LSAT’s later transition allowed the test designers time to focus more on implementing measures to prevent cheating, Lowry wrote. 
“For the past several years, we’ve been evaluating various pathways to deliver the LSAT digitally, with the goal of increasing security, accessibility and the student experience. Most standardized tests have already switched to computer delivery, but the existing methods for ensuring the security and integrity of our test weren’t up to our standards,” Lowry wrote. “That’s why we patented a new system for delivering the LSAT digitally, through the use of tablets.”
The new exam platform increased security, so it will be harder for test takers to bring questions from a tablet out of the exam room than with the paper format of the exam, according to Stohr.
In March, the U.S. Department of Justice brought charges against 50 defendants in the largest indictment concerning fraud in the college application process. Among the individuals indicted, including four parents of Georgetown University students, were parents who paid a fraudulent test proctor to supervise the SAT, according to the charges.
Ensuring the fairness and integrity of the LSAT is especially important after the recent college admissions scandal, according to Lowry.
“The recent scandal involving college admissions is a good reminder that our continued vigilance around the security and integrity of the test is very important,” Lowry wrote.

Georgetown University students and campus sustainability organizations joined thousands of young activists protesting the effects of climate change in the Washington, D.C. iteration of the first ever Global Climate Strike last Friday, Sept. 20.  
The D.C. Global Climate Strike included protests outside the Capitol building, with protestors holding signs to bring attention to the severity of the climate crisis. Around 50 Georgetown students attended the strike on Friday, according to Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network’s Environmental Justice Team co-leader Lucy Chatfield (COL ’22). GREEN and GU Fossil Free advertised the event to the Georgetown community by collaborating to create posters for the rally prior to the event.
Mass demonstrations such as the Global Climate Strikes help show how millions of people are passionate about addressing climate change, according to Chatfield. 
“The climate crisis is so daunting, and it’s so easy to feel, as an individual, that there’s nothing you can do about it,” Chatfield wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Participating in mass mobilizations like these is how I stay optimistic, because I know there are millions of others fighting alongside me.”
Given the long-lasting impacts of climate change, attending the strike helped emphasize how much advocacy and action is needed to properly address the climate crisis, according to GUFF core member Juliette Leader (SFS ’20). (Full disclosure: Leader is a former member of The Hoya’s editorial board).
“Climate change is an issue that will be irrevocably intertwined with our lives for decades to come and will touch on every aspect of our lives,” Leader wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It was a reinvigorating experience that reminded me of how justified we are in demanding climate action now and how important our work is.”
The Global Climate Strike occurred in the midst of the Climate Forum 2020 hosted at Georgetown featuring 12 presidential candidates on Sept. 19 and 20. The two-day forum provided candidates with the opportunity to hear student concerns about the climate crisis while proposing their own climate change policies. 
Both the Climate Forum 2020 event and the Global Climate Strike brought awareness and urgency to the climate crisis, according to Citizens’ Climate Lobby President Laura Rockefeller (SFS ’22).
“The forum and the protests are both so important in making climate a visible, visceral issue,” Rockefeller wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Global Climate Strike included participants, largely students and other young people, in more than 150 countries who protested to demand more governmental action on the climate crisis. The strike on Friday was the first of many protests happening throughout this week in light of the United Nations Climate Action Summit meeting in New York City on Sept. 23. 
The D.C. Global Climate Strike included multiple youth speakers highlighting their concerns with the climate crisis. Hearing young voices talk about the negative consequences of climate change on their futures resonated with Georgetown students, according to GREEN’s Environmental Justice Team member Grace Katz (COL ’23). 
“My favorite part was when they had the speakers,” Katz said. “They had one little boy who was a part of the movement suing the government for the air quality in their city, and this 12-year-old boy spoke about how he wants to have a future and that really hit me hard.”
As a part of the series of climate change protests this week, demonstrators in the Capitol Hill area of the District blocked traffic on Sept. 24, shutting down several road intersections as a part of the “Shut Down D.C.” initiative. The event led to the police arresting 26 protesters, according to The Washington Post.
The attention that large protests like the Global Climate Strikes draw highlight the younger generation’s responsibility to bring awareness to resolving urgent climate change problems, strike attendee Trey Di Bona (SFS ’23) said.
“I hope it convinces people of the immediacy of the problem,” Di Bona said. “It’s something we’ve been putting off for half a century now, and it’s not something we can put off any longer, and I think it sends a pretty strong message that it’s our generation’s duty to fix it.”

The markers used to make those posters, the ubers and buses used to go to the protest, and the litter left behind by these marchers was egregious and shameful—it would have been more beneficial to the planet if they had stayed home the entire day.
Those signs should be written in Mandarin, Hindi, and Turkish because India, China, and Turkey are emitting increasingly compared to the United States where cities like D.C., N.Y.C, S.F. and Philly (which are population centers) are banning plastic straws (DC), Styrofoam (NYC), plastic bottles (SF) and plastic single use bags (Philly) on top of instituting congestion pricing.

Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service’s GU Votes initiative held its fourth annual “Storm the Dorms” voter registration drive on National Voter Registration Day, Sept. 24. 
For seven hours, 50 volunteers staffed tables in the four first-year residential communities and the Leavey Center registering students to vote. GU Votes Ambassador Andrew Straky (COL ’20) estimates that hundreds of students registered to vote. 
The registration drive helps students be proactive about voter registration for local elections this year, as well as primaries in early 2020, according to Straky. Students interested in voting in primaries in their home state will need to request absentee ballots sooner than they might realize, he said.
“There are state elections in five states, but I think most people are looking ahead toward the primaries,” he said. “Those are going to come up quicker than people think, so we’re trying to get the first step done right away.”
Motivating students to register in a year without a national election is more challenging, but crucial to GU Votes’ mission, Straky said.
“It’s small little quirks that either intentionally or unintentionally create huge barriers for students to vote, so you want to get people thinking about it as early as possible,” he said. 
GU Votes’ cause resonated in a bipartisan manner with members of Georgetown University College Democrats, Georgetown University College Republicans and other nonpolitical campus organizations volunteering to register their peers to vote. 
“Storm the Dorms” is important because it helps students participate in politics, according to GUCD Chair Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21).
“Even though it is 2019 and not a major election year, this is an essential and ongoing project,” Hollister wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We need to make sure that even while not at home, every college student has the opportunity to have their voice heard.” 
Voter registration is essential for fair and democratic elections, said GUCR President Hayley Grande (COL ’21). 
“We believe that voting is integral to the strength of American democracy,” Grande wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s especially important that Georgetown students are registered to have a voice in government.”
Before the first “Storm the Dorms” event in 2016, GU Votes worked with the Office of Residential Living on an exemption to a ban on tabling in residential communities. Georgetown University’s Speech and Expression Policy ordinarily prohibits tabling in residential communities due to concerns about noise and ease of access.
Making this exception for voter registration helps GU Votes reach first-year students, who are most likely to be unregistered to vote, according to Straky.
“We have a new class of first-year students every year, and obviously they just turned 18 for the most part and are the least likely to be registered to vote,” Straky said. “So we’re trying to capture these students non-stop, so that’s why we strategically choose to table directly in the first-year communities.”
This strategy paid off in the case of Aaron Greenstein (SFS ’23), who came across a GU Votes table in Darnall Hall and decided to register. 
“I was walking to my room and there was a table outside in the hallway, asking if I had registered to vote,” Greenstein said in a conversation with The Hoya. “I wanted to vote but I didn’t know I had to register. I thought it was very helpful having that set up.” 
Students like Greenstein registered through GU Votes’ online voter portal, bit.ly/guvotes, which Straky called a “one stop shop for voting at Georgetown.” 
“You can register to vote, you can check your voter registration status, you can request an absentee ballot, you’ll even be able to see who’s on your ballot once we get close enough to the elections,” Straky said. 
Since some states do not have online voter registration programs, the majority of students will need to mail in a voter registration form to their hometown. GU Votes’ voter drop box program allows students to easily mail in their registration forms or absentee ballot requests by providing prestamped envelopes at numerous locations around campus, including The Midnight Mug, Uncommon Grounds and The Hilltoss. The drop box program launched Sept. 24, 2018. 
These voter drop boxes will be available until Oct. 24, but there is a permanent one in the GU Politics Office in the basement of Healy Hall, according to Straky. GU Votes is planning different ways to eliminate obstacles to student voting, and new programs are currently underway, he said.
The university is very supportive of institutionalizing voter engagement overall,” Straky said, “We’re working on a few projects to make it even easier for students to have access to voter registration and access to ballot requests.”

In 2017, Visa offered tens of thousands of dollars in assistance to any business willing to partake in its Cashless Challenge and begin refusing to accept cash. This initiative fit broadly into the company’s vision of a Cashless World. As credit card companies, tech moguls, small businesses and even the entire country of Sweden move toward this proclaimed hyperefficient future without cash, some have begun to question just how inclusive this cashless world really is and what its effects on disadvantaged communities in Washington, D.C., will be.
As more businesses begin refusing cash transactions, residents of D.C. find themselves unable to purchase goods from many local shops. Over the last two years, many businesses throughout Georgetown and the District have transitioned entirely to cashless practices, including Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly referred to as The Corp. Other retailers like Sweetgreen, Barcelona Wine Bar, South Block’s Georgetown location, Surfside in Dupont Circle and Menchie’s on U Street have also cut out cash.  
Despite lowering costs for small- and medium-sized businesses, however, operating with exclusively cashless transactions disproportionately disadvantages low-income families, people of color and immigrants without documentation. These historically marginalized groups nationwide go without bank accounts at higher rates, leaving them unable to participate fully in an increasingly cashless economy. 
As a result, city and state legislatures, local activists and even the executive branch of the Georgetown University Student Association have begun to push back against the increasingly common cashless practice to ensure all customers are able to live sustainably, regardless of their access to bank accounts. 
Increasing Inaccessibility 
Critics from across the District have found cashless processes to be discriminatory to low-income individuals and families without access to a credit card. More establishments have begun turning away customers without forms of credit in the District, but students at Georgetown have also felt the effects of these practices on campus. 
The Corp adopted a cashless model Feb. 1, 2018. Though The Corp’s storefronts still accept Flex dollars, Students without either a credit or debit card or a meal plan may find themselves unable to purchase from any of The Corp’s seven on-campus storefronts.
As a result, cashless practices make life more difficult for students without credit cards, according to GUSA President Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20).
“It is an elitist practice that prevents a lot of students, especially low-income students, from living properly on campus by making basic life necessities such as food or cleaning supplies inaccessible,” Francis wrote. “Cashless is classist, plain and simple.”
Cashless businesses should return to accepting cash for the sake of students who cannot or prefer not to use credit cards, Francis wrote on behalf of the GUSA executive. 
“Not accepting cash is a direct attack on low income consumers, and we hope cashless businesses reconsider that business practice,” Francis wrote. 
Cashless practices not only disproportionately affect low-income students, but also present new obstacles for students without documentation. Certain providers of financial services may be reluctant to serve those without social security numbers, and compounded with difficulties of obtaining government approved IDs, many immigrants without documentation in the United States operate without credit cards. 
In the face of these difficulties, the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access’s Undocumented Student Services has identified steps that could enable immigrants without documentation to adjust the changing commercial landscape, according to Arelis Palacios, associate director for Undocumented Student Services for the CMEA.
“Some undocumented students and families may not be eligible for bank accounts in certain states,” Palacios wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But we have located a few local/national bank branches that provide these crucial services to undocumented communities.”
A Legislative Pushback
To address public concern surrounding the growth of cashless retailers, many states and cities are seeking legislative solutions. 
Just this year, Gov. Phil Murphy (D-N.J.) signed the state’s cashless prohibition into law March 18, and Mayor James Kenney (D-Pa.) signed the city’s bill Feb. 27 — only a few among the growing list of places to require brick-and-mortar storefronts to accept cash. Massachusetts has even had a cashless ban on the books since 1978.
Two separate bills that would ban cashless retailers have also been introduced in the House of Representatives, both of which still await hearing. New York City and Connecticut also have cashless bans that await approval from local legislatures. 
As action against cashless practices picks up nationwide, Washington, D.C. Councilmember David Grosso is attempting to finish an effort he started in early 2018. Grosso introduced the Cashless Retailers Prohibition Act of 2019 in February as a follow up to his earlier attempt, the Cashless Retailers Prohibition Act of 2018. 
The act expands on its predecessor to prohibit all retailers, not just those retailers selling food, from discriminating against cash by refusing to accept cash as a form of payment, posting signage that claims cash will not be accepted and charging customers different prices depending on their payment method.
Going cashless disproportionately affects younger and low-income consumers because they are less likely to have the means to pay without cash, as well as customers that use cash for accounting and safety purposes, according to Grosso.
“By denying patrons the ability to use cash as a form of payment, businesses are effectively telling lower-income and young patrons that they are not welcome,” Grosso said in a press release. “Through this bill, we can ensure that all DC residents and visitors can continue to patronize the businesses they choose, while avoiding the potential embarrassment of being denied service simply because they lack a credit card.” 
Residents of the District have either no access to bank accounts or significantly limited access to financial services at higher rates than the national average. Of all households in the District, 29.4% had significantly limited access and 8% had no access, according to a 2017 survey from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
In total, over one-third of the Washington, D.C. population have either limited or no access to a bank account and depend on cash transactions, signifying that nearly 40% of D.C. still depend heavily on cash transactions.
Despite the large portion of District residents who rely on cash, Grosso’s bill has been sitting in committee since its introduction in February. Grosso’s previous bill also sat in committee awaiting hearing for over 10 months until the end of the legislative period, causing it to fail. 
Gross was unavailable for comment at the time of print.
Though its passage remains uncertain, Francis praised Grosso’s bill, saying it would be beneficial for the Georgetown community.
“If all businesses accepted cash, that would be ideal and it should be the standard,” Francis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Future for Cashless Businesses 
Despite the obstacles cashless businesses can present to students at Georgetown or consumers in the District, the practice has grown more common because it can help small businesses stay afloat. 
Small- and medium-sized businesses nationwide previously have reported paying billions of dollars each year in costs associated with transporting and handling cash, according to a study from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Cashless models eliminate the need to physically transport money to and from the bank and the need to pay employees to count balances through the day.
South Block’s Georgetown location accepted cash as a payment method until 2018. However, as the business opened more storefronts, fewer customers paid in cash, according to founder and CEO Amir Mostafavi. Cash sales plummeted from 40% of all sales in 2011 to 6% before the decision to become cashless.
Cashless transactions have also diminished the likelihood that businesses like South Block will experience robberies, given the reduced amount of cash held in storefronts each day. This factor was a major consideration when the business went cashless, according to Mostafavi.
“We also felt that carrying cash and the safety risks around it were no longer justified due to low cash transactions,” Mostafavi wrote in an email to the Hoya. 
The Corp began refusing cash transactions to minimize costs associated with accepting cash, according to CEO and President Seo Young Lee (COL ’21).  
Cashless businesses have different plans for handling legislation barring the practice. South Block will not be engaging in any political activity to oppose the bill, according to Mostafavi.
“We always adhere to any requirements that the state, city, county has on businesses, so we will monitor and make adjustments if need be,” Mostafavi wrote.
Corp leadership knows about Grosso’s legislation and the discriminatory implications of refusing to accept cash, but plans to continue its current practices, according to Lee.
“We are cognizant of the limitations to accessibility that our current payment methods pose,” Lee wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “Regardless of the Cashless Retailers Prohibition Act, The Corp’s ability to serve any and all customers on campus is at the forefront of our planning, and it will continue to remain as a priority in our considerations until all limitations are resolved.”
Businesses like Amazon and Sweetgreen, however, in response to the growing backlash against cashless businesses, have reversed course and begun accepting cash again at certain brick-and-mortar stores, preempting legal requirements.
Francis has been in contact with high-ranking members of The Corp on whether its cashless practices fulfill its mission.
“The Corp has a history of working to provide scholarships and many other philanthropic endeavors to the Georgetown community,” Francis wrote. “We are curious to see what the future holds and we hope the Corp continues to be open to moving towards accepting cash again.”

GoCard User says

This article states that the only way to put money on a GoCard is via a bank account. I’d like to remind readers that the university has machines across campus to load cash into GoCard (one on the 3rd floor of Lauinger library and another in the Leavy Center) – might advertising these more aggressively and encouraging the university to add some more locations mitigate many of the cash issues, at least on the student side?
