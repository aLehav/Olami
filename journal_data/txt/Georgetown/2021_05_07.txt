Georgetown University’s decision to deny tenure to a professor has raised community concerns about alleged procedural failures within the tenure review process and discrimination within the department. 
Mubbashir Rizvi, a Muslim assistant professor from Pakistan who has worked in the department of anthropology since 2013, received notice from the university in August 2020 that he would not be offered a tenured position. Following months of appeals and third-party mediation with the university, Rizvi and Georgetown community members are speaking out against the university’s decision.
The university’s denial of Rizvi’s tenure application means he will no longer teach at Georgetown when his terminal-year contract expires at the end of the spring 2021 semester. In his last semester at Georgetown, students have launched a campuswide petition calling for an appeal of the decision, alleging university administrators and faculty in the anthropology department perpetuated discriminatory practices and committed administrative failures throughout the tenure decision process. As of May 6, 2021, over 700 community members and various faculty members have signed on in support.
While many of the concerns raised by the Georgetown community have focused on alleged administrative failures during Rizvi’s tenure review, documents obtained by The Hoya revealed instances of alleged discrimination toward Rizvi from fellow department members. 
Inconsistencies in the Tenure Process
Rizvi joined the anthropology department in 2013 and regularly taught classes on South Asian anthropology. While at the university, his scholarship focused on environmental justice, peasant land rights and postcolonial militarization. In May 2019, just as he began the tenure application process, Rizvi published a book exploring social justice and land rights in Pakistan. 
During the tenure review process, a professor’s qualifications are judged by various internal and external review boards. The professor also collects letters of recommendation, as well as examples of research and academic scholarship, which are compiled with the recommendations of the tenure review boards to create a dossier presented to the University Committee on Rank and Tenure. The UCRT is staffed by a group of tenured professors across various disciplines.
In order to achieve tenure, professors are required to meet specific criteria, including high-quality teaching ratings by both professors and students, scholarly accomplishments and service to both one’s field of study and the university, according to the faculty handbook. Based on the recommendation of the UCRT, the provost and university president ultimately make a decision regarding the professor’s tenure status. 
One of Rizvi’s external reviewers, Thomas Hansen, a professor of anthropology at Stanford University, said he wrote to Georgetown to recommend Rizvi for tenure in spring 2019 in an interview with The Hoya. According to Hansen, Rizvi’s number of publications, as well as the quality and future trajectory of his scholarship, met the general standard for tenure within the field of anthropology. 
In November 2019, professor Denise Brennan, chair of the department of anthropology, informed Rizvi that the department tenure review board had voted not to recommend his application, worsening his prospects of receiving tenure. 
Brennan cited concerns about his academic work and teaching history, according to her official decision letter to Rizvi obtained by The Hoya. 
“The weaknesses of the dossier are the number of publications, the lack of competitive grants awarded, teaching record, and the trajectory of future publications,” Brennan wrote in a letter to Rizvi.
When contacted for comment, Brennan directed The Hoya to a university spokesperson.
Despite Brennan’s reasoning in the document, Rizvi earned positive peer performance reviews and student evaluations over the course of his time at Georgetown, according to Georgetown’s course evaluation website.
Since Rizvi began teaching, the anthropology department completed three peer evaluations of Rizvi’s teaching: one during the spring 2014 semester, one during the fall 2014 semester and one during the spring 2018 semester, according to review documents obtained by The Hoya. None of the evaluations raised specific concerns over Rizvi’s teaching performance.
In the 2018 peer review of Rizvi’s class, professor of anthropology and interim professor Gwendolyn Mikell, who was on Rizvi’s tenure committee, praised Rizvi’s abilities as a professor, according to the review document obtained by The Hoya.
“Professor Rizvi demonstrated his excellence as a teacher because he patiently allowed (required) students to present their ideas and assessments, provided careful course correction if they go in the wrong direction, and used humor and visuals to help students completely engage the issues. I enjoyed the class,” Mikell wrote in her evaluation.
Mikell did not respond to The Hoya’s multiple requests for comment.
Rizvi did not receive a peer evaluation during his final year of teaching, which he felt disadvantaged his application for tenure, he said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Rizvi was formally denied tenure Aug. 19, 2020, according to a letter from Provost Robert Groves to Rizvi obtained by The Hoya. Groves cited specific concerns over Rizvi’s teaching performance and research trajectory as reasoning for the denial of tenure.
It came as a shock to hear the university denied Rizvi for tenure, according to Hansen. 
“I heard about the tenure denial in August, and I was surprised to hear that because I thought that his file, as I reviewed it, was quite strong,” Hansen said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
After the university formally denied his tenure, Rizvi sent follow-up appeal emails to university administrators and deans, according to emails obtained by The Hoya. When the university did not take action to address his concerns of procedural failures, Rizvi said he turned to third-party mediation with the university through the Washington, D.C. Office of Human Rights, an independent organization that seeks to combat discrimination by enforcing local and federal human rights laws. During the process, Georgetown hired outside counsel, who would not commit to reviewing Rizvi’s tenure case or reinstating Rizvi as a professor, according to Rizvi. 
The university cannot comment on the specifics of individual tenure cases, though there are policies set forth to ensure each application is reviewed equitably, according to a university spokesperson.
“Every tenure case, including Dr. Rizvi’s tenure application, receives the most careful attention and deep consideration,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While Georgetown does not comment on individual tenure applications, the University has a thorough process for review of tenure applications which is set forth in the Faculty Handbook.”
For Ananya Chakravarti, an associate professor in Georgetown’s department of history who specializes in early modern South Asia, the university’s denial of Rizvi’s tenure is a step backward for academics at the college.
“This is my area of regional expertise. I know how much we’re shooting ourselves in the foot in terms of losing a really outstanding young scholar in the larger field of South Asia,” Chakravarti said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “He’s deeply respected among the larger South Asian research community, especially among anthropologists.” 
Rizvi’s removal will widen an already prominent gap in Georgetown’s academic coverage of South Asia, according to Chakravarti.
“Right from the beginning, my mind from an institutional point of view, this feels like we’re shooting ourselves in the foot, and we’re doing it in a field we’ve traditionally not had much expertise in,” Chakravarti said.
Alleged Instances of Discrimination
In addition to the administrative failures and inconsistencies during his tenure review process, Rizvi also characterized his experience in the anthropology department as discriminatory and hostile.
When asked if he had experienced a repeated pattern of disrimination within the anthropology department, Rizvi responded, “Absolutely.”
Rizvi pointed to anecdotes illustrating this allegedly discriminatory environment, including requests to teach a class outside his area of expertise and requiring him to change a course title. 
Mikell requested Rizvi teach a course during the fall 2019 semester on the anthropology of terrorism despite his academic focus on Muslim diaspora communities. In an interview with The Hoya, Rizvi said he felt Mikell was conflating his knowledge of Muslim communities with knowledge of terrorism. Ultimately, Rizvi did not teach the course.
Rizvi also alleged that department chair Denise Brennan required Rizvi to change the title of his spring 2019 course, “Race, Empire, and Muslims in the West,” to “Race and Empire,” because of concerns within the anthropology department that the department would appear Muslim-centric. Records of course offerings from the anthropology department reveal the course name was changed.
“So this is the kind of gaslighting that’s been going on for a while. I’ve been just waiting for my turn to have a bit of autonomy when I’m tenured to do what I want,” Rizvi said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
According to Rizvi, he was the first person of color hired directly into the anthropology department. Other faculty members of color transferred into the department after initially being hired into different positions, he said. The Hoya could not independently verify these claims. 
The university has failed to adequately create a diverse scholarly environment, according to Rizvi. 
“This is the problem. The diversity of opinion, the diversity of offering, diversity as a word has to be not just our pigmentation but also has to be our ability to be able to bring different approaches and topics,” Rizvi said. “Which obviously comes from what our backgrounds are.” 
The university is committed to maintaining an inclusive environment, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Georgetown is committed to being an inclusive campus that welcomes people of all faiths, races, ethnicities, sexualities, gender identities, abilities and backgrounds and we do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct in violation of university policies,” a university spokesperson wrote.
Rizvi brought an important perspective on South Asian anthropology to his department, according to anthropologist and professor in the department of Spanish and Portuguese Joanne Rappaport.
“As an Asian-American faculty member from a working-class background he brings a very much needed diversity to Anthropology and the humanistic social sciences at Georgetown,” Rappaport wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown community members have long advocated for greater Asian American and Pacific Islander representation at Georgetown. In 2019, students founded the “Georgetown Doesn’t Teach Me” campaign to call for greater Asian American representation in the university’s course offerings. Students have also called for the creation of an Asian American studies program. Recently, following the spike in racist, anti-Asian hate crimes amid the COVID-19 pandemic, community members have advocated for increased university support for the AAPI community.
For Chakravarti, Rizvi’s removal represents a step backward in the fight for increased South Asian representation in Georgetown’s academics.
“We’re quite lucky to have a scholar like Professor Rizvi at Georgetown because it’s not a school that has a traditional strength in South Asia,” Chakravarti said. “It could be a school with really great representation in terms of what the study of South Asia means, and we could become an important hub, but this decision feels like a massive step backwards for all of us who care about the study of South Asia on campus.”
Georgetown must do better to support faculty of color, according to Rizvi.
“I would like Georgetown University to really practice what they have been saying in terms of looking at racial justice, looking at fairness, looking at objective records and not biased assessments,” Rizvi said.

He’s produced more research as an assistant professor than his department’s present chair did at the same rank. 
You’d know that if you’d bothered to look that up.

Everyone wants to claim discrimination now instead of realizing they didn’t produce. His reviews would have indicated issues in his application which we can’t read. Each generation of assistant professors have higher requirements than those who came before.

I feel the mention of him being Muslim could’ve waited numerous paragraphs later. His experience speaks more than his ethnicity, religion, or nationality. As a POC, I understand gaslighting has many forms but the most unusual thing about all of this is the fact that he’s the anthro department’s first POC to be hired. Kinda alarming 😳

Ahhh.  Georgetown, officially a Catholic, Jesuit university that now is so woke it teaches anything but official Catholic Doctrine… Even after reading this article I fail to see any discrimination, and only disappointment and using the old ‘they must hate me because….’ card that’s used as a political tactic every election year..

Anthropology is about quality not quantity- the impact of his research is measured by book reviews, the quality of his articles it’s not about quick run of the mill citations- his book has been adopted by R1 Universities around the world and that is the main impact – this is not a popularity contest or technnology patent learn to tell the difference between disciplines

This is yet another example of the racist (including intersectionally racist) double-standard in academia. Colonialism is alive and well in the academy: knowledge is a territory that white people keep wanting to plunder and keep. Brilliant Black academics doing the work (and overachieving in comparison to their white counterparts) are “welcomed” into institutions to serve the institution’s own narcissism: to prove the veneer of its diversity practices to onlookers and outsiders; as a visible insurance policy against accusations of discrimination – whilst behind the scenes, those diversity practices constitute empty, dead promises. And lo, when those brilliant Black academics challenge the monoculturalism, contest the double standard, overachieve yet further in a pre-emptive move to ensure they do pass go when approaching white gatekeepers’ hurdles – they’re labelled lacking, “difficult” and “uppity”; there’s a desperate attempt by the white academic colonialists to counterattack by weaponising a fictional deficit model critique of the individual or group. “Give me the confidence of a mediocre white man”: academia is teeming with white mediocrity masquerading as authority.

It looks to me like his book is a reworked version of his dissertation from 7 years prior.  Negligible peer reviewed journal articles.  
I’ve seen this before: a book project stretched out for years and used for tenure without much research beyond it.
I had substantially more published and in top outlets when I went up for tenure almost two decades ago.
Research-wise, I can see denying him tenure at Georgetown.

Concerned Academic says 
May 11, 2021 at 3:28 pm
It is completely normal that the published book for the tenure review is based on one’s dissertation research. Stanford UP is an excellent academic publisher. 
I don’t know what you consider “negligible” peer-reviewed journals; all of the journals he published in are reputable with good impact numbers. All have a double-blind peer review process. 
He clearly ticked all the boxes except for one marked “white.” I guess you had that privilege, Ed, in addition to publishing in a time that was decidedly less competitive than today.

WiseOne says 
May 11, 2021 at 3:39 pm
That’s entirely untrue: it’s standard in academia i.e. to write one’s doctoral thesis up into a book and for it to take years – that’s what critical thought is: layers and layers of critical and philosophical thinking distilled into robust critical prose which is laden with intertextual references. I’ve known colleagues take 10 years in which to achieve the same as this scholar. Intelligent, critical writing takes time to produce and publish with any integrity.

MR says 
May 11, 2021 at 4:51 pm
Did you read the dissertation? Did you read the book? Did you even read this article? The tenure denial was not based on the quality of research but justified on the lack of “future trajectory” and teaching effectiveness. The evidence says something else-and that is why the most respected scholars and students are objecting to forcefully. 
So let me ask, are you a scholar? Or, a paid troll?

Hello Ed G,
    I would like to see your academic record.  Would you identify yourself so we can see how productive you were over the last 20 years. 
   By the way department head Denise Brennan has a book called *What’s Love Got to Do With It?* Substantive anthropological research indeed . 
    And Ed, you can check my record anytime you like. I’m on line and I’ve identified myself below.

Georgetown routinely denies tenure to faculty of color. I know of at least two cases. I applaud Rizvi’s bravery and tenacity to fight back. Georgetown knew about his research *before* they hired him. If they didn’t want his expertise on the Middle East, then don’t bring in a ME specialist. 
But that’s the *diversity* game at  many a so-called elite university.  Hire lots of expendable assistant faculty of color. Use those numbers to congratulate on itself on the hiring of X number of faculty of color; then deny tenure to all the *colorful* faculty they put on the covers of their website, trotted out to their Board of Trustees and showcased in their alumni magazines, etc.
For six years those African American/Latinx/Middle Eastern diverse faculty make Georgetown look like a progressive and intellectual diverse institution. 
Then its *Get Out* at tenure time. Pretty swell *diversity* investment strategy for Georgetown.

You are right on the mark Natasha. But it has grown beyond just persons of color. It now includes all races, genders, religions… in short, if you’re not well connected in the political and financial world, and not bringing in lots of cash from government and corporate grants, your time at GU is short. When John DeGioia took over as president, the doors opened and in came the politicians and donors, dictating what would be taught and who would teach it. As an illustration, Chuck Hagel, former politicians and Sec. of Def. was out of a job so he was brought in as Professor in the School of Foreign Service [no graduate degree] and he said he was here to ‘… hep out whereever I can …”. I could say much more, but this is where Georgetown is. Superficial, neoliberal, corporatized, and increasingly irrelevant.

It seems that most of the posts ignore the elephant in the room: “…the lack of competitive grants awarded,”
Academia may pretend that they focus on original work. But if you are not bringing in the bucks, you should not expect a tenure offer ..

The Department was NOT actively sabotaging him–where do you get this sense!? It is sad the Department is implicated in this at all. I know the department well, and they are one of the greatest group of people *and* scholars I have encountered in academia.

I can’t speak about his research, but he has a “54” rating on Coursicle (pretty midling) and a 3.6 rating on Rate My Professor (despite having 7 raters post on 4/21, who gave him 5s – pretty suspicious).   Happy to see that Georgetown values teaching in its evaluation.

mana says 
May 19, 2021 at 7:59 am
Ok that settles it, go online, look up Rate My Professor and deny tenure – very good reasoning indeed! Forget about actual class observations done by peers— did you read the article? Do you know the ABC of online trolling ? Teaching is not customer service it is about challenging students

Lou S. says 
May 20, 2021 at 9:04 am
As per Georgetown’s tenure policy, student evaluations are a component in the evaluation.  And, yes, “customer service”, e.g. office hours, effective feedback, etc. is an important element of a student’s experience and learning.

MANA says 
May 21, 2021 at 8:49 am
FYI, student evals are not Rate My Professor. Do you know his student evals? He has over 700 students rallying for him. Don’t twist what’s in the article! Being a professor or teacher is not customer service it is about guiding, challenging, pedagogy is not coddling

Bad Hoya says 
May 22, 2021 at 10:07 pm
Around 90% of those “700” students never took his class and so their views aren’t relevant.  They’re just supporting him because they’ve been brainwashed to cry racism every time someone who isn’t White doesn’t get what he or she wants.  No one has any proof he was denied tenure because of his race, but we have multiple data points he wasn’t a very good professor and did not work well with others on the faculty.  Let’s face it: he’s a grifter, as are those who are using his race as justification for his failure to secure tenure.

Professor Neel Sukhatme at the Georgetown University Law Center will use his Carnegie Fellowship award to conduct research investigating the consequences of felony sentences on incarcerated people and their families. 
The Andrew Carnegie Fellows Program provides a $200,000 stipend for a select group of fellows determined by a committee of jurors consisting of scholars and academic leaders from across the country and chaired by Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
The research will focus on the effects of courtroom sanctions on the families of people convicted of crimes, according to Sukhatme.
“I’m trying to use my background as an attorney, as an engineer, as an economist, to work on problems that hopefully really matter to people and to try and discover some facts about the criminal justice system and its impact on people,” Sukhatme said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
The Carnegie Corporation distributed $5.2 million in 2021 among 26 fellows working in the social sciences and humanities. These scholars will focus their research on the social sciences and humanities, investigating topics ranging from COVID-19 pandemic recovery to the #MeToo movement. The committee selected the fellows by evaluating each proposal’s potential impact on their field of study and the applicant’s capacity to convey their research to a general audience. 
This research opportunity will allow Sukhatme to consider the consequences of an individual’s felony sentencing that are not often considered by policymakers, such as the sentence’s impacts on partners, parents and children, according to Alexander Billy (GRD ’20), who will work alongside Sukhatme to support his research under this fellowship.
“What we really want people to think about — policymakers especially — is that incarceration may, though it’s not even given, deter future crime for a specific person,” Billy said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “But there are other costs. It actually could be counterproductive, because you could be put in a situation where you don’t have any other outside opportunities, and crime is really the only way that you have to make ends meet.”
Sukhatme worked with Billy to co-found Free Our Vote, an advocacy organization that works to inform previously incarcerated people that they are eligible to vote, after an amendment passed in Florida in 2018 that allowed most former felons to vote in elections, provided they had paid after paying off their court fines and fees. 
The research project draws from Sukhatme’s personal background in working in the courtroom and researching convicted felons’ right to vote in Florida, Sukhatme said.
“All this got me thinking about these collateral consequences of criminal convictions that are often ignored, like losing your right to vote,” Sukhatme said. “That reminded me of my days as a law clerk, when I often thought about those consequences in the real cases I saw. If a parent goes to prison, how does that affect their children, both immediately and later on in life? That’s the kind of research that I hope to pursue.”
Sukhatme’s interest in using data-driven research methods to pursue justice in various ways will prove essential to his research, according to Georgetown Law Dean William M. Treanor. 
“There are a number of factors that go into criminal sentencing but, currently, none of these relate to the long-term impact the sentence will have on individuals or their families,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “By measuring that impact, Professor Sukhatme will offer judges, juries and policymakers a way to assess the broader societal implications of their decision making. That could be revolutionary for our criminal justice system.”
Sukhatme said the exceptional research done by scholars across the Georgetown community will inspire his own research project. 
“What I’m really grateful for is being at Georgetown, in this amazing community of students and scholars, many of whom are working on important projects that are going to influence policy,” Sukhatme said. “That, to me, has been a wonderful experience.”

Georgetown University’s first cultural climate survey revealed tensions between students and the Georgetown University Police Department, as results show students of color reported being disproportionately stopped by GUPD.
Of the undergraduate students surveyed, 7% reported having been stopped and questioned by GUPD. These results include 15.8% of Black/African American students, followed by 9.4% of Hispanic/Latinx students, 8.6% of multiracial students, 6.4% of Asian students, 6% of White students and 4.8% of international students who reported they were stopped by GUPD in the past year. The university’s student body in 2019 was 47.6% White, 8.81% Asian, 7.84% Hispanic/Latinx and 6.97% Black/African American. 
GUPD is beyond repair and should be replaced with a more equitable oversight system on campus, according to Georgetown University Student Association Senator Ace Frazier (MSB ’23), who also serves as GUSA’s equity and inclusion policy director and a member of its GUPD abolition working group.
“You cannot fix a foundational oppressive system and the culture it creates on Georgetown University campus is the same it creates across the nation,” Frazier wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I believe we need to establish a 5-year plan to defund and eventually abolish GUPD in order to help keep students safe.”
In past years, students have raised complaints about hyperpolicing on Georgetown’s campus. In particular, students of color have experienced unnecessary surveillance and excessive use of force from GUPD. Last October, GUSA senators established a GUPD Abolition Working Group, which is advocating for GUPD’s abolition by engaging the university and educating the Georgetown community. 
The results of the cultural climate survey have served as a call to action for GUPD, according to Associate Vice President for Public Safety and Chief of Police Jay Gruber. 
“We are committed to continuing to improve our processes and procedures and to ensure there is no racial bias in GUPD actions as we strive to ensure that all members of our community feel safe on campus,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our Officers have a deep respect for the diversity of the Georgetown community and are committed to serving and protecting our community in a fair and impartial manner that promotes respect and inclusiveness.”
In the wake of the Georgetown community backlash against racial disparities in police treatment, Gruber said GUPD has initiated reforms. Among these initiatives are enhanced implicit bias, de-escalation and antiracism training for all officers; requiring officers to track and record all stops and identification checks; and providing students with information about their rights and how to report bias, according to Gruber.
Originally, administrators did not plan to include additional Georgetown-specific questions in the survey, instead drafting questions based on the National Institute for Transformation and Equity questionnaire, a survey developed to measure inclusivity and equity on campuses across the country. However, after soliciting student input, students called on the university to include Georgetown-specific questions. Following student advocacy and a 2019 GUSA petition, the university agreed to add questions regarding policing, bias in the classroom, curriculum inclusivity, intersectional identities and accessibility.
After consulting with students, the university ensured all survey questions and instruments underwent an extensive process of development, testing and validation to ensure a balanced survey and accurate results, according to a university spokesperson.
“Items were constructed using existing research and assessment and data from across the nation, and systematic methods were used to assess the content and construct validity of the surveys,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Despite student advocacy efforts for the inclusion of Georgetown-specific questions related to law enforcement, only one question on the published survey referred to GUPD, according to Frazier.
“The survey entirely and I believe intentionally neglected to ask student perception of GUPD in terms of their usefulness as a resource,” Frazier wrote. “They also did not ask about how safe people feel when they think about GUPD. These are vital questions to determine GUPD’s success at their job and in order to evaluate whether they serve any purpose to Georgetown University.”
The changes GUPD has already initiated represent continued efforts to combat racial disparity at Georgetown, according to Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Rosemary Kilkenny (LAW ’87), who said the university has plans to conduct another survey to measure its progress.
“I look forward to continuing joint efforts with Chief Gruber to address the concerns raised by students in the survey,” Kilkenny wrote in an email to The Hoya.
To get broader and more specific information on GUPD relations, the university should conduct a more specific survey to better gauge students’ experiences with GUPD, according to Frazier.
“I hope to see a GUPD specific survey that asks relevant questions relating to the practices and culture around GUPD,” Frazier wrote. “I guarantee many would be interested in such a survey and that the results would be very telling of what actions to take going forward.”

The White House will aim to repair a fractured relationship with the press following the animus of the previous administration, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at an event.
The event, titled “Where Do We Go From Here?” was hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and the White House Correspondents’ Association on May 5. Current secretary Psaki and Zeke Miller, president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, discussed the current political media landscape in a conversation moderated by Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), director of GU Politics.
President Biden and his administration have focused on maintaining a diplomatic tone when holding press conferences in order to rebuild the trust between the White House and the press, according to Psaki.
“We value the press, we value the role of the press and we value the importance of sharing information,” Psaki said at the event. “You can have disagreements. He has moments where he disagrees with the line of questioning, of course, but the tone is a part of the message we are sending to the country and the world.” 
The Biden administration has attempted to rebuild the relationship between the White House and the press, after former President Trump had a characteristically tense relationship with the media, often spreading misinformation during news conferences or labeling certain publications as “fake news.”
The panel was featured as part of the multievent “A Symposium on The Press, The Presidency & Trust” and sought to bring members of the White House Correspondents’ Association in conversation with press representatives from the Biden administration. 
The event was held virtually in place of the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, an annual fundraiser event by the White House Correspondents’ Association that seeks to help finance news coverage of the White House, which was canceled because of concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Prior to her current role in the Biden administration, Psaki served as the spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State from 2013 to 2015 and the White House communications director from 2015 to 2017. Psaki also served as a GU Politics Fellow in the spring 2017 cohort.
According to Psaki, the role of the White House communications team has changed in the past several years, with social media becoming a much more important way to reach the American public with information on policy decisions.
“I am a believer that television is still a huge driver of information, but when we’re looking at COVID and how we’re trying to get out to communities and reach people who are more hesitant but also just need information or do not know how to get access, we can’t do everything through daily newspapers,” Psaki said. “Our role as the government is to make sure we’re disseminating information out to a broad swathe of the public.” 
Indeed, the challenges that COVID-19 presents have been directly observed by the American public. Roughly 71% of Americans believe that COVID-19 has changed the way news publications have reported on stories and disseminated information to the public, according to survey data from the Pew Research Center.
At the same time, many Americans increasingly turn to social media to stay up to date with the news. Even with the rise of social media, conventional news outlets are still likely to play a strong role in shaping people’s political opinions, according to Miller.
“Social media has given any administration more tools to communicate, but most people have an informed opinion about whether they dislike Joe Biden or like Joe Biden,” Miller said at the event. “They probably got those set of facts from a media filter. They probably got it from the news coverage of that social media message.”
In response to the new challenges stemming from COVID-19 and social media, the White House will continue to treat the press with professionalism and hopes to reestablish trust between the two groups, according to Psaki.
“We are going to take their questions. We are going to provide information. We are going to have a back and forth as warranted,” Psaki said. “Having a war or battle with the media organizations is not in our interests, is not in the interests of the American public, and frankly, it distracts from what we’re trying to communicate about.”
