Ecuadorean environmentalist Ivonne Baki discussed her country’s efforts to preserve the Amazon Rainforest in Intercultural Center Friday afternoon.
Baki, whose presentation was sponsored by the School of Foreign Service’s Center for Latin American Studies, is a former ambassador to the United States and the Secretary of State for Ecuador’s Yasuni-ITT initiative. Launched in 2007 by Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa, the initiative seeks to prevent oil drilling in the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini oil field in Ecuador’s Amazon Rainforest.
Baki, who lived in Lebanon during the Lebanese War, said she initially aspired to be a peacekeeper.
“I realized [during the bombings in Lebanon] how difficult it is to create life and how easy it is to destroy it in just a second. It’s unacceptable,” Baki said, “I thought [being a peacekeeper] was what I would do with my life, but then I visited the Yasuni.”
One of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on the planet, the Yasuni rainforest was threatened because of the vast oil reserves beneath it.
As part of the initiative, Ecuador promises to prohibit the extraction of oil from these fields in exchange for half of the monetary worth of the reserves – $3.6 billion – from  the international community..
 Baki explained that the monetary compensation to Ecuador is an integral part of the model.
“Ecuador is a developing country. It needs a lot of investment in education and infrastructure,” she said. “It is an oil-dependent country, and the easiest thing for us to do would be to [extract the oil], but we are committed to the environment.”
She also detailed the negative ramifications that could come from the rainforest’s destruction, including global warming and the loss of biodiversity.
“Actually, in the long-term, it would not be economically profitable to extract the oil,” Baki said. “You would lose [the long-term] resources that the forest provides.”
An important part of the initiative includes educating the local population about how to preserve the forest so the citizens of Ecuador can benefit from its resources. The program grants locals the tools necessary to take charge of the conservation effort.
“Social development is the most important part of our investment,” Baki said. “The most important part of what [the people in the Yasuni area] are asking for is work. We have to empower women and educate children.”
Recently, Baki has met with government officials in several countries, including the United States, to talk about monetary pledges for the United Nations Development Group, Yasuni Trust Fund. So far, the fund has raised $200 million and is projected to meet its $3.6 billion goal in the next 13 years.
However, Baki said it is even more important that she meets with civilians and students because the largest donations are individual contributions and because she relies on student support to raise awareness for the initiative.
“[Washington] is where they make the laws, and this is about creating laws. I want Georgetown University to take this … to Congress — take the [lead] and make this known.” Baki said “This is the only planet we have.”
Students who attended the event applauded the project’s innovative approach to sustainability.
“This is a great example of the innovation being applied in the realm of development these days, bridging concern for the environment and issues like sustainability in ways that are totally new,” Alex Blake (GRD ’14) said.

Amid the bustle of college life, the ESCAPE First-Year Experience has given students the opportunity to leave campus, take a break and reflect on their experiences.
Run by the Office of Campus Ministry, the retreat was created to uphold the Jesuit ideals of spirituality and reflection.
The Class of 1990 proposed the idea for ESCAPE after realizing it regretted the lack of reflective experiences during its first year at Georgetown. Arthur Calcagnini (C ’54) endowed the program with $1.5 million to enhance Georgetown’s Catholic and Jesuit mission in 1990.
Now in its 22nd year, ESCAPE has evolved into a 27-hour spiritual, but nondenominational, overnight experience that offers freshmen, transfer and international students the opportunity to make new friends and leave the District for Shepherd’s Spring Outdoor Ministry Center, a retreat center in Sharpsburg, Md.
“We’re very rooted in the Jesuit tradition of reflection and introspection, but we’re open to people of any faith and tradition or no faith and tradition,” Sean Huang (COL ’14), one of this year’s ESCAPE student program coordinators, said of the program’s mission. “While we’re not exactly secular because we use Ignatius values of reflection, we design the program to accommodate all students.”
ESCAPE Director Bridget Sherry said the issues explored during the retreat are as important to today’s freshmen as they were in 1990.
“The model on which ESCAPE is built is one that has really stood the test of time,” Sherry said. “I think that speaks to the questions that [students] are wrestling with at this point in their [lives]: ‘What do I want to do with my life? What makes me happy?’ and ‘What brings meaning to my life?’ We see ESCAPE as an introduction to the path of reflection.”
ESCAPE offers 12 retreats throughout the year, each of which comprises about 15 to 30 participants and 13 upperclassmen team leaders.
The 2012-2013 ESCAPE team is composed of 39 sophomore, junior and senior leaders, who apply for the position after the last retreat in February and remain on staff for one year.
Many leaders are returning ESCAPE participants who wanted to give back to the program.
“Georgetown wasn’t a place that I automatically fell in love with,” Magdalena Buczek (COL ’13), an ESCAPE student program coordinator, said. “What I found beautiful about ESCAPE was that everyone’s walls and guards just go down, and you realize that other people are feeling the same way that you are. I can say right now … that I love [the school]. The program has given me a lot, and I felt very passionate about giving back.”
Team leaders and faculty speakers lead talks that are central to each retreat. Three student leaders give speeches about their pre-college, freshman year and senior year experiences, and one faculty member typically shares insights about life after college.
After the speeches, students separate into smaller, hour-long discussions to share personal stories.
“It was such a relief to learn that everyone is going through the same things I am and that everything will all work out in the end,” Kylie Mohr (COL ’16) said of her experience on ESCAPE’s September retreat. “I learned that, surprisingly enough, college is a time to be selfish and a time to find what works for you, to stay true to yourself, to love yourself and to put yourself first.”
Faculty speakers, such as Fr. Patrick Conroy, S.J., related to Mohr on a personal level.
“Two nuggets of advice that Father Pat told me on ESCAPE really stood out,” she said. “Don’t be afraid, and keep people in your life that make you feel alive.”
Sherry also commented on the effectiveness of adult speakers.
“As a Jesuit institution, we hope that students come in tune to the values and the principles of what they want to do in life,” Sherry said. “Because the questions ‘What do I want to do with my life?’ and ‘What do I do if I encounter setbacks or failures?’ … don’t go away after college.”
ESCAPE is in the midst of undergoing a major expansion.
The program is now in its third year at Georgetown’s campus in Qatar, where coordinators seek to promote its Jesuit values overseas.
Sherry, who traveled to Qatar three years ago to train the new staff, remarked on the programs’ similarities.
“There are different customs that have to be abided by,” Sherry said, “but we can see in the Qatar program how ESCAPE is translating to a very different cultural and religious context and thriving.”
The program will also be moving to a new permanent home next year, a contemplative center in Bluemont, Va., endowed by Arthur and Nancy Calcagnini.
“It will be here, in the Calcagnini Contemplative Center, where the members of our community [can] seek out our deepest inner truths, discover the best version of ourselves and renew our commitment to our mission,” University President John J. DeGioia said at the center’s ground-breaking ceremony last fall.
For now, retreats at the current center provide participants with a much-needed chance for reflection and relaxation.
“The trip can be summed up into good food, good fun, good company and a chance to reflect on life,” Huang said.

Georgetown students enjoyed a candid discussion with writer and producer the HBO series “Entourage” Doug Ellin in Lohrfink Auditorium Monday evening.
Ellin began the discussion with stories about his early years as an aspiring stand-up comedian in Hollywood. His film career formally launched when he was 22 years old and wrote a short film called “The Pitch.”
“Somebody saw the film and liked it enough to get me a job as a production assistant at New Line Cinema [film studio], so I worked in the mail room,” Ellin said. “But then the president saw my film and wanted me to go from working in the mailroom to producing a $35 million movie with him.”
Ellin declined the offer and instead chose to attend film school to learn about the industry, after which he went on to direct films such as “Phat Beach.”
After discussing his path to becoming the writer of a hit HBO series, Ellin entertained questions from many “Entourage” fans regarding his inspiration.
“I wanted to do a show about me and my friends. I had to make it something I could relate to,” Ellin said. “I wanted it to be a show that showed how 18-to 34-year-old guys actually talk and act.”
Despite the current popularity of “Entourage,” Ellin said that the show’s early ratings were shaky.
“Based on the numbers, we didn’t know if people were even watching the show, so we were prepared to get hit by negative reviews,” Ellin said. “But surprisingly, The New York Times said we were the best show on television in 2003 and we even got Golden Globes for it.”
Ellin encouraged students interested in the film industry to go out and work hard to fulfill their goals.
“There’s no structure to the business. You could make millions off of your first film or spend your entire career trying to convince people that you can do it; you never know,” he said. “But if you really want to do it, get yourself out there as quickly as you can, meet someone in the business, charm him and get him to read your stuff.”
Much of the conversation centered on questions from the audience regarding specific scenes from episodes of “Entourage.”
“I thought it was cool how down to earth Doug Ellin was with us,” Elliot Rosenfield (COL ’16) said. “He spoke to us like we were his close friends, which made it easy to see why so many people, myself included, love ‘Entourage’ and feel like they can relate to it so well.”

The Student Group Union has two remaining vacancies on its executive committee that will be filled by the end of the week, according to SGU executive committee chair and performing arts representative Aman Shahi (COL ’13).
The position for the student government representative and the non-advisory board remain open. These new representatives will serve alongside nine other members of the committee until November.
“There is no set deadline for us to fill these positions,” Shahi said. “The way the vacancies have worked, we’ve really just been filling vacancies as they come about.”
Executive committee terms usually begin at the end of April and last throughout the summer and fall semesters.  However, after the first SGU elections were held in February, the group did not hold an election in April. Because of the extended term, positions opened up as committee members left campus to go abroad.
The SGU was founded last year to provide student groups with a forum to collaborate and represent student organizations at Georgetown. The union currently is comprised of 76 member organizations.
“A lot of last semester was really just getting off the ground and establishing basic administrative practices,” Shahi said. “Since then, we’ve begun to build relationships with important organizations on campus like GUSA. At this point, as we have matured as an organization, we are really focusing on the work that we can actually get done.”
SGU members sought to differentiate the group from SAC.
“SGU is completely separate from SAC,” SGU executive board member and Media Representative Emily Coccia (COL ’15) wrote in an email. “We are a way for groups to connect with other groups that probably face similar problems and share similar concerns. Both SAC- and non-SAC-funded groups have joined the SGU. One analogy would be that we are to student groups as GUSA is to the student body.”
According to Shahi, the SGU’s goals for this year include organizing a second student group summit, implementing suggestions from the Student Life Report, providing more resources to student groups and working with the Georgetown Conversation, an online forum that encourages dialogue among students, faculty and administrators.  But before these goals can be met, the union must firmly establish its presence on campus.
“I think accomplishments are kind of tough for us to define right now,” Shahi said. “Right now we are focusing on relevancy; we’re making sure that we are a part of the conversation, and we want to be able to provide student groups with services that they wouldn’t otherwise have.”
But Shahi is also hopeful for SGU’s first full year on campus.
“If you were to ask me the question ‘What has the SGU accomplished?’ a year from now,” he said, “I would want to have a list of concrete things, having been a functioning organization for a year. By that point, we will have a number of accomplishments under our belt.”

Admissions officers are checking Facebook pages and Google search results of potential applicants with higher frequency than ever previously reported.
A Kaplan Test Prep survey released Oct. 4 found that 27 percent of admissions officers use Google and 26 percent use Facebook as a means of evaluating potential candidates for admission.
While this figure represents only a slight shift from 2011, when 20 percent checked Google and 26 percent Facebook, there was a notable change from last year in the number of admissions officers who found online material that had an adverse impact on an applicant’s admissions prospects.
Of those admissions officers who check either Facebook or Google, 35 percent said they discovered damaging material, as opposed to 12 percent last year.
Admissions officers listed vulgarities written in blogs, alcohol consumption in photographs and evidence of other illegal activities as among the types of online content that reflected poorly upon the applicant.
“The traditional application — the essays, the letters of recommendation — represent the polished version of an applicant, while often what’s found online is a rawer version of that applicant,” Jeff Olson, vice president of data science at Kaplan Test Prep, wrote in the organization’s press release about the survey.
Students are now taking a variety of preventative measures to shield their Internet presence from the scrutiny of admissions officers.
Many high school seniors now attempt to keep their pages clean of any pictures that show them drinking or partaking in other illegal activities.
“I just made sure not to be in those photos,” Sylvain Kauffman (COL ’16) said. “I’d heard horror stories about people losing scholarships [because of incriminating photos].”
Some high school seniors, however, use a different approach and attempt to prevent admissions officers from even finding their pages.
“I got rid of all the vowels in my name and changed my email to a non-existent one,” Anastasia Savoretti (MSB ’16) said.
Kenna Libes (COL ’16) was taken aback when her Georgetown interviewer added her as a friend on Facebook but immediately changed her privacy settings to control what she could see.
“I went through my posts like a whirlwind cutting off her visibility,” Libes said.
In contrast to the growing trend toward scrutinizing candidates’ social media activity and Internet presence, however, Georgetown admissions officers said they typically do not use Facebook or Google to learn more about an applicant.
Only 15 percent of colleges nationwide have a policy governing whether their admissions officers are allowed to examine applicants’ Internet presence, of which 69 percent prohibit officers from doing so.
“It is not a valuable use of time for Georgetown’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions to use social media and Google to make inquiries about prospective students,” Margaret Lysy, associate director of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, wrote in an email.
However, Lysy did not entirely rule out the use of Facebook or Google in cases where the admissions office might need more information about a candidate than provided on the application.
“It is possible we could use one of these tools, but it would be an exception,” she said.

EUGENE ANG/THE HOYAThe university is now in the process of choosing an architect to organize the chapel’s internal redesign.With the restoration of Dahlgren Chapel’s foundation almost completed, administrators began interviewing candidates to redesign the building’s interior Monday.
A selection committee composed of administrators from the Office of Campus Mission and Ministry, the Office of Planning and Project Management and the Office of Advancement will choose an architect to orchestrate the indoor renovations, according to Assistant Vice President of University Facilities Regina Bleck. The university hopes to install improved lighting, new seating and a custom-built organ by the end of next summer.
Meanwhile, the exterior renovation of the chapel remains on schedule, according to Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (CAS ’88).
“They have completed the restoration of the foundation, and now they are waterproofing the base of the chapel to prevent future disruption of the ground,” he said.
Landscaping around the chapel will begin in the spring.
In addition, the chapel’s stained-glass windows, which were removed for cleaning at the end of November last year, will be reinstalled early next month, according to O’Brien.
He added that the university aims to raise another $2.5 million to complete the work on the chapel, which will supplement the $6.2 million lead gift given by L. Francis Rooney (CAS ’75, LAW ’78) and Kathleen Rooney (SFS ’77).
“We continue to fundraise for the project, but we have been very pleased with the response from our alums,” said O’Brien. “Dahlgren is the spiritual heart of the campus. And whether a donor is Catholic or not, they recognize the symbolic importance of the chapel. Because it says Georgetown has a soul. It’s more than just bricks and mortar.”

In response to last year’s child sex abuse scandal at The Pennsylvania State University, Georgetown has launched a new Protection of Minors Policy.
The policy, which was approved by the Faculty Senate in September, was announced last week in a university-wide email from the Office of the President.
“We recognize that we certainly have to look at how we protect minors on campus,” Vice President for Public Affairs and Senior Advisor to the President Erik Smulson said.
Georgetown began reviewing its policy regarding treatment of minors on campus after news of the Penn State scandal broke last November. According to Smulson, the review resulted in the formation of a Culture of Care Working Group, a committee composed of university leaders from Georgetown’s three D.C. campuses that gathered information about other university’s policies and noted how they differed from Georgetown’s.
“There were a lot of current policies in place that we already have,” Smulson said. “We have a code of ethics. … We have an honor pledge … so there is a culture of care that is already integrated into our community.”
The working group first established guidelines last April for on-campus summer programs that include minors and used this initial set of recommendations as a test for the final policy. According to Smulson, the guidelines applied to more than 45 different summer programs on Georgetown’s campus that included minors.
Most of these summer guidelines, which consisted of recommendations for program coordinators and leaders, were incorporated into the final policy.
“We did an inventory of all the groups that bring minors to campus and looked at what the best practices were,” Smulson said. “It changed the way [the programs] did business based on the guidelines, which I think is a very good sign.”
The fully developed policy released last week sets standards for treatment of minors across Georgetown’s campuses and establishes protocol for dealing with infractions.
According to the policy, “abuse or neglect of minors” includes physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or negative treatment of any individual under the age of 18. The policy applies to all buildings, facilities and areas owned and operated by the university.
To enforce this standard, the policy requires all people over 18 who lead or participate in programs or activities involving minors to undergo training and a criminal background check.
Training includes learning methods for recognizing signs of abuse or neglect and developing ways to protect minors from abuse. Non-university organizations must submit documentation proving that program members underwent training.
The policy also highlighted the importance of a reporting system, which mandates that members of the university community call Georgetown’s Department of Public Safety or the Metropolitan Police Department if they notice suspicious activity. Community members also must inform the Office of Compliance and Ethics about concerns.
According to Smulson, the university’s next task is to ensure that the campus understands the new policy.
“It is very much an ongoing process because now that we have the policy in place, we have to increase awareness that we have the policy and that this is an issue,” he said.
He added that the university hopes to bolster the policy’s message by bringing speakers to work with student groups and talk about child abuse throughout the year.
“It is going to be a constant conversation to make sure people are aware of the issue of child abuse,” he said.

Three years after University President John J. DeGioia launched his Main Campus Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness, several of the project’s main goals have yet to be accomplished.
The initiative was introduced by DeGioia in April 2009 in response to a series of bias-related incidents — including offensive graffiti written on walls and statues and a controversial April Fools’ edition of The Hoya — and the release of a 300-page report on diversity published by the Student Commission for Unity that found that 76 percent of students “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that self-segregation is a problem on campus.
The initiative comprised three working groups that aimed to address inclusiveness and diversity in the areas of academics, admissions and student life. The groups published their recommendations between December 2009 and May 2010.
Though Georgetown has successfully enacted some of the working groups’ recommendations — hiring more diverse faculty, increasing yield rates among minority students and implementing programs like the 1789 Scholarship Imperative, which aims to annually award 1,789 $25,000 scholarships to needystudents — other issues remain unresolved.
Current students and alumni who were involved in the initiative are now voicing concerns about whether the university has acted on the remaining recommendations, particularly those of the academic working group.
According to Saaliha Khan (COL ’13), a diversity fellow in the Office of Campus Ministry, the initiative has faded from the forefront of university policy over the past few years.
“[The university] used to send out all-school blasts about the initiative, the working groups and the recommendations that were being implemented,” Khan said. “Recently, though, I haven’t seen anything.”
SCU member Zenen Jaimes (SFS ’13) expressed similar concerns.
“All the recommendations were kind of pushed aside, despite the fact that many students spent a lot of time on it to try to address a real problem,” Jaimes said. “[The school] simply moved forward without it, and the conversation about diversity on campus sort of ended with it.”
Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny pointed to several of the working groups’ recommendations that have already been enacted, including the hiring of more minority faculty members and the successful implementation of diversity fellowships for professors and students.
According to Kilkenny, two Black professors, eight Asian professors and one Latina professor have been hired on the main campus since last winter.
She added that the university is now in the process of diversifying other administrative areas, including chaplains- and faculty-in-residence, professional staff and resident assistants.
Additionally, the Doyle Initiative, a program that encourages faculty to discuss topics of diversity and tolerance during lectures, ensures that professors broach the topic of acceptance in the classroom.
“Faculty [members] are continuing to take advantage of that program by enhancing their pedagogical approaches to teaching,” Kilkenny wrote in an email.
During the past two academic years, nine undergraduate diversity fellows — including Khan — have been assigned to the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action, the Office of Campus Ministry, the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, the LGBTQ Resource Center, the Women’s Center, the School of Nursing & Health Studies and the Center for Child and Human Development.
“Diversity … is a collaborative effort that permeates the campus,” Kilkenny wrote.
Kilkenny said that the initiative is still in the implementation phase but that students have expressed frustration about the initiative’s slow progress.
“We were under the impression that the university would, in a timely and open fashion, let us know which recommendations would be accepted and which wouldn’t, but that hadn’t come to pass by the time I graduated,” said Ryan Wilson (COL ’12), a member of SCU and a co-chair of the admissions and recruitment working group. “We had no idea about what was being done.”
Wilson pointed to components of the initiative that have stalled, particularly the academic working group’s recommendation that the university develop its minority studies programs.
“The academics working group had put forth recommendations for expanding the African American studies department and creating formal African American, Latino and Asian American studies majors,” Wilson said. “The school has yet to act upon these recommendations.”
According to the SCU’s 2008 report, 95 percent of Georgetown’s peer universities — defined as all other members of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education and all Jesuit schools — already have an African American studies major. Another two-thirds have a Latin American studies major and one-third offer majors in Asian American studies.
Additionally, around 70 percent of these schools include diversity courses in their core curricula, another primary concern for students involved in the initiative.
“We don’t see a focus on diversity education curricula, and that is needed in order to foster respect [for diversity] on campus,” Khan said.
According to Khan, a lack of student advocacy has allowed the university to stall on the implementation of the working groups’ recommendations.
“[The university] needs to step it up,” she said. “I know that many students still care very much about the initiative, both for diversity in the university and to ensure that Georgetown becomes a more welcoming place. But in terms of the administration and holding them accountable, we as students need to push a little bit.”
But concern about on-campus diversity is felt at the administrative level as well. Director of the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access and Associate Dean of Students Dennis Williams said that the Supreme Court’s ruling on Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin — an ongoing case challenging the constitutionality of affirmative action policies — could affect Georgetown’s efforts to recruit more minority students.
“We should also be prepared to do what is necessary to continue to enroll significant numbers of previously excluded students if the U.S. Supreme Court rules that colleges cannot consider race in admissions,” he wrote in an email.
But according to Jaimes, increasing minority enrollment will not address larger issues about tolerance on campus.
“There’s a difference between having the diversity in the numbers and actually feeling that our campus is a place where diversity is valued,” he said.
According to Wilson, this change will only happen if students ensure that the university keeps the initiative at the forefront of its agenda.
“This is not the first time nor will this be the last time that [a diversity initiative] will be debated on campus,” he said. “The most important thing to do is to research and reach out to people so we stop doing the same work over and over again.”

Correction: Upon publication, Roanne Lee (MSB ’12) was incorrectly labeled as a member of VFA’s second fellowship class. However, Lee was a member of VFA’s first fellowship class.
Venture for America, a two-year entrepreneurial fellowship program founded last summer by former start-up executive Andrew Yang, aims to expand its presence at Georgetown in the coming semester.
VFA recruits top college graduates to work at promising start-up companies for two-year periods in low-cost cities.
The organization aims to create 100,000 new jobs in the United States by 2025 and to increase the amount of hands-on company development experience for college graduates who are interested in engineering, computer science and business.
“My experience in VFA has differed greatly from those of fellow graduates, but I think that’s really benefited me,” Roanne Lee (MSB ’12), a member of the program’s first fellowship class, said. Lee works as an analyst at Cintrifuse, a new business initiative in Cincinnati, Ohio, that offers investment support, mentorship and workspace. She said that the experience has taught her more than a traditional job in business or finance would have.
“I went with the choice without the security of a job path that was already paved for me, and that pushed me to develop my independent skills to a much higher degree,” she said. “I’m welcomed into meetings with executives and leaders of companies and treated as a valuable member of the work force here, and I’m not sure that’s something most recent graduates find in corporate cultures.”
To apply for the fellowship, students must complete an online application that includes essays, a resume and two letters of recommendation before going through an extensive three-round interview process.
Once accepted into the program, fellows participate in a company-graduate matching process. New fellows speak with VFA employees to determine regional preference, areas of interest and personal skills. Once matched, fellows go through a formal interview with the selected company to ensure proper fit. Finally, fellows must attend a five-week boot camp at Brown University where they learn how to run a company.
Major business leaders, including, David Tisch, co-founder of TechStars, and Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn, act as mentors during these business training programs.
“[The boot camp] provided me with technical skills, a better understanding of commodity training and a distinct vision of creating a culture of value within the start-up I was assigned to,” Lee said. “That really prepared me for all that I do now,”
Though the program is only in its second year, the application process has already become highly competitive. Only ten percent of the applicants were accepted into the fellowship class of 2012, according to Georgetown’s VFA Campus Ambassador Timothy Raftis (COL ’14).
Raftis, who was inspired to become a campus ambassador after attending an information session last month, is enthusiastic about the fellowship’s mission.
“I hadn’t even heard of the program until three weeks ago, but when I heard Andrew Yang present the goals and the vision of the program, I was sold,” he said. “I wasn’t a senior, so I couldn’t apply for the fellowship, but I knew I had to become a part of it, so I applied to be an ambassador.”
As campus ambassador, Raftis’s main job involves raising awareness about VFA’s presence on campus through email campaigns, Facebook and hanging flyers. He said he is confident that Georgetown students will take advantage of the program.
“You get to actually create something. You take ownership of something and are able to see the direct effects of your work,” Raftis said. “The attention and experience you can get in small businesses is very valuable and not something graduates can immediately get in consulting or finance, [where] you have to go through bureaucracy of company.”
Raftis also pointed out the networking opportunities the fellowship provides.
“Fellows are building relationships with mentors right away, which can help them tremendously later on in their careers,” Raftis said. “They also forge bonds with peer VFA fellows, and out of that, you get a network of great young talent just as passionate about entrepreneurship as you.”
VFA and its partner companies pay fellows an annual salary that ranges from $33,000 to $38,000 for their work and grant $100,000 investments to top fellows who successfully start businesses at the end of their two-year term.
VFA Director of Corporate Development Mike Tarullo, who is responsible for choosing VFA’s partner companies, seeks out promising companies in cities that are supportive of VFA’s mission. Currently, VFA has 49 partner companies in Providence, R.I., Cincinnati, Ohio, Las Vegas, Nev., New Haven, Conn., New Orleans, La., and Detroit, Mich., but plans to expand its presence to two to four more cities in the next year.
“VFA plays a vital role in allowing these small start-ups to get talent that they otherwise wouldn’t be able to recruit because they don’t have budgets for campus recruiters or interns in the pipeline,” Raftis said. “VFA bridges that gap and gives them a fair shot at getting talented and driven graduates.”
VFA and the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative will co-sponsor Georgetown’s Entrepreneurship Day Nov. 9.

In order to raise awareness and fundraise for Covenant House, Hoya Outreach Programs and Education will hold its second annual Solidarity Sleep Out Nov. 16 on the Leavey Esplanade.
The sleep out, co-coordinated by Gianna Maita (COL ’15) and Daniel Ryan (COL ’13), will run from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. the next morning. Students will sleep on the ground on the esplanade to get a feel for the experience of living on the streets.
“We want to make homelessness a real idea instead of an abstract concept like, ‘I know there are homeless people out there, and I know some of them are youth and teenagers,’” Ryan said. “You spend a couple hours outside on a cold November night, and it becomes a lot more real.”
The event will also include a cappella performances, a showing of the documentary “Streetwise” and speakers from Covenant House, a nonprofit organization that provides food, shelter, clothes, transitional housing, job skills training and GED classes to homeless and runaway youth.
“Basically, [Covenant House] gives them the tools they need to get back on their feet,” Maita said. “These kids are so hard working, but it’s their horrible social or family situations that prevent them from changing their lives.”
Ryan, whose father is the chief executive officer of Covenant House, cited his own experiences with the organization as his reason for getting involved with the sleep out.
“Covenant House reminds me that there are people out there who have it a lot worse than I ever could or ever have, and the way they can wake up every day and go out there and fight for a normal life, get a job, go to school and feel the love that Covenant House gives them, as opposed to a traditional family — it’s just very inspirational.”
He added that the sleep out aims to give students a sense of what it feels like to live in these circumstances.
“It’s supposed to make people feel uncomfortable,” he said. “We want to give ourselves a perspective we don’t have to deal with on a usual basis.”
Maita added that during last year’s sleep out, the group moved inside after 2 a.m. due to extreme cold.
“Even by the time we were watching the movie, it was so cold that my CD player slot in my laptop wouldn’t open,” Maita said. “We had to pry it open.”
Although moving inside made the experience less authentic, Fiona Meagher (COL ’15), a participant in last year’s event, pointed out that homeless youth do not have the option to escape the weather, which emphasized Georgetown students’ privilege.
“It was crazy to think that some people don’t have the option to just go inside and use a warm bathroom or warm up,” she said.
Meagher added that the event was a powerful learning experience.
“I definitely don’t think I know exactly what a homeless person feels, but I think that I have more empathy,” she said. “I’ve experienced — to some degree — a taste of what they go through every night, and knowing that makes this problem impossible to ignore. It makes you know that it’s not an experience that any person should have to go through, yet they do, so something must be done about this.”
Ryan added that he hoped that people come away from the experience with a renewed sense of dedication to the problem of youth homelessness in D.C.
“Sleeping outside in cold conditions, just trying to do that for one night and then trying to imagine what that’s like on a daily basis is difficult. It’s an amazing opportunity to imagine, to put ourselves in the shoes of homeless kids,” Ryan said.
“I hope people will come away with a sense of urgency [and] feel the need to visit a Covenant House shelter, donate their time or money or spread the word about homelessness among youth,” he added. “I want this night to leave a lasting impression.”

University of California, Santa Barbara professors Linda Adler-Kassner and John Majewski spoke to Georgetown faculty about the different methods of utilizing innovative ways of thinking in the classroom in Lauinger Library Monday afternoon.
The event was organized by Director of Writing Curriculum Initiatives Sherry Linkon and was sponsored by the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, a program that offers tools and resources to facilitate learning for students and faculty.
Adler-Kassner and Majewski discussed the importance of understanding threshold concepts, which are unique lenses used to analyze a specific discipline, so teachers can learn how to teach complicated ideas to undergraduate students.
Majewski and Adler-Kassner applied their ideas in their respective history and writing courses at UC Santa Barbara. Adler-Kassner’s English students were all in Majewski’s history survey course, so the two collaborated when teaching the concepts.
Both professors emphasized the importance of identifying, understanding and applying threshold concepts in their subjects.
“One of the things we teach students [is] good taste,” Majewski said. “We are teaching them the values of how historians evaluate arguments and that, yes, there are different interpretations of history, but there are certain evidentiary standards that historians use to evaluate arguments and competing narratives.”
The event was part of a series of lectures that will contribute to an ongoing discussion concerning the revision of the general education writing requirements on campus, according to Linkon.
“I wanted them to share the notion of threshold concepts and to give us an example of what happens when faculty in an academic discipline – a traditional discipline like history – start talking with people in writing as a discipline: What [do] they learn from each other?” Linkon said. “From my sense, just seeing what happened in someone else’s teaching can help all of us feel like … this would be a worthwhile thing to do.”

FILE PHOTO: SARI FRANKEL/THE HOYASales from food trucks, which now appear on campus Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, are taxed as of Oct. 1.Food trucks in the D.C. area are now required to charge a 10 percent sales tax in accordance with a new law enacted Oct. 1.
The D.C. Council approved the tax in May, requiring vendors that bring in more than $3,750 worth of sales revenue in a quarter to charge the 10 percent tax. This is the same tax that brick–and-mortar restaurants are already required to charge.
Previously, all food truck vendors were required to pay an annual $1,500 fee. Vendors that bring in less than $3,750 per quarter will still pay this fee rather than the 10 percent tax.
According to Andrew Huff, D.C. Council director of communications, this change is one of many that food trucks may encounter as the D.C. Council tries to put food trucks and traditional restaurants on more even footing.
“In our eyes, this helps to level the playing field and legitimize the food trucks and the food truck industry as businesses in the District of Columbia,” Huff said.
According to Mike Lenard, treasurer of the D.C. Food Truck Association and owner of the TaKorean food truck, this shift is a welcome one.
“We’ve never been unwilling to do something like this,” he said. “It was just never law before. … It’s obviously a big shift, but what we’re really advocating for is the regulations that will allow us to be treated more like normal businesses.”
There has been a recent push to expand the presence of food trucks on Georgetown’s grounds as one of several initiatives to bring student socializing back to campus. Owing in part to efforts by the Georgetown University Student Association, food trucks are now on campus from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.
According to Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), GUSA vice president, the new tax should not affect this initiative or students’ willingness to purchase from the trucks.
“I don’t think this will have a significant impact on the popularity of the late-night food trucks that GUSA advocated to bring to campus, and we hope that the food truck industry here in D.C. will continue to grow so that they can continue to bring their delicious wares to our campus,” Kohnert-Yount said.
