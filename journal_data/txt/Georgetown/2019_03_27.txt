Former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst pleaded not guilty to a racketeering conspiracy charge in a Boston federal court Monday, following his March 22 resignation from the University of Rhode Island.
Ernst’s plea comes after the U.S. Department of Justice brought charges against 50 defendants, including other coaches as well as parents, for college admissions fraud March 12. Eleven other defendants were arraigned with Ernst on Monday, all of whom pleaded not guilty.
The indictment alleges that Ernst accepted more than $2.7 million in bribes to falsely designate 12 applicants as athletes recruited to the tennis team to guarantee their admission to Georgetown. Ernst was released on a $200,000 bond March 12 after the indictment charges.
Ernst allegedly channeled the bribes through a charity intended to help underserved youth and used the money to purchase a house in Cape Cod, according to federal prosecutors. Prosecutors are pursuing the forfeiture of the Cape Cod estate as well as Ernst’s Chevy Chase Club membership, among other assets.
The federal judge of the arraignment also approved expanded conditions of release after Ernst filed a petition Friday to travel within the continental United States to visit his mother and look for jobs as a tennis professional.
The college admissions scheme was led by William “Rick” Singer, who pleaded guilty to four charges including racketeering conspiracy March 12. Singer owned the college consulting company that facilitated the bribes by collecting payments from parents and distributing them to coaches.
The Department of Education sent a letter to Georgetown and seven other universities Monday to alert the institutions that the Ed Department is opening its own investigation into the bribery scheme. Universities have an obligation to notify the Ed Department of any credible information that an employee may have engaged in fraud regarding federal student aid programs.
Georgetown conducted an internal investigation into Ernst’s conduct in 2017 and asked him to resign after the investigation found that Ernst had violated admissions policies, according to the university’s website.
“While evaluating applications of students who were being recruited by Mr. Ernst to play tennis, our Admissions Office discovered irregularities in the representation of their athletic abilities and other credentials,” the website said. 
Following his resignation from Georgetown, Ernst began working as a tennis coach for the University of Rhode Island. URI announced that Ernst resigned at 3:47 p.m. on Friday, March 22. URI had placed Ernst on administrative leave March 12.
URI hired Ernst after Georgetown athletic director Lee Reed gave Ernst a positive recommendation, according to a URI statement.
Georgetown removed a June 2018 press release from its website thanking Ernst, referred to as “Gordie,” for his service to the tennis team, according to an op-ed written by URI President David Dooley and URI athletic director Thorr Bjorn in the Providence Journal on March 22.
“The University wishes Gordie all the best,” the Georgetown release said.
Georgetown University Alumni Admissions Program interviewer Mickey Lee (COL ’05) emailed to the university Monday a petition with 18,000 signatures urging the university to rescind degrees and admission to those implicated in the admissions bribery scheme. Lee also blamed Georgetown Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) for the scandal and requested his resignation.
“Georgetown must lead the way and by example through this bribery scandal by doing what it can in its power to deter future attempts to bastardize the meritocracy that is supposed to be education,” Lee wrote in an email to the university president’s office. “In this case, it all starts with rescinding admissions and degrees conferred to these cheating frauds as well as having the Dean of Admissions accept responsibility by resigning from his post.”
The university has not yet issued a public response to Lee’s email.
Yale confirmed Monday that it rescinded an admissions offer for a student linked to the college admissions cheating and bribery scandal, according to the university’s website. The University of Southern California rescinded the admissions of six students implicated in the scandal March 14, according to The Washington Post.
This article was updated March 27 to correct Lee’s role as a Georgetown University Alumni Admissions Program interviewer.

The U.S. Department of Education launched an investigation into eight universities, including Georgetown, for potential misconduct relating to the admissions bribery scheme Monday.
The investigation comes two weeks after former university tennis coach Gordon Ernst was indicted by federal prosecutors for falsely designating applicants as recruits to the Georgetown tennis team. Ernst, who pleaded not guilty to the bribery charges Monday, was one of 50 individuals named in the March 12 indictment. None of the eight universities involved were charged. 
The Ed Department informed Georgetown and the seven other universities involved in the scandal that the Ed Department would examine whether the universities violated laws concerning the department’s financial aid programs or any other education regulations, according to Politico, which first reported the investigation. 
If universities have credible information about employees or applicants who engage in admissions fraud, they are obligated to notify the Department of Education, according to the Ed Department.
The university will cooperate with investigators and is dedicated to a equitable admission process, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
“Georgetown University takes seriously its responsibility to comply with federal law and will cooperate with the United States Department of Education’s investigation,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are committed to an admissions process that includes a fair, holistic review of each application.”
The Ed Department has the authority to impose sanctions on an educational institution that misrepresents the programs it offers, according to the letter. The letter sent to Georgetown asked for details about how the college presented its admissions policy to consumers and any reviews that the university has done of admissions decisions for recruited athletes.
The Ed Department also requested the university identify all students who were mentioned in the Department of Justice indictment and show the department the admission files, transcripts and any financial aid packages that the students involved had received. The Ed Department was not available for comment as of press time. 
There is no indication that Georgetown officials other than Ernst were involved in the admissions bribes, Vice President and General Counsel Lisa Brown and Vice President and Senior Advisor to the President Erik Smulson wrote in a March 12 email to the campus community. The university has taken new initiatives to reduce fraud for candidates applying as student athletes, such as audits to determine whether recruited athletes appear on rosters. 
In addition to Ernst, the March 12 indictment named Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez, Douglas Hodge, Elisabeth Kimmel and Stephen Semprevivo, all of whom have or had children at Georgetown University between 2013 and 2019. The parents allegedly paid a test proctor to supervise the SAT for their children and falsified athletic records and admissions essays, according to the charges.
Yale University, one of the eight universities under investigation, confirmed the Ed Department’s investigation in a March 26 news release.
“We are reviewing the department’s requests and will respond appropriately,” Yale University President Peter Salovey wrote.
Georgetown also currently faces a class action lawsuit in relation to the admissions bribery scheme, filed March 15 by two college students and two parents. The unfair admissions process at the schools involved in the alleged scheme economically and emotionally harmed the students who were rejected from the schools, according to the lawsuit.

Jewish Life at Georgetown celebrated its 50th anniversary March 22 with a special Shabbat that brought together current and former students and faculty to remember the history of the Jewish community at Georgetown University.
The event included Shabbat prayer services as well as speeches by students and administrators. Numerous Jewish alumni and professors attended the ceremony, and University President John J. DeGioia gave the opening address.
Jewish Life, the Jewish faith chaplaincy at Georgetown established in 1969, runs weekly Shabbat services, hosts celebrations of recognized holidays and organizes community events
Georgetown and its students have benefited from the contributions of the Jewish community and faith tradition, DeGioia said, referring to the Jewish concept of tikkun olam, which translates from Hebrew to literally mean “repair the world” and has to many become representative of the pursuit of social justice. 
“We have a richer understanding of what it means to be a university when we are inspired by the spirit of tikkun olam, and for this, we are all deeply grateful,” DeGioia said in his speech. “We are a stronger community because of the presence of this faith community.”
Reflecting on the past of the Jewish people is critical for the future of the community, according to Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), manager of special projects at the Museum of Jewish Heritage and a former historian for the Georgetown University Student Association.
“The stories and figures of our communal past contain powerful lessons for us,” Goldstein said in his speech. “Discerning those lessons is a job for each of us that we each must take on for ourselves as part of a collective conversation.” 
Jewish life on campus started in 1834, when the Marx Lazarus enrolled as the first Jewish student to attend Georgetown. Still, Jewish students faced significant barriers finding their way to the Hilltop long after. The university imposed a quota to limit the Jewish student population to five individuals each year throughout the earlier half of the 20th century.
Georgetown hired its first full-time rabbi in 1968, more than a century after Lazarus enrolled at the university. While the university had historically hired part-time rabbis, Rabbi Harold White became the first full-time rabbi at a Catholic university in the United States. 
White, who retired from Georgetown in 2010 and died in 2015, also played an important role in creating the university’s Center for Jewish Civilization — referred to as the Program for Jewish Civilization when it was founded. 
The CJC, a teaching and research center in the School of Foreign Service founded in 2003 that offers classes on Jewish civilization, is one of many outlets that have developed alongside Jewish Life to support the Jewish community on campus, including the Bayit LLC, a residential community to celebrate Jewish culture and heritage.
The Jewish chaplaincy’s primary goal has been to develop and connect Jewish students, according to its website.
“Jewish Life at Georgetown aspires to advance the life and growth of every self-defined Jewish student through building their sense of Jewish Connection, Confidence, and Concern,” the website reads.
Experiences at Georgetown foster a stronger sense of Jewish identity for many Jewish-identifying students on campus, according to Goldstein. 
“Virtually every single alumnus with whom I spoke told me that they graduated more knowledgeable, proud and engaged in Judaism than having entered Georgetown, and attending this Jesuit, Catholic school strengthened their Jewish identity,” Goldstein said in his speech.
Jewish Life is still grappling with the diversity of its community members, and opinions surrounding contentious issues like Israel continue to pose challenges, according to Katie Wysong (SFS ’19),  a member of the on-campus Jewish community. Acts of hate against the Jewish faith both at Georgetown and nationally also remind Jewish Life members of existential concerns for their community. 
“As our community has grown, these questions become more centrally engaged with,” Wysong said. “We also face external threats, with the swastikas drawn across campus and the Pittsburgh shooting last year demonstrating it all too clearly.”
This struggle and debate, however, has contributed to the strength of the Jewish community on campus, according to Wysong.
“However, out of those difficult moments and difficult conversations, we emerge stronger,” Wysong said in a speech. 
Though the event served to remember the Jewish community’s past on campus, it also served as a prayer for its continued strength and vitality at Georgetown, according to Rabbi Rachel Gartner, director for Jewish life on campus.
“Tonight we will celebrate the generations of Jewish Hoyas and our staff who have fuelled and fanned the flames of Jewish life so that it could shine as brightly and as powerfully as it does right now through the eyes of the myriad students in this very room tonight,” Gartner said at the event.

Georgetown University ranked ninth among medium-sized universities for the number of alumni joining the Peace Corps in 2018, the organization announced March 21.
With 27 undergraduates joining in 2018, Georgetown ranked among the top 25 volunteer-producing medium-sized schools; however, the number marks a marginal drop from 2017, when the Peace Corps announced Georgetown had provided 31 volunteers and ranked sixth among similarly sized schools.
The Peace Corps was founded by President John F. Kennedy to develop service-learning opportunities that create long-lasting change in communities across the globe. Georgetown’s top ranking with the Peace Corps reflects the similarity between the service-oriented goals of the two institutions, according to Emily Zenick (GRD ’98), chief of staff of the School of Foreign Service.
“The goals of the Peace Corps dovetail perfectly with the mission of Georgetown — to train people in key areas to provide needed services to people in other countries,” Zenick, a Peace Corps alumna herself, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Service work opportunities and organizations like the Peace Corps have consistently had a strong relationship with Georgetown because of the university’s commitment to its Jesuit values, according to Beth Schill, an adviser at the Cawley Career Education Center whose focus includes the Peace Corps.
“Georgetown’s mission of preparing students to be persons for and with others, combined with the intellectual curiosity students have about our world is a perfect match for the mission of the Peace Corps,” Schill wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Volunteers with the Peace Corps sign a two-year contract to work in a country abroad to work on an issue area such as education, health or economic development. Applicants select a specific country they intend to volunteer in during their period of service and interview via video conference before receiving an acceptance. 
Among medium-sized universities, considered schools between 5,000 and 10,000 undergraduate students, The George Washington University produced the most undergraduate alumni volunteers at 54, according to the report. The University of Wisconsin-Madison led large-sized universities with 75 undergraduate alumni joining the Peace Corps in 2018.
The Peace Corps provides an effective way to channel American values abroad, according to Grace Nagel (COL ’11), who is currently focusing on female empowerment in Senegal.
“Serving in the Peace Corps is not the same as taking up arms for one’s country, but Peace Corps Volunteers are often the closest thing to an American ambassador in many corners of the world,” Nagel wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Knowing that I could represent the best ideals of America — diversity, friendliness, and positivity — was inspiring to me.”
Beyond bringing important values to Senegal, the Peace Corps immerses its volunteers in different cultures, according to Nagel.
“Peace Corps Volunteers must integrate into their community — you cannot develop effective trainings or encourage behavior change if you don’t live how your community lives,” Nagel wrote.
More than 980 Georgetown graduates have volunteered with the Peace Corps since its founding in 1961, according to the organization. The university readies its students for the responsibility of a Peace Corps volunteer from both its commitment to teaching international perspectives and its on-campus opportunities, according to volunteers.
Service initiatives housed in the Georgetown Center for Social Justice can help prepare students for work in the Peace Corps, according to Joy Robertson (SFS ’16), who is currently a teacher in Mozambique.
“I was active in (probably too many) student organizations as an undergrad, but I can definitely attribute my comfort in the classroom to being a DC Reads tutor and a co-teacher in the Summer Institute for Teaching and Learning (STIL), both housed in the incredible CSJ,” Robertson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown prepares students for larger service efforts such as the Peace Corps by examining issues through both a global and community lens, according to Bianca Clark (SFS ’18), who is focusing on youth development in Morocco.
“The discussions I had on campus, both inside the classroom and out, have allowed me to see my service in a greater social justice context and solidified my commitment to the use of community assets to address community identified needs,” Clark wrote in an email to The Hoya.
