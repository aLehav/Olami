John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79) stepped modestly up to the podium a decade ago to address over 2,000 faculty, staff, students and alumni gathered there to honor him.
“Good afternoon, and thank you. It is a profound honor to accept this responsibility today as the 48th president of Georgetown University,” the newly inaugurated president said.
Ten years later, DeGioia has overseen the largest expansion of campus facilities in university history. From establishing auxiliary campuses both across the river in Virginia and halfway around the globe in the Middle East, to overseeing an over 50 percent growth in the university endowment and strengthening many of its academic disciplines from business to regional studies, DeGioia has left his mark on the past decade.
“President DeGioia’s leadership has built upon the foundations of excellence and strategic growth that his predecessors have laid down,” said Dan Porterfield (CAS ’83), a close friend to DeGioia and former senior vice president for strategic development.
LOOKING OUT FROM WITHIN
Much about DeGioia is unique in Georgetown history. He is the first lay president of a Jesuit university in America, breaking the line of 47 ordained predecessors. Consequently, he is the first to have a family of his own, with his wife, Theresa, and young son, J.T.
“He really was a major forerunner in showing the 28 Jesuit colleges and universities that a layperson could lead a Catholic institution with fidelity to its religious mission,” Porterfield said.
Despite the non-traditional choice by the board of directors, DeGioia gained the backing of the majority of the community almost immediately; his reputation as a deft administrator preceded him.
Porterfield recalled that there was unanimity among the Jesuits on the board of directors about the choice.
“Fr. Brian McDermont, S.J., said at the time, speaking for the Jesuits on the board of directors, that they believed Jack DeGioia was a ‘providential decision for the next president,'” Porterfield said.
Before his appointment, DeGioia had spent his entire professional life on the Hilltop. After receiving his diploma in 1979, he took a job as hall director in New South Hall. In 1982, he began work as an assistant to former University President Timothy S. Healy, S.J.
He rose quickly through the ranks, becoming dean of student affairs as a 28-year-old in 1985. He was appointed associate vice president and chief administrative officer for the main campus in 1992.
In 1998, former University President Leo J. O’Donovan, S.J. (CAS ’56), put him in charge of fixing the finances of Georgetown University Medical Center, giving DeGioia the title of senior vice president.
Three years later, when it came time for a search committee to choose the next president of the nation’s oldest Catholic university, its members settled on DeGioia. Leaders were impressed with his work negotiating a complex financial deal to sell the clinical operations of GUMC to MedStar while retaining the academic institution of the medical school.
DeGioia’s long tenure on the Hilltop also made him a logical fit for a leader.
“He came to the job with exquisite experience. … I think at the time of his election he knew more about Georgetown University than anyone but God,” Fr. Otto Hentz, S.J., said.
In-depth knowledge of his alma mater gave him the ability to manage and transform the institution effectively. But Special Assistant to the President for China Affairs Dennis McManus, S.J., commented that over 35 years at Georgetown has not boxed in DeGioia’s perspective. Hentz agreed.
“People wondered that since all his years had been at Georgetown, he might be narrowly focused, but the opposite is just the case,” Hentz said. “His vision is very broad.”
According to Hentz, one of DeGioia’s greatest strengths is his hiring of quality staff to manage the complex operations of the university.
“My impression is that he’s an effective administrator because he hires effective administrators. What amazes me is how much he is on top of all that’s going on at the university,” he said.
PRESERVING A JESUIT IDENTITY
Ten years later it seems that any question of DeGioia’s commitment to the university’s Jesuit and Catholic identity has all but disappeared. According to McManus, of all the achievements the president has made over his 10 years, one of the greatest has been the strengthening and rejuvenation of Georgetown’s Jesuit character.
Current Vice President of Mission and Ministry Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (COL ’88), agreed that DeGioia has carried on the founding principles of the university.
“He has been very intentional about promoting the Catholic and Jesuit character,” O’Brien said.
Hentz explained that, being Jesuits, many of DeGioia’s predecessors became complacent with the school’s identity.
“In the ’50s and even the ’60s, we sort of took it for granted. There’s no cruise control in these matters,” he said. “In some ways, his commitment to the Catholic, Jesuit identity of Georgetown is more impressive precisely because he is not a Jesuit.”
As the first lay president, DeGioia engaged actively in promoting the ideals of the order. He instituted seminars on Ignatian spirituality for senior administrators and the Board of Trustees to help teach the leaders of Georgetown what it meant to be a Catholic and Jesuit university.
In 2003, DeGioia instituted the Office of Mission and Ministry to augment his efforts to preserve the university’s spiritual heritage. He has consistently chosen a Jesuit to fill that role — the singular priest in the senior administration hierarchy.
Those close to DeGioia emphasized that he personally is deeply ingrained in the Catholic spirituality of the order. He has twice made the full 30-day journey of the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises, the backbone of Jesuit spirituality, according to O’Brien.
Out of his active pursuit of the university’s traditional heritage has come an enhanced commitment to interreligious dialogue. Under DeGioia, multiple conferences have drawn religious leaders from around the world to campus to discuss global faith interactions and understanding.
He also makes a trip to Rome every year to meet with the superior general of the Society of Jesus, the leader of the Jesuits, as well as leaders from the Vatican. Stemming from his conversations with Jesuit leaders have come some of his plans for Georgetown’s international engagement.
“Our education must be put in service to the world,” O’Brien said. “It is both our goal and our way of operating.”
LEADING AN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
The extension of the university into the global sphere has been one of the most significant developments of DeGioia’s term. Porterfield drew a connection between DeGioia’s work worldwide to former President Healy’s work nationally. Healy is credited with transforming Georgetown from a local institution to a national center of higher education. Porterfield said DeGioia engineered a similar change from a national to international university.
The past 10 years have seen an unprecedented increase in international engagement. Georgetown opened a branch of its School of Foreign Service in Doha, Qatar in 2005. It has made key investments in partnerships with both India and Israel, as well as in China, a process that culminated in a high-profile trip by the men’s basketball team to that country this summer.
McManus noted that DeGioia’s work in the international sphere presented a vastly different set of challenges from Healy’s national development.
“It’s a very different world. It’s a very diverse world,” McManus said. “When you try to go global you not only have the issue of languages, but you have discrepancies in levels of socioeconomic development.”
Porterfield postulated that the university still had a lot to discover about its international engagement.
“It’s not clear what will define institutions as global,” Porterfield said. “Out of a sheer force of conviction that it would empower Georgetown … for future generations to develop global relationships now … he was committed to building the relationship because he saw the long-term strategic value.”
“A different president might not have chosen to do that work,” Porterfield added.
GROWTH ON THE HOMEFRONT
Back on the main campus, DeGioia has overseen impressive growth on the Hilltop. With the building of the Southwest Quad, Rafik B. Hariri Building, Davis Performing Arts Center and the under-construction New Science Center, Georgetown will complete the largest expansion of campus facilities in university history.
Overall university property has also expanded significantly with the opening of the Qatar campus, the Clarendon location for the School of Continuing Studies and the groundbreaking for the Calcagnini Contemplative Center in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Porterfield said that the new space has drastically improved student life on campus.
“[The expansion of facilities] drastically enhances the university’s competitiveness,” he said.
Under DeGioia’s leadership, the U.S. News and World Report ranking has stayed fairly constant from 23 in 2001 to 22 in 2011, rising to 21 at its highest. He also worked extensively to shore up university finances in order to facilitate the university’s growth.
“Clearly his focus in stabilizing the financial platform of the university has been a priority,” said Erik Smulson, vice president for public affairs and senior adviser to the president. “It gave confidence to some of our alumni and donors that we would be a good manager of the funds that they were willing to give us.”
In 2004, the university created the Investment Office and appointed a the first chief investment officer to oversee the growth of Georgetown’s endowment.
Since DeGioia took office in 2001, the endowment has grown over 50 percent to top $1 billion. This remains modest with respect to peer institutions, but growth continues to offset operating costs and provide additional financial stability.
Under DeGioia, a $1 billion fundraising campaign was completed in 2003. At the end of this month, another $1.5 billion capital campaign, which has already hit its halfway mark, will enter its public phase.
Solidifying the financial base was necessary for one of DeGioia’s other main priorities to become possible: Meeting the full need of all applicants, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
“The first pillar of the [capital] campaign is scholarships,” Smulson said. “He recognizes that making institutions of higher education affordable for students from all economic backgrounds is a key priority.”
ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY
Amid the turmoil of the ongoing campus plan battle, DeGioia has experience on his side.
This is his second time as president encountering opposition from the surrounding community. He inherited a contentious situation with the 2000 Campus Plan, which was ultimately resolved in court in 2003. He also played a significant role in his position as a senior administrator during the 1990 Campus Plan proceedings.
The DeGioia administration has made a conscious effort to play a positive role in the District and its surrounding areas. “Our engagement in the city … has never been greater,” Smulson said.
According to Smulson, both the construction of the Southwest Quadrangle, which allowed more students to live in campus residences, and the Ward 7 initiative, which is a partnership between Georgetown and the Meyers Institute for College Prep, have been significant investments in improving neighborhood relations.
But for all his work at Georgetown and around the globe, many administrators emphasize a single point: DeGioia’s commitment to the undergraduate experience.
“His ability to translate to faculty and senior leaders why we value the development of undergraduates … has very significantly affected choices that senior leaders make in how to respond to student needs,” Porterfield said.
DeGioia has remained active in the academy, teaching an Ignatius Seminar for freshmen in the College. According to Smulson, who served as his chief of staff for four years, his class and weekly office hours are some of the most important events on his calendar.
However, some students feel that DeGioia could engage more on campus.
Brad Hilson (COL ’12) echoed that sentiment. “I never see him on campus. I’ve been here for three and a half years now and I never see him … I don’t think he’s a very student-oriented person.”
A JUGGLING ACT
For a university president, however, the job is much more than just community relations and fundraising campaigns. Those close to him say that the non-stop commitment takes its toll and that DeGioia doesn’t give an inch.
“There is no person in this university, not one, who would ever tell you that when they were working with President DeGioia, they worked harder than him,” Porterfield said. “He has been a servant-leader in the role of president in support of Georgetown University and its people.”

As Arthur Calcagnini (C ’54) stood looking over the Blue Ridge Mountains last Friday while he prepared to break ground on the retreat center named for him, he reflected on his path to the Calcagnini Contemplative Center’s actualization.
“This is a dream that I’ve had that’s taken a long time to come to fruition,” Calcagnini said shortly before he and members of the administration picked up their shovels and began the ceremony. Once complete, the center will serve a variety of campus retreat programs year round. The programs that will soon make their home at the center include ESCAPE, a secular overnight retreat for first-year and transfer students that provides participants with a chance to reflect on their first year at Georgetown. Calcagnini himself has funded the program since 1991.
The center’s future home encompasses 55 acres nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, about a 75 minute drive from Georgetown’s main campus.
“When we first saw this place, we knew that this was it. It was love at first sight,” Calcagnini said.
According to university officials, the completed project will include a historic home, a chapel, community and dining halls and 28 cabins to house up to 78 students.
Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., the vice president of Mission and Ministry, spoke to the sanctity of the location.
“Mountains are a place to meet our God. Just like our Hilltop, today we add another holy mountain to Georgetown,” O’Brien said.
This milestone marked the latest chapter in Calcagnini’s twenty-year dream to construct the university’s own space for the wide range of spiritual retreats offered throughout the year.
He and his wife, Nancy, who financed the popular ESCAPE program with a $1.5 million endowment in 1991, pledged their support for this project with a $17 million donation.
Friday’s groundbreaking marked the culmination of a lengthy search to find and acquire a suitable property for the Contemplative Center.
The idea was conceived 20 years ago when Calcagnini, a member of Georgetown’s board of directors’ committee on religious affairs, attended an ESCAPE weekend after providing funding for the program.
The retreat became an annual tradition for him, and seeing the impact that the program has on students is what drove him to fund the new center.
“Receiving a letter from a student saying this has been the most formative experience of their life — it’s all worth it,” he said. “We feel so blessed that we have the means to share with [Georgetown] the funding for this special place.”
The Calcagninis have spent much of the last 10 years personally working to find a proper location. The search was prolonged by the difficulty of finding an appropriate site within a 90-minute drive from campus. After choosing Bluemont, Va. for the site, the administration spent two years negotiating and working with the Clarke County board of supervisors to gain approval for the proposed construction.
The construction of the center is far from complete, as contractors will have to complete major improvements to the site over the next two years. This includes moving a historic house to another spot on the property, to allow for the construction of additional facilities.
O’Brien said the finished site will be able to accommodate multiple retreats at the same time, with enough facilities for both separate and communal activities. For him, this sentiment expresses the core Georgetown value of interreligious understanding.
As University President John J. DeGioia looked ahead in his opening speech to the reflective space’s contribution to university life, he spoke of such an outlook.
“It will be here, in the Calcagnini Contemplative Center, where the members of our community [can] seek out our deepest inner truths, discover the best version of ourselves and renew our commitment to our mission,” he said.
For the immediate future, programs like ESCAPE and AGAPE will continue to operate out of the Shepherd Springs Outdoor Ministry Center in Sharpsburg, Md.
“We’ve been going there for the past 10 or 11 years. They’ve been very hospitable and welcoming to us, but we’re not the only group to use that space,” Sherry said.
For that reason, Sherry looks forward to the center’s completion.
“I think making a space that is really ours is going to be phenomenal. The added flexibility may allow for program enlargement and growth in the future,” she added.
But for Calcagnini, breaking ground on the new center meant something more.
“This is one of the happiest days of my life,” he said.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton directly challenged the throng of students crowding the upper floor of Gaston Hall this morning to work toward improving the system of higher education in India.
“A democracy depends on education and an educated citizenry. At the highest levels of government, we are committed to this, but the success of these efforts will be determined by you, those outside government,” Clinton said.
Clinton’s speech kicked off the U.S.-India Higher Education Summit, aimed at brainstorming ways that U.S. and Indian citizens and officials can form strategic partnerships. In a day filled with roundtables and breakout sessions, other notable speakers included U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Robert Blake, Indian Ambassador to the U.S. Nirupama Rao, Indian Minister of Human Resource Development Kapil Sibaland various university presidents.
Speaking for about 10 minutes to a packed crowd of Indian and U.S. government officials, university faculty and staff and about 150 students, Clinton recounted her own college years.
“When I first started out at Wellesley, I wanted to win a Fulbright to India. Unfortunately, due to political reasons that program was suspended,” she said. “But now, [years later], I see higher education as an even greater passport to opportunity and understanding.”
While she began with a quip encouraging students to join the foreign service, she proceeded to emphasize how they can also make a tremendous impact through exchanges, internships and service projects.
“We want to see more students enrolling for credit at Indian institutions. I’m asking you to develop direct connections.”
Clinton’s keynote address set the tone for the summit, which is the result of collaboration between President Barack Obama and Indian President Manhoman Singh. She outlined the partnership between the two leaders, which has provided millions of dollars for development between the two countries. She added that the United States has more faculty exchange programs with India, the world’s largest democracy and one of the most rapidly growing economies, than any other country. She emphasized, however, that the burden of improving the quality of higher education in India will fall on the private sector.
“I’d like to challenge all of us to jumpstart these kinds of connections. There is no better way to do it than brainstorm in sessions this afternoon. How can our universities deepen collaboration, work on research and set goals we can work on meeting?” she asked. “What institutional barriers can we and should we break down?”
This partnership is the way of the future, according to Clinton.
“For those of you watching the great rise of India, I hope you are as excited as we are,” she said, before highlighting India’s plurality and potential. “We want these two great democracies to be as interconnected as possible.”

The Department of Public Safety warned campus to stay on the lookout for a suspicious person who has attempted to enter multiple residence halls without identification.
In an alert posted on its website Wednesday afternoon,DPS provided a photo of the suspect, who is described as a 5-foot-10 black male of medium build with short dreadlocks. Although the alert can be accessed from theDPS website, it was not emailed to members of the campus community.
According to DPS, the suspect was first seen attempting to enter Harbin Hall without a GOCard on an unspecified date. When the Allied Barton security guard would not let him proceed, the suspect said that he was meeting with two friends but did not know their room number. The suspect then had a conversation with the guard for about 25 minutes before leaving the building.
In a second incident just after midnight on Oct. 1, the same suspect tried to walk past the Village C East security guard without presenting identification. When the guard confronted him, he said that he was meeting up with a friend and then left the building.
The suspect in these incidents bears a similarity to the descriptions of suspects in several previous incidents. The suspects in a rash of burglaries this semester were described as black males, about 5-foot-8 to 5-foot-10 in height and of medium build — matching the description of the suspect in theDPS alert.
At 11 a.m. on Saturday, a Nevils Hall resident woke to find a similarly described suspect in his apartment. When the student attempted to question the suspect, he took the student’s backpack and fled. Two weeks earlier, DPS reported that a black male of a similar description stole laptops, an unspecified amount of U.S. currency and several electronic items from LXR and Harbin Halls on Sept. 16 and Sept. 17, respectively.
Representatives of DPS did not respond by press time to requests for further comment.

Burleith Citizens’ Association President Lenore Rubino announced that she will step down from her position as president when her term ends in early November, according to the October edition of the Burleith Bell, the BCA’s monthly newsletter.
Attorney Chris Clements, who has represented the BCA and the Citizens Association of Georgetown in D.C. Zoning Commission hearings of the 2010 Georgetown Campus Plan, will run for the position at the organization’s elections on Nov. 3.
Though she did not specify why she would not be running for the position again in her newsletter announcement, Rubino expressed confidence in her successor.
“His intelligence and dedication has garnered the respect of the BCA Board, the ANC and the [Citizen’s] Association of Georgetown,” she wrote. “He is committed to the well-being of our community.
Rubino has opposed Georgetown’s 2010 Campus Plan and student rental of properties in Burleith throughout her term as BCA president.
The Hoya reported on Oct. 4 that Rubino publicly applauded Mayor Vincent Gray for condemning the Campus Plan at the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E’s October meeting.
“We’ve witnessed the devastating loss of single-family homes being turned into student housing,” she said at the meeting.
Rubino also co-chaired the task force that drafted the ANC’s initial redistricting proposal this summer. The proposal, which recommended the creation of an eighth single-member district, has been criticized as unrepresentative of the student population.
Alykhan Merali (SFS ’13), spokesman for the student advocacy group DC Students Speak, said that he doubts this change in leadership will improve relations between the university and the community.
“I understand that her successor [Chris Clements] led the testimony against the Campus Plan at the zoning commission hearings, so I’m not exactly sure as to whether our relations will improve. But we do hope to have more dialogue with BCA,” he said.
Rubino and Clements did not respond to requests for comment by press time.

From alerting residents about flying debris during Hurricane Irene to relaying the threat of an armed gunman at the Law Center’s campus, the HOYAlert system has become a staple of university communication this year. Over 15,550 students, faculty and staff are subscribed to HOYAlert, the Office of University Safety system that updates the community about real-time changes to the university’s operating status due to inclement weather and immediate safety threats. “The HOYAlert system is designed as an opt-in system, where members of the community choose to enroll in the system in order to receive alerts,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh wrote in an email. “It serves as one of the primary means of communication in the event of an incident that poses a life safety threat to members of the Georgetown University community.” Participation in the system requires a university NetID and the selection of a primary on-campus location with which the individual identifies as his or her primary location — typically one’s residence hall or apartment. Although electing to receive HOYAlerts is entirely voluntary, the Office of University Safety strongly encourages students, faculty and staff to sign up for the system. “The importance of enrolling in HOYAlert cannot be understated,” Pugh wrote. According to her, the development of the HOYAlert system was prompted by the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech, after which several universities instituted emergency notifications systems. However, concerns about delayed response time were heightened by the possible gunman on the Georgetown Law Center campus two weeks ago. Those on the main campus subscribed to HOYAlert received a text message from the university at around 1:40 p.m. to alert them of the event though the gunman was reported near the Law Center at approximately 12:30 p.m. Some students were initially alarmed by a lack of communication from the university after Vital Vittles and the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union temporarily closed after hearing of the threat around 1 p.m. The main campus alert was the second in a series of text messages sent to HOYAlert participants, according to Pugh. The first was sent to individuals enrolled in the system who identified themselves as members of the Law Center campus. Pugh acknowledged the difficulty of distributing information as quickly as possible, however. “Every situation is unique, and delivery time is impacted by cellular network coverage, carrier infrastructure and a variety of other factors,” Pugh wrote. HOYAlert operates under the guidelines established by the university’s Department of Emergency Management & Operation Continuity, and its use in individual situations is based on the input of law enforcement professionals, according to Pugh. The text, voice and email messaging system is part of a larger university communication network that is intended to alert students through multiple means in the case of an emergency. This includes broadcast emails sent to all university members, preparedness website updates, banners on the Georgetown website, GU cable television banners and the network of building and floor marshals. “We take the safety and security of our community very seriously, and we are always reviewing our procedures to see how we can enhance them,” Pugh wrote. Many students have taken the warnings of the Office of University Safety to heart and signed up for the service in order to remain aware of campus safety concerns. “I think it lets you know important safety information on campus that you wouldn’t necessarily know,” Courtney Ingard (COL ’15) said. For Ingard, the service helped when the university sent a mass text messages alerting students about the possibility of a gas leak in Maguire Hall in mid-September. “I have a class in McGuire and it just made me more aware, so I could avoid the area,” she said. Others, however, do not see the merits of a system that they feel is overbearing. “I didn’t even know about it,” Elizabeth DeRosa (COL ’13) said. “I think the emails are sufficient to my knowledge of what’s going on.” “There’s so much crime at this school, and I don’t like getting flooded with text messages,” Claire Hardwick (COL ’12) said.

Georgetown’s debate team shot to the top of the Cross Examination Debate Association national rankings of collegiate debate teams on Tuesday after winning the Henry Clay Debates at the University of Kentucky.
Andrew Markoff (SFS ’14) and Andrew Arsht (COL ’14) were voted to the No. 1 spot by their debating peers this week.
According to Jonathan Paul, director of Georgetown’s debate program, participating college policy debate programs submit a ballot every week ranking the current top teams in the nation.
While the poll is the closest college policy programs have to an official survey of the best teams, it is only one indication of how well the team is doing at a particular point during the season, according to Paul.
“This particular poll is followed by most major college policy programs since it was established,” Paul said. “But similar to college sports, it is still just a poll and only a recognition of how we are performing at a given point in the year.”
Competing in a field of 153 teams, Markoff and Arsht rode a 6-2 preliminary record to reach the elimination rounds of the Henry Clay Debates, where the two sophomores won the votes of all three judges in each round, eventually winning the entire tournament. They defeated teams from Baylor University, Liberty University, Emory University and Dartmouth College.
Markoff and Arsht also were ranked the third- and fifth-best individual speakers, respectively, for the tournament.
The team debated whether or not the U.S. Federal Government should substantially increase its democracy assistance for one or more of the following: Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen.
Georgetown also fielded a second team composed of Richard Day (SFS ’14) and Tyler Engler (SFS ’15) that advanced to the elimination rounds after a 6-2 record in the preliminaries.
The debate team’s recent success marks the second year of the program’s restoration of the prominence it had in the 1970s. While the team was ranked ninth in the national rankings last fall, the debate program was positioned between first and third and won the Copeland Award from the National Debate Tournament five times this decade. The team fell from its prestigious acclaim when Debate Coach Jim Unger left the university. The program has been on the upswing since Paul was hired to mentor the students, however.
Even with the top ranking and finish, Markoff and Arsht said they are already focusing on tournaments later on this season.
“The real accolades are awarded at the National Debate Tournament in late March,” Paul said. “We are obviously all thrilled with the latest ranking, but we are more focused on getting ready for our next tournament.”
To prepare for tournaments, the debaters spend 30 to 40 hours every week tackling new topics and conducting research.
“You do research to develop sets of arguments that you think give you a strategic advantage in a debate,” Markoff said.
He added that it is a combination of individual sacrifice and group effort that drives the team.
“It requires a relentless amount of individual effort,” Markoff said, adding that this effort goes toward the team’s end product. “All of us are pretty focused on winning as a team.”
The team’s next tournament will be at Harvard over Halloween weekend, where they will compete against roughly 102 other teams for the championship.
“Our mantra for the year has been to take it ‘one debate at a time,’ and we will continue to do that in our preparation for Harvard,” Paul said. “There are a lot of great teams competing this year, and we will strive to be prepared for every contingency.”
Paul added that as the team has become more successful in competition, it has also seen an expansion in membership.
“Our team is steadily growing, and I’ve been humbled by the interest in the program from top high school debaters and other students on campus,” Paul said. “We’ve tripled in size over the last two years and because the current team is only freshmen and sophomores, we look poised to grow even more over the next few years.”

“The importance of enrolling in HOYAlert cannot be understated,” Pugh wrote.
According to her, the development of the HOYAlert system was prompted by the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech, after which several universities instituted emergency notifications systems.
However, concerns about delayed response time were heightened by the possible gunman on the Georgetown Law Center campus two weeks ago. Those on the main campus subscribed to HOYAlert received a text message from the university at around 1:40 p.m. to alert them of the event though the gunman was reported near the Law Center at approximately 12:30 p.m. Some students were initially alarmed by a lack of communication from the university after Vital Vittles and the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union temporarily closed after hearing of the threat around 1 p.m.
The main campus alert was the second in a series of text messages sent to HOYAlert participants, according to Pugh. The first was sent to individuals enrolled in the system who identified themselves as members of the Law Center campus.
Pugh acknowledged the difficulty of distributing information as quickly as possible, however.
“Every situation is unique, and delivery time is impacted by cellular network coverage, carrier infrastructure and a variety of other factors,” Pugh wrote.
HOYAlert operates under the guidelines established by the university’s Department of Emergency Management & Operation Continuity, and its use in individual situations is based on the input of law enforcement professionals, according to Pugh.
The text, voice and email messaging system is part of a larger university communication network that is intended to alert students through multiple means in the case of an emergency. This includes broadcast emails sent to all university members, preparedness website updates, banners on the Georgetown website, GU cable television banners and the network of building and floor marshals.
“We take the safety and security of our community very seriously, and we are always reviewing our procedures to see how we can enhance them,” Pugh wrote.
Many students have taken the warnings of the Office of University Safety to heart and signed up for the service in order to remain aware of campus safety concerns.
“I think it lets you know important safety information on campus that you wouldn’t necessarily know,” Courtney Ingard (COL ’15) said.
For Ingard, the service helped when the university sent a mass text messages alerting students about the possibility of a gas leak in Maguire Hall in mid-September.
“I have a class in McGuire and it just made me more aware, so I could avoid the area,” she said.
Others, however, do not see the merits of a system that they feel is overbearing.
“I didn’t even know about it,” Elizabeth DeRosa (COL ’13) said. “I think the emails are sufficient to my knowledge of what’s going on.”
“There’s so much crime at this school, and I don’t like getting flooded with text messages,” Claire Hardwick (COL ’12) said.

Ye Domesday Booke, the university’s yearbook since 1905, was dropped as a student organization from the Media Board two weeks ago.
The Media Board, which oversees all student publications, voted to terminate the yearbook’s status as a student organization on Sept. 30, three days after sending an email to the student body encouraging people to apply for co-editorship positions.
The move came after several years of low student interest in one of the university’s oldest publications, according to Vice Chair of the Media Board Chris Cronbaugh (COL ’12).
While Cronbaugh emphasized that the yearbook’s organizational status change does not jeopardize its publication, losing the backing of the Media Board, in addition to a lack of leadership and undergraduate participation, is likely to strain the perpetually understaffed group.
Former Ye Domesday Booke Editor-in-Chief Ashley Angelotti (SFS ’11) fears that the yearbook will no longer include some of the unique features that it was able to add as a sanctioned student publication.
“If the students want that, then they have to show the administration and the Media Board that they are willing to work for it,” she wrote in an email.
The yearbook’s fate has been precarious for the past few years, following the rise of social networking and declining awareness of Ye Domesday Booke’s existence. With the advent of sites such as Facebook, students now have free access to photos and comments that would normally be featured in the annual book.
Current transition editor Ciara Foldenauer (COL ’14) said that it has been hard to attract attention to a publication that she believes is dropping in popularity across the board.
“Maybe it’s not really a college thing anymore,” she said, pointing out the decisions of other universities, namely Mount Holyoke College and Wesleyan University, to discontinue the publication of their yearbooks.
Foldenauer also said that people who are interested in publishing, writing and photography have gravitated toward more visible on-campus publications.
With the current lack of interest in Ye Domesday Booke, Foldenauer questioned whether this year’s edition will get published.
Despite the $1,000 stipend and free summer housing provided for co-editors of Ye Domesday Booke, fewer than one dozen people have applied for the position this year.
However, 12 to 15 people have expressed interest in engaging with the yearbook this year in lesser roles.
“We never got around to actually staffing people because there wasn’t enough interest,” Foldenauer said.
The yearbook depends heavily on student contributions, but most undergraduates seem hesitant to help because of the workload required, according to Foldenauer.
“There are other things I could be doing with my summer that are more useful for my future career,” Preston Mui (COL ’13) said.
Because it involves a lengthy production process, Ye Domesday Booke requires its staff to live at the university over the summer in order to reach the deadline for its publication.
“How do we balance the institutional value of having a yearbook with perceived low interest on the part of students?” Erika Cohen-Derr, director of the center for student programs, said. “The physical nature of the yearbook does make it special, but all options are on the table.”
While many sympathize with the yearbook’s predicament, Jordan Moeny (SFS ’15) said the legacy of the publication does not necessarily make it an integral component of university life.
“I think it’s unfortunate. … But life will go on,” she said.

This month students are wearing their pride on their sleeves as the university celebrates OUTober and LGBT History Month.
GU Pride, Georgetown’s undergraduate LGBTQ organization, handed out 200 blue “I Am” T-shirts to faculty, staff and students in Red Square Tuesday to celebrate Coming Out Day, the first event in a month-long series commemorating LGBT history month.
The event, now in its seventh year, aims to increase visibility on campus of both LGBTQ students and allies. Students spent Monday night covering Red Square with chalked messages of toleration and awareness in preparation for Tuesday’s event.
While some students use the day as a chance to come out to their peers or celebrate their identity, many of those who wore “I Am” shirts were allies hoping to show their support for the LGBTQ community.
Julia Maddera (COL ’13), GU Pride’s publicity chair, has participated in Coming Out Day all three of her years at Georgetown.
“Every time it blows me away,” she said. “It is comforting to know that you are not alone here on campus. I think it sends a powerful message to students who are still closeted, as well as prospective LGBT students who wonder if Georgetown will provide a welcoming environment for them.”
Each year, GU Pride chooses a different color of the rainbow for the t-shirts. According to Meghan Ferguson (COL ’15), co-programming chair for GU Pride, this year’s light blue shirts were intended to represent the first color on the transgender pride flag.
“One of the big motivations behind this year’s campaign is the recent slew of attacks against transgender women in D.C., so we thought it was important to bring up,” Ferguson said.
Coming Out Day kicked off a month of activities sponsored by GU Pride and several other student organizations, including GradPride and the LGBTQ Alliance.
Tuesday night featured a dinner and discussion of the internet-based “It Gets Better” campaign that calls national attention to LGBT suicides among youth. GU Pride has started its own related project called “Making it Better,” which Ferguson described as a more proactive version of the campaign geared specifically toward Georgetown students.
“It asks people, ‘What are you doing to make Georgetown a safer community for LGBT people?'” she said.
The month’s events will conclude with the 25th annual AIDS Walk Washington on Oct. 29.

How can millions worldwide love one man whom they have never met?
On Oct. 5 one of the leading tech titans of the world, Steve Jobs, passed away. The Apple co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer died after battling pancreatic cancer for seven years. Millions of people across the world mourned the passing of one of the most influential people in their lifetimes. His legacy lives in every single computer, tablet and smart phone; he revolutionized how people work, play and interact.
Out in Silicon Valley, Calif., where I grew up, it is the norm for at least one parent to be working for some high-tech company. Engineering runs through people’s blood and sets a lifestyle. Everyone, no matter how much they know about technology, has some sense of what is going on and what is on the cutting edge of new technologies. That is why, when it was announced that Jobs had died, my Facebook feed exploded with people expressing their condolences. One person even wrote how much she had enjoyed making his favorite hot chocolate at a store where she worked in Stanford. Jobs’ death impacted the region and high-tech industries, since it felt like we had lost a close friend, even if we hardly knew anything about him.
Steve Jobs was the first person to fully market computers to the common person. When the computer was invented during World War II, it was a large, complex and difficult-to-understand device that only a handful of people could effectively use. However, Jobs saw the mass potential of computers for the life of the common man.
Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 with Steve Wozniak, after which the dynamic duo introduced several computers that were aimed at the consumer by making them more than just green text on black backgrounds. The products they created brought the first meaning to the term “personal computer.” After an internal power struggle that resulted in his walking out on the company, Jobs founded a software company called NeXT and a computer animation company called Pixar. In a twist of fate, Apple purchased NeXT in 1996, and Jobs returned to the helm soon after. Over the next decade and a half, Jobs oversaw one of the largest expansions of any company worldwide. Through huge successes such as the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad, Jobs transformed Apple into arguably the most powerful technology company in the world.
Jobs revolutionized how we interact with the world around us. Every single computer, tablet and phone has a little bit of Jobs’ work in it, even if it is not an Apple product. Jobs’ keen eye for delivering products that helped consumers influenced how rival Microsoft designed its operating system, not to mention the development of the mouse (another Apple invention). He also changed how we listen to music by effectively killing the compact disk market and spurred a revolution of digital music sharing. But arguably, his most important contribution was his unwillingness to accept the cell phone companies’ design of the original Apple phone, a decision which led to the revolution of the mobile phone market that allowed companies to develop phones as they saw fit.
The products Jobs designed were extraordinary, but his real contribution was to the technological revolution and the societal change in Silicon Valley that continues today. Jobs helped establish Silicon Valley, along with Bill Hewlett and David Packard of Hewlett-Packard, Larry Ellison of Oracle and many other tech leaders, as the capital of technology companies. As a resident of Palo Alto, I can attest that Jobs’ influence over the region is unspeakable.
I won’t go so far as to say that Jobs was a “magician” as some people do, because frankly, Apple products are usually overpriced with underwhelming specs. But Jobs had the ability to develop and deliver products that were easy to use, and people wanted to buy them. He was able to deliver a product that forced other companies to play catch-up and redesign with the customer in mind. His unwillingness to make the Mac environment as free as the company’s Super Bowl XVIII ad makes me believe that Jobs was a revolutionary in the high-tech, music, entertainment and business industry, but not a god. However, he was someone who not only changed how Silicon Valley does business and lives, but also how the world functions as a whole.
