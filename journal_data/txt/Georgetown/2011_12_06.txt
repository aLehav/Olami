The Department of Public Safety and the Metropolitan Police Department reported differing information on a break-in at a student residence at 1418 36th St. Friday night.
According to the description of the incident the victim gave to MPD, an unknown male entered the residence through a back door. When asked what he was doing there, the suspect claimed to be looking for a party and fled through the back door.
The incident was the first of two break-ins to occur that night. Less than an hour later, at 10:30 p.m., a student living at 3609 O St. reported that she went into a bedroom to investigate a noise and saw an unknown person. The student screamed and the intruder fled down the stairs and out the back door.
Though the DPS and MPD reports agreed on the basics of the first break-in, they contained several differences regarding the time and description of the incident.
While DPS reported that the suspect emerged from a closet while the student was sitting in her living room, the MPDreport said that he entered the residence through an unlocked back door. DPS described the incident as a burglary, while MPD classified it as an unlawful entry.
The time of the incident reported by DPS also differed from the time reported by MPD by 11 minutes. According to DPS, the break-in occurred at 9:56 p.m., while MPD reported that it happened at 9:45 p.m.
This is the second time in the past week that DPS reports have differed from other descriptions of a crime.
In a public safety alert regarding a theft at Vital Vittles Thursday, DPS reported that $600 in cash was stolen from the store’s back office. However, the actual amount stolen was closer to $300, according to The Corp’s Chief Operating Officer Brooke Heinichen (SFS ’12).
“We very specifically gave them the number that was the exact amount that was taken, but $600 was the number they reported and I’m not quite sure why,” Heinichen said.
According to Georgetown’s Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, the $600 figure was a preliminary estimate.
“Initial estimates of the amount of cash stolen from Vital Vittles were broad,” she wrote in an email.
Pugh did not respond to questions about the source of the discrepancies between the DPS and MPD reports.

Next semester a new intercollegiate conference at Georgetown will channel D.C.’s cultural focus on international relations and politics.
The Walsh Exchange, which is being spearheaded by Georgetown students, will provide undergraduates with an opportunity to discuss and promote the most recent research in foreign policy. Jon Askonas (SFS ’13) developed the idea for the conference about a year ago in order to foster a stronger intellectual community at the university and establish a forum through which undergraduates can present their own research.
Since then, the Walsh Exchange Steering Committee, comprised of two co-chairs, Askonas and Colleen Wood (SFS ’14), and seven coordinators, have organized the conference, which will be held April 13-15. Shuo Yan Tan (SFS ’12), long-term development chair of the Carroll Round, and Lucas Stratman (SFS ’12), president of the SFS Academic Council, as well as the International Relations Club, have been instrumental in the planning process.
Wood is excited about what the Walsh Exchange means for Georgetown and its reputation as a hallmark institution in the world of foreign affairs.
“It only makes sense that the university with one of the top-ranked international relations programs in the country would host a research conference where undergraduates can engage with new ideas and new research in the field,” she said.
The format of the Walsh Exchange closely resembles that of the Carroll Round, an international economics and political economy roundtable conference held annually at Georgetown. Its purpose and content, however, are very different.
“International relations, at its core, is very different from international economics, and our conference structure will reflect that with more active dialogue and exchange of abstract ideas, backed up with research,” Wood said.
The conference will feature a keynote speaker, to be announced at a future date, to reinforce the messages of the conference and demonstrate what a career in international relations entails.
Students are invited to play an active and participatory role in the Walsh Exchange through the submission of research papers, which can include works in progress or complete senior thesis projects.
Even for those students who do not participate directly, the Walsh Exchange hopes to be a resource based on the nature of the dialogue it will bring to campus and the long-term research that it hopes to inspire, according to Wood.
“I firmly believe that all students at Georgetown can benefit from this conference and the ideas it promotes,” she said. “All students wishing to work on research projects and all students wishing to engage in intellectual life on campus can benefit from what the Walsh Exchange has to offer.”

Positioned across from a CBS news reporter, with cameras, microphones and producers scattered around his office, professor Michael Eric Dyson continues his typical day at work.
Dyson’s class, “Sociology of Hip-Hop: Urban Theodicy of Jay-Z,” has become the focus of a media circus on campus in recent weeks, drawing attention from the Associated Press and Fox News as well as BET and Perez Hilton’s celebrity blog.
Just an hour before he sat down at his desk, Dyson was pacing behind the podium of an Intercultural Center classroom and lecturing more than 140 students in what resembled spoken word poetry.
Although interest in the class has spiked recently, Dyson has been teaching “Sociology of Hip Hop” since he arrived at Georgetown in 2007.
It was not until this year, however, that he decided to focus the course on Jay-Z. Dyson said the idea to teach a class centered on the seminal rapper had been in the back of his mind for several years.
“I was originally supposed to give a series of lectures at Harvard back in 2008 about the influence of Jay-Z. But the night before I was supposed to speak, a certain young, black man became president of the United States, so the lectures ended up being about him instead,” Dyson said.
This semester, Dyson decided to take the opportunity to examine societal norms through the lens of Jay-Z’s music. Because of his widespread recognition in the black community, Dyson has been able to bring many prominent guest speakers to class. Recent visitors have included Steve Stoute, marketing mogul and longtime friend of Jay-Z, and author Zack O’Malley Greenburg, who wrote the biography of Jay-Z, “Empire State of Mind: How Jay-Z went from Street Corner to Corner Office,” which is one of the class’s assigned readings.
Beyond guest speakers and books, Dyson also brings his personal experiences with Jay-Z to the class. Dyson began his friendship with the rapper at a conference some years ago.
“Knowing the rapper personally doesn’t weigh the outcome of the class positively or negatively, but it definitely gives a more intimate familiarity with the class,” he said. “I will send him texts about the class, and we definitely have his full support and interest. I’m still hoping we can get the chance to Skype him in or something before the end of the semester.”
Dyson is known for his friends in high places, including Jesse Jackson, who introduced him to his wife, and recording artist Lupe Fiasco, who he brought to one of his lectures last fall.
A 53-year-old academic, author and television personality, Dyson peppers his lectures, for which he uses few notes, with lyrics by hip-hop superstars from Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. to Drake and Jay-Z.
However, Dyson said that his enthrallment with Jay-Z’s words does not stem from a simple penchant for the music. Rather, his studies focus on exploring the implications of lyrics that can be both powerful and controversial. For this reason, he expects a high level of thinking from his students.
“In class, we don’t just sit around and say, ‘Wow, that’s dope!’ We use [Jay-Z’s] lyrics, and we connect them to themes and theories within sociology that are relevant to today,” Dyson said. “We deal with every major issue that every sociology class should address: race, class, gender, the relationship between men and women, racial and sexual hierarchy.”
Though Dyson ties his lectures together with audio samples, they often wander off of the topic of hip-hop to the civil rights movement, other aspects of popular culture and class relations.
For Janine Duffy (COL ’14), a sociology major, the class has widened her perceptions of the study of sociology.
“You can definitely look at the class with a broader lens. It isn’t just about Jay-Z. A lot is what you want to get out of the class,” she said.
Since the beginning of the semester, major media outlets such as MSNBC, CBS, the Associated Press and the Washington Post have descended on the classroom.  While some students said they feel the revolving door of reporters has shaped class discussion, Dyson says he is unfazed.
“We are doing what we are doing regardless of whether there are reporters there or not,” he said. “I don’t conduct myself any differently, and I don’t think my students do either.”
Tate Tucker (COL ’14), a student musician who has gained prominence in the past year and met Lupe Fiasco through Dyson, said that he thinks the national attention is a sort of validation of Dyson’s academic concentration.
“In terms of the media attention, it’s nothing new with Professor Dyson anymore, and it’s become pretty customary at this point to feel as if our class is a documentary of sorts,” he said. “Not in a bad way, but it sort of legitimizes the subject matter in a very unorthodox way.”
Along with the media attention, however, has come a critique of the occasionally vulgar nature of the lyrics Dyson has explored in the class. But the professor believes that Jay-Z’s word choice — even if offensive — is worthy of study.
“Yes, some of the songs that we study do use derogatory words for women. However, we shouldn’t obsess over the word but rather why he used the word,” he said. “Today, there are many institutions that exclude women. I don’t see that as being any different.”
It is this desire to demonstrate how hip-hop reflects American societal norms that fuels Dyson’s lectures.
“It wasn’t until the ’70s that black literature was viewed as being worthy of critical interpretation,” he said. “We really are in good company. Hopefully in 20 years, we will be looked at as pioneers.”
Although he will not be teaching any classes next semester, Dyson said he will be around campus and continue to meet with students in the spring. It is likely that he will be back to teach this specific class again in the future with some tweaking of the course material, he said.
“I think I would really like to take a closer look at the neighborhood where Jay-Z came from and really investigate to see if we can’t learn more about that story,” he said.
He added that in the future he hopes to include the perspectives of other influential artists, such as Aretha Franklin and Kanye West, into his study of the sociology of hip-hop.

On a Thursday night in the Hariri Building, amongst breakout rooms filled with busy students, a D.C. entrepreneur is being taught business technology strategies by a team of undergraduates.
The students work with the Hilltop MicroFinance Initiative, a group of 12 who work to fund and educate small business owners in the District who do not otherwise qualify for loans and funding.
“Essentially what we look to do is target local D.C. area entrepreneurs and business owners who are looking to expand, but don’t have access to forms of credit from banks. So we provide them the financing to expand their small businesses,” Chief Financial Officer Craig Melcher (MSB ’13) said.
The group was started three years ago as part of the Georgetown University Social Entrepreneurship Competition. Eventually, securing funding from the Rotary Club of Bethesda, HMFI has been gradually building and developing.
The group has a two-pronged approach to their mission.  As potential loan recipients work through the application, they are required to attend a series of tailored lessons designed to increase their knowledge about the business world.
Bernardo Figueroa, the first recipient of an HMFI loan, operated a Salvadorian food truck before he was referred to the group.
Figueroa, who has received three successive loans of $3,000, $6,000 and $7,000, is now the owner of Lalo’s Market, a grocery store in Columbia Heights.
“I’d rather work with [HMFI] than a bank any day,” Figueroa said.  “They gave me a lot of information on how to run a business, make a balance sheet and make sure I don’t spend more money than I’m bringing in.”
The burst of the housing bubble crippled Kipp Martin’s work as a realtor. Because Martin, who also works part time as a truck driver, lacked the skills and capital to embrace social media marketing, he turned to HMFI to revamp his business.
“Not only did we give him the capital to purchase a smart phone, a digital camera and set up a website, but we gave him important skills,” said HMFI Chief Operating Officer Alissa Orlando (SFS ’13). “We said, ‘Here, this is how you use Facebook, here is how you use QR codes on all of your door hangers to bring people to your website and here’s how you use LinkedIn and Twitter to find new clients.”
Chief Executive Officer Alex Honjiyo (SFS ’13) said the fact that the lenders are college students sometimes creates awkwardness initially, but the discomfort quickly dissipates.
“The whole process of dealing with awkwardness is offset by the kind of personal relationship we build with the client, which is the most important part of the process,” he said. “So, the relationship really does change from the first meeting where the client realizes that these kids are 19, 20 years old, and still in college.  But over time, we build these personal relationships, we meet the families, we visit their stores and it really does change the relationship.”
HMFI’s loan structure centers around year-long loans paid back in 12 equal installments.  Though they charge 10 percent interest — somewhat higher than market standards of around eight to nine percent —  the group seeks to serve business owners too risky to qualify for big-bank financing.
“It’s a hand up, not a handout,” Orlando said. “I want to give a hand up to industrious, ambitious individuals who have the talent and will to improve their lives, but don’t have the financial resources.”
While most lending corporations ensure adequate collateral before the approval of a loan, HMFI relies more upon the lasting relationships formed with its clients to ensure payback.  To date, the organization has retained a 100 percent repayment rate.
“Having loaned out over $18,000, with no real mechanism of collecting if they don’t pay back, [the perfect repayment rate] is pretty awesome,” Orlando said.
The group hopes to expand their number of clients from two to 10 by spring 2013 and also add services such as credit reporting.
According to members, while microfinance organizations at other universities often employ alumni to manage the day-to-day operations, HMFI only allows graduates to serve on their Board of Directors.
“I think the idea of having college students run the organization is really important,” Honjiyo said. “There is something about having college students run this that not only provides a really good experience, but it allows us to get off the Hilltop, work in the community and bring about real, tangible change in the District of Columbia.”

Jenniffer Torres Ortega  (COL ’13) moved to the United States from Colombia three years ago without knowing a word of English. This fall, she enrolled at Georgetown, as one of a handful of students who transferred to the university from a community college.
Although the university does not keep records on the number of students who transfer from community colleges, Torres Ortega said that she sometimes feels almost alone in her experiences.
“I found it difficult to adapt to social life as a junior,” she said.
Like some community college transfers, Torres Ortega didn’t follow the usual path to college. Since she lives in Arlington, Va. she has to commute every day and has had difficulty joining the social scene.
“Students don’t seem to really connect in classes, but more in their dorms or activities. Even when I do connect with someone in class, it’s difficult to keep that going outside of the classroom.”
According to Senior Assistant Director of Admissions Leah Thomas and Assistant Director of Admissions Colleen Miltenberg, some community college transfers have taken time away from school to work or serve in the military.
“Many times the community college students have taken a bit more of a non-traditional path to end up where they are,” they wrote in an email.
Torres Ortega, for example, began her university studies in her native Colombia. After moving to the United States to be with her future husband, she enrolled in English as a Second Language classes at Northern Virginia Community College. After a year, she began taking liberal arts classes and looked into transferring to another university to complete the psychology degree she had left unfinished in Colombia.
The transfer process was fairly smooth, she said.
For the past 25 years, Georgetown has partnered with 16 schools, including Northern Virginia, for the Community College Preferred Consideration program. Partner institutions are able to nominate two students for favored consideration by Georgetown, and it often pays off well.
In 2011, the acceptance rate for students nominated in the program was 60 percent, while in 2010 it was 44 percent, according to Thomas and Miltenberg. In contrast, Georgetown’s overall transfer acceptance rate for the 2011 admissions cycle was 10 percent.
Torres Ortega was able to transfer 60 credits, the maximum allowed by Georgetown, and she has almost finished  her psychology major. Because transfer students are required to take classes at Georgetown for at least two years, she is continuing with the premed track, and she plans to add  a minor to her course load next year.
While Georgetown is challenging, Torres Ortega said, professors and deans have been very understanding, and she has enjoyed the jump to a university. She is not alone in finding academic success at Georgetown.
Mark Svensson (COL ’12) transferred to Georgetown from Rockland Community College in 2010. Svensson did not apply to college during high school. After graduation, however, he decided that he wanted to hit the books after all, so he enrolled in Rockland’s honors program.
“I knew after my freshman year that I wanted to transfer,” he said. “While most students at Rockland don’t transfer to a 4-year college after completing their associate’s degree, 90 percent of those in the honors program do transfer to Ivy League or other Tier I schools.”
Svensson is now a government major at Georgetown.
“I always wanted to come to Georgetown because of the politics and international relations,” he explained.
Emily Schuster (COL ’14), a Japanese major and transfer from Portland Community College, was waitlisted by Georgetown her senior year of high school.
Schuster decided to attend community college as an inexpensive alternative until she had another shot at her dream school. The second time around, she was accepted.
Unlike Svensson and Torres Ortega, Schuster had little support from her former school.
“Most students at Portland transfer to the state university afterwards. Applying to Georgetown was a fairly independent process. Luckily, I had already done it once,” she said, laughing.
While Schuster has enjoyed her transition to the Hilltop, there have been some bumps along the way. Because she could not receive credit for many of her general education classes, Schuster will be taking 20 credits every semester until she graduates and does not have time for many extracurricular activities.
Other elements of the transition have gone more smoothly. She has found a core group of friends among transfer students, and she lives with three other transfers in a Village A apartment.
Svensson, too, said it was easy for him to transition to campus. Shortly after he arrived on campus, he met then-Georgeotwn University Student Association President Calen Angert (MSB ’11). Angert, he said, took him under his wing and introduced him to many of his current friends and encouraged him to join GUSA.
While the transition was rockier for Torres Ortega, she said overall she is enjoying her campus experience and wants to apply to Georgetown Medical School.
“When I first moved to the [United States], I visited Georgetown’s campus with friends and told them that I would be going here. They all laughed,” she reminisced. “Sometimes it’s still hard to believe that I’m here, that I’ve done it. The first day that I bought a Georgetown sweater and put it on, [I] really felt like I belong[ed] here. That’s a good memory.”

Students who use the D.C. Metro may see their wallets shrink as the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority debates a 5.7 percent fare increase to address budget shortfalls.
Along with the fare hike — which would cover about $50 million of next year’s projected $124 million shortfall — WMATA is considering rounding bus cash fares to the dollar and eliminating the peak-hour fare system.
A Dec. 1 press release from WMATA cited growing wage, health and pension costs, including $11 million in court-mandated wage increases and $9 million increases in pensions for workers, as accounting for nearly half the deficit. The remainder is due to projects such as $20 million in preparation costs for the Metrorail expansion to Dulles Airport and $8 million for escalator maintenance.
Some students are unsatisfied with the current fare system and upset at the prospect of further price increases.
“I think it’s frustrating already because you have to pay for distance whereas in Boston on the T you only pay once,” Kristen Trivelli (NHS ’14) said.
But students said the possibility of a fare hike would have little impact on their use of the system due to the limited number of alternatives in the District.
“I honestly don’t think that it would impact my metro riding at all because I would have to take the metro regardless, and taxis are still more expensive in general,” Brad Hilson (COL ’12) said.
WMATA last raised fares in 2010 with a general 10-cent increase across all modes of transportation. Later that year, the transit authority enacted a rate system based on peak commute hours that further increased Metrorail fare. That increase was designed to mitigate a $40 million budget shortfall.
“It’s not going to change the fact that people don’t want to have to drive through the traffic in the city,” Hilson said about future rate increases. “People are just going to have to deal with it.”

Ziad Saqr (NHS ’15) never wanted to go to school here. But when he was applying to colleges last fall, his older brother Eyad (SFS ’13) was a sophomore obsessed with all things Georgetown.
“He would tell me about all the basketball games and force me to watch the games on TV,” Ziad said.
Still, Ziad didn’t intend to follow in his brother’s footsteps.
“I went to high school with my two brothers my entire life,” he said. “I’ve never been to a school where one brother wasn’t there.”
But a year later, Ziad found himself on the Hilltop, just as enthusiastic about Georgetown as his older brother.
“I’m very happy about coming here,” he said. “Georgetown is my home.”
 
Hoyas From Birth
In this year’s freshman class of 1,603 students, 159 have at least one parent who graduated from Georgetown. An additional 112 students have at least one sibling who has attended the university, and 25 are following both at least one parent and one sibling who have gone to school on the Hilltop.
For some children of alumni, the introduction to university culture begins at a young age.
“My dad, when he was my basketball coach growing up, always called our team the Lady Hoyas,” said Mia Von Gal (COL ’13), whose father, Tim, graduated from the College of Arts and Sciences in 1981.
Greg Kelly (CAS ’83) also didn’t wait to immerse his daughter, Kimberley (COL ‘15), in the tradition.
“Our children have been surrounded by Hoya alums their entire lives,” he wrote in an email.
Kelly’s wife, Lorraine (CAS ’83), and many of their closest friends are also alumni.
“That’s … evidence that the [Georgetown] community relationships are uniquely strong.”
According to Anne Noyes (SFS ’80), the university was also a frequent topic of conversation in her household.
“Growing up, my daughters heard stories about this cool, sophisticated place [where] I went to school, where Jeane Kirkpatrick and Henry Kissinger taught senior seminars, my Russian history teacher took us to parties at the Russian embassy [and] Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) was my commencement speaker,” she wrote in an email. “Those discussions had a lasting impact on them.”
Both of her daughters, Allyson (NHS ’13) and Elena (COL ’15), now attend the university.
“To  say  I am thrilled that they are at [Georgetown] is an understatement,” she said.
But not all legacy students grew up with such a strong awareness. Jesse Colligan (SFS ’14) said that even though his father, Bud (SFS ’76), is an alumnus, he rarely brought up the university at home.
“My family didn’t really talk all that much about Georgetown at all when I was growing up,” he said. “It was only when my oldest brother was accepted to and decided to attend Georgetown that I first took notice of the fact that my dad went there.”
And when it came down to applying to and choosing a school, some students, like Alfonso Fernandez (COL ’14), felt a desire to separate themselves from their family history.
“I wanted to live something apart from my family, because I was scared that I’d follow their same footsteps. I wanted to create an identity apart from them,” he said. Fernandez’s father, Alfonso Fernandez, Jr. (SFS ’78), and sister, Maria (SFS ’10), both attended Georgetown.
Natalie Sergi (COL ’14) also wanted to forge a path independent of her parents and brother — all Georgetown attendees — but she felt a connection to the university after visiting the campus during her junior year of high school.
“I feared my brother would be bothered by his little sister tagging along as he became a college kid. But he told me he would love to have me there, and I didn’t want to pass up the opportunity to attend such a prestigious and well-rounded university,” she wrote in an email.
 
The “Tip Factor”
This inherited connection can be a boon to alumni’s children who choose to apply to Georgetown.
The Office of Admissions breaks down the legacy category into two groups: an “immediate legacy” — an applicant whose parent or sibling attended the school — and a “Georgetown tie,” which designates those who have a relative, such as an aunt or uncle, who graduated from Georgetown.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charlie Deacon said that legacy is a potential advantage for students in the application process, with particular attention paid to parent involvement with the university after graduation.
The level of connection an alumnus has maintained with his alma mater creates a “tip factor” for his children when they apply.
“The university has a policy to look favorably on families who have been active since graduating,” Deacon said. “The stronger the tie is, the more important it is to consider it.”
According to Deacon, the tip factor does not come into play for 90 percent of applicants with legacy.
“Legacy kids look virtually identical to the overall applicant pool,” he said.
About 6 percent of all applicants last year — 1,100 students out of a total of 19,000 — checked the legacy box on their applications. The admission rate for legacy applicants was 11 percent higher than for the overall pool, at 29 percent versus 18 percent.
Among students who chose to enroll in the class of 2015, 16 percent have a direct legacy and an additional 7 percent have a more distant relative who attended Georgetown.
The statistics for the current freshman class mirror the overall incidence of legacy students in the undergraduate student body.  Senior Associate University Registrar Scott Campbell reported that almost 23 percent of traditional undergraduate students have a parent or other relative who graduated from or currently attends Georgetown.
According to Deacon, these numbers are relatively low compared to those at other universities.
“Every university favors alumni in some way,” he said. “Georgetown doesn’t favor legacy as much as other schools do. … Our goal is to be diverse. We want the best, most talented students.”
 
A Shared Experience
For alums, sending their children to Georgetown has its own benefits.
“It is so much fun to visit them and to stroll down memory lane,” Noyes said of visiting her daughters.
Kelly agreed.
“When my wife Lorraine and I dropped Kimmy off this year, and when we came back for parents’ weekend, it was a great mixture of positive emotion — memories of our time as students, pride that our child gained admission and excited anticipation for what she would experience in the next four years.”
Legacy students agreed that the added exposure they gain to Georgetown through their relatives gives them an advantage in adapting to life on campus.
“Georgetown definitely felt like home to me before it did to others [in my class],” Fernandez said.
Von Gal lived with another legacy student her freshman year and said it was easier for both of them to adapt to their new environment.
“I feel like we had kind of a leg up, because we knew where things were on campus and had background information on how things worked,” she said.
But there is at least one downside to having legacy status.
“Sometimes I wonder if I was only accepted because I’m a legacy … which can be a disturbing thought,”Colligan said.
Other students also question whether legacy students really deserve their spots.
“It is unfair to an extent if you can just say, ‘My mom used to go here,'” London Finley (COL ’12) said. “I guess that’s just how the system is.”
Paige Larson (MSFS ’83), an alumni admissions interviewer of 28 years, said that her child’s positive experience at Georgetown helps to validate what she tells prospective students about her alma mater.
“Every spring when I talk to the new admits from my state, I can now avow with absolute sincerity that Georgetown is an exceptional experience for the child and for the parent,” Larson said. “Cura personalisis not just a motto, it is a pledge. I think that I took it for granted as a student, but I am so very, very grateful for this now and for Georgetown’s enduring commitment to its students.”
