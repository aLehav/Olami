A student was sexually assaulted in Village A Friday evening, according to the Department of Public Safety.
A public safety alert emailed to students at 12:15 a.m. Saturday termed the incident “forcible fondling” and reported that the victim suffered no physical harm.
According to the PSA, the suspect is a black, male non-student between the ages of 19 and 25. He is further described as being 5-foot-8 with crooked teeth. He was wearing a lime green jacket and was last seen fleeing west between O’Donovan Hall and Southwest Quad.
DPS and the Metropolitan Police Department searched the campus and the surrounding area for the suspect but were unable to find him.
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that DPS and MPD searched the campus and surrounding area for the victim. They were actually searching for the suspect. The corrected version was posted at 1:17 p.m. on April 28.
