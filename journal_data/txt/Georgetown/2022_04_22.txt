A team of students from Georgetown University and Harvard University won first place at the 2022 Georgetown Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Challenge for their software company Mercor.
Brendan Foody (MSB ’25), Surya Midha (SFS ’25) and Adarsh Hiremath, a first-year at Harvard, co-founded Mercor in January 2022. The company pairs teams of skilled engineers with start-ups to meet their development needs. 
The trio, all of whom attended the same high school in San Jose, Calif., were awarded a $10,000 prize for being chosen out of 60 teams to win the April 7 Entrepreneurship Challenge, Georgetown’s largest annual pitch competition. 
Mercor is the first business to combine software contracting and software recruiting, which is attractive to small start-ups that want to simultaneously grow their product and their team, Foody said. 
“The reason that’s really uniquely strategic in the start-up market is because start-ups need their team in-house as they’re iterating their product, growing, and raising venture cash,” Foody said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’re the only software contractor that allows them the predictability and efficiency associated with contracting but also gives them the option to have their team in-house as they grow.”
Undergraduate and graduate students at Georgetown were able to pitch their ideas in the Entrepreneurship Challenge, with competitors giving a five-minute pitch followed by a three-minute question-and-answer session from a panel of judges. The Entrepreneurship Challenge awards separate winners for the undergraduate and graduate levels. 
Hiremath said that as a dual recruiting and contracting agency, Mercor works to source tech talent through top Indian Institutes of Technology and then applies their skill sets to specific start-up projects. 
“Say they want to build an application or website, or they even want a minor tweak to their existing codebase. They would come to Mercor, and Mercor would use that talent to do high quality work at an affordable price,” Hiremath told The Hoya. “One of the things that Mercor is currently focused on doing is building out our platform where entrepreneurs can go on the platform and then be matched with an engineering team of the appropriate skill set.” 
Mercor plans to sponsor a hackathon at IIT Kharagpur, a top computer science college in India on April 27. 
The coding club at IIT Kharagpur invited students from a variety of Indian Institutes of Technology to compete in the hackathon for the opportunity to work at Mercor, Hiremath said.
“There are 500 participants in the competition, and they’re all competing for an opportunity to work at Mercor and work on the software products that we have for clients,” Hiremath said. “We believe that sourcing talent early is one of the best ways possible to get that talent, and we’re doing that by partnering with IITs.” 
Mercor has seen success with clients at Georgetown University and beyond, like Pentada, a platform for finance and commerce apps. Additionally, the company built the dashboard and QR code for Attend, an app that allows professors to create a QR code that a student can scan to log their class attendance. 
Recently, Mercor partnered with Chris Delaney (MSB ’25) on his project, Hoyadle, a spin-off of the popular online game Wordle.
Delaney said that Foody’s work at Mercor helped to turn his code for Hoyadle into a reality. 
“As soon as I told him about it, he was able to access the domain for me to get access and upload the code to the website and run it within a few hours,” Delaney said in an interview with The Hoya. “Most of what he developed was making the website actually real and putting the website to the domain, and he also helped with marketing by advertising it on Instagram and reaching out to some other Georgetown related accounts to advertise for us.”
In the future, Mercor hopes to partner with venture capital firms to receive referrals for early stage investments. By working with venture capital firms, Mercor can ensure that their business endeavors involve companies with sufficient levels of capital to be successful, Foody said. 
To meet increased demand for software contracting and development, Mercor must continue to develop its new platforms to scale.  
“For us, as co-founders, the thing we want to improve on is making sure we have a very rigorous, scalable process to manage a ton of projects concurrently,” Hiremath said. “Because, ultimately, the way we take Mercor to the next level is by efficiently managing all of those components. That’s one of our biggest priorities.”

Georgetown University professor of Japanese history Jordan Sand was named a 2022 Guggenheim Fellow, which will provide for the opportunity to have the time and money to finish a book about Japanese history.
The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation awards grants to around 175 recipients each year and provides funds to support each Fellow’s individual work. The 180 Guggenheim Fellows chosen for 2022, including  Sand, who teaches courses like “History of Modern Japan” and “Modern Cities and Urbanism,” received news of their acceptance April 7 and are part of the Guggenheim Foundation’s 97th annual fellowship cohort.
Being named a Guggenheim Fellow gives scholars the opportunity to expand their research, ultimately enriching scholarship as a whole, according to Edward Hirsch, president of the Guggenheim Foundation, in an April 7 press release.
“The work supported by the Foundation will aid in our collective effort to better understand the new world we’re in, where we’ve come from, and where we’re going. It is an honor for the Foundation to help the Fellows carry out their visionary work,” Hirsch said in the press release.
This award will give Sand the necessary time to continue with his scholarship and writing related to Japanese history. 
“I applied for the grant to have some time to finish writing a book about Ise, site of Japan’s most important Shinto shrines, historically connected to Japan’s imperial family,” Sand wrote to The Hoya. “I have been working on the project for a while and am getting close to completing the manuscript. I plan to publish a book in Japanese and another in English.”
Sand’s previous book, published in 2013 and titled “Tokyo Vernacular: Common Spaces, Local Histories, Found Objects,” explores the intersection of history and modernity in Tokyo’s urbanization process, highlighting the research that occurred in the 1970s and the unconventional historical landmarks that emerged as a result.  
His new work, which he now has more time and funds to pursue because of the Guggenheim Foundation, will be about how Japanese history and infrastructure intersect, according to Sand. 
“One theme I have focused on is how societies have coped historically with the impermanence of the material world, particularly buildings and monuments,” Sand wrote. “This project relates to that issue because the Ise shrines are torn down and rebuilt from scratch every twenty years. They have been doing it for about 1,300 years. My project examines why they do that and how they have kept it going for so long.”
The Guggenheim Foundation chose the 180 recipients from almost 2,500 applicants made up of scientists, scholars, writers and artists from 51 different fields of study. 
Bryan McCann, chair of the history department, said that Sand brings a valuable perspective to East Asian culture and is deserving of being a Guggenheim Fellow. 
“Professor Sand is a leading scholar of the cultural history of Japan, and it is wonderful to see his accomplishments recognized and his ongoing research supported,” McCann wrote in an email to The Hoya. “His work is a reminder of the richness of cultural history and its implications for broader understanding.” 
Sand’s research focuses on the history of architecture, material culture and everyday life. The scope of Sand’s research extends from the urban experience in Tokyo to the rise of metropolises globally. Sand often highlights how individuals and their communities adapt to these new physical spaces.
As urbanization continues to grow across East Asia, Philip Kafalas, professor in the department of East Asian Languages and Cultures, said that Sand’s research in the area will become more significant for scholarship. 
“Professor Sand’s work helps us understand the world we feel emerging around us, so I can well understand why the Guggenheim selectors would reward its potential,” Kafalas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I notice that he is the only awardee under the category of ‘East Asian Studies’ this year, and I am not aware that anyone else in the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures has been a Guggenheim Fellow since I have been here, so it is quite an achievement.”
Being named a Guggenheim Fellow will allow for financial flexibility to pursue academic projects while temporarily pausing his work as a professor, Sand said. 
“The grant is intended to keep me afloat while I take leave from teaching,” Sand said. “Funds are not targeted, unlike people in the sciences, most of us in the humanities don’t need special equipment. We just need time in the archive or the library and at our desks writing.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) senate unanimously passed a resolution to create a working group for a statistical agency to conduct surveys and a semesterly census on the student population to gauge student opinion on issues.  
During the April 10 meeting, the GUSA senate voted to create the Student Advocacy Statistical Agency, which would be funded by GUSA. The agency would conduct surveys to determine student opinions on different issues. The agency would also have representatives from GUSA members, undergraduate academic councils and media board organizations. 
One of the purposes of creating the statistical agency was to allow people in GUSA to gain a better understanding of the needs of the student body, according to GUSA Senator Joshua Bernard-Pearl (SFS ’25), who was one of two senators to introduce the resolution. 
“Occasionally people will reach out to us, but we don’t have a really good way of knowing scientifically, kind of what percentage of students care about this issue or that issue,” Bernard-Pearl said in an interview with The Hoya. “So in that sense, it’ll help us to know what the student body cares about.”
The agency will provide GUSA and other advocacy groups with the necessary information to bargain with the administration, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Leo Rassieur (COL ’22). 
“For a long time, student leaders have struggled with communicating credible information about student wants and needs to the administration,” Rassieur wrote to The Hoya. “I believe this new agency will help GUSA and other advocate groups at Georgetown come to the negotiating table better equipped to make change.”
The creation of the agency will help a number of different student organizations, according to Bernard-Pearl. 
“It’s something that’s meant to help a number of different agencies,” Bernard-Pearl said. “We recognize that there’s a need for data and statistics on students’ opinions, not just within GUSA, but also within other advocacy and information organizations.”
The statistical agency is in the process of launching next semester, according to GUSA Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’23), who worked with Bernard-Pearl to introduce the resolution.
“Obviously, we kind of are going through a trial run this year,” Gordon said in an interview with The Hoya. “So we’re going to get money from GUSA. The hope is that this would be a permanent thing added to the bylaws in the future, but preferably before the next budget summit.”
The new agency will also help students engage with GUSA, according to Rassieur. 
“This new agency will help students express their views on a wide range of subjects far more frequently than they can right now, helping to bridge the disconnect that some feel exists between GUSA and the student body,” Rassieur wrote. 
The agency will also act as a tool for different organizations to interact with the broader student body, according to Gordon.
“My hope is that it could broaden outreach amongst all the different student advocacy groups and give us better data,” Gordon said. “So when people decide to implement projects, they know which projects are going to be ones that students want and which ones the students don’t really care that much.”
While the agency was created by GUSA, its long-term goals involve becoming an independent entity, according to Bernard-Pearl. 
“It was created kind of within the GUSA framework, but with the idea that it would branch out from GUSA,” Bernard-Pearl said. “The goal of the agency was not to be under necessarily the senate or the executive or to be a GUSA agency, but become more of an adjacent entity. The framework was used because forming an agency that way allows it to work in close partnership with GUSA and also have access to funds and resources and the kind of relationships that GUSA has with the administration.”
Although the agency is in its early stages, its proponents are confident that it will become a permanent fixture of student government, according to Gordon.
“I just think it’s a good idea. It’s a long time coming, and it’s not easiest to get things going. But, you know, it’s going to happen. We’re like the rock band that starts in the garage, but for stats,” Gordon said.

A Georgetown University graduate received the 2022 Citizens Honors Award for Service by the Congressional Medal of Honor Society for providing medical relief and training in global conflict zones. 
Aaron Epstein (SFS ’12, MED ’18) received the prestigious award from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, which was chartered by Congress in 1958. The medal is the highest military award for valor in the United States. Each year, the society presents awards to five citizens and one organization. Award categories include youth service, young heroes and single acts of heroism. Epstein received the citizen service award. 
Epstein will be presented with the award during a ceremony on July 20, 2022.
The Citizens Honors Award recognises Americans who have dedicated their lives to serving others, according to John Falkenbury, executive vice president of the Medal of Honor Society. 
“The Congressional Medal of Honor Society instituted the Citizen Honors Awards 15 years ago as a tangible way to express the view of its members — the living Medal of Honor recipients — that the principles of service and sacrifice are relevant to all Americans and not limited to those who wear a uniform,” Falkenbury wrote to the Hoya. 
Epstein completed a masters in security studies at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service (SFS) in 2012 and graduated from the Georgetown University School of Medicine (GUMC) in 2018. At the GUMC, Epstein founded the Global Surgical and Medical Support Group (GSMSG), an organization dedicated to providing medical support in war-torn regions. 
Epstein credited his SFS education for helping him understand the world from a political and security standpoint. 
“It allowed me to create a medical network and use the real political understanding I had obtained to navigate conflict zones in a more effective way than more idealistic aid organizations,” Epstein said in an interview with The Hoya.   
SFS Dean Joel Hellman said Epstein has used his education from the SFS and GUMC to improve the world.
“It is so interesting how Aaron combined a medical and security studies education — he brought those two things together and thought about how he can apply his skills in conflict zones,” Hellman said in an interview with The Hoya. “Not a lot of doctors understand working in volatile zones. SFS encourages people to cross boundaries that you don’t see elsewhere.” 
The GSMSG trains civilians and soldiers on emergency medical response in danger zones, according to Epstein.
As part of GSMSG, Epstein said that he previously provided medical care to people injured by ISIS fighters in Iraq and is now training civilians in Ukraine to deliver first aid to those injured in war. 
“We train our partners rather than dumping supplies and leaving,” Epstein said. “Our approach from the get go has always been to do training. We aimed to broadly train the population in combat casualty care so that everyone could handle on some level basic battle trauma.”
Epstein said his understanding of politics and the medical network have allowed him to navigate conflict zones in a way unlike other aid organizations.
“There are avenues to do good in this world in an effective manner,” Epstein said. “A lot of people are disheartened by seeing international aid organizations that are not efficient where only a tiny fraction of donations make it to those in need. I want people to know though that there are groups out there that are still trying to do the most good.”
Epstein has not only used his medical education to help others in conflict zones, but also to train his colleagues to do the same, according to Princy Kumar, GUMC senior associate dean of students. 
“I think highly of Aaron Epstein as he is one of the most altruistic students I have encountered. He also wanted to teach others around him and would often take students for a 2-4 week period to a crisis zone so they could experience the role of physicians in conflict situations,” Kumar wrote to The Hoya.
Awards like this help to inspire other SFS students to do extraordinary things, according to Hellman.
“The award makes all of us at Georgetown proud and contributes to the mission of the school — the more students who are recognised for the kinds of exciting contributions they are making to the wellbeing of others, it just brings great honour and inspiration to other students,” Hellman wrote.”

Georgetown University commemorated the 160th anniversary of the Compensated Emancipation Act through multiple campus events. The act abolished slavery in Washington, D.C. 
Passed by Congress in 1862, the act abolished slavery in the District, freeing 3,000 individuals from enslavement. From April 12 to 27, Georgetown is hosting a variety of events to reflect on the injustices of slavery and recognize the university’s own active role in the history of enslavement. 
In 1838 the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus, which ran Georgetown at the time, sold 314 enslaved people — now known as the GU272 — to financially sustain the university. 
Events included an Emancipation Exhibit on April 12, which explored documents significant to Georgetown’s history with enslavement, such as documents recording the works of Jesuits in the Maryland community. An April 16 name-reading event honored the people enslaved by the Maryland Jesuits who ran the university in the 19th century. On April 19, the university also hosted a talk titled “Facing Georgetown’s History,” launching the new book “Facing Georgetown’s History: A Reader on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation.” 
The book was edited by Georgetown history professor Adam Rothman and Middlebury College assistant professor of history Elsa Barraza Mendoza. 
On April 27, the university will hold a virtual transcription event, hosted by the Georgetown Slavery Archive, which holds materials related to the Maryland Jesuits and the university’s deep ties to enslavement. At the event attendees can transcribe historical documents for digitalization. 
Mary Beth Corrigan, curator of the Georgetown Collections on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation, said the Emancipation Act achieved the emancipation movement’s goal to abolish slavery in the District.  
“The District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act of 1862 has tremendous local significance: it ended slavery at Georgetown,” Corrigan wrote to The Hoya. “It also represented the fulfillment of one of the major goals of the abolitionist movement: to secure legislation abolishing slavery in the only jursidiction directly controlled by the U.S. Congress.”
When Congress emancipated enslaved people, the politicians chose to compensate slaveholders rather than enslaved people, Corrigan said.  
The Booth Family Center for Special Collections, an archive located in Georgetown’s Lauinger Library, contributes to the commemoration of District Emancipation every year, according to Corrigan. 
The special collection is home to many documents exploring the significance of emancipation in the District, including records related to the last enslaved man at Georgetown University, Aaron Edmonson, and pamphlets on Congressional debates over emancipation in the District, according to Corrigan.  
“Facing Georgetown’s History: A Reader on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation,” analyzes Georgetown’s history with slavery and its larger connection to the history of slavery in the United States, according to Rothman.  
“The book shows Georgetown’s manifold connections to slavery; in fact, Georgetown’s history is a microcosm of the whole history of American slavery, including the history of emancipation,” Rothman wrote to The Hoya.
This book can force the Georgetown community to confront the university’s legacy of slavery, according to Keith Gorman, director of the Booth Family Center for Special Collections. 
“The book helps support the GU community’s efforts of coming to terms with how slavery is so deeply intertwined in the history of this nation,” Gorman wrote to The Hoya. “It also creates a space for community members to better understand the continuing legacy of the enslavement of individuals and communities. In a sense, the book brings the archive to the individual reader.” 
Many of the documents included in this book were drawn from the university’s own historical records, according to Gorman. The first section of the work looks at the history of slavery in the broad context of American Catholicism and the second portion focuses more specifically on Georgetown’s history of slavery, Gorman said.  
Rothman said it is crucial to understand the history of emancipation. 
“Understanding how chattel slavery ended in Washington, D.C., is an important lesson in the possibility of fundamental and even revolutionary change in American history, as well as the limits of change,” Rothman wrote.

COVID-19 cases in Washington, D.C. have spiked as a part of a recent surge caused by the highly transmissible BA.2 Omicron subvariant. 
In the past two weeks the District has seen a 51% increase in COVID-19 cases, with a 14-day average of 216 new COVID-19 cases reported each day. Hospitalizations for COVID-19 in the District have also increased 6%, but deaths have not increased.
The rise in cases due to the rapid spread of the BA.2 subvariant, which is now responsible for over 90% of COVID-19 cases in the United States. 
Although caseloads remain lower than the spike of cases seen in the District by the Omicron variant in December and January — when the District reached an average of 2,123 daily cases — public health officials have expressed concern that the new subvariant will continue to cause an increase in cases.
Georgetown Nursing and Health Studies Professor Rosemary Sokas said a primary reason for the spike in cases is because of the subvariant’s ability to infect those who are fully vaccinated. 
While most of Omicron and BA.2 infections are in healthy young adults, increasingly relaxed public health guidelines may put vulnerable populations at higher risk of infection, according to Sokas.
“The CDC has set a terrible precedent with its current system that aims just to prevent a total meltdown of the healthcare system – as long as the ICU’s aren’t full, they are telling the vulnerable it’s everyone for themselves, just mask up if you are vulnerable,” Sokas wrote to The Hoya. 
On April 18, following a ruling from a federal judge striking down the Center for Disease Control’s reinstatement of a mask mandate on all transportation services, WMATA announced that Metro riders would not be required to wear masks beginning that same day. 
While the District’s indoor mask mandate expired Feb. 28, private establishments can choose whether to require patrons to wear masks while inside their business. 
Georgetown Chief Public Health Officer Ranit Mishori (MED ’02) said the combination of the transmissibility level of the BA.2 subvariant and the lifting of COVID-19 safety measures may have led to the COVID-19 spike in the District.
“The BA.2 variant is even more infectious than the original Omicron strain,” Mishori wrote to The Hoya. “At the same time, many public health measures have been relaxed (particularly indoor masking) and vaccine protections have waned.”
Masks are critical to protecting the health of marginalized communities, according to Sokas.
Immunocompromised and disabled people have heightened health and safety concerns about the lifting of indoor mask mandates across the country. 
Erin Davies (COL ’25), who is in a high-risk category for COVID-19 due to having asthma, said mask mandates ensure the safety of immunocompromised students. 
“The lack of remote access also means that people with increased risk can’t opt to safely attend classes remotely during a spike in cases or if a mask mandate is removed,” Davies wrote to The Hoya. “For that reason I think the mask mandate is helpful for classes even though I also do not enjoy it.” 
Georgetown reinstated its mask mandate earlier this month after experiencing an uptick in cases following the university’s lifting of an indoor mask mandate in March. 
Georgetown’s temporary decision to reinstate the mask mandate was driven by monitoring case levels at Georgetown and throughout the District, according to Mishori.
Davies said she continued to wear a mask when the university lifted its mask mandate. 
The decision to wear a mask can ensure the health and safety of other District residents as some masks like KN95s are more effective than others, Sokas said. 
KN95 and N95 masks have been shown to lower the odds of testing positive for COVID-19 by 83%, according to the CDC. 
Komal Samrow (SFS ’25), who has expressed concern about COVID-19 in the District, said listening to public health experts on guidance for protection is important to combat COVID-19 risks.
“What I do know is that there is a segment of the population that is genuinely threatened by COVID, and if all it takes to help protect those people is to wear a mask indoors,” Samrow told The Hoya. 
Samrow said she will continue to adapt as the pandemic evolves.
“I look forward to things going back to the way they used to be, but right now, I’m happy learning to adjust and adapt, if it means I and the people around me are safe and healthy,” Samrow wrote.

The closing of all dining halls accepting meal swipes on campus over Easter break prompted student concerns about food security on campus. 
During the April 13 to April 18 break, Georgetown University closed all dining locations, including Leo J. O’Donovan dining hall, the only dining hall on campus. Only Epicurean and Company, a restaurant that requires the use of Flex dollars or other methods of personal payment, remained open for the duration of the break. Students expressed concerns about food options over the break due to the closure of Leo’s and other campus dining locations. 
The university’s decision to close dining hall locations without providing alternative food sources exacerbated existing food insecurity problems, according to Ace Frazier (MSB ’24), who remained on campus over break. 
“As an independent student I often wonder where I’m going to get my next necessity,” Frazier wrote to The Hoya. “I’m already worried about being homeless this summer and every break I often have to ration meals. They should be available to anyone.”
Concern over food insecurity extends back semesters, with students expressing concerns over Thanksgiving break last fall. Over 50 students approached the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) about food options during the break after the university closed Leo’s. 
 Many students chose to remain on campus due to the brevity of the break, so the university’s decision affected more students than during other breaks, according to GUSA President Kole Wolfe (SFS ’24). 
“The university’s decision to close all meal plan dining locations was ill advised, especially because a majority of the student body is obligated to purchase the meal plan, and many students on campus during the break rely on Leo’s, RJ, and Crop Chop for their meals and can’t afford to double pay for food,” Wolfe wrote to The Hoya.
Royal Jacket, a sandwich shop, and Crop Chop, a salad bar, both accept meal swipes and were closed during the break. 
Emma Barbazette (NHS ’25), who remained on campus for the break, was not surprised by the university’s decision to close dining locations. 
“The lack of food options over break was very frustrating for those remaining on campus, but unsurprising given issues that many students have had with food security in the past. There was only one food option available on campus – Epicurean – and it was one for which we had to pay,” Barbazette wrote to The Hoya. 
The current meal plan policy requires all students living on campus to enroll in a meal plan. First-years and sophomores are limited to the most expensive All Access 7 Plan, which includes unlimited meal swipes at Leo’s and costs $3,260.
The university’s decision to close dining locations was made after an assessment of student needs, according to a university spokesperson.
“Demand for on-campus dining typically declines significantly over break periods and Epicurean continues to be able to easily support the volume of demand during these times,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. 
Students can use Flex dollars, which are part of meal plans, at Epicurean or visit the Hoya Hub, a campus food pantry that remained open during the break, according to the spokesperson. 
The Georgetown Scholars Program (GSP), which provides support for first-generation low-income students, distributed meal vouchers for the break, according to the spokesperson.
Serena Barish (COL ’25), who remained on campus over the break, said the lack of support from the university was frustrating given that many students chose to remain on campus for financial reasons. 
“I feel as though many people made the plans to stay on campus over break with the intention of saving money. Therefore, the University forcing these students to pay for food appears counterproductive,” Barish wrote to The Hoya. 
The lack of support for students over breaks reflects a larger problem on campus, Barish said. 
“It reflects the larger culture on campus of a lack of awareness of the varying financial situations of students,” Barish wrote.

An $11 million gift from Michael (GSB ’89) and Robin Psaros will energize the newly renamed Psaros Center on Financial Markets and Policy. 
The Psaros Center, founded following the 2008 financial crisis by Georgetown University finance professor Reena Aggarwal, facilitates objective, data-backed dialogue that can inform government and economic decision making about critical issues related to financial policy. Psaros, who studied under Aggarwal in the 1980s, supported this vision with an initial gift of $500,000 to establish the center. 
Finance is the most popular major at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business (MSB), and this most recent gift will enable the Psaros Center to engage students at a deeper level, Aggarwal said. 
“We are going to expand what we are doing with students in terms of having student fellows at the center, research assistants, and these student fellows and research assistants will have the ability to work not only with the faculty associates of the Psaros Center but also with really distinguished board members and visiting distinguished fellows,” Aggarwal said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The Psaros Center’s Board of Advisors consists of 15 professionals, ranging from Robert Steers, who leads Georgetown’s Steers Center for Real Estate, to Stacey Cunningham, former president of the New York Stock Exchange. They help shape the Psaros Center’s practice and policy by providing leadership and expertise to students.
Psaros hopes that the gift will benefit the students and school that led to his own success. 
“My family is humbled and excited to invest in Georgetown, and in doing so, give back to a country that has provided us with so many opportunities,” Psaros said in the university’s April 11 news release.
Aggarwal said that a lot has changed in the field of finance within the last 10 years, and the Psaros Center needs to explore all of it.
“There are so many issues that policymakers and the markets have to deal with right now that didn’t even exist 10 years ago, like digital assets,” Aggarwal said. “It’s a whole new emerging area, and both policymakers and the private sector are trying to figure it out. What is the future of digital assets? What is blockchain technology? What is the future of crypto assets?”
The donation from Psaros will fund investments in student programming and serve as a resource and asset for the Georgetown community. New opportunities will include the chance for student fellows and research assistants to work on conducting their own research with faculty.
Samantha Krause, director of marketing and communications at the MSB, said the Psaros gift will directly improve the student experience at the Psaros Center through the hiring of a new executive director and a student programming facilitator. 
“The Center is focused on increasing events for students, including pulling new faculty leaders for different speaker events,” Krause said in an interview with The Hoya. “There has been a lot of great work and programming in the decade or so the center has already existed. We can expect to see an acceleration of all of the positive contributions. For students, there will be many ways to participate and find support.”
Anthony DeGrado (MSB ’23), a research assistant at the Psaros Center who analyzes trends of growth within emerging markets, focusing on the blended finance evident in public-private partnerships, said there are many existing and upcoming opportunities for students to get involved with research at the Psaros Center. 
“The gift is just going to accelerate much of what has already been going on. The faculty have lectures on their research and have many presentations open to all students,” DeGrado said. “In the future, the center is looking to have a broader range of opportunities for students to get involved with, from research positions to special events.”
Aggarwal said that the resources present at the Psaros Center are crucial to understanding the current financial market. 
“COVID has made financial inclusion and inequity an even bigger issue, so the Center is really uniquely positioned to address these new emerging issues that both policymakers and the broader practitioner community is facing,” Aggarwal said. “This is a pivotal moment, as there is so much going on in the world of finance and policy that Georgetown must step up and take on this role.”
