Seeing an opportunity to educate and improve the lives of their classmates in college, Maggie Cullina (COL ’22) launched their own sex education Instagram account to guide college students and young adults through the complexities of gender and relationships. 
Cullina’s Instagram account, titled “La Nouvelle Sexe,” aims to offer concrete advice for students navigating relationships in college despite this time of remote learning. 
“I think this year especially, even though it’s not a traditional time to be in college, I still want to have the main focus of the account be for college students because I think the ecosystem of campus sex is so specific and weird,” Cullina said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “I really want to investigate, what is hookup culture? What does that mean? What does it feel like to be a part of?”
Cullina plans on posting about topics including what sex positivity means to them, sex and relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic and how consent should begin, according to their Instagram. 
“There is so much I wish I had known about sex (and gender and relationships) when I was younger and I also have so many thoughts on the discourse of college students and sex,” they wrote on the account’s first post Sept. 6. 
For Cullina, the language used around consent was designed to function in a legal setting, rather than in interpersonal situations. Young adults need to be taught the importance of boundaries and how to communicate those, they said. 
“You have to teach people how to have compassionate sex, and so I think that is definitely my perspective as a sex educator,” Cullina said. “Being able to build that curriculum from an academic perspective I think was really important to me.” 
Women’s and gender studies professor Sara Collina originally suggested Cullina identify themself as “your local philosopher of sex ed” on their Instagram account. Online accounts like Cullina’s do important work toward making the larger culture more inclusive and aware of all sexualities.
“The two things that I see Maggie bringing together so beautifully is this passion for communicating, educating and promoting what I think [they] would call sex postive,” Collina said in an interview with The Hoya. “But we can also call it more simply a promoting a culture of respect and inclusion in the context of sex and sexuality.” 
Cullina did not pursue the intersection of sex and school at first. When they arrived at Georgetown, Cullina had planned to major in global health in the School of Nursing and Health Studies. 
“In my head still, my academic interests were still very separate from sex,” they said. 
Then, in October 2019, Cullina listened to a podcast produced by WNYC’s RadioLab called “In The No,” a three-part series that explored the complexities in the language of consent. Afterward, Cullina looked with newfound interest to see if Georgetown offered any courses on the subject, and they discovered the women’s and gender studies program, they said. 
“I think that kind of marked a shift in studying sex and relationships from more of an intrapersonal and community level and not just sex as something between two people,” Cullina said. “I think through various women’s and gender studies classes, being able to study the social aspects of sex was really interesting and foundational for me.”
Last fall, Cullina helped develop the “Title IX for a New Generation” course with their classmates and Collina. The student-designed course, which facilitates student-led research and proposals tackling evolving Title IX policies at Georgetown, allowed Cullina to explore the best methods of teaching ways to prevent sexual harm.
Though Cullina participated in sex education at school when they were growing up, they learned what it meant to be sex-positive and became familiar with the topic through YouTube, including Hannah Witton’s channel and Lindsey Doe’s series “Sexplanations.” Creators such as Witton and Doe have used YouTube, Instagram and other internet platforms to promote sex positivity and educate a generation raised on abstinence-only slogans and unfettered Internet pornography, according to The New York Times.
Cullina is clear that “La Nouvelle Sexe” is not meant to replace robust and healthy sex education. Instead, their account shows there might be more to learn about sex than many people assume, they said. 
“I think I just want to kind of plant the seed to cultivate that you should question what you’ve been taught about sex,” Cullina said. “I think that’s what being a philosopher of sex ed means to me.”

Georgetown University undergraduates elected a majority female student senate for the first time in history last week, marking what many Georgetown University Student Association officials hope is a permanent transition to a more diverse and inclusive student government.
Polls closed for the GUSA Senate elections Sept. 19 after a contentious and unorthodox campaign cycle. Seven Black Georgetown students were also elected to the senate, the highest number in history, according to GUSA Vice President and former Senator Bryce Badger (MSB ’21).
With a diverse incoming senate, GUSA will be better able to accurately represent and support the student body, especially marginalized groups on campus, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22).
“Perspectives that have been overlooked and misrepresented for so long will finally have a voice in the room,” Sanchez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “No longer will predominantly cis white men debate issues that affect marginalized communities. Time after time, these men promised to fight our issues for us. However, we are more than capable of doing it ourselves. This Senate has the opportunity to enact incredible, long-lasting change that will affect students for generations and promote opportunities for more communities to feel empowered to join.” 
Many students who clinched senate seats joined the campaign by petition days before polls were set to open. The election saw eight out of the 12 students who petitioned to be in the race win seats. Many of these newly elected senators are BIPOC candidates advocating for a more diverse and inclusive senate.
Makayla Jeffries (COL ’23), one of the newly elected sophomores who petitioned to join the ballot, was initially hesitant to join the contest because of concerns about GUSA culture.
“I had been thinking about running for GUSA Senate since my freshman year, but I’d been turned off from it by all these horror stories, the way people’s faces dropped as soon as I brought up GUSA Senate,” Jeffries said in an interview with The Hoya. “I don’t know if I had the personality that fits what a GUSA senator is supposed to be.”
Jeffries also expressed her frustrations over past senates’ treatment of female senators of color, a sentiment shared earlier this week by some students in GroupMe chats. Jeffries specifically mentioned the experience of former GUSA Senator Alexandra Mucher (COL ’22), who resigned from the senate Jan. 26, citing a toxic work environment.
The petitions succeeded in creating a more diverse and representative senate, according to GUSA Senator Leo Rassieur (COL ’23), who won reelection.
“This race was definitely shaken up by the addition of all of the candidates who petitioned after we succeeded in extending the petition period during the emergency senate meeting,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Senate’s makeup has changed dramatically as a result of the election, and I think we’ll finally be able to represent the diverse community that Georgetown is.”
Jeffries was among the candidates running as part of the Progressive Coalition, a group co-founded last semester by Senator Leo Teixeira (COL ’21) to advocate for marginalized groups on campus.
“Myself and a few other senators, who have since graduated, came to this conclusion that the senate (and the trajectory it was on) was not sufficiently advocating for marginalized communities and had a crisis of performative action,” Teixeira wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The goal of the coalition has always been to win a strong number of seats in the senate, so we saw the benefit of having such a large number of candidates coming together.”
Overall, 19 members of the Progressive Coalition, a cohort of GUSA and non-GUSA members focused on student activism, successfully won their seats in the senate. The group currently includes about 30 to 40 students, 27 of whom ran for senate seats. The Progressive Coalition has no ties to the Georgetown Progressive Alliance, a different student group on campus.
Many incumbent senators will not be serving in the senate this year. Several senators dropped out of the race before polls opened Sept. 17 amid tensions surrounding the work culture in the senate, and several others resigned from the senate earlier this year.
The Class of 2024 seats were filled by Adora Adeyemi (MSB ’24), Bella Fassett (SFS ’24), Camber Vincent (SFS ’24), Deborah Wey (SFS ’24), Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24), Lara Sophia Santana (SFS ’24), and Nirvana Khan (SFS ’24). 
The remaining seats were filled accordingly: Ivan Jimenez (COL ’21), Lily McGrail (COL ’21), Natalie La Fleur (COL ’21), Samantha Moreland (COL ’21), and Winston Ardoin (SFS ’21) won the remaining seats for the Class of 2021. 
Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22), Henry Dai (SFS ’22), Jordan Brown (COL ’22), Melanie Cruz-Morales (COL ’22), Olivia Kleier (SFS ’22), and Rowlie Flores (COL ’22) each won a seat for the Class of 2022. 
Anndy Serrano (COL ’23), Erique Perez (COL ’23), Kariel Bennett (COL ’23) and Katie Wang (SFS ’23) won the remaining seats allotted to the Class of 2023. 
David Park (MSB ’23), Nicole Sanchez (SFS ’22), William Leonard (COL ’23) and Yaritza Aguilar (COL ’22) won the remaining three at-large seats.

In past semesters, members of the Georgetown Parliamentary Debate Team spent their evenings practicing in windowless ICC classrooms before trouncing their opponents at tournaments across the country. 
This semester, they have had to adjust their operations. Their debate tournaments, as well as all their practices, will be held virtually, causing GPD President Cindy Wang (SFS ’21) to worry that it may be hard to sustain student engagement and build a tightly knit cohort of debaters. However, new students seem eager to join the club; the team saw a 30% increase in membership this fall. 
“The biggest challenge we have right now is how to keep our members around and foster the same environment we would have with in-person physical interaction, because that historically has been a really important part for us to bond as a community,” Wang told The Hoya in a Zoom interview.
Because the semester is fully virtual, many Georgetown clubs are developing new ways to bring on new members and sustain club activities. Many have seen surprising increases in student involvement since the Council of Advisory Boards Fair at the beginning of the month.
Many clubs are focusing on creating methods to improve Zoom fatigue, a phrase of the times describing the adverse effects of excessive screen time on physical and psychological health. 
H*yas For Choice, a group that advocates for reproductive justice and provides contraceptives to students, recognizes the toll the virtual environment can take on members, according to Vice President Rachel Harris (COL ’21).
“When meeting, learning, or doing advocacy work through a virtual forum, it is inherently impersonal and isolating,” Harris wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are trying to mitigate these issues by meeting with each of our advocacy team members one on one to check in and provide support in any way we can.” 
H*yas for Choice is also taking steps to combat Zoom fatigue by keeping meetings to an hour length, hosting smaller, more personal discussions, and keeping members engaged on GroupMe, Harris wrote. 
Despite the virtual setting, Harris has witnessed energetic engagement and commitment from its members.
“Honestly, I have been surprised by the willingness and dedication of individuals for involvement. Virtual learning environments are extremely draining, and to see that individuals are still invigorated about advocating for reproductive and sexual wellness is keeping me hopeful and inspired this semester,” Harris wrote.
Hoya Blue, the student fan section for Georgetown’s sports teams, has already implemented new virtual club activities to help members stay engaged and get to know each other, according to Vice President Lauren Pyjar (SFS ’21).
“We did a virtual trivia night last week, and then this coming week we are doing speed dating, which is kinda fun — not like actually dating — but just one-on-one two-minute conversations over Zoom just to get to know people,” Pyjar said in an interview with The Hoya. “Coming up, I think we are going to do once a week or every other week group watches of old games”
Though new students are eager to engage with club life, club members face significant geographical and technological barriers to participating in club life.
Freshman Wenyu Zhu (COL ’24), who lives in China, has found it difficult to engage in club activities late into the night. 
“For me, the virtual environment is mainly difficult for my 12-hour time difference,” Zhu wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As an international student, I only have limited choices regarding time difference, but if I decide to stay up, my body doesn’t allow me to be engaged at that time.” 
Although there have been some challenges with joining clubs virtually, clubs remain an active presence in student life. 
Some students, like freshman Mehek Thapar (COL ’24), who has already joined GU Jawani, Mask and Bauble, and Hoya Blue, among others, have immersed themselves in club life. 
“I am a person who really likes to stay busy, and I love that there are so many club events happening and that I can already get involved,” Thapar wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These clubs have definitely been my main social interaction, and a lot of them are focusing more on community building and bonding in the fall, which is nice, especially for a virtual semester where it’s so hard to get to know people.”

Low-income Georgetown University students struggling to balance school and home life under the added pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic have leaned on university resources during the virtual semester. 
Students returning to environments that make learning more difficult have turned to organizations such as the Community Scholars Program, a summer orientation program for incoming first-generation and low-income students, and the Georgetown Scholars Program, which supports low-income and first-generation Georgetown students through funds and partnerships with on-campus organizations.
When Georgetown initially transitioned to virtual learning in March, GSP helped the Georgetown University Alumni Student Federal Credit Union, Georgetown’s student-run bank, establish a Coronavirus Student Relief Fund, which helped students pay for flights home and cover other expenses related to transitioning off campus. Since then, GSP has provided easier access to resources like necessity funding, which is available to GSP students throughout the year for professional, academic or emergency expenses.
Manahal Fazal (SFS ’24) had to get a job at the beginning of the pandemic to help support her family and save for college expenses after her father, her family’s main income source, lost his job. 
“It was very difficult because I knew I had to work in order to have some sort of allowance to help pay for college and then certain essentials, along with helping my parents out,” Fazal said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It was a lot to manage, and luckily, it was senior year, so I didn’t have that big of a workload. But during AP Exam time, it got extremely difficult because there were times when I should have been practicing for the exam that I had to work.”
Fazal participated in CSP, which helped her easily settle into her classes this semester.
“It was an amazing experience,” Fazal said. “It really prepared me a lot for what classes were going to be like and helped me through the transition into college-level classes. In the fall, it wasn’t difficult at all because CSP gave me that momentum, and I knew what was expected.”
Despite the struggles she faced in her final semester of high school, living on campus at Georgetown this semester has provided Fazal a safe and productive work environment without distractions, she said.
Georgetown’s revised plan for the fall semester, which was released at the end of July, caused concern for many freshmen who were planning to live on campus. Originally, the university intended on housing the entire Class of 2024 on campus. However, when pandemic conditions did not improve, the university only offered on campus housing to students with extenuating circumstances. 
Deborah Wey (SFS ’24) lives with her parents, her three siblings and her niece. Wey, who works as a cashier to help pay tuition, and her parents have struggled with their employment since the start of the pandemic, she said.
Wey is a member of GSP, which has been advantageous in her transition to college from home, she said. 
“So far, it’s been really good. They definitely have tried to engage with students as much as possible,” Wey said. “I definitely feel like they’re doing a really good job with connecting students virtually and trying their best to connect them with the resources that they would need.”
When Wey learned Georgetown revised its fall plan, she started to worry about her living situation and balancing her responsibilities at home with her academic responsibilities.
“I definitely was worried about my learning space because I already had to live with six other people,” Wey said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Even now, it’s already proving to be inhibitory towards my education because it’s just a big distraction. I understand why I have to do these things, but it really doesn’t help that I already have to teach myself certain things, and then I have that on top of it.”
Although Wey could have applied to live on campus, she chose not to because she wanted to keep spots open for other students who were going through more difficult living situations.
“I really should have applied, and I regret it every day because of my family situation and then also just the need for resources,” Wey said. “But the reason why I didn’t was because I didn’t want to take this opportunity away from somebody who has a more serious situation than I do.”
GSP has taken steps this semester to financially support low-income students facing heightened anxieties given the conditions of the pandemic, according to the GSP Executive Director Melissa Foy (COL ’03).
“A GSP student came up with the brilliant idea of a ‘Learn from Home’ grant designed to offset expenses that come with learning wherever a student is this semester – maybe a lamp or a slightly more comfortable chair,” Foy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “All GSP students are eligible for that and hundreds have used it.  We also continue to use our Necessity Fund to help with many other unexpected costs like medical bills, counseling, tutoring, etc.”
GSP is also offering more professional development resources for students this semester, according to Foy.
“There is increased angst among our students regarding jobs and careers so we’ve ramped up our professional development offerings through events, job postings and our mentorship to support them,” Foy said. “Mostly we’re trying to be flexible because all of this is unchartered territory, so it’s important to be responsive to the moment we’re in.”

Earlier this month, The Hoya revealed that several Georgetown University students had belongings they had left on campus for storage thrown away or lost on the university’s watch. Several other students notified The Hoya about similar storage experiences after the article’s initial release. Two students who experienced storage mishaps told The Hoya that a moving company partnered with the university had lost many of their valuables. 
I.
One student, who wished to keep their identity anonymous because their case is still being investigated by the university, was unable to return to campus to move out of their apartment, which prompted Georgetown to store the student’s belongings with Hilldrup. The student requested that their items be shipped to their home rather than be stored in a facility, which was not a possibility accounted for in the March move-out protocol, according to the student. 
“There was no plan of action to ship students’ things back,” they said in an interview with The Hoya. “It was obvious to me that their only objective was to store things and did not anticipate needing to ship things.”
After continued correspondence with the university and Hilldrup from March until May, the student was finally able to have their items shipped to their residence. However, they explained that communication about getting their belongings shipped was confusing and vague.
“There was no transparency because I had known that my stuff had been packed and stored and it was somewhere in Virginia, and there was no indication of when I would get it back,” they said.
Upon opening the boxes, though, the student discovered that expensive moisturizers, hand sanitizers, supplements, a designer accessory, a suitcase and a vacuum cleaner were missing.  They also received some items, including toilet paper, laundry detergent, sheets and plates, that they requested to be donated in a Google form sent out to all students unable to return to campus to move out.
The student requested $537 from the Office of Risk Management for their losses and was awarded $517.
They believe most of the complications were because of Hilldrup’s lack of transparency.
“I can’t complain about the way Residential Living handled everything,” they said. “It was the communication with Hilldrup that was not great. It seems that there was a lack of communication between Georgetown and Hilldrup.”
II.
Lauren Olosky (SFS ’21) was unable to return to campus to gather her belongings from her Village B apartment after Georgetown extended online learning until the end of the spring semester.
“Georgetown had said that I would need to be quarantining for two weeks, which I was doing in California with my family, but that they wouldn’t wait two weeks for me to come get my stuff,” Olosky said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I was like, ‘Why do you need to get my stuff out right now? Can’t you just wait until I can come back and get it on my own?’”
Olosky’s roommate sent her most of her personal and valuable items because she could not retrieve her belongings on her own, while the university stored the rest of her items with Hilldrup free of charge.
In June, when Olosky returned to Washington, D.C., to move into a townhouse rental, she was able to retrieve her items from storage. However, she discovered that several of her belongings were missing.
“It was mostly household items, but I lost some artwork too that I had bought in Germany, like custom artwork — watercolor — that I have no way to replace,” Olosky said. “Some of the stuff was large. I have a bar cart for example. I don’t know how that just goes missing.”
Olosky reached out to Hilldrup in an attempt to locate her missing items only to find out that Hilldrup never logged any Georgetown students in its system, so there was no record of Olosky’s belongings ever being in storage and therefore no way to track down her missing items. 
Hilldrup directed Olosky to Georgetown. After communicating with the Office of Risk Management, Olosky was able to receive full compensation for her missing items. However, she does not think Georgetown’s response to the situation was adequate. 
“I just felt like I had fallen between the cracks. Between Hilldrup and the university, neither has taken responsibility for the loss and for telling me what happened, so I have no way of knowing,” Olosky said. “It was a really frustrating experience for me back in March and then again in June, and that’s just something that I felt again and again.”

Ruth Bader Ginsburg may have been a towering legal and cultural icon, but at Georgetown University, she was also admired as a frequent visitor and mentor to students — and as “Marty’s wife,” the loving life partner of the late Georgetown University Law Center professor Martin Ginsburg. 
Georgetown Law held a virtual memorial Monday night remembering the late justice who died Sept. 18 at age 87 from complications of pancreatic cancer. Georgetown community members shared personal stories and extolled Ginsburg’s legal, personal and pedagogical excellence. 
The event was moderated by Law Center Dean William Treanor and featured reflections from several Georgetown community members with ties to Ginsburg: professors Mary Hartnett and Wendy Williams, co-authors of her authorized biography; professors Dori Bernstein and Mitt Regan, two of her former law clerks; and Judges M. Margaret McKeown (LAW ’75) and Nina Pillard, two of her colleagues on the federal bench. 
Pillard, a former Georgetown Law professor, who has often been compared to Ginsburg and mentioned as a potential future Supreme Court justice, said Ginsburg’s life had served as an inspiration for her own career.
“She was an incredible example,” Pillard said. “She’s gone, and she is irreplaceable. We are bereft.”
Each speaker took turns recalling and sharing their fond personal memories of Ginsburg: from weekly calls to Bernstein when she was hospitalized mid-clerkship to assenting to participate in a school project for Regan’s middle-school daughter.
Hartnett remembered how Ginsburg came to a class of hers to watch former President Barack Obama’s farewell address with her students and said it was a testament to Ginsburg’s dedication to working with students.
“Justice Ginsburg so loved students,” Hartnett said. “Her students, our students, all students, which is why she found so much time for them, for you.”
The speakers also discussed Ginsburg’s lasting love of education, stemming from her roots in academia. Ginsburg worked as a law professor at Rutgers Law School from 1963 to 1972 before moving to Columbia Law School where she became the first tenured woman at the school.
After being appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit by President Jimmy Carter in 1980, Ginsburg continued to find time for students by speaking at the Law Center. Treanor expressed his gratitude for her service to Georgetown, recounting the iconic jurist’s more than two dozen addresses on campus over four decades. She last spoke on campus in February to commemorate the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. 
“Even after she went on the bench, she remained a teacher,” Treanor said. “And we at Georgetown, as a community, benefited immeasurably from her commitment to teaching the next generation.”
Many of the professors who participated also described the devoted partnership shared between the justice and their former colleague Martin Ginsburg, who served as a faculty member at Georgetown Law for 30 years until his death in 2010. Martin Ginsburg was known as a fierce advocate for his wife, pushing for her appointment to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and later to the Supreme Court.
“How can we carry on the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg?” Pillard said. “I would say that all of you know a woman who could benefit from the kind of love and support that Marty gave to Ruth. It’s on you to honor the Ginsburgs by being for those women their Martys.” 
The justice’s former clerks remembered her as an exacting boss with high expectations and, as Regan put it, a “meticulous — some might say compulsive — attention to detail.” But, they agreed, the payoff was enormous. Bernstein credited Ginsburg with transforming her legal career and offering an example that would guide her for decades afterward.
“It’s almost like when you’re in therapy, and your therapist is always in your head,” Bernstein said. “When you clerk for someone like Justice Ginsburg, she’s in your head for life.”
As the event came to a close, Treanor held back tears while sounding the hopeful note he said Ginsburg would have wanted to be shared. 
“Challenges are real, and losses are inevitable,” he said. “But we should learn from Justice Ginsburg that faith in the future will sustain us and that faith will be rewarded.”
