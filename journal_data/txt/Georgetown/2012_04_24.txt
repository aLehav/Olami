With a revamped Residential Judiciary Committee and a growing Student Advocacy Office, the university’s avenues for student involvement in conduct policies are growing.
But unlike many universities that use student-enforced honor codes to protect against lying, stealing and other kinds of social misconduct, Georgetown’s is restricted to academic conduct.
Bryn Mawr College is one school that uses a broad honor code to police student life. According to Honor Board Head Emeritus Priya Saxena, this type of code positively contributes to the school’s culture.
“The social honor code encourages students to make the right decision but also holds them accountable for the not-so-right decisions,” Saxena wrote in an email.
The College of William and Mary and the University of Virginia also have honor codes that protect against cheating, lying and stealing. At both institutions, codes are enforced by entirely student-run organizations.
Stephen Nash, chair of the Honor Committee at UVA, said that the system, which was established in 1842 and was devised in part by students, has created an atmosphere of mutual respect and confidence on campus.
“I think many people feel that because of the presence of our system and how important it is for … students, it is an effective tool for preventing lying, cheating and stealing,” he said.
Nash added that the honor code creates an environment in which members of the campus community feel they can leave laptops and backpacks unattended.
Justin Duke, chair of the Honor Council at the College of William and Mary, echoed this sentiment but said that an honor code would not necessarily prevent major crimes.
“I think if someone’s going to steal computers or cars, they’re going to do it regardless of potential Honor Code ramifications just because they’re often dwarfed by legal ones,” he said.
Duke pointed out that the code is often more effective at preventing lesser offenses that involve questions of morality rather than legality.
“It makes you stop and realize that petty theft like that isn’t a one-way street,” he said. “If you commit an act, it comes at someone else’s expense.”
Saxena echoed this sentiment.
“Having an Honor Code does not make a perfect environment, but it does hold students accountable for their actions,” she wrote.
Georgetown’s honor pledge is a part of the university Honor System, which is separate from the Student Code of Conduct. Honor Code violations, which include plagiarism, are dealt with by the university’s Honor Court, while the Office of Student Conduct punishes Code of Conduct infractions.
Sonia Jacobson, director of Georgetown’s Honor Council and assistant for academic affairs, wrote in an email that the university’s pledge helps students understand the importance of honor.
Unlike those of William and Mary, UVA and Bryn Mawr, however, the Georgetown pledge does not address instances of theft.
Jacobson added that the university may implement a similar honor pledge for social consciousness and said that the issue is being considered by Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Jeanne Lord.
“I do believe a stated pledge requiring honest, civil, respectful behavior would help remind students how important those attitudes are and help prevent theft by students against other students … and the institution,” Jacobson wrote in an email.
She added that the university has not considered integrating theft into the Honor Code.
According to Jacobson, because most of Georgetown’s crime seems to be committed by people not affiliated with the university, it would be difficult to determine whether or not such a pledge would help decrease crime on campus.
Duke emphasized that whether or not they are effective at preventing crime, social codes are important because they encompass all aspects of student life.
“The non-academic provisions in our code are important because it is an honor code and not an academic code,” he said. “I think ours covers the reality that college is a place to grow intellectually and it is a place where people mature into adults.”

This summer, Heather Sweet (SFS ’14) will make her way from San Francisco, Calif., to Washington, D.C., a 4,100-mile cross-country journey that will be the longest bike ride of her life.
The trip is part of the Ocean2Ocean campaign organized by Motion Commotion, a nonprofit organization that promotes health and fitness.
During her 53-day journey, Sweet will stop to speak to youth, including members of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the YMCA, about the benefits of exercise.
The riders hope to gain the attention of first lady Michelle Obama’s campaign to raise healthier and more active children when they make their final stop at the White House.
Sweet was inspired by her involvement with the Georgetown Triathlon Team to undertake the endeavor with Sarah Swigart (COL ’08), the Triathlon Team founder and director of Motion Commotion USA.
Sweet said that her immediate interest arose because of the event’s focus on exercise and being outside. However, her desire to participate also stems from personal reasons.
“I have rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, and this year particularly was very hard to manage, so it was one of those things that I … see as an obstacle that … this trip will help me overcome,” Sweet said.
A competitive swimmer in high school, Sweet began cycling actively in the spring of 2011. In preparation for the event, she has continued competing with the Triathlon Team and has extended her workout regimen.
“Motion Commotion is really rooted in and associated with the Georgetown Tri Team,” Sweet said. “Riders include many enthusiastic Georgetown athletes from the team.”
Sweet credited her team, friends and family as another source of motivation.
“I am infinitely thankful to everyone who is contributing to the efforts of Motion Commotion,” she said. “Knowing that I have friends, family and the Georgetown community supporting this adventure is really inspirational.”

Despite a muted presence on campus this semester, the advocacy group D.C. Students Speak has been making strides toward increased student representation in local politics.
According to Andrew Klemperer (SFS ’13), DCSS co-chair, the Georgetown chapter of the organization has been focused on encouraging students to register to vote in local elections, supporting the university in the 2010 Campus Plan debate and protesting the local noise ordinance, which jails or fines those who make an “unreasonably loud noise” between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.
During the last week of February, the organization registered 250 students at Georgetown, American University, The Catholic University of America, The George Washington University and Howard University as D.C. voters.
Describing the voter registration strategy as a “dorm storm,” Klemperer emphasized the importance of having student representation in D.C. politics.
“The reason that student opinions and interests are usually not represented, especially in the local government like the [Advisory Neighborhood Commission], is because students don’t vote,” he said.
According to Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), who is slated to be co-chair of the Georgetown chapter of DCSSnext semester, student votes will be especially important this fall when Georgetown students will likely run for three positions on ANC 2E.
Across the District, DCSS has also focused on protesting political decisions that affect students, such as the D.C. Residential Parking Protection Act, a law that would repeal a special vehicle licensing exception for students.
The new law, which would have required students who live in D.C. and have a car to live in special permit zones, register their cars in D.C., buy D.C. car insurance and obtain D.C. residency and tags, was not instituted in part because DCSS chapters District-wide signed a petition in December.
The petition, which was signed by over 600 students, complained that many students have legitimate reasons to drive, such as commuting to work and tending to medical and family concerns and that legislation singling them out was therefore unjust, . In addition, several DCSS members testified in front of D.C. Council to oppose the act.
Klemperer said that because the university has turned to private negotiations with neighborhood groups to resolve the campus plan debate, student advocacy has played a diminished role in that process.
“This semester has been a little more quiet than we wanted it to be with the campus plan dying down,”Klemperer said.
Georgetown University Students Association Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) added that a change in DCSS leadership this semester may have contributed to its reduced visibility on campus.
“Previously, the president of DCSS was [Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13)], a Georgetown student, and this year it’s [Michael Panek], an American [University] student,” she said. “There’s sharing power between Georgetown and other schools involved.”
Alykhan Merali (SFS ’13), co-chair of the Georgetown chapter of DCSS, said that while the organization has been less focused on the campus plan dispute, it has been active in several other initiatives.
“We may have been a little bit more under the radar because the issues we are pursuing are not as controversial as the campus plan,” Merali said. “However, our goal is to work with all of the issues that affect students in D.C.”
Klemperer added that DCSS will continue to play an active role in the campus plan debate as necessary.
“The campus plan is an important issue for DCSS and for most Georgetown students,” Klemperersaid.
According to Panek, the organization has been making strides toward fulfilling its goal of gaining more respect for students in D.C. politics and hopes to continue this trend in the future.
“The fact that city leaders are now reaching out to students, coming to college campuses and cultivating relationships that are so important makes me feel like I’ve been successful,” Panek said.
The organization brought Ward 6 Councilmember Tommy Wells, an advocate of ethics reform and government oversight, to speak at Georgetown in January. Wells talked about the unique challenges of the D.C. government and endorsed Georgetown’s position in the campus plan debate.
Georgetown’s chapter of DCSS also hopes to reschedule a rescinded speaking engagement withCouncilmember Jack Evans.
In the future, Tezel said he hopes to get more students registered to vote, ensure that Georgetown students win all three possible seats on the ANC in November, increase DCSS meeting attendance on campus and generate a better relationship between the university and neighbors.
“This is something that our fellow D.C. universities have done better than us … and we think [developing a stronger relationship with our neighbors] starts with these elections,” he said.

Mayor Vincent Gray has proposed tax benefits as a means of ensuring that LivingSocial, an online daily discount provider co-founded by a Georgetown graduate, keeps its headquarters in D.C. after the company failed to make a profit last year.
Amazon, which owns 31 percent of the company, reported in February that LivingSocial incurred a net loss of $558 million.
Though the company has sold over 63 million daily deal vouchers since it was founded as Hungry Machine in 2007, it has yet to turn a profit. Last year,Groupon, LivingSocial’s largest competitor in the daily discount market, suffered a $308.1 million loss.
D.C. officials worry that the financial strain of maintaining headquarters in the District could compelLivingSocial, which is one of the city’s biggest private employers, to move.
The company’s co-founder and chief executive, Tim O’Shaughnessy (MSB ’04), told Gray that keeping LivingSocial in D.C. would be more expensive than pursuing growth elsewhere, according to an April 17 article in The Washington Post.
“We’ll make a commitment to the District if the District will make a commitment to us,” he said.
In response, Gray proposed the tax incentives that, pending approval by the Council of the District of Columbia, are forecasted to save LivingSocial up to $32.5 million in taxes over a five-year period, beginning in 2015. In turn, this would bring the District $133 million during the next 10 years from corporate income, personal income, taxation on hotel stays and other spending by LivingSocial.
According to Doxie McCoy, senior communications manager for the mayor, Gray hopes that the incentives will allow LivingSocial to remain a substantial part of the D.C. economy.
“Mayor Gray’s proposal is an effort to assist the economic development of D.C. as part of his economic strategy,” McCoy said. “LivingSocial is an essential part of enhancing the District’s economy, and that is why Mayor Gray wants to keep it around.”
Brendan Lewis, LivingSocial’s corporate communications director, told The Hoya that even thoughLivingSocial has received a high number of compelling relocation offers, the company is unlikely to move out of D.C., especially in light of Gray’s proposed incentives.
“D.C. is LivingSocial’s home and in our DNA. We are very grateful to Mayor Gray for his leadership and support in designing this mutually beneficial legislation and look forward to working with the City Council on its quick passage, which will allow LivingSocial to continue to grow and prosper with the District,” Lewis said.
With these tax adjustments, LivingSocial expects to hire an additional 1,000 employees in D.C. In exchange for the tax breaks, LivingSocial will be required to ensure that the majority of these employees reside in the District or move to the city within six months of their employment.

Depression may not be widely acknowledge at Georgetown, but it is widely felt, according to a presentation given Friday by Tyler White (COL ’14) on the results of his semester-long research project studying depression in college students.
White said the number of Georgetown students suffering from the disorder is on par with national statistics on young adult mental health.
“Essentially, it reiterated the message that Georgetown is like every other college campus across the country, and kids struggle with depression here, just like anywhere else,” White said.
White, a psychology major, designed and conducted the research project in coordination with JenniferWoolard’s “Research Methods and Statistics” class, along with classmates Betsy Helmer (COL ’13), Kayla McNeill (COL ’13), Joanna Orlando (COL ’14) and Olympia Filippeli (COL ’14).
The classmates distributed the Center for Epidemiological Studies’ Depression Scale, a 20-question population screening tool, in a number of introductory science and ethics courses at Georgetown. They received 387 student responses but were unable to release the exact statistical outcomes of the survey because of Institutional Review Board policy.
White, who hopes to pursue a profession in clinical psychology, was interested in studying mental health at Georgetown because of the particular tendency for college students to be affected by mental health difficulties.
“If you look at journal articles, almost one in four people between the ages of 18 and 25 will have a major depressive episode,” he said. “There are a lot of things that affect college students, and I think we all feel the ups and downs of college life.”
While about one in four students visits Georgetown’s Counseling and Psychiatric Service during his academic career — echoing the journal data White cited — attendees of the presentation agreed that student awareness and dialogue about mental health issues should be increased.
Andrew Kanouse (NHS ’14), who attended White’s presentation, said the statistics were ones that students needed to hear.
“I loved the cura personalis aspect Tyler brought into the point because that’s a side I’d never considered but is completely right. As Georgetown students, we have a duty to care for the whole person, particularly our minds,” Kanouse said.
At his presentation, White advocated extending training for Safety Net, a group of faculty that has agreed to reach out to any students they believe to be suffering from mental health issues, to include all professors on campus.
Director of Health Education Services Carol Day, who is familiar with White’s research, agreed that an expansion of the Safety Net program could be beneficial for students but questioned the feasibility of the idea.
“I think it’d be a great idea, but logistically, it’d be very hard,” Day said. “To do it at the scale that it would be beneficial and helpful, it would require another staff person whose primary job would be to pull that together.”
White hopes that his research will contribute to an open dialogue surrounding the topic of mental health in college.
“I think raising awareness is tremendously important in combating stigma and encouraging people to seek help earlier, rather than later,” White said.

With final exams quickly approaching, the LXR Community Council and the Georgetown Gastronomes have made plans to transform Alumni Square into a stress-free zone filled with puppies and slushies.
First implemented at the University of California at San Diego, Tufts University, and Yale University, “puppy love” is a proven de-stressing tactic. Research by the National Institutes of Health shows that interaction with dogs improves mental, social, and physiological health as well as lowers blood pressure.
Playfully designated “Slush Puppies,” Georgetown’s version of this stress-relief program will mirror earlier college initiatives. Set for April 28, the event offers participants a chance to play with 15 dogs and will also offer free slushies from the Gastronomes, an on-campus group that promotes healthy food choices. The dogs will be provided by the non-profit organization People Animals Love, which also supplies pups to area hospitals and convalescent homes.
“It is going to be a great community development initiative, but also an avenue to show that the community council can do more,” the event’s coordinator Dalvin Butler (COL’13) said, adding that he hopes the program will draw students over to east campus.
The program will take place in Alumni Square and is open to all students.
Katie DuBois (COL ’15) said she is looking forward to participating.
“I don’t think any amount of slushies or puppies will take the stress away from finals, but it sounds great,” she said.

With admission to graduate programs becoming more and more selective, “undergraduate research” has become a new buzz phrase on college campuses, Georgetown’s included.
The increasing role of research on campus has been especially evident this past month, as Georgetown has played host to three undergraduate research conferences in the past 10 days.
The most recent of these was the 11th annual Carroll Round conference on international economics, which was held this weekend. The event featured 28 students who showcased 26 papers on topics ranging from international trade to education in the developing world.
“[Participants] present their research in sessions that are modeled after professional-level academic conferences,” steering committee chair Katrina Koser (SFS ’12) said. “The whole goal is to foster scholarly innovation at the undergraduate level.”
With the success of the Carroll Round series in mind, Jonathan Askonas (SFS ’13) co-founded the Walsh Exchange earlier this year. The conference debuted April 13-15.
“To our knowledge, the Walsh Exchange is the first-ever undergrad research conference for international relations,” he said.
The inaugural conference featured 14 presentations from students at six East Coast universities.
Askonas believes the exchange will benefit both students and the university.
“The Walsh Exchange will cement Georgetown as not only the place to learn the profession of international relations, but a place for undergrads to engage in meaningful research as well,” he said.
Askonas also hopes that the quality of future conference presentations will attract up-and-coming professorial talent seeking undergraduate research assistants.
“That’s the big dream,” he said.
Despite the variety of presentation opportunities available to undergraduates, getting a chance to conduct research can be a challenge. Students must forge professional relationships with faculty and compete for available research spots.
This is made difficult by the fact that Georgetown has a student-faculty ratio of 11-to-1, much higher than that of peer research institutions. The University of Chicago and the University of Pennsylvania both have ratios of 6-to-1 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has a ratio of 8-to-1.
Tracking down a professor who is open to working with students is not always easy, either.
“I think we have a fundamental communications gap. A lot of professors conduct research, [but] unless you know them personally, you’re not able to find out what they’re doing. They may not know how to reach out to students,” Askonas said.
Askonas, who also serves as secretary of academic affairs for the Georgetown University Student Association, expressed his desire for the creation of a centralized database of research opportunities offered by faculty.
“Absence of information is a big part of why students don’t get involved in research,” he said.
Lauren Tuckley, research resource coordinator for the Office of Fellowships, Awards and Research, is working to implement a central database to house faculty requests for research assistants. Past the planning stage, the database is now under technical development, a stage Tuckley expects to be somewhat lengthy.
“[With the database] it will be much easier to go to one space, look for faculty members and look for connections,” she said.
Tuckley hopes to debut the site in fall 2012 but guaranteed that it would be available by the spring of 2013.
Even when students are able to find a professor to work with, many students face financial barriers when pursuing unpaid summer research opportunities.
“The only downside to Georgetown’s fantastic location in Washington is how challenging it can be to take on an internship full time over [the] summer that is unpaid,” Alexander Theos, assistant professor in the department of human sciences and faculty advisor for last Wednesday’s NHS Undergraduate Research Conference, said.
While several grants for independent summer research exist, Tuckley acknowledged that the university must provide more funding opportunities.
“Having more support would help a student make a choice that is more influenced by [his] academic interest than monetary interest,” she said.
Despite these recognized setbacks, Theos remains optimistic.
“When a student comes to me and asks, ‘How do I get involved in some type of independent research?’ I take a deep breath before giving them this sort of global overview,” Theos said. “The opportunities at this campus and in the greater D.C. community are mind-blowing.”

Six students became the first-ever pledge line of the Georgetown colony of the Phi Iota Alpha Fraternity Sunday, inaugurating the Latino fraternity’s presence on campus.
Founding member Alberto Morales (NHS ’12), who has been working with Phi Iota Alpha representatives since last August to establish Georgetown’s colony, said that the fraternity will bring to Latino students institutional support that the university does not provide.
“The reason that I decided to bring this specific chapter is because I personally saw some of my friends drop out of Georgetown and struggle a lot, and I couldn’t understand why,” Morales said. “We want to use [PIA] as a powerhouse to find innovative ways to unite the Latino community and all of Georgetown.”
Phi Iota Alpha strives to develop leadership and unite the Latino community, a mission the Georgetown colony aims to extend to people of all races and backgrounds. Despite Phi Iota Alpha’s Latino origins, Morales emphasized the importance of opening the fraternity to all students at Georgetown.
“Although this can be very successful, if we only welcome Latinos, then we are doing exactly what other clubs do,” Morales said.
Drawn to the fraternity because of its focus on personal improvement, new pledge Antony López(COL ’14) is excited to serve as an example for other students.
Martin Rincon (COL ’15), another brother, particularly enjoyed the pledging process. “You … build a friendship that’s really strong,” he said.
Because the university traditionally does not support Greek organizations, the group will not seek or receive funding or recognition from the Student Activities Council, instead looking to Greek organization councils for funding.
“This is a grassroots movement because it is an independent project,” Morales said. “We hope that Georgetown can fund us one day, because we believe this will add value to the community.”

University officials received a letter Thursday signed by almost half of Georgetown Law Center’s student body requesting that Georgetown include contraception coverage in student insurance plans for the 2012-2013 school year.
Georgetown Law Students for Reproductive Justice submitted the letter, which cited a decision by the Department of Health and Human Services to require all universities to cover women’s preventative services in their student insurance plans beginning in the coming school year.
Religiously affiliated institutions, however, have been given the option to delay coverage for a year. This would allow Georgetown to continue to exclude contraception from student insurance plans, an option the signatories of the letter opposed.
“It is the morally correct decision, and it is in line with the Jesuit creed of cura personalis, to care for the whole person,” the letter read.
According to Kelly Percival (LAW ’13), co-president of LSRJ, the letter is intended to show the level of student support for immediate coverage. Signed first by Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12), who has received a firestorm of media attention in recent months for her advocacy of contraception in insurance plans, the letter includes over 780 Georgetown Law student signatures.
“We’re just asking [the university] not to delay one extra year,” she said. “Delaying it is a strong statement on how they really feel about student health.”
In order to obtain signatures, Percival, Fluke and other supporters posted the letter online and sent it to student organizations and friends. They also tabled at the Law Center and solicited support in classrooms.
“We knew there was a lot of support for it, but we weren’t sure how much,” she said. “We were really thrilled with the overwhelming support that we got in the end.”
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, Georgetown has received other letters from several groups regarding the inclusion of contraception coverage in Georgetown’s health insurance plans. She did not comment on whether these petitions would affect the university’s position.
“University leaders have heard from groups on all sides of the issue of student health plans,” Kerr wrote in an email. “Their concerns have been clearly articulated, and the leadership of the university is grateful for the respectful dialogue that students and faculty with differing views have engaged in over the past few months.”
One such letter, which included 103 signatures from students and alumni, requested that the university clarify its position on contraception to be in keeping with church teaching.
Although the university has not yet responded to these most recent letters, University President John J. DeGioia previously replied to a letter from law school faculty calling for a commission to consider the university’s health plans. In the letter, DeGioia noted that students are not required to purchase health care from the university. He also maintained that the current policy is consistent with Georgetown’s Jesuit ideals.
According to Percival, LSRJ is currently working to draft further petitions in collaboration with H*yas for Choice and students at Georgetown’s School of Medicine.

Yates Field House released its second annual student survey Thursday in an effort to beef up its services and equipment.
The Fitness and Wellness Student Satisfaction Survey, conceived by Director of Fitness MeghanDimsa and Yates Field House Director Jim Gilroy, was sent in an email to all Georgetown students.
“My goal after composing and sending the survey is to simply listen and do what I can … to improve fitness and wellness at Yates,” Dimsa wrote in an email.
The survey comprises 27 questions that solicit student opinion on equipment maintenance, facility cleanliness and staff professionalism.
“Without assessing what our students want, I am unable to effectively program quality fitness classes, purchase state-of-the-art fitness equipment and put suggested ideas and changes into motion,”Dimsa wrote. “The responses from this survey are taken very seriously with an intention to do what I can to improve Yates.”
Joe Fiorica (COL ’14), who said he works out at Yates up to three times a week, felt that the facility has room to improve in terms of equipment.
“There [are] not enough benches and … free weights, so sometimes you can end up trying to rush to get the equipment before someone else or end up waiting,” he said.
Other students have concerns about the availability of equipment and facilities that are shared with varsity athletic teams.
“There’s always an elliptical free when I go, so I’m happy,” Bridget Mullen (COL ’15) said. “But sometimes it can be hard to find time to use the pool because the varsity team is always practicing.”
According to Dimsa, clear and constructive feedback has the ability to change the Yates experience.
“Clearly, not every comment, concern or request can be addressed immediately; however, the input will continually be addressed and in many cases implemented,” she wrote.
Despite its shortcomings, Fiorica said his experiences at Yates have been positive overall.
“I’ve been to gyms at other schools, and while there is room for some improvement [at Yates], we already have a great gym,” he said.

The fall semester editorial staff of The Hoya was elected this weekend and begins its term with today’s issue.
Editor-in-Chief Connor Gregoire (COL ’13) will continue his yearlong term, which started in November, while his senior editorial staff has experienced a complete turnover.
“I’m excited to get working with an entirely new staff,” Gregoire said. “It will be a challenging but rewarding experience.”
Lauren Weber (COL ’13), former executive editor and Board of Directors member, was elected chair of the board.
“I am honored to be elected chair … and I look forward to working with the incredibly talented team on staff in the year ahead as we continue to make strides to better serve the greater campus community,” Weber said.
Senior City News Editor Sarah Kaplan (SFS ’14) and Guide Editor Steven Piccione (COL ’13) were elected executive and managing editor, respectively.
The new staff hopes to continue the progress The Hoya has made over the past semester, Gregoiresaid, including its partnership with Washington Post Social Reader and the launch of “The Fourth Edition” and “Hoya Paranoia” blogs.
The Hoya’s focus will remain on these major projects in the upcoming fall semester, with a continued emphasis on widening the scope of news coverage.
“We hope to improve in our role as the best outlet for breaking news relevant to the campus community,” Gregoire said.
