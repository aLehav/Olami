“I was a GUSA senator freshman year, and my experience there was that the senate doesn’t get too much done, but I think that the president and the executive board [do] work hard to get stuff done. That stuff doesn’t always come into effect because it gets caught up in administrative problems, but they do work hard,” Michael Lonie (COL ’11) said.
The leading candidate opposing their re-election, Matt Wagner (SFS ’11), only had positive things to say about the two. “Calen and Jason approach the job very professionally. I would have focused on very different areas than they have done but they represent [the] general will of students,” Wagner said.
According to Angert and Kluger, their administration’s greatest success has been reforming the inner workings of GUSA itself.
“[The biggest victory] has been a cultural shift that we have brought about, more than any single action item. The only way those things can happen is when students work together, and the only way students are going to work together is if there is a no-nonsense culture,” Angert said.
Angert and Kluger said their close working relationship has made their performances as president and vice president all the more effective.
“We were good friends before coming in, and not some strategic thing that old GUSA did in the past. It let us work really closely, honestly. We could solve any issue even if we had difference of opinion just by working it out and having this close personal relationship on the side,” Kluger said.
For Angert, their soon-to-be-finished term’s success is best measured by their efforts to secure a tradition of results for future GUSA leaders.
“This whole term has been about setting the groundwork,” Angert said. “We are not looking to say ‘we did this and this and this.’ I’m much more interested in seeing this organization go forward.”

Abortion opponents reaffirmed their commitment to battle Roe v. Wade this past weekend, gathering at Georgetown for the 12th annual Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life.
The conference, which was organized by the Georgetown Knights of Columbus, Right to Life and Catholic Daughters, is named for Cardinal John O’Connor (GRD ’70), the late archbishop of New York. O’Connor was a renowned figure in the Catholic Church’s movement against abortion, celebrated for his participation in large-scale policy debates.
This year’s O’Connor Conference included a Mass for Life on Saturday night and group discussions, along with a panel discussion on O’Connor’s work and his vision for the anti-abortion movement on Sunday. The organizers also presented the Fr. Thomas M. King award to students from Villanova University for their work opposing abortion.
“There was a lot of work that went into this conference,” conference organizer Brigid Bower (COL ’11) wrote in an email. “I started planning this last March. As far as we know, it’s the largest student run pro-life conference in the country.”
The keynote address was delivered by Lila Rose, the 22-year-old founder of the anti-abortion organization Live Action, a youth-led group that uses new media and undercover reporting to expose alleged corruption in the abortion industry. In her speech, Rose urged students to dedicate themselves to the movement.
“Is there an issue, or a worse injustice, that is taking more lives, but is protected by the law, than abortion?” Rose asked. “This is the greatest cause of our day.”
Rose’s speech was well received by the anti-abortion crowd.
“[Rose] was a marvelous speaker, very articulate, and she has some very interesting ideas for trying to expose the deceptions that take place in Planned Parenthood, using creativity and modern technology to bring those deceptions to light,” said Fr. Joseph Koterski, S.J., a member of University Faculty for Life and the moderator of the panel discussion. Kieran Raval (COL ’13), advocate for the Knights of Columbus and a member of the board of directors for the conference, agreed.
“She brought youth and enthusiasm and excitement to really inspire the attendants, many of whom were high school and college students, to get more involved and to become a leader as she was,” he said.
Rose did not shy away from controversy, calling abortion a “genocide” and said that “Planned Parenthood is built on eugenics.”
Amanda Lanzillo (SFS ’13), secretary for H*yas for Choice, told The Hoya that Rose’s spirited rhetoric may encourage polarization on the issue, a negative result in her eyes.
“I think that the problem with the issue [of abortion] is that people use very strong language that prevents people from people talking honestly about it,” Lanzillo said. “I would like to see more dialogue about these issues but people tend to drag in this kind of rhetoric, to use words like ‘genocide,’ and it becomes very difficult to have a thoughtful debate. … We need to be careful not to use language like that.”
Still, attendees on the anti-abortion side of the fence found the conference thought-provoking and inspiring.
“The panel discussion was spectacular,” Bower wrote in an email. “It was nice having this outstanding panel which discussed someone who had such a profound effect on the pro-life movement in the morning and then later in the afternoon, Lila Rose, someone who is motivating future pro-life leaders. It was a nice balance.”
The conference was followed Monday afternoon by a March for Life on the National Mall.
“This is the fourth year I’ve been to the march and the crowds are always tremendous,” Raval said. “The people are prayerful, they’re respectful, and you can tell that they are there with a sense of focus.”
“The whole message of the conference and the march is to educate people and make them understand that they have the power,” Grand Knight of the Knights of Columbus Brendan Gottschall (COL ’12) said. “We want to encourage them to take action to get this done.”

But dissatisfaction with OCAF is not a recent development. In 2006, Amanda Gant (SFS ’07, GRD ’12) created a Facebook group entitled “I Hate OCAF,” mainly to protest the lack of transparency in the cost of renting event space. The group, which is now dormant, lists an extensive list of cost estimates that Gant intended for the benefit of other student groups on its homepage.
Gant, a member of Georgetown UNICEF and The Big Hunt as an undergraduate, dealt frequently with OCAF to reserve spaces for those groups.
“You had to work really hard to schmooze them and nothing you could do was good enough,” she said. “It was very much like you couldn’t find the information that you wanted.”
Gant felt that student groups had little conception of the real cost of holding an event and OCAF failed to be upfront about costs.
“If they had given us that kind of information we would have known and be able to budget for it or just choose something else,” Gant said.
Today, fee estimates are more readily available to student groups, though some still express concerns that fees are hard to pin down. Groups under CSP can obtain an OCAF Operation Manual, which walks leaders through the process and provides a list of fees. According to Shiu, other offices, such as CSJ, do not provide a similar document.
At the low end, a room like McShain Lounge can cost a minimum of $37 per hour on a weekend. Spaces such as Copley Formal Lounge go for closer to $50 per hour — with a four-hour minimum — not counting the rental fees for chairs, tables, projectors and other services. These high prices become difficult for some groups to afford.
“It’s these ridiculous, exorbitant fees that get tacked on,” O’Loughlin said. “They charged us $18 for one tablecloth.” According to Frank, OCAF determines its price list each year and distributes it to CSP.
The goal for many who must deal with OCAF extensively is merely to fix the problems they see in the office. That is easier said than done, with no formal complaint system readily available for OCAF customers.
“OCAF needs to improve its service to student groups and make itself more transparent in terms of assessing criticism and to create mechanisms where student groups can give more feedback on where OCAF can approve,” said Scott Stirett (SFS ’13), a former SAC commissioner.
McCoy said that he has heard the story of OCAF complaints before — but without hard facts, there is little that can be done moving forward.
“Unfortunately, anecdotal information doesn’t allow us in CSP the information and data to address any systemic issues,” McCoy said.
According to McCoy, CSP has instituted a formal complaint form on their website for student groups to report a variety of operating issues. So far, none of the complaints submitted have been directly related to OCAF.
After years of the same problems plaguing OCAF’s interactions with their customers, Gant feels that the problem is difficult to address because it is so ingrained.
“It’s a structural problem that OCAF [has] and also a morale problem. The students that work there … are put into a bad system,” Gant said.

Most seniors dread the nail-biting job interview process that comes with leaving the Hilltop, but two Georgetown grads are at least trying to make the ordeal a little less nerve-racking.
Launched by Chip Malt (COL ’10) and Sanjay Murti (COL ’10), Interviewspy is a new website that gives interviewees access to over 150 typical questions posed during job interviews. Viewers can search the website for questions and answers and add their own content to the site based on previous interview experience.
The collaborative effort began during Malt and Murti’s junior year, when Malt, a computer science major, was preparing for an interview with Google. After scouring blogs and websites for commonly asked questions, he and Murti began to realize that companies often recycle their interview inquiries.
Then, during an interview with a different company, Malt was asked the same question Google had asked him in a previous interview. Malt and Murti came to the conclusion that no matter what company, similarly challenging questions tend to be standard in the interviewing world.
Keeping a spreadsheet full of questions that they had collected, Malt and Murti sought an outlet for their information, one that would hopefully help students navigate the process in the future.
After graduation, Murti, also a computer science major, began interning with Google — and began coding the Interviewspy website, which converted Malt’s and his database of questions into an interactive site that allows users to search for companies, find past questions and upload content.
The website enables job hunters to filter through information about the company, position and interview round. Users can also search broader fields including consulting, finance, consumer goods, education and technology. The website is free and does not require registration, and all posts are anonymous.
At the current time, the website covers interviews from 29 companies and the Harvard Business School. Few users have offered answers, though the site is still in its fledgling days and may gain popularity as more students emerge from school in a competitive job market.
“It aggregates different information from around the web into one place,” Malt said. “The site is a huge time saver.”
Students said that they might well use the site when embarking on their next internship or job search.
“Well, I definitely think it would be useful,” Kera Wright said (MSB ’13). “It just eases your mind.”
Wright said she has mixed feelings on the ethics of the site, but worries that those who don’t look up questions beforehand are putting themselves at a disadvantage.
“They’re not going to take pity on you because you did the right thing,” she said.

A special report compiled by Georgetown faculty, graduate and undergraduate students released last week provided never-before-seen evidence about the murder of The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl by al-Qaida operatives in Pakistan in 2002 — including confirmation of the identity of his killer.
Dubbed the Pearl Project, the investigation began as a journalism class at Georgetown in September 2007 headed by Georgetown journalism Director Barbara Feinman Todd and Asra Nomani, a former colleague of Pearl’s. Run as a seminar over two semesters, the course consisted of 32 student-journalists. After the conclusion of the class, the Pearl Project moved to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists at the Center for Public Integrity. A small group of students continued to work on the investigation along with Feinman Todd and Nomani.
“Undergraduate students had just as much responsibility in the class as graduate students, and their beat assignments were equally challenging. Many undergrads went above and beyond completing an assignment and turned into serious investigative journalists,” Pearl Project Managing Editor Kira Zalan (GRD ’10) said in an email.
Undergraduates participated in a wide variety of project functions. Assigned multiple tasks, the students investigated websites hosting the video of Pearl’s murder, studied forensic techniques that could be performed on the video, investigated aspects of the Pakistani government, followed individuals or groups such as the video’s courier and the Pearl family and took photos and videos of the class, according to notes in the report.
Zalan cited the examples of Jessica Rettig (COL ’09), who knocked on the door of an unresponsive source while on break in Florida, and Mary Cirincione (SFS ’08), who obtained previously unreleased FBI documents about the bomber Pearl had been investigating when he was kidnapped. Students developed sources, conducted interviews, shared findings with the class through presentations and written assignments and often clocked long hours, making phone calls after midnight to reach sources in Pakistan, Caitlin McDevitt (COL ’08), a student in the course, said. McDevitt is now the deputy style and gossip editor at Politico.
Zalan was one of those who continued to work on the project. She spent a total of three and a half years reporting on Daniel Pearl.
“I would work entire nights and weekends, and it didn’t feel like work but more a mission, a passion or a hobby. Because of the project, I plan to turn investigative journalism into a career,” she said in an e-mail.
The project pioneered new journalism technology, including a wiki that allowed students to collaborate in a virtual electronic newsroom. Over three and a half years, the team was able to build a chronology of Pearl’s kidnapping and murder and the subsequent police investigation, using hundreds of interviews and thousands of documents. The project also filed a lawsuit against eight government agencies, including the CIA.
Pearl was kidnapped in January 2002 while conducting investigative work by a group of militants. Unsure what to do with their prisoner, the kidnappers contacted Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-described mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, who is currently being held at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Mohammed and two others arrived at a compound in Karachi where Pearl was being held. Mohammed then slashed Pearl’s throat, but an accomplice failed to operate the video camera they were using to document the scene, and Mohammed re-enacted the killing by decapitating Pearl.
In the video released by the killers, only the hand of Pearl’s killer is visible. The report states that U.S. officials used vascular technology, or vein matching, to demonstrate that the hand of the unseen man who killed Pearl on the video is Mohammed’s, but this information was not released to the public until the Pearl Project’s report.
Mohammed had confessed to the murder at a military hearing in 2007, but the United States has not charged him with the crime due to doubts about the validity of testimony obtained while Mohammed was in CIA custody, where he was waterboarded 183 times. In all, the report identified 27 men, including guards and drivers, who played a part in the kidnapping and murder, 14 of whom are currently at large in Pakistan.
“Pearl’s story is a sad and inspiring human story, but for young journalists, it’s particularly poignant,” McDevitt said in an email.

Georgetown University donated $5,000 to help cover the costs of recently elected D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray’s transition and inauguration events, one of several recent donations the university has made to the philanthropic endeavors of local politicians.
These donations represent a major increase in the amount of money Georgetown has contributed to members of the D.C. Council over the past several years.
The mayor’s fund was established to cover the costs — estimated to total over $800,000 — of Gray’s transition work and inauguration. While previous mayor Adrian Fenty also raised money for his inaugural ball, Gray is the first D.C. mayor to decline all city funds for his transition. Georgetown’s donation was specifically used for transition costs, Doxie McCoy, a spokesperson for the mayor, said.
“[Mayor Gray] thought that there were individuals, entities, universities and businesses that would be willing to donate to cover the costs, since we’re in a budget crisis,” McCoy said.
According to the latest figures, over 250 individuals and groups have donated almost $700,000 toward the fund. Howard University was one of the largest contributors, donating $25,000 to Gray’s inaugural events.
Georgetown has contributed to a number of funds run by members of the D.C. Council in recent years. Since 2007, Georgetown has donated $4,300 to the constituent funds of D.C. Council members — a sharp increase from the $800 donated between 1999 and 2006.
“We frequently contribute funds to a range [of] events and causes that are important to the District of Columbia and impact its citizens,” Rachel Pugh, director of media relations at Georgetown, said in an email.
Each of the 13 members of the D.C. Council has a constituent fund, which is used to support a variety of community activities.
Georgetown has allotted donations to the funds of four members — Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), Yvette Alexander (D-Ward 7) and David Catania (D-At large) — since 2007. The university also donated to the constituent fund of Mayor Gray while he was D.C. Council chairman in 2009.
The two most recent donations, both equaling the maximum allowed contribution of $500, were to Alexander and Evans. Both sit on the city’s Committee on Economic Development, and Evans also represents the Georgetown neighborhood.
Ben Young, chief of staff for Councilmember Catania, said that the funds are used to support the community.
“Anything that we do is for the benefit of constituents,” Young said.
Donations to Evans’ fund are used to underwrite charity events, support civic groups and provide emergency relief, Andrew Huff, a spokesperson for the councilmember, said.
The George Washington University has also previously contributed to the fund for Councilmember Evans, who also represents its neighborhood.
Pugh said that Georgetown also donates to support volunteering, mentoring and other events and causes that impact city residents. University officials did not provide total amounts that Georgetown spends on public service and political donations.

Funding for a contract between Georgetown Medical Center and the city of Washington, D.C., has been slashed by 10 percent in an effort to close the District’s $127 million budget gap.
The cuts to the Health Initiative Contract will impact a program that helps people with intellectual disabilities receive better health care, according to Marisa Brown, project director for the D.C. Health Resources Partnership at Georgetown.
“The cuts this year are somewhat minimal because … knowing that the city was having problems, we cut out some things already,” Brown said. “But the big question is what’s going to happen next.”
The Health Initiative Contract is a partnership between the city’s Department of Disabilities and services and the medical centers at Georgetown and The George Washington University. Both medical centers will lose 10 percent of funding. According to Brown, this is the first time the District has made cuts to an existing contract in her 25 years working at Georgetown.
“This has never happened before, so it’s a pretty big deal,” she said.
The cuts reflect the extent of the budget crisis that the city is facing. In addition to facing a $188 million deficit for 2011, the District’s projected budget deficit for 2012 is $600 million, as Mayor Vincent Gray announced Saturday.
In spite of this, the Fiscal Year 2011 Proposed Gap Closing Plan, which included the cuts to the Health Initiative Contract, does not include any tax increases.
The FY 2011 Plan passed the D.C. Council with 11 votes and only two dissenters on Dec. 7. It will come into effect after it is reviewed by Congress or in 30 days if it is not reviewed.

Even if erased in name this December, “don’t ask, don’t tell” and its legacy continue to limit overlap between Georgetown’s principal LGBTQ and Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps groups, according to members.
The GU Pride and the Hoya Battalion, the Army ROTC program at Georgetown, have traditionally had no relationship, according to GU Pride Publicity Chair Kevin Mercer (COL ’11). To join the ranks of LGBTQ organizations on campus would threaten students’ standings in ROTC, Mercer said.
Although GU Pride would openly welcome ROTC members, none have joined in the past, according to Mercer, who said intermingling of the two groups would take time as the U.S. Armed Forces adapts to the repeal of DADT.
“I doubt though, that we will see a sudden tidal wave of ROTC members joining, or even coming out, in part because … I still believe there is an institutional memory of homophobia, as well as sexism,” he said. “[This] will take a long time to be overcome and requires a significant cultural rather than policy change.”
The Hoya Battalion, which is under Army instruction, has issued a moratorium restricting its students from speaking to the press about the repeal of DADT, according to Freeman Condon (NHS ’14), a private cadet in the Georgetown University Army ROTC program.
The Battalion includes students from the ROTC programs at Georgetown University, American University, The George Washington University, Catholic University of America and The Institute for World Politics.
At other D.C. universities, relations between ROTC and LGBTQ groups have shifted.
Before the new year, American University’s premier LGBTQ clu,b Queers and Allies, openly opposed an Undergraduate Senate bill petitioning for ROTC access to university fitness facilities, decrying the group for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, according to a Queers and Allies press release. Since DADT’s repeal, the LGBTQ student group has withdrawn its opposition to the bill.
Students at American are now working to ease any tension between LGBTQ groups and ROTC programs at other universities. Brett Atansio, senator for the Class of 2013 at American, is reportedly working with GWU’s Student Association to change its ROTC policy in a similar fashion, according to The Eagle, American’s student newspaper.
Congress repealed the DADT policy on Dec. 18, 2010, after 17 years of the policy. The U.S. military’s DADT policy prohibited lesbian and gay service members from uncovering their sexual preferences and enabled officers to discharge those who they believed to be engaging in sexual relations with those of the same gender. The policy became federal law in 1993 under the Clinton administration.

Watch out for Facebook posts from the head honcho of the Hilltop himself in the next few weeks. In a further effort to facilitate communication with the university community, Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia joined Facebook last Wednesday, according to Associate Vice President for Communications Julie Bataille.
“In this space, you will learn more about the privilege I have of representing Georgetown in many different contexts, whether here on the Hilltop, in the city of Washington, D.C., or in various locations around the world,” reads a statement from DeGioia visible on the Welcome page of his profile.
Categorized as a “public figure” on Facebook, the page is labeled “Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia.” The page maintains a constant hodgepodge of Georgetown-related information, ranging from links to events involving the president or university, including Ignatius Seminars, to a recent women’s lacrosse game and The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which DeGioia will be attending this week. The site also provides contact information and a brief biography of DeGioia.
In a meeting with university press on Jan. 14, DeGioia said that the page would be an effort to increase transparency, a sentiment echoed by Bataille.
“President DeGioia understands that Facebook can be a powerful medium for him to share news, ideas and insights that may be of interest to the extended Georgetown community,” Bataille said.
At press time, 357 people were listed as “liking” the page.
With over 20,000 likes to the page, Georgetown University itself has had a Facebook page for a few years, as have many of the university’s divisions, organizations, schools and classes. Many other U.S. universities, including fellow D.C. schools American University and The George Washington University, also have Facebook pages, though neither has a separate page for the university president.
DeGioia is not alone in creating a page, however. A handful of other presidents, including Ohio University President Roderick J. McDavis and Florida State University President Eric Barron have also joined the social networking site.
Universities across the country have also been making a concerted effort to increase their exposure through other popular websites, including YouTube and Twitter. Georgetown currently maintains both a Twitter account and a YouTube channel.
Not every student will be liking DeGioia’s page immediately.
“I’m extremely stingy with things I want appearing in my newsfeed,” Austin Yoder (COL ’11) said.
Tory Pratt (SFS ’11) agreed but saw the merits of the page’s various tidbits about Georgetown.
“I don’t really use Facebook enough to like a lot of things,” Pratt said. “But I guess it would be more of an information source.”
Georgetown students might see updates on the president’s page in their newsfeed this weekend, as Bataille said that new posts would come — live from Switzerland.
