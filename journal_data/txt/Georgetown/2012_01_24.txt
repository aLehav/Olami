Fifty cartons of cigarettes were stolen from Vital Vittles at 3:37 p.m. Monday, according to the Department of Public Safety.
The incident was the fourth in a string of robberies at the on-campus convenience store this school year and the third involving cigarettes.
In a public safety alert emailed to the campus community Monday evening, DPS reported that a suspect forced his way into Vital Vittles’storage locker and stole the cigarettes.
Alexander Pon (COL ’12), the president and CEO of Students of Georgetown, Inc., was unsure of the value of the stolen goods.
The suspect is described in the PSA as a 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-8 Hispanic male with short black hair and a goatee. He was wearing a red shirt, black jacket, black jeans and black shoes.
Pon said that footage from Vital Vittles’ security cameras has been submitted to the Metropolitan Police Department for further review.
“From the security footage, it doesn’t appear to be a Georgetown student,” Pon said.
The first of the three burglaries was reported Sept. 4 and involved the theft of 90 cartons of cigarettes. Two other robberies occurred at the store in December; more than $200 in cash was stolen from an office Dec. 1, and over $1,500 in cigarettes was stolen Dec. 6.
No suspects have been arrested in connection with any of the thefts.
Pon theorized that the small size and relatively high value of cigarettes could have made them a target for robbers.
Prior to the December thefts, The Corp had taken new security measures at Vital Vittles, including the installation of security cameras.
“[Despite the robberies,] I am confident that employees are safe,” Pon said.
He added that additional security measures would be taken following this latest incident, although he declined to disclose specifics of these measures.

Voting opened yesterday on the referendum for the three proposals on how to spend the $3.4 million generated from the Student Activities Fee Endowment reform. In December 2010, the student body voted to gradually change the fee from $100 to $150 in the 2012-2013 academic year. The money raised from the increase was available for proposals drafted by students and then determined by the Georgetown University Student Association. The projects were selected by a student commission from a wide range of plans last spring and finalized in the fall by GUSA’s Finance and Appropriations Committee. The university administration signed an agreement letter with GUSA Monday that ensures that the plans will instituted in the appropriate manner. Read on for details of each of the proposals up for a vote.
Social Innovation and Public Service Fund:
$1.25 million has been allocated to SIPS, a proposal that would provide financial support to students and alumni interested in pursuing innovative service projects or nonprofits. The fund would begin by allocating a total of $100,000 a year to be invested in grants, sponsorships and organization partnerships, while fundraising to increase its independent endowment.
New South Student Center:
The project allocates $2.04 million to expand a new student space already slated to be built in the lower levels of New South Hall by August 2014. The university’s plans include a pub, living room and open study space. The additional SAFE money would be used to construct an outdoor terrace on the south side of the building and improve the renovation’s first level. Together, these funds will increase the original floor plans by 21 percent.
Georgetown Energy:
$250,000 has been allocated to the student organization, which plans to install solar panels on the roofs of about 43 university townhouses. This measure could save the university almost $400,000 in energy costs over the next 20 years. The savings would be placed in a Green Revolving Loan Fund that will fund sustainable energy projects around campus. Ideas include solar-thermal water heating and using more efficient showerheads and light bulbs.
Each proposal must be passed by a majority vote. At least 2,000 students must cast their ballot in the election for it to be considered valid.
Money from any referendum that is not passed will not be redistributed to another plan; instead, new initiatives will be submitted for consideration for the remaining funds.
Check the email from GUSA that links to the online ballot, or stop by the new polling stations in O’Donovan Hall to cast your vote by Jan. 26.

As it has grown over the past semester, The One World Youth Project, has continued to innovate as its volunteers increasingly innovate in the classroom.
The program, a nonprofit founded by Georgetown alumni Jess Rimington (SFS ’09), is housed in the Center for Social Justice. It is designed to foster a cross-cultural dialogue on global issues through online video calling, social media sites and courses designed to increase international awareness in secondary schools.
“To create a more just world, we will have to combat ignorance and instill in these children a sense of internationalism so that they can address the challenges in a way that is not provisional,” project ambassador Asjed Hussain (SFS ’15) said.
Since its founding in 2004, OWYP has connected U.S. secondary schools to classrooms in foreign countries to develop students’ understanding of the increasingly connected world.
Students interact across the globe using Yammer, a sort of private Facebook that allows media sharing, and Chafte, a phone recording service, according to Communications Director Anjali Daryanani (SFS ’11).
“We like to think of these techniques to link classrooms together as innovative and also equal-access,” she wrote in an email.
The students involved have also introduced their own ideas, using websites like Freerice.com, which donates 10 grains of rice through the World Food Programme for every quiz question that is answered correctly.
“We had to balance education and fun,” Hussain said. “For example, we would play games … [to] introduce the U.N. Millennium Development Goals. The students were right on the spot to talk about topics like illiteracy, poverty and hunger.”
According to project members, discussing these international issues is crucial for students from underprivileged neighborhoods, as they are unlikely to be exposed to these topics in their classrooms.
Georgetown students have been working with students in Hart Middle School in Southeast D.C. and the Columbia Heights Education Campus. The Georgetown volunteers teach in conjunction with students from the Kosovo’s University of Prishtina, who work at Elena Gjika Elementary School.
According to one of the seven Georgetown project ambassadors, Brian Potochney (SFS ’15), the ambassadors worked with experts who have taught in inner cities. Potochney, who has been leading weekly lessons in local schools since October, said that one of the greatest challenges was to keep the students engaged.
“You wanted them to have fun while also taking it seriously,” he said.
Another challenge has been the inconsistent Internet access at Hart Middle School.
“Sometimes the Internet cuts out in Hart Middle School, so it’s not a guarantee that the students will be able to connect with their partner classroom in real-time,” Daryanani wrote. “But when the university students are responsible for collecting their students voices in the forms of media, uploading, downloading and sharing with the partner classrooms, all students can benefit from the international experiences and meeting peers from the other side of the world independent of technology access.”
According to Hussain, project leaders also benefit from their participation.
“The service is horizontal. You give and receive at the same,” he said. “The kids teach us a great deal, too. Growing up in a totally different background makes you more aware of the privilege and responsibility in dissolving injustice, which is one of the core Jesuit values.”

The three proposals for spending the $3.4 million allocated by the Student Activities Fee Endowment reform each reached their 2,000 vote threshold on the first day of a three-day referendum.
Though all three proposals obtained the 2,000-vote minimum required to consider the election legitimate, each proposal must receive a majority of the total votes cast by Thursday in order to pass. Election commissioners have not yet released how many of the votes counted have been in favor of the proposals.
The vote minimum is a bylaw of the Georgetown University Student Association constitution, which requires at least one-fifth of students to vote on a referendum for it to pass. In Sunday’s GUSA executive meeting, senior counselor Sam Ungar (COL ’12) said that the vote minimum gives more legitimacy to student referendums.
The New South Student Center proposal, which adds $2.04 million to the student center renovation project, reached the threshold at approximately 5:45 pm. The $1.25 million Social Innovation and Public Service Fund proposal had obtained 2,000 votes by 6:30, and Georgetown Energy’s proposed $250,000 allocation to install solar panels on about 43 university townhouses had reached the vote minimum at 8 pm.
Election Commission Officer Adam Giansiracusa (SFS ’12) wrote in an email that the final results will be published on Friday.

Nikhil Lakhanpal (MSB ’13) was chosen as the next CEO of the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union on Jan. 15.
Lakhanpal has been a GUASFCU intern since the fall of 2009, when he was selected as a member of the term’s teller class. He later joined the member service and information technology departments, and he currently serves as vice president of information technology. He will effectively become CEO March 1.
“I’m excited to work with the six other board members, who are not only some of the smartest and coolest people I’ve ever met, but share a passion to make the credit union a better place,” he said. “They all understand that being on the board is not just about this upcoming year but about building on 29 years of hard work and dedication.”
Lakhanpal hopes to improve customer service by implementing a remote technology deposit system and smart phone application.
He is also determined to improve the intern experience.
“GUASFCU wouldn’t be possible without the hard work of its interns,” he said. “It’s our job as the Board of Directors to make sure we’re recruiting the best people on campus and to make sure that for the people we recruit, the credit union experience is worth remembering.”
Outgoing CEO Katie Cohen (COL ’12) believes that Lakhanpal will be a great asset to GUASFCU in the future.
“The nominating committee is very proud of the incoming Board of Directors and confident that the credit union is poised for continued success,” she wrote in an email.

The 1634 Society, a fledgling organization focused on bolstering undergraduate-alumni relations, has proved itself as an important resource to the university in its few months of existence.
The organization, which became an independent entity from the Senior Class Fund in summer 2011, attempts to function as a liaison for students with the Office of Advancement and encourages donations from alumni and current students after they graduate.
“I’m confident in saying, in the next three to four years, 1634 will be a [The] Corp or Credit Union on Georgetown’s campus. That is our goal and I am extremely confident that we can achieve that,” board member Bryan Satterly (SFS ’13) said.
The group now has 40 members, or trustees, and five board members. The organization is inspired by the vision of Jesuit priests Andrew White and John Gravenor, who arrived in Maryland in 1634 intending to build a university, and who were an integral influence on Georgetown’s founder, John Carroll. According to Satterly, the 1634 Society’s mission is to help foster a culture of philanthropy among undergraduate students that will continue after they leave Georgetown.
“We truly believe that Georgetown is and should be recognized as one of the top-tier institutions for learning, now and for generations to come, and I think that part of what’s holding us back is lack of tradition and lack of philanthropy,” he said.
Georgetown did not begin to seriously focus on developing its endowment until Leo O’Donovan served as university president in the 1990s.
While the 1634 Society began in 2010 as a part of the Senior Class Fund, a group dedicated to educating students about philanthropy, it became a separate entity last year. Satterly and board member John Kenchelian (COL ’12) were members of the Senior Class Fund when the 1634 Society became an independent organization.
“The Senior Class Fund has their eye on current results, while we have our eye on current results and future results,” Kenchelian said. “We want students to not only think about improving Georgetown as undergraduates, but [also] as alumni.”
The 1634 Society spent its first semester as an autonomous organization focused on leading the undergraduate component of the Campaign for Georgetown, which hopes to raise $1.5 billion dollars by 2016.
This spring, they plan to bring an alumnus to speak to students on campus each month. They will also launch a multimedia campaign to raise awareness about their organization and are currently accepting student trustee applications.
“We want to choose people to add to our group who want to emulate what Georgetown is about — the Jesuit values and [being] men and women for others. [We want] future leaders — people who really embody those values and will carry them throughout their lives and make sure that those values are there for others,” Ron Boehmer (COL ’12) said.
As a group devoted to alumni relations, the 1634 Society works closely with the Office of Advancement and Alumni Career Services to plan and execute student-alumni networking events. One of the organization’s primary responsibilities is the leadership of the student aspect of the ongoing Campaign for Georgetown. The organization also partnered with The Corp Service and Outreach Committee and the Office of Advancement to sponsor the inaugural Homecoming Humanitarian Award last semester.
Emily White, the assistant director of Alumni Career Services, stressed the importance of undergraduate-alumni relations and the role of the 1634 Society in their promotion.
“Our [alumni’s] appetite to connect with students is extremely strong. The Georgetown network literally spans the globe with alumni who are ready, willing and able to share their expertise and experiences,” she wrote in an email. “Our hope is that every student is able to take advantage of this strong network and have a meaningful connection with an alumnus during their time on the Hilltop.”

This year’s prospective freshman class set a record with 20,050 applications to the university’s class of 2016.
But they also set a record in diversity, as the numbers of African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic and international students applying to the university continued to rise, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon.
From last year, applications from African-Americans and Asian-Americans each jumped 1.05 percent from 1,773 to 1,858 and from 2,786 to 2,934, respectively. Meanwhile, the number of applications from Hispanic students increased 1.1 percent from 2,067 to 2,266 and the number of international applications rose 1.05 percent from 2,255 to 2,344.
According to Deacon, the trends in the number of undergraduate applications to Georgetown this year closely reflect an increase in ethnic diversity in the United States.
Deacon also pointed to a shift in the regions from which students applied.
The decline in the number of applications from states like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, which have traditionally sent high numbers of students to Georgetown, matched the decline in these states’ applicant populations.
According to Deacon, the growth of the overall applicant pool can be attributed to increased interest from prospective students in the growing Southern and Western regions of the country.
Florida, California and Georgia saw the biggest jumps, with the states seeing an increase of 82, 73 and 69 applications, respectively, from last year.  California remained the largest source of applications among the 50 states, as it has been for about five years.
While Deacon lauded the increased diversity of applications as beneficial to Georgetown, he added that the increased ethnic and geographical diversity of applications will create more strain on Georgetown’s commitment to provide financial aid to students in need. According to Deacon, this shift represents a tilt toward a less wealthy demographic.
“The looming issue behind all of these numbers is the impact on financial aid. We have a more diverse and larger population that puts even more pressure on raising money for scholarships,” he said. “We would love to be able to see the tilt continue, but we need to be able to afford it.”
Deacon attributed this growth of interest in states farther from the Eastern seaboard to the university’s countrywide recruitment efforts and the continued appeal of studying in the District of Columbia.
“We think we get that [increase] because we do joint recruiting with elite universities all over the country … so we hit all 50 states. We get a general audience rather than very targeted audiences,” Deacon said. “And the farther away you are [from your target audience], the more you depend on your name, which suggests that Georgetown has greater name recognition across the country.”
Deacon said that the spike in interest from states outside the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the country will help insulate Georgetown from declining application rates in those areas.
“If we hadn’t seen growth outside the Northeast, we would be seeing declining applications,” he said. “Georgetown has a national appeal, fortunately. If we were primarily Northeastern, which a lot of colleges are, we would be facing some worrying times.”
Deacon said that only 31 percent of the applicant pool was from the Mid-Atlantic region this year, adding that it is very unusual for universities to derive such a small proportion of their applicants from their immediate region.
“That’s good news for us in that less than a third of our own pool comes from where there’s decline,” he said.
Deacon added that while it is too early to tell whether the demographic breakdown of applicants will ultimately be reflected in the distribution of the Class of 2016, he said it was likely.
“There are no preordained quotas and we’ll have to see how it shakes out, but I would guess that more will be accepted from [faraway] states than in past years,” Deacon said.
Deacon characterized this year’s trends as a surprisingly dramatic reflection of demographic trends sweeping the country. He said that the stagnation in the number of white applicants and the sizable growth in minority applicants, as well as the decrease in Northeastern applicants and growth in Western and Southern applicants are in line with real population changes in the United States.
“This is a more dramatic-looking [shift] than we thought it would be. We could predict the drops and rises, but these are actually really visible. … When you think about the pool rising significantly in Alabama … we would not necessarily have predicted that level of a rise,” he said. “We’re pleased to see that kind of change.”

Pro-life activists from across the country gathered on campus this weekend for the the 13th annual Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life, the largest student-run conference of its kind.
Kevin Sullivan (SFS ’14) and Katie Schmitz (COL ’13) co-directed the event, which attracted about 650 attendants this year.
The conference, sponsored by Georgetown University Right to Life, Catholic Daughters of America, the Knights of Columbus and University Faculty for Life, is held the weekend before the national March for Life, which marks the anniversary of Roe v. Wade.
Although the conference’s aim is to promote pro-life advocacy, Sullivan emphasized the educational component of the weekend’s events.
“The goal of the conference, in the message of Cardinal O’Connor, is discussion,” he said. “Our conference, while we do attract a lot of activists, is more about educating and discussion.”
The conference featured a Mass for Life Saturday afternoon by Bishop William Lori in DahlgrenChapel and a Fiesta for Life to benefit the Northwest Pregnancy Center in D.C. later that day.
Schmitz stressed that this year’s conference was intended to expand the traditional view of pro-life efforts.
“While the unborn is a very central idea to the pro-life movement, it is not the only aspect of the movement,” she said. “We value life from conception until natural death; that includes genocide and human trafficking and respecting and defending the lives of people who are subject to those sort of things.”
During Sunday’s keynote address, students from Fordham University to the University of Notre Dame Australia helped fill Gaston Hall.
Keynote speaker Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia highlighted the necessity of tolerance toward people with disabilities and the importance of valuing all life.
“The real choice in accepting or rejecting a child with special needs is never between some imaginary perfection or imperfection,” he said. “The real choice is between love and unlove, between courage and cowardice, between trust and fear.”
Chaput also called on Catholics to take political action and vote pro-choice politicians out of office.
“Catholic citizens who take God seriously cannot claim to love their church and then ignore her council on vital public issues that shape our nation’s life,” he said.
Chris Cannataro (MSB ’15), who attended the conference, praised the archbishop’s adherence to Catholic beliefs.
“Archbishop Chaput gave a phenomenal speech,” he said. “He talked about the intrinsic value of life and embodied the values of St. Ignatius of Loyola of setting the world on fire.”
This year’s conference differed from years past in its focus on the political aspect of the abortion debate. For the first time, directors were able to coordinate a congressional panel, featuring Reps. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), Jean Schmidt (R-Ohio), and Ann Marie Buerkle (R-N.Y.).
“[What we’re doing this year is] trying to gear [the conference] more towards Georgetown students who are political creatures,” Sullivan said.
The congressional panelists talked about their own commitment to pro-life legislation and the strides made toward advancing their ideals.
At the conclusion of Sunday’s events, the Students for Life at the University of Michigan were presented with the Fr. Thomas King, S.J., Award, which included a $1,000 prize. The award, which recognizes pro-life strides made by undergraduate student groups, is named after the former Georgetown professor who co-founded University Faculty for Life in 1989.
GU Right to Life president Joseph Cardone (COL ‘14) estimated that 30 Georgetown students attended the March for

A new organization created by a group of upperclassmen in the McDonough School of Business is aiming to pave the way for a growing international student presence in the MSB.
The McDonough Global Student Association, headed by President Alicia Parodi (MSB ’12) and Vice President Quintin Eusebio (MSB ’13), was founded in October 2011 and currently boasts more than 60 active members. The group held its first event in November, when more than 90 students gathered to receive advice from international banking recruiters and MSB deans.
“I think Georgetown is one of the most international universities in the world and we didn’t have an organization that was for international, undergraduate MSB students,” Parodi said. “Our mission is to provide a platform for development, especially in professional and academic aspects, for international students in the MSB.”
The MGSA intends to aid international students in navigating the difficult bureaucratic processes that can hinder their attempts to secure student visas, on-campus jobs and summer internships. Members are in the process of composing a set of manuals and handbooks that explain these issues.
Another adjustment challenge specific to international students is the dramatic change in teaching styles between their home countries and the United States. According to Parodi, American universities emphasize participation in classroom discussions while international teaching norms tend to focus on direct lectures from teachers who might be offended by a student challenging them.
Parodi, a native of Peru, felt challenged by this new educational style during her first year in college.
“I was terrified when I found out that 20 percent of my grade was based on participation, when back in my country you do not discuss or debate in class.”
To combat this, the MGSA will try to communicate the differences between these educational experiences to incoming freshmen.
“We aim to help them with that learning curve, to make their experience more fulfilling,” Eusebio said.
As the young organization continues to build, the executive leadership seeks to grow in many directions.
“I think one of our biggest challenges is to keep up our momentum. At Georgetown, it’s so easy to get lost in the swarm of events held every week,” Eusebio said. “We want to build up our base and make our organization something that people can integrate with their lives. We realize that each and every one of our members has a story to tell and comes from a unique background.”

Now in its second semester, Georgetown University Television political talk show “Full Court Press” returns to the air with an aim to provide a distinct political voice for the university community.
Coerte Voorhees (COL ’12), the mind behind the idea for “Full Court Press,” identified himself as the show’s liberal force, while co-host James Pickens (COL ’12) tends to favor a more conservative view.
Together, they hope that this semester they will be able to recapture the original spirit of the show as well as forge a new path for its future.
Voorhees was inspired to create the program while working at GUTV his junior year.
“I asked myself, ‘At a school like Georgetown, in one of the most politically-charged cities in the world, why on earth did we not have our own political talk show?'”
Relying upon his background in film production and his long-time interest in politics, Voorhees decided to create a show that explored American political life through interviews with politicians and debates between Georgetown students.
“It really is a Georgetown show. It showcases the incredible opportunity we have by living here — to have a discourse,” he said.
The program has played host to personalities such as Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) and Rep. Jared Polis(D-Colo.). Future episodes will feature former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, who is currently running for the U.S. Senate.
“I just walked up to Gov. Kaine on the street and asked him if he would want to be on our show, and he was very interested,” Voorhees said.
However, Voorhees and Pickens insist that the undergraduates are the stars of the program. They are looking to bring that student spirit back this semester.
“Some of the students who come on the show are smarter and sharper than a lot of the people I see on MSNBC and CNN. It says a lot about our student body as a whole,” Voorhees said.
Pickens reinforced the importance of students sharing their opinions on public matters.
“No matter what your political stripes are, these issues are so important to our future. We all should get involved. If we have learned anything from the Internet revolution ,it’s that everyone has the opportunity to voice their opinions,” he said. “We really have a tradition of dialogue here at Georgetown, and one of our main goals with the show is to showcase that Georgetown identity.”

A reduced salary cap for university researchers who receive National Institute of Health grants is expected to dramatically affect research programs at universities nationwide, though it will likely have little impact on the Georgetown University Medical Center’s budget.
The salary cap was reduced by $20,000 as part of the new federal budget for fiscal year 2012. As a result of the legislation, universities nationwide must bear the burden of maintaining salaries.
Few scientists at Georgetown will be affected, according to GUMC’s Dean for Research and Interim Director of Biomedical Graduate Research Robert Clarke.
“The overall impact of the NIH salary cap reduction will be modest since we have a relatively small proportion of researchers who have salaries at or above the cap,” he wrote in an email.
But the funding cuts could have far more negative consequences for Georgetown’s neighbors. According to a Jan. 17 article in The GW Hatchet, The George Washington University will likely lose thousands of dollars for researcher salaries.
“I realized it would have an impact the moment I heard about it,” Anthony-Samuel LaMantia, the director of the GW Institute for Neuroscience, told The Hatchet.
At Georgetown, about 80 percent of the $153.7 million in research grants that the university receives comes from the federal government.
Clarke noted that of the Medical Center’s typical yearly budget, 56 percent comes from the NIH while the remaining 44 percent is from other government agencies, foundations and businesses.
Although the federal budget was signed on Dec. 23, Clarke said that it would not be possible to gaugethe precise economic consequences of the cap until the NIH issues further details on the policy. Depending on the NIH’s rules for the cap’s implementation, both new and old research grants could be affected.
Executive Vice President and Dean of the Medical Center Howard Federoff agreed that the ramifications of the cap would not have too severe an effect on research at Georgetown.
“We will manage the additional burden and do not believe it will impact investigators such that they would depart GU,” he wrote in an email.

The Department of Public Safety uncovered a substance containing methamphetamine in an LXR dorm room early Thursday morning.
According to a report in the DPS crime blotter, officers noticed a smell similar to that of marijuana while speaking with two students on the rooftop of LXR Hall. One of the students told DPS that he had smoked marijuana earlier while off campus and consented to allow DPS to search his room.
While the officers were searching the room, the student opened a drawer and gave them a plastic bag containing an unknown substance. DPS also discovered drug paraphernalia and a milky white substance.
The Metropolitan Police Department was called to the scene to field test the substance and concluded that it contained methamphetamine.
It is unclear whether the substance was being used as an ingredient in the production of drugs. The case was turned over to the Office of Student Conduct and MPD is handling the ongoing investigation.
It is not clear whether any arrests were made following the incident Thursday morning.
“Since issues of individual student behavior are handled confidentially we cannot provide any more information at this time,” DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith wrote in an email. “The use and distribution of illegal drugs are issues we take very seriously and are violations of the Student Code of Conduct.”
Possession of counterfeit or controlled substances, including marijuana and methamphetamine, is considered a Category B violation in the university’s Code of Student Conduct and is punishable with a variety of sanctions, ranging from housing relocation to disciplinary probation or suspension.
If the investigation concludes that the substance was being used to manufacture drugs, the violation would be considered a Category C and could result in suspension or dismissal from the university.

Professor Patrick Deneen, the director of the Tocqueville Forum on the Roots of American Democracy, will resign from Georgetown at the end of the semester after seven years at the university.
Deneen will leave his post as the Tsakopoulos-KounalakisChair in Hellenic Studies in the government department for a similar position in the University of Notre Dame’s department of political science, leaving the future of the Tocqueville Forum uncertain.
While Deneen said that he has greatly enjoyed teaching at Georgetown, he hopes to play a more integral role at Notre Dame.
“I go from [a university] where I find myself often at the periphery … to one [at] which I have been recruited explicitly as [a professor] who can be a significant contributor to the life and mission of the institution,” he said.
Deneen, the founding director of the Tocqueville Forum, which intends to preserve America’s roots in Western philosophical tradition, cited poor reception of the center by the faculty and administration as one of his reasons for leaving.
“[Over] the years, it has been increasingly evident to me that I have exceedingly few allies and friends elsewhere on the faculty to join me in this work and dim prospects that the trajectory of faculty hiring will change,” he wrote in an email to select students Sunday night. “I have felt isolated from the heart of the institution where I have devoted so many of my hours and my passion.”
He added that he will have the chance to further the Catholic identity of Notre Dame, an opportunity that he believes was not available to him at Georgetown.
“I have decided that I would like to be welcomed as a contributor to the widely-embraced institutional mission of the university where I intend always to devote so much of my time, energy and passion, rather than someone who is largely regarded as an outlier,” he wrote in the email.
Kieran Raval (COL ’13), a student fellow in the Toqueville Forum, said Deneen was approachable to students and brought the study of America’s Western heritage alive.
“He’s a great teacher, and I’ve never actually had him in class,” he said. “I think he’s a great … beacon of the liberal arts tradition at Georgetown and … of classical learning.”
In his email, Deneen wrote that he is concerned that it will be difficult to find a replacement to serve as director of the Tocqueville Forum.
Helen Decelles-Zwerneman (COL ’14), another student fellow in the forum and one of Deneen’sprevious students, said she too is worried about the program without his leadership. The forum was one of the primary reasons Decelles-Zwerneman decided to attend Georgetown.
“As the director of the Tocqueville Forum, I’m not sure he’s really replaceable,” she said. “I hope that the forum can continue without him, but I can’t see how it [will continue] to be as great as a group and … resource.”
There is not a position similar to that which he had in the Tocqueville Forum waiting for Deneen at Notre Dame, but he has not excluded the possibility that he will assume such a role there some day.
“It’s explicitly because of the kinds of courses I teach and the focus of my writing that I was recruited,” he said.
