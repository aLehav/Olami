Emergency repairs on the water and natural gas lines between the Leavey Center and the Lombardi Cancer Center will continue throughout the week and restrict vehicle traffic in the area until they are complete.
A leak in the water line was found at the end of last week, which eroded support for the natural gas line, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr. The gas line was replaced over the weekend, but another leak was found when testing the newly installed sections. That leak in the natural gas line is being addressed by the most recent repairs.
The natural gas supply to several Georgetown University Medical Center buildings, the Lombardi Cancer Center and the Leavey Center will be cut off as well. The Kentucky Fried Chicken in Hoya Court, Faculty Club and Cosi in the Leavey Center are temporarily close, according to email from Vice President of University Safety Rocco DelMonaco Monday.
The area between the Leavey Center and the Lombardi Cancer Center remains open to pedestrians and patients that are visiting Lombardi.
In addition, the Leavey Center and Hariri Building’s parking lots will not be affected. However, there may be limited access to Lot G, located behind the GUMC’s Research Building, throughout the morning.

The Office of University Safety successfully conducted its biannual test of the HOYAlert and Campus Alert systems on Wednesday afternoon.
The tests are aimed at familiarizing the university community with the alert system and ensuring that the components of the system are operative, according to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh.
At around 12:55 p.m., university staff activated the Campus Alert System. Loud steam whistle-like noises sounded throughout the Georgetown University campus. Students, faculty, and staff signed up with the HOYAlert system also received text messages and phone calls informing them of the test.
University officials indicated that the testing went according to plan.
“Today we were able to confirm that the HOYAlert and the Campus Alert System, a network of steam whistles located throughout campus that is activated when there is a need to shelter-in-place, are working,” Pugh wrote in an email.
Over 16,000 students, faculty, and staff are enrolled in the system.
In the event of a real campus emergency or disruption, HOYAlert would be used to inform students of a situation and give important safety instructions to them.
“These tests are one of many steps the university takes to engage our community in preparing for possible emergencies and to become familiar with the various notification systems,” Pugh wrote.
The system was last used to inform students of a gas leak in Maguire Hall in September.
The next test of the system will occur at the beginning of the fall semester.

Each semester, University President John J. DeGioia sets an hour aside to talk to representatives of the campus media. The highlights from today’s meeting include planned expansions to the university’s campus, how Georgetown is pursuing international engagement, howDeGioia hopes to the see the campus plan debate resolved and the future of the capital campaign. Read on to get a peek inside the several initiative’s on the president’s plate.
Downtown DC: The New Frontier
DeGioia announced that the university is working with a real estate agent to find more space for the School of Continuing Studies in D.C.
“Our code name is Georgetown Downtown,” he said.
The decision to expand was prompted by increasing demand for continuing studies and executive education programs.
“We’re looking for [space] in Downtown Washington, particularly for adult learners,” DeGioia said.
The university hopes to find an additional location near a Metro stop, according to DeGioia. This new area would complement the SCS’s satellite campus, home to the Center for Continuing and Professional Education and the Master’s Degree Programs in Technology Management and Journalism, Public Relations and Corporate Communications in Clarendon, Va. Moving more graduate student off of Georgetown’s main campus was one of the concessions made by the university in the debate with neighbors over the 2010 Campus Plan.
The university also plans to build the Intercollegiate Athletic Center adjacent to McDonough Gymnasium. The gymnasium was built when Georgetown was home to 3,000 men and eight sports, according to DeGioia. Today, the university has a population of 7,000 undergraduate students and has 29 athletic teams.
“McDonough just can’t hold intercollegiate athletics anymore, and we need some expansion,” DeGioiasaid.
A revised version of the original plans for the renovations is being submitted to the Old Georgetown Board for review. Earlier plans for the 125,000-square-foot athletic complex were given to the board, part of the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts, in October. The board, however, disliked aspects of the building, including its height, the proposed entrance and the planned glass wall and asked the university to make revisions.
The project will cost between $50 and 60 million, an amount which the university hopes to raise in full as a new focus for the ongoing capital campaign. DeGioia is hopeful about the initiative because the full costs of the Davis Performing Arts Center and the Hariri Building were fundraised.
“We’ve set a good precedent,” he said.
Around the Globe
The university is currently investigating become more involved in higher education in India. DeGioiaand his administration are exploring ways that Georgetown can engage and foster more higher education in partnerships with India’s 18 Jesuit colleges and 150 high schools. According to DeGioia, these schools are among the best in the nation.
“Part of the challenge for India is that they simply don’t have enough higher education infrastructure,” he said.
DeGioia hopes that both of the university’s global campuses can collaborate with institutions in India and create more opportunities for Indian teachers and students to better meet the overwhelming existing demand for college education and double the number of college attendants.
“We’re seeing a strong potential collaboration between our campus in Doha and opportunities in India,” he said.
DeGioia also remarked that the university is planning on undertaking initiatives in Brazil this year. Georgetown has been fostering a relationship with the country since the Council on Competitiveness: U.S.-Brazil Innovation Learning Laboratory was held on campus in 2008.
Capital Campaign Hits The Road
The public launch of the current capital campaign, “For Generations to Come: The Campaign for Georgetown,” and philanthropy throughout last semester propelled the university past the half-way mark of the initiative’s fundraising goal of $1.5 billion, according to DeGioia.
“We had an exceptional first six months of the year,” he said, further stating that he believed it was one of the university’s best fiscal periods to date.
The priority for the money continues to be funding scholarships, particularly through the 1789 Scholarship Imperative, an initiative to make Georgetown’s financial aid packages more competitive by offering 1,789 scholarships of $25,000 each year that are raised primarily by philanthropy.
The next step for the campaign is to hold smaller regional launches in eight to 10 cities internationally. Visiting the cities – which include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami and London – will take about four and a half years, according to DeGioia, who plans to visit each of them himself.
DeGioia visited these same cities earlier in his time as university president to announce and fundraise for the 1789 Scholarship Imperative.
“That’s … a way of bringing everyone together in a really imperative way,” he said. “I know these cities and they know me.”
Controversy Despite Concessions
The university will be submitting its final filing regarding the 2010 Campus Plan to the D.C. Zoning Commission this Friday. A ruling on the revised plan from the commission will be given on Feb. 9 and accompanied by a written report in mid-April.
DeGioia hopes to avoid a lawsuit, which was required to resolve the controversy over the 2000 Campus Plan, and expects to the commission to be responsive to the concessions that the university has made.
“We have worked [as] collaboratively and responsibly as we possibly could,” he said. “We believe that the proposals we have made are … very responsible, very responsive.”

The Masters in Foreign Service program was recently ranked the best masters program for students interested in international relations for the third year in a row.
The School of Foreign Service beat out several prestigious programs for the number one ranking, including those at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Princeton, which took second, third and fourth place respectively.
The annual rankings were released by researchers with the Teaching, Research, and International Policy project in their January survey of international relations scholars.
The TRIP project is based at The College of William and Mary and interviewed faculty members from every four-year university and college in the United States for the survey. The results included responses from 1,582 faculty members about their views on international issues.
When asked, “What are the five best masters programs in the world for a student who wants to pursue a policy career in international relations?” 69 percent of respondents listed Georgetown in their top 5.
This is the fourth survey the group has conducted and the third time the MSFS program has received the top ranking, according to Director of the Masters of Science in Foreign Service Anthony ClarkArend (SFS ‘80),
“All of us that work with the Masters Programs in International Relations at Georgetown are honored and humbled to receive this number one ranking for the third time in a row,” Arend wrote in an email.
Additionally, 28 percent of survey respondents said that Georgetown’s was among the top five programs for undergraduate students wishing to study international relations, putting it in fifth place, behind Harvard, Princeton, Stanford and Columbia.
Carol Lancaster, dean of the SFS, was also pleased with the rankings.
“This is a credit to all faculty of the university who teach students in these programs,” she wrote in an e-mail.
