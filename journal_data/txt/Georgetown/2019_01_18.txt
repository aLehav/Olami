Multiple Georgetown students have been approached by individuals on campus about the ideological concept of “God the Mother,” asking them for their contact information to join a Bible study. 
A female incarnation of God, “God the Mother,” is believed to have co-created the Earth with “God the Father,” a belief associated with the fringe sect of Christianity known as the World Mission Society Church of God. WMSCOG has faced allegations of mistreatment from former members.
WMSCOG has recruited members on college campuses throughout the country, including Oberlin College, Vanderbilt University, Boston College, the University of Mississippi and Boston University, according to The Daily Beast. Reports of students encountering individuals using similar recruitment techniques as Georgetown students have experienced began in January 2018. At Boston College, multiple students were approached in early 2018 by individuals who asked if they had heard of “God the Mother” and invited them to a Bible study. WMSCOG confirmed they approached these BC students. 
Two individuals approached Haley Talati (COL ’20) inside the Healey Family Student Center in November 2018. Talati said the women stopped her, read Bible verses to her and spoke to her about the concept of “God the Mother.”
“I wouldn’t say they were trying to convince me of anything necessarily, but I did get the impression that their interest did go beyond the academic and was more personal and religious-oriented,” Talati said.
The interaction seemed harmless at the time, according to Talati, despite the allegations of mistreatment against the WMSCOG.
“I was more inclined to think more generously toward it just because they’re taking a different approach to gendered God instead of male imagery, which I think is generally a good thing,” Talati said. “But looking back, it seems probably — and just from other things I’ve read since then — less benign than maybe the impression I got initially from that meeting.”
Former members of a WMSCOG church in New Jersey called the group a cult and claimed the church frightened individuals into joining and donating money, according to a local media outlet.
Campus ministry instructed the individuals approaching students on Georgetown’s campus to address students more respectfully after students reported feeling uncomfortable following interactions with members, according to Bryant Oskvig, Director of Protestant Ministry. 
“I haven’t had any direct interaction with them. One of my colleagues has and indicated to them what our expectations are and how they are to communicate,” Oskvig said in an interview with The Hoya. “We made it clear that they just couldn’t corner students in the way that they were, at least has been reported to us.”
WMSCOG’s recruitment methods resemble those of the International Church of Christ, a cult that Georgetown announced in 2012 was banned from campus for violating university guidelines, according to Professor Lauve Steenhuisen, a visiting assistant professor in theology and women’s studies. Georgetown requires all religious groups that operate on campus to become affiliated with the university before they can approach students on campus.
Steenhuisen currently teaches a course titled “U.S. Cults: Religious Extremism and the Search for Meaning” at Georgetown. WMSCOG has been on campus for at least a year, according to Steenhuisen. 
“I taught my cult class a year ago this semester,” Steenhuisen said. “The World Mission Society has been around on campus at least since then.” 
Georgetown University Police Department received one official report regarding the individuals proselytizing “God the Mother” in December, according to GUPD Chief Jay Gruber. Despite several student accounts to The Hoya, GUPD has yet to send out an alert to campus. 
GUPD’s records management system, which requires keyword searches, makes it difficult for  officers to compile a comprehensive list of incidents of religious groups trying to recruit students, Gruber said.
“We have had a number of groups that have come onto campus over time doing similar types of things,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The group’s activities do not currently pose a threat to individuals on campus, according to Gruber.
“We don’t plan on sending an alert to our community about this,” Gruber said. “This activity, although unwanted, does not pose a danger to the community.”
Religious groups regularly visit campus during the semester, whether they are working with campus ministry or not, according to Oskvig.
“While this group has made, now, multiple appearances on campus, this isn’t the only group that we’ve had that sort of shows up,” Oskvig said.
The religious fringe group hung flyers across campus, including in Red Square and the Leavey Center, according to Nelise Jeffrey, office coordinator for the theology department. The flyers were bright yellow and featured clip art, phrases in both English and Korean, and an invitation to a Bible study, according to Jeffrey.
Encounters with individuals proselytizing the religious fringe “God the Mother” concept have not been limited to Georgetown’s campus. Maddie Chu, a freshman at American University, was also approached on her school’s campus Nov. 29 by a young man and woman who asked her if she had heard about the concept of “God the Mother.”
Students who wish to report interactions with religious groups on campus (both Georgetown- and non-Georgetown-affiliated) are encouraged to contact the Office of Campus Ministry by email at [email protected]. If students feel at all unsafe in these interactions, they are encouraged to immediately contact GUPD by phone (202-687-4343) or through the LiveSafe app.

I’m troubled by this article and its implications.
We often hear during our time on the hilltop about the importance of the Catholic and Jesuit traditions for the university. The physical trappings of these traditions, such as the Bioethics Institute, Wolfington Hall, and the omnipresent crosses, provide students with the opportunity to reflect on Georgetown’s fascinating and unusual history as a fundamentally faith-based institution that, since its founding, has sought to welcome, educate, and inspire folks other unaffiliated with either the Roman Catholic Church or the Society of Jesus. Our university was founded by a priest central to American ecumenism. For two hundred years the Hilltop has (at least tried) to honor that heritage of loving our neighbors. Let’s not drop the ball now. 
I think it is a fair assumption that the primary concern in this article relates to the theology of this organization. “God the Mother” is used nine times in the article. That is fine — I believe a critical function of Georgetown’s community of diverse faith traditions is that it gives us a chance to critically reflect on our personally-held precepts by debating theology with others (I’ll never forget when I was stuck in the back of a university van for five hours listening to a rigorous and unceasing debate on transubstantiation). However, the article seems to come from a public safety perspective, claiming that these missionaries are a cause for concern and not an opportunity for new voices of faith to join the campus-wide conversation. Notably, no members of this WMSCOG are quoted or referenced in the article. This is particularly problematic because this group appears to be tiny, and lacks the biopower to assert its beliefs as a faith tradition, and not a “cult” “encroaching” on campus. 
In fairness, the authors have accused the missionaries of “cornering” students and pressuring them to a sign a listserv. That is not a theological concern. However, if that behavior provides sufficient grounds to produce hang-wringing articles about encroaching cults, I have some terrible news for GUASFCU, those guys who sell donuts, Blue and Grey, and every GUSA campaign staffer who will inevitably chase me around Red Square at least once in the next month or so.

I have to reply to this. The primary concern regarding this group is not theology, rather the combination of theology and the methods of indoctrination (extreme social influence).  I don’t have time to explain but would be happy to talk if you like. This is a very dangerous group that has ruined lives and destroyed relationships.

The Georgetown University Student Association senate began initial deliberations Tuesday on a referendum that would allow Georgetown students to vote on whether to establish a reconciliation contribution, a fee to collect money for a charitable fund to benefit descendants of the 272 slaves who were sold by the Maryland Society of Jesus in 1838, commonly known as the GU272.
The GUSA senate ways and means committee met Tuesday night to discuss the referendum, which would establish a financial contribution for descendants of the GU272, after GUSA senator Sam Appel (COL ’20) introduced a bill titled the “Act of Referendum to Establish a New GU272 Legacy and Create the Reconciliation Contribution.”
The bill proposed the reconciliation contribution appear as a semesterly fee as part of tuition. However, senators and members of the GU272 Advocacy Team, a group of students who advocate on campus for descendants, have yet to finalize the exact details of the possible fund, according to GU272 Advocacy Team member Hannah Michael (SFS ’21). 
Several descendant groups have called for reparations in different forms, such as financial reparations, including the GU272 Isaac Hawkins Legacy Group, the GU272 Descendants Association and the Legacy of the GU272 Alliance.
The reconciliation contribution bill was inspired by the history of the student activities fee that is included in the cost of attendance, created by Georgetown students in 1999, according to Appel. The committee voted Tuesday to make the reconciliation contribution as a stand-alone fee, instead of tying it to the student activities fee as it was originally proposed. 
Senators present expressed their support for the referendum and agreed the topic deserved further deliberation. In the days since, committee members and team members have continued discussing further details on the semesterly fee and the establishment structures that would determine allocation of the reparations.
Moving forward, discussions need to focus on the opinions and experiences of the descendants of the GU272, Michael said.
“The wrong that was done in the 1838 sale can’t be amended without making sure that that’s the center of any work that we do,” Michael said in an interview with The Hoya.
The GU272 Advocacy Team met Thursday night to continue discussions on the referendum, but Appel and Michael declined to comment on what details they anticipated further deliberations would address.
Mélisande Short-Colomb (COL ’21), a descendant of the GU272 who was present at the Tuesday meeting, said the referendum is an opportunity for redress. 
“We are here tonight because current Georgetown University students have the opportunity to address and provide funding in a way that has not that has not been done in any other university in the United States or in the world,” Short-Colomb said at the meeting. “It is a student demonstration that students are willing to make a statement.”
Talks around the referendum will resume next week as senators discuss guidelines for the reconciliation contribution, as well as the creation of a specific structure for the GU272 Reconciliation Board of Trustees, which would oversee how the funds benefitted GU272 descendants.
The senate talks are part of a wider discussion of university efforts to address Georgetown’s historical dependence on slavery. In 2015, the university created the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation to address this history and the GU272 specifically. The Working Group’s 2016 report outlined recommendations for how the university should proceed, including the recommendation of financial aid for the descendant community.
Though the university has apologized for its role in the sale of the 272 slaves to plantations in Louisiana and named buildings on campus after Isaac Hawkins and Anne Marie Becraft, the first name listed on the 1838 bill of sale and the founder of one of the first schools for black girls in Georgetown respectively, Georgetown has not created financial aid initiatives for descendants, despite their requests for such aid.
Georgetown history professor Adam Rothman, who was a member of the working group, was supportive of the student discussions. 
“I’m excited to see that the students are thinking about Georgetown history and their relationship to it,” Rothman said. “I’m all in favor of conversations that flow from that.”
Georgetown is engaged in dialogue with the descendant community and the Society of Jesus as it continues to consider other recommendations from the working group, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
“We appreciate the engagement and support of students and GUSA and will continue to consult with students and other members of the university community as we work in partnership with Descendants on a process that recognizes the terrible legacy of slavery and promotes racial justice in southern Louisiana, southern Maryland and throughout the nation,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The relationship between the GU272 and the university ought to be incorporated into more of Georgetown’s curriculum to ensure broader awareness among the student body, Rothman said.
“The more we can do to elevate the consciousness of our own history around campus, the better. I’d like to see classes that devote some attention to this history — not just in history classes, but in philosophy classes, theology classes, business classes and art classes,” Rothman said. “Some of that is going on already, but I think that in some cases, students can take it upon themselves.”
This article was updated Jan. 23 to more accurately reflect the role of the GU272 Advocacy Team and to clarify the nature of the proposed fee.

While GU has revealed it’s involvement in the sale of 272 enslaved Africans and descendants of Africans, it has not revealed the monstrous destruction of life, culture and human possibilities of enslaved Africans by the Society of Jesus. Georgetown University is just one of many institutions of the Society of Jesus. What is known about the Society of Jesus and what it did to the Peoplehood of the enslaved African Descendants calls for more comprehensive actions of reconciliation because of the dehumanization that continues today. Jesuits continue to use the word “slave” to identify and define our enslaved ancestors. It’s in their texts, scriptures, and verbal communications. Consequently, there can be no reconciliation by GU if the Society of Jesus does not rid its texts, scriptures, and verbal communications of the ascription and description of enslaved Africans as “slaves.” Our enslaved Ancestors were African people (scientists, philosophers, architects, mathematicians, community and religious representatives, etc.) “enslaved” by the Jesuits, and others under the system of chattel slavery. In essence, with this derogatory term, The Society of Jesus reinforced and sustained slavery and made us, chattel “slaves”— property and commodity to be bought and sold. 
This monstrous tradition must be done away with. Getting the language right to create the paradigm shift from slave to enslaved, master to enslaver, is the key to our Peoplehood and reconciliation for Jesuits to correct. There can be no reconciliation or repair without “restitution” and “reparations.” Cessation, assurances, and guarantees of non-repetition of dehumanizing language must be done. GU and Jesuits must lead the way in getting the language right. Every effort must be made by the Jesuits to engage in meaningful ways to repair the psychological and structural damage of our Peoplehood starting with the language used to identify and recognize the humanity of enslaved Africans. This is the price of racial reconciliation that must be paid by the Society of Jesus.

Abortion is anti-feminist and represents violence against the female body, according to a panel of female anti-abortion advocates at an event in Dahlgren Chapel on Jan. 15.
Women who are against abortion are often misconstrued as being anti-feminist, Gloria Purvis, creator of a Catholic television network show, said at the event. Purvis, however, argued that supporting abortion prevents women from embracing their own bodies.
“People say: ‘I’m a feminist, I’m this, I’m that, how can you be not for abortion?’ And my answer to that is I think the question of abortion poses as the problem the female body itself,” Purvis said. “The problem itself is pregnancy. Our enemy of progress is our very own body. Just the essence of being female.”
The panel, titled “Stand for Life, All Life, Every Life: Resisting the Throwaway Culture,”was hosted by the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life as part of the Dahlgren Dialogues series, which features conversations with various thought leaders about moral and political issues regarding faith and public life. 
Cosponsored by the Office of Mission and Ministry, the panel also featured Aimee Murphy, executive director of Rehumanize International, a nonpartisan organization that stands against all violence, which the organization argues includes abortion and the death penalty. President of Feminists for Life of America Serrin Foster and Julia Greenwood (COL ’19) also participated in the panel.
Abortion does not advance equality but rather is a form of violence against women, Murphy said at the event. 
“Pro-life women like all of us sitting up here really do represent a rejection of the idea that we need violence in order to be equal,” Murphy said. “Anyone who needs violence in order to succeed in life is ultimately anti-human and, in this case, extremely misogynistic.”
Greenwood and Murphy’s message to anti-abortion women is that abortion access does not equal the progression of women’s rights.
“Abortion is not empowering to women,” Greenwood said in an interview with The Hoya.
Violence in the form of abortion contributes to oppression, Purvis said, drawing parallels to the systemic racism faced by black people during the Civil Rights Movement.
“When you think about the Civil Rights Movement and the violence that people endured just to say, ‘I am a man, I deserve just the same things as everybody else,’ the kind of violence they endured because people wanted to keep them down,” Purvis said. “In this case, they say that women have to use violence on children, the unborn, in order to achieve our equality.”
In the spirit of combating male-dominated culture, women must embrace pregnancy as something that is exclusively feminine, Purvis said. 
“If you want to talk about misogyny, then what is more misogynistic than to say maleness is the pattern for female perfection,” Purvis said. “Male bodies, as a consequence of sex, don’t get pregnant. We do. And to make that the problem and then to suggest violence to the woman and to the body within her is a problem.”
Bipartisan support for legislation like the Pregnant Women in Custody Act would give more resources to pregnant women and support them in carrying their pregnancies to term, according to Foster. The Pregnant Women in Custody Act, introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in September 2018, would provide prenatal care to incarcerated pregnant women. 
“Let’s get the Pregnant Women in Custody Act done. Let’s get these things, let’s start checking off the list and talking to people,” Foster said. “We’ve had President Obama and President Trump, Republicans and Democrats work with us on different bills, and that is what we need to do in this town.”
As a student leader of The Francis Project: Hoyas for Human Dignity and Life, a project that strives to create awareness of the Catholic understanding of human dignity, Greenwood said she has found many student pro-abortion rights organizations unwilling to participate in dialogue.
“We have found that other students on this campus, those that are most opposed to us, are not terribly interested in dialogue,” Greenwood said. “We’ve tried. They’re not interested; they want to shout at us actually.”
In response to the event, H*yas for Choice said abortion access is a life-saving procedure that prevents high maternal mortality rates.
“We believe that abortion is a fundamental human right, and it is disappointing to see these panelists discuss ‘protecting life’ while advocating for further restricting access to life-saving procedures like abortion,” H*yas for Choice wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
Women who do not support abortion have been unfairly characterized as anti-women, Purvis said. 
“We all have been painted as anti-woman and that is completely contrary to progress,” Purvis said. “I think we say, ‘No, we are pro-women, authentically pro-women, without violence, and that includes our unborn daughters as well.’”
Abortion continues to prove itself as a divisive topic on Georgetown’s campus. A petition to ban the pro-abortion rights student group H*yas for Choice launched in November 2018. H*yas for Choice remains unrecognized by the university and thus does not receive financial support from Georgetown. Georgetown University Right to Life also had its anti-abortion chalk display in Red Square defaced in 2016.
Though abortion is a tense topic, many Georgetown students are open to learning more about the anti-abortion mission, according to Greenwood.
“My main surprise, just in my daily life and the people that I know through classes and through freshman dorms, is how many people are in the middle,” Greenwood said. “That’s a really important area that we oftentimes forget to work on: how to draw these people in, because it’s kind of natural to find something off-putting about the prospect of having to kill children.”

Abortion falls within the values of Christianity and women’s right to abortion should be protected, Christian OB-GYN and reproductive rights advocate Dr. Willie Parker said at a Lecture Fund event Wednesday. 
Condemning reproductive choices like abortion is not intrinsic to mainstream religions, and the perception of abortion as an immoral act reflects a misconstrued understanding of religious teachings, Parker told students. 
As a devout Christian doctor, Parker said his sense of morality centers around supporting the patient’s wishes.
“I had a moral obligation and ethical obligation to respect the personhood and the autonomy and the bodily integrity of women,” Parker said. “As a practicing physician, I had an ethical obligation to practice beneficence.” 
Parker’s visit came just a day after a panel hosted by the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life with the Office of Mission and Ministry that featured four anti-abortion activists who argued that abortion is anti-feminist. 
The limited access to abortion services in many Southern states and his experience with racism and poverty growing up in Birmingham, Ala., motivated Parker to practice as a women’s health care provider in the South, he said Wednesday.
U.S. policymakers shy away from confronting abortion inaccessibility issues because they worry they might infringe upon religious freedom, according to Parker.
“Because of the deep-held value of religious freedom in our country, people back up and they throw their hands up,” Parker said. “How do you rebut or push back on somebody’s religious understanding?”
Parker provides abortion services to women in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois and Mississippi. These states represent some of those with the most restrictive abortion laws nationally, according to Parker’s website. He is a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit against the state of Mississippi, attempting to prevent the closure of Mississippi’s only abortion clinic. 
American views on abortion vary widely based on religious group, according to a 2014 Pew Research Study. Although a minority of Americans believe abortion should be criminalized, the study found that a majority of evangelical Christian respondents think abortion should be illegal. 
Christians do not violate their religion’s ideas about morality by providing abortion services, Parker said. Parker serves on the boards of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice and URGE and chairs the board of Physicians for Reproductive Health.
Religion should not dictate reproductive policy as it has in the past, Parker said.
“The problem with religion influencing policy is that religion is too prolific in a nation where religious freedom is guaranteed,” Parker said. “Religious pluralism means that we cannot have policies that govern us all determined by something so subjective.”
Outside of political policies, religion should play a role in the debate about abortion, according to Parker.
“Science without morals and ethics is dangerous, and religion or sentimentality without evidence and scientific reality is dangerous,” Parker said. 
Those who oppose the legality of abortion in the United States contradict the fundamental U.S. value of individual freedom, according to Parker.
“Patrick Henry said, ‘Give me liberty or give me death,’ and that was a rallying cry for the revolution that founded this country,” Parker said. “So I don’t know why it’s such a reach for us to understand why a woman’s willing to die trying to live on her own terms versus being forced to live on the terms of someone else.”
Parker’s lecture was cosponsored by pro-abortion rights student group H*yas For Choice and Georgetown University College Democrats. The event included reserved seating for members of both H*yas for Choice and anti-abortion student organization Georgetown Right to Life. Georgetown University Police Department officers checked the bags of all attendees and officers stood around the perimeter of the room during the event.
Parker addressed comments made by panelists at the Stand for Life event hosted by the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life and the Office of Mission and Ministry. Parker rebuked the idea that abortion is a form of violence towards women in an interview with The Hoya, instead insisting abortion empowers women to protect their lives.
“To say abortion is anti-feminist is like saying black people opposing racism is racist. They can say that if they have a very narrow and rigid understanding of what is appropriate to women,” Parker said. “There is an internal inconsistency with saying that something that is so critical to the existence of women is anti-feminist.”
Parker addressed student activists in the room, commending H*yas for Choice’s advocacy for reproductive health despite a petition to ban its activities on campus. The group remains unrecognized by the university and does not receive financial support from Georgetown.
“The notion and the very idea of a group and an organization at Georgetown University called H*yas for Choice inspires me,” Parker said.

The ongoing government shutdown has resulted in hundreds of federal employees being instructed to work without pay, national tourist attractions remaining closed and local businesses having to alter daily operations.
The longest in U.S. history, the government shutdown began Dec. 22 after the U.S. Congress declined to comply with President Donald Trump’s $5 billion funding request for a border wall.
Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) wrote a letter to Trump’s administration on Jan. 4. The regional leaders urged the president and Congressional leaders to end the government shutdown because of its negative effects on state and local budgets, government services, the economy and the livelihoods of federal workers. 
“The national capital region is home to well over 360,000 federal workers, many of whom are employed by the departments and agencies affected by this lapse in appropriations,” the letter reads. “These federal employees have been furloughed or forced to work without pay, not knowing when they will get their next paychecks.”
The leaders also cited the threat the shutdown poses to public safety and health, especially in areas maintained and safeguarded by federal employees. The shutdown puts coasts and waterways at risk because of the shutdown’s restrictions on the daily operations of the Environmental Protection Agency and Coast Guard, according to the letter. 
The reduced number of federal workers also leads to lower standards of safety and sanitation in national parks, according to the letter.
Five workers affected by the government shutdown anonymously filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for requiring them to work without pay. The lawsuit alleges that the administration labeled the defendants as essential workers without proof that their work meets the necessary standards. The Jan. 9 lawsuit seeks to prevent the federal government from mandating employees work without pay.
Hayley Grande (COL ’21), president of the Georgetown University College Republicans, commented on the conditions of unpaid federal workers, but acknowledged that benefits could arise from the shutdown.
“It’s unfortunate that government employees are furloughed,” Grande said in an interview with The Hoya. “There are different perspectives within the club that see the merits of having the shutdown and the demerits as well, and it really depends on the outcome.”
The reduced number of federal workers because of the shutdown adds to the day-to-day considerations students must take when making travel plans or visiting D.C. attractions, according to Georgetown University Democrats Chair Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21).
“I think that us living in D.C. has also opened our eyes. I know traveling back, I definitely went to the airport earlier, so even just small things like that, and even the museums are closed,” Hollister said in an interview with the Hoya. 
Beyond preventing federal workers from receiving their paychecks, the shutdown also hurts local businesses dependent on closed tourist attractions, according to Washington’s Top News. 
While the metro system, local government, Library of Congress and Kennedy Center remain open, the Smithsonian museums, National Zoo, National Gallery, National Archives, Washington Monument, Rock Creek Park and other government-run attractions remain closed until further notice.
The closure of federally-run national attractions has decreased revenues for business owners and taxi drivers reliant on visitors to these attractions. Additionally, tour groups operating in D.C. have attempted to fill in gaps in tour schedules by working with privately-owned museums, according to The Washington Post. 
Though the shutdown has caused some disturbances in the District, the city is taking efforts to alleviate limitations caused by the federal government’s limited operations. Daily work done by the local government such as trash collection will continue because of the District’s adoption of budget autonomy following the last government shutdown, allowing D.C. to raise and spend funds without the approval of Congress.
The LOVE Act, signed by Bowser on Jan. 1, enables couples to get married despite the government shutdown. The act allows D.C.’s secretary to issue marriage licenses in place of the clerk of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which has not been operating during the shutdown.
“As we’ve said: You can’t shut down love,” Bowser said in a Jan. 11 news release. “This shutdown is senseless, it’s hurting real Americans, and we will continue calling on the President to work with Congress to get the government back open and our federal employees back to work.”
Bowser commended local businesses and event organizers for their efforts to keep the city running and provide entertainment to tourists and visitors amid the closure of national parks, monuments and museums.
“I am proud that through these challenging times, local businesses, event organizers and others are stepping up and providing our residents and visitors continued access to resources, attractions, and activities that make D.C. the greatest city to live in and visit,” Bowser said in a Dec. 31 news release.

Georgetown University administrators rebuked proposed changes to Title IX regulations at a town hall hosted by Students Taking Action Against Interpersonal Violence, a campus student group dedicated to advocating against sexual misconduct, on Tuesday.
On Nov. 16, the U.S. Department of Education released proposed changes to Title IX regulations that include the redefinition of sexual harassment under Title IX and raising the standard of proof necessary in Title IX hearings.
In response Georgetown hosted 10 in-person feedback sessions across its campuses in Washington, D.C., between Dec. 3 and 19 to provide a forum for students to voice their thoughts on the Department of Education’s proposed changes to Title IX regulations. 
The feedback sessions, however, left many students uncertain of how the university would respond to their concerns, according to STAIV member Fiona Singer (SFS ’20). The university’s ambiguity has led STAIV to seek another forum to clarify how the university intends to proceed.
“We felt that creating a forum where STAIV would be able to ask and follow up on a lot of the topics and issues that were raised in the listening sessions would be a really valuable tool for the work that we’re interested in pursuing,” Singer said in an interview with The Hoya.
The panel included Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, Director of the Office of Student Conduct Judy Johnson, vice president for institutional diversity and equity Rosemary Kilkenny, associate director of Health Education Services Jen Schweer, and Title IX investigator Samantha Berner. Berner has also been serving as the interim Title IX coordinator since Laura Cutway vacated the position in June 2018.
Georgetown plans on opposing the proposed changes in the proposed regulations for limiting action the university can take against sexual assaulters on campus, according to Olson. 
“We believe that Title IX coordinators should be able to proceed with a complaint when there are multiple reports against the same respondent without requiring the individuals to be cross-examined,” Olson said. “We believe that we need to act when we know as an institution, or reasonably should know.”
The proposed Title IX regulations would treat educational institutions like courts of law to the detriment of survivors of sexual assault at Georgetown, according to Olson. 
“We care deeply at Georgetown about fair grievance procedures,” Olson said. “By narrowing the definition of sexual harassment and by requiring colleges to implement courtroom-like procedures, we believe the proposed regulations will deter reporting, will allow misconduct to go unaddressed, and will make students feel less safe and be less safe.”
The new definition requires  “severe, pervasive and objectively offensive” conduct to be perceived as sexual harassment, whereas the previous definition only required one of the three conditions. The Education Department’s proposal also mandates that investigations of formal complaints be held to a higher legal standard of proof, which would make taking disciplinary action against accused students harder for universities. The previous standard used in Title IX hearings required only that the alleged action more likely than not took place, while the new standard requires “clear and convincing” evidence that a violation occurred.
Multiple students present at the feedback sessions and at the town hall expressed concern over the new definition of “sexual harassment” as well as the introduction of proposed regulations requiring cross-examination of accused students and survivors as well as the higher standard of proof. 
The university hopes to finish its draft of comments to the regulations by the middle of next week, according to Kilkenny. The comment period for the proposed Title IX regulations ends on Jan. 28. 
STAIV member Emma Oechsner (COL ’21) said the group still feels the administration’s response is lacking, as Georgetown has not yet published its formal comment. Administrators promised students they would have the opportunity to read before it is submitted to the Education Department.
Students have also criticized Georgetown for its handling of recent cases of sexual misconduct on campus. Students wrote an Aug. 31 letter criticizing the university for having Berner serve as both a Title IX investigator and coordinator following the departure of Laura Cutaway, the previous Title IX coordinator. Following a Nov. 8 op-ed and a Nov. 13 letter to the editor that outlined specific instances in which the university did not meet survivors’ needs, Georgetown Survivors formed to offer new support networks to survivors of sexual assault.
According to Georgetown’s 2016 Sexual Assault and Misconduct Survey, 31 percent of female undergraduates and 10.8 percent of male undergraduates report having experienced sexual assault at Georgetown. A second campuswide sexual assault and misconduct survey will be administered by the university in early 2019.
Sergeant Sarah Halpren-Ruder, the Sexual Assault Response Team coordinator, promised at the town hall to increase the amount of sexual assault training from two hours to eight hours for all GUPD officers. Halpren-Ruder promised Sexual Assault Response and Prevention officers will obtain at least 40 hours of training per year.
The town hall also featured an open forum designed particularly for students from minority groups on campus to ask questions, according to STAIV. Many students, however, voiced frustration at the administration’s deferral of many questions to Health Education Services. 
“I was disappointed that it was either Jen Schweer talking about what Health Education Services does or other members of the panel reflecting back on Health Education Services,” Singer said. “I feel that the institution should make an effort more holistically — it makes me feel there is a few very talented people in one office in campus, but I would like to feel as a student that the entire administration is committed to making students feel safe on campus.”
Despite these complaints, the town hall provided a welcome continuation of the conversations started in the feedback sessions, Singer said.
“I was really grateful that there was a conversation that felt very productive,” Singer said. “I felt that the administration was more transparent than they had been prior, and I did think the event ended with a pretty strong list of commitments that we can follow up and maintain conversation on.”

The Georgetown University Women’s Center has yet to secure a permanent replacement for former Director Laura Kovach three months after she vacated her position Oct. 5.
Kovach worked for the women’s center for over a decade. Under Kovach’s leadership, the center established the Biondi Copeland Lecture Series, which recognizes the exceptional leadership of women in higher education. In collaboration with Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, Kovach also spearheaded an annual conference for women students. 
While the center searches for new leadership, Jeanne Lord, associate vice president and dean of students, will serve as interim director of the center, aided by several colleagues who have already been employed at the center for some time. 
Currently, the women’s center has four undergraduate student workers, one graduate assistant and a program coordinator who is a staff member, according to Vanessa Phillips (MSB ’19), a staffer at GUWC. The center also receives external staff support while Lord serves as interim director, Phillips said. Phillips declined to disclose progress on the search for a new full-time director.
Karla Rondon, the program coordinator for the center, said the daily operations and services provided by the women’s center for the community will remain unchanged during the interim director period.
“The Center will continue to function as it has been, and we’re committed to providing all students with resources and education. We want students to know that what we offer has not changed, and we’re very excited for the upcoming semester,” Rondon wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Kovach left the women’s center to begin a new role at Alteristic, a social accelerator organization focused on the prevention and elimination of power-based violence.
Kovach declined The Hoya’s request for comment on last year’s change in leadership. 
Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson praised Kovach’s legacy and advocacy efforts for women’s issues during her time in the position.
“Laura Kovach provided extraordinary leadership to the women’s center for over 10 years and was a powerful voice on current issues impacting women, notably surrounding our community’s work in preventing and addressing sexual assault,” Olsen said in a statement to The Hoya.
Caroline Sarda (COL ’20), an undergraduate staffer at the center, said despite Kovach’s absence, the center remains committed to its goals of being accessible for all students.
“Laura provided a very unique energy and warmth to the center that we will really miss, but we are dedicated to keeping the space a safe, welcoming and helpful resource for all students at Georgetown,” Sarda said. 
Students involved with the women’s center in the past will play a vital role in the center’s operations as it undergoes a change in leadership, Olson said.
“As we conduct a search for a new leader and explore strengthening the work of the women’s center and LGBTQ Resource Center, we will engage with students leaders and campus partners who are involved with both,” Olson wrote in his statement to the Georgetown community.

Cardinal Donald Wuerl, former archbishop of Washington, D.C., was aware of an allegation of sexual assault against former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, his predecessor, as early as 2004, according to his Jan. 15 letter to the Society of Jesus.
Wuerl’s letter comes after previous public claims that no accusations were made against McCarrick during his time in D.C. until June 2018, when the Archdiocese of New York reported a credible allegation of abuse against McCarrick. Wuerl denied prior knowledge because his statements were in response to questions of McCarrick’s abuse of minors, whereas Robert Ciolek was an adult during the timeframe of abuse, according to Wuerl’s letter.
In 2004, Ciolek, who left the priesthood to get married in 1988, accused McCarrick of sexually abusing him while he was an adult seminarian in a complaint to the Diocese of Pittsburgh, according to the D.C. Diocese’s Jan. 10 news release. Wuerl, who was then the bishop of Pittsburgh, reported the accusations to the Apostolic Nunciature to the U.S., a clerical office of the Vatican based in D.C. with the rank of an embassy. Wuerl kept the accusation confidential following his report to the Papal Nunciature.
His disclosure comes amid student calls for the university to revoke the honorary degrees given to Wuerl and McCarrick. In response, Georgetown has assembled a working group to revisit the honorary degrees and has yet to announce a decision.
Georgetown will continue taking measures to address the issue of abuse in the Catholic Church, according to a university spokesperson.
“The allegations surrounding abuse in the Catholic Church are deeply troubling,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is with profound sadness and concern for the victims and those harmed by these actions that we continue our work to respond to this moment through dialogue, reflection, and action, building on the convenings this past semester and ongoing conversations with our community.”
The Archdiocese of D.C. defended Wuerl for respecting Ciolek’s privacy in his handling of the allegation in 2004.
“Bishop Wuerl adhered to Mr. Ciolek’s request for confidentiality, and the Archdiocese understands that Mr. Ciolek also expressed his gratitude with how the Diocese of Pittsburgh handled his allegations,” the D.C. Archdiocese wrote in a Jan. 10 news release.
The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, an advocacy group for survivors of institutional sexual abuse, is calling for the Catholic Church to punish Wuerl for his compliance in covering up McCarrick’s abuse and later denial.
“If other American prelates are as disgusted with the abuse crisis as they claim, they should publicly demand that the Vatican excommunicate not only Wuerl but every other official who has ignored, minimized, or covered-up allegations of child sex abuse,” SNAP wrote in a Jan. 14 news release.
The recent development comes after Pope Francis accepted Wuerl’s resignation from the position of D.C. archbishop in October after a Pennsylvania grand jury report revealed Wuerl’s mishandling of cases of sexual abuse during his time as bishop of Pittsburgh. 
McCarrick was suspended from ministry last June and resigned from the College of Cardinals in July, the first cardinal to resign from the advisory group due to allegations of sexual abuse. He is currently being tried by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the judicial arm of the Vatican.

The Office of Planning and Facilities Management is responding to a significant increase in student concerns about mold by cleaning dorms with high rates of moisture-related problems, as universities nationwide address mold infestation in campus buildings.
Between Dec. 21 and Jan. 9, facilities conducted cleanings and inspections of on-campus buildings that were exposed to high amounts of moisture and mold last semester, according to Benjamin Kuo, vice president of planning and facilities management.
“We conducted deep cleaning of all private bathrooms in our residence halls, on-campus apartments and off-campus townhouses, as well as larger communal bathrooms in the dormitories, approximately 920 bathrooms total,” Kuo wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
In addition, 148 bathrooms received extra cleaning to ensure that tile and grout areas were free of mold, according to Kuo.
Facilities responded to 361 mold-related work requests between August and October last year, more than double the number reported during that time frame in 2017.
All the bathrooms of Village A and Henle Village apartments were treated with Saniglaze, a sealing process to clean and maintain tile and grout, according to an email sent to the Georgetown community members Wednesday.
The university also hired outside contractors to inspect the dorms with increased reports of moisture and mold build-up, according to Kuo. Eastern Research Group, an industrial hygienist firm, searched for mold and measured air conditions in affected dorms.
Addressing reports of mold is a university priority and students are encouraged to contact the Student Health Center should they have any concerns about mold affecting their health, according to Geoffrey Chatas, Georgetown senior vice president and chief operating officer.
“We will continue to monitor the situation and respond to recommendations from ERG’s final report to ensure a safe learning, working and living environment for our campus community,” Chatas wrote in the Wednesday email.
Historic amounts of rainfall contributed to increased mold in on-campus dorms, with the greatest number of requests coming from students living in Village C, Darnall Hall and Village A.
Several students became ill after exposure to black mold in their dormitories last semester. Students reported contracting bronchitis, as well as experiencing difficulty breathing, coughing, lightheadedness, fatigue and congestion. Exposure to mold can lead to itchy eyes and skin, upper respiratory problems and nasal stuffiness, according to the Center for Disease Control.
Facilities conducted air quality assessments in Village C East, Village C West and Darnall Hall before winter break, according to a Dec. 3 email sent to residents of the three dorms. Facilities staff conducted visual inspections of each student dormitory room as well as the common rooms.
Members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee urged the university to protect facilities workers responsible for the removal and cleanup of mold in a letter delivered to University President John J. DeGioia on Dec. 6. Workers were exposed to harsh chemical cleaners such as bleach during mold remediation efforts, often without proper training, according to GSC.
Other colleges in the Washington, D.C. area have also experienced issues with mold because of unprecedented amounts of rainfall and poorly maintained buildings.
Last September, more than 500 students at the University of Maryland, College Park, were relocated to hotels after mold was discovered throughout a freshman dorm. Incidents of mold in living areas have also been reported at nearby universities, including American University and The George Washington University.
The increase in reports of mold is not limited to colleges in the region: Indiana University at Bloomington is among many universities nationwide that experienced an increase in mold-related problems last semester, according to the Indiana Daily Student. IU is facing a class action lawsuit that alleges the university did not do enough to remove mold in two freshman dorms.

The mean grade point average in all undergraduate courses taken in the McDonough School of Business will now be capped at 3.5 out of 4.0 in an effort to decrease competition among students.
This new grading policy will affect core and elective courses across all majors, in addition to Georgetown’s MBA program, and will take effect in the spring 2019 semester, according to a Jan. 7 email from Patricia Grant, MSB senior associate dean, announcing the update to MSB students. The former policy, which had been in place since 2009, dictated that the average GPA in any MSB core class could not exceed 3.3.
The MSB’s decision comes after a monthslong initiative to address concerns about unintended consequences of the previous grading policy, such as increased competition, reduced collaboration and adverse effects on employment and graduate school admissions compared to universities where such a policy does not exist, according to an email announcing the update to MSB students.
The MSB’s executive council, which includes the school’s faculty and senior administrators, as well as student representatives, decided upon the new policy in November 2018, according to the MSB website.
Professors are able to request an exemption to the grading policy on the basis of exceptional reasons, such as a small class size or high levels of self-selection into the class, according to the email.
Former Deputy Dean of the MSB Professor Ricardo Ernst was a strong advocate of implementing the previous curve until he saw the negative consequences the strict curve had on students’ willingness to collaborate.
“The element of competition is always healthy, but you should not push it to the limit,” Ernst said in an interview with The Hoya. “One of the beauties of Georgetown is that our students, at the end of the day, many times they become friends. Having the curve implemented too tightly destroys that very important part of the learning process, which is cooperation among classmates.”
Paul Dougherty (MSB ’20) believes students’ academic attitudes will not be affected by a change in the grading system.
“I am not so sure that it will change the level of ‘competition’ people talk about when it comes to the MSB,” Dougherty said. “The way I see it, people will continue to put in their best effort and the result of the curve will simply be a different way of measuring the same academic process and relative performance that has always occurred.”
The new policy is likely to not affect students on a day-to-day basis, since the grading curve only comes into effect at the end of the course, according to Dougherty.
“The curve only comes into effect once final grades are solidified, and thus does not affect a student’s perception of their standing in a class until it is too late to change the level of effort they are putting in,” Dougherty said.

The Hoya Hub, an on-campus food pantry, has expanded to 130 signups in the three months since its opening, but more may be utilizing the pantry, as the Hoya Hub does not track exact usage statistics.
The pantry opened in October 2018 following a 2016 Georgetown University Student Association survey in which 54 percent of respondents reported experiencing food insecurity on campus. The Hoya Hub seeks to alleviate food insecurity on campus by providing food through its on-campus location in the Leavey Center.
The Hoya Hub encourages pantry users to indicate their use of the pantry through an online form, but completion of the form is not necessary to obtain the access code to the pantry.
Of the pantry users who filled out the voluntary form, 66 percent are undergraduate students, 25 percent are graduate students and 9 percent are staff or alumni. Class breakdowns were roughly even across the four years of undergraduates, with juniors accessing the pantry most and sophomores the least.
Sixty-six percent of students who completed the form said they did not have a campus meal plan.
Georgetown can do more to address food insecurity on campus beyond offering the food pantry as a resource, Research and Writing Fellow at Food Tank Katherine Walla (SFS ’19) said.
Georgetown could re-evaluate whether its meal plans, which offer varying amounts of meal swipes and flex dollars, leave students with sufficient funds for food, Walla said.
Graduate students face a different set of financial circumstances than undergraduate students, with low stipends or hourly wages that do not extend into the summer months, according to Chad Frazier, a Ph.D. candidate in the history department and member of the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees organizing committee, the leadership committee for the graduate student union.
“So what happens is you have to make a living and make ends meet,” Frazier said. “And the way a lot of grad students do that is by skipping a meal.”
GAGE worked with the Hoya Hub to spread awareness about the pantry among graduate students, Frazier said, citing a disconnect between graduate students and campus resources. GAGE also helped hold a food drive for the pantry.
Efforts to reach out to Georgetown staff, such as translating Hoya Hub promotional materials into Spanish, also resulted in a quick uptick in the use of the pantry by staff members, according to Hoya Hub chair Caroline Barnes (COL ’19).
In a continued attempt to move beyond the nonperishable food items offered by the pantry, the Hoya Hub partnered with The Tavern, Sweetgreen’s indoor farmers market, to provide students with $10 coupons for fresh produce.
Through this partnership, the Hoya Hub hopes provide healthy, balanced meals to students, according to Barnes.
“We’re really trying to push, instead of just snacking, a whole, sustainable meal, especially for those who don’t have a meal plan,” Barnes said.
At The George Washington University, students are set to launch a program called Last Call For Food on Jan. 28, which discounts food at campus locations toward the end of the day for students experiencing food insecurity.
The program’s leaders are planning to expand to Georgetown and American University, according to LCFF co-founder and GWU senior Chloe King. In December, the group began efforts to expand to Hilltoss, the salad restaurant in the Healey Family Student Center owned by Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly known as the Corp, according to King.
Beyond providing donated or discounted food, increased awareness of students’ eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could potentially help alleviate food insecurity, according to Walla. 
A recent Government Accountability Office report found almost 2 million low-income students may have been eligible for SNAP but were not receiving the benefits. 
Yet eligibility issues can arise for students who are enrolled in college more than half time, according to Walla.
“If you’re enrolled over half-time, you’re not eligible because you’re assumed to have your parents’ financial support or support from colleges,” Walla said. “But, as we know, that’s not the case.”
Many full-time students may remain unaware of exceptions that could make them eligible, such as working more than 20 hours per week.
The GAO report recommended that the Food and Nutrition Service provide clarification for college students on eligibility.
Once the Hoya Hub obtained a location in the Leavey Center in September, the group raised the necessary funds to open the following month through SaxaFund, Georgetown’s student-run crowdfunding platform.
The Hoya Hub has raised $1,625 of its $3,000 goal through its page on SaxaFund. The group also has an official Georgetown donation page. A range of students, professors, alumni and family members have donated, according to Barnes.
In December, the Hoya Hub received a $5,000 grant from the Masonic and Eastern Star Home Charities for 2019. Barnes expressed hope that the grant would be renewed for the following year, and that a combination of grants and donations would sustain the effort going forward.
Space, rather than funds, is the Hoya Hub’s greatest challenge going forward, according to Barnes. Although Barnes plans to continue to advocate for more space for the Hoya Hub on campus, she estimates expansion could take more than one year.
“I think the Hoya Hub is going to be a fixture on campus moving forward,” Barnes said. “I just don’t know with the existing space we have on campus whether that will be realistic even in the next year or so.”

Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Democratic leaders endorsed the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, which would make D.C. the 51st state in the United States. The District’s non-voting representative in Congress, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), introduced the bill on Jan. 3 with 155 original cosponsors, setting the record for a bill introduced on the first day of Congress.
Pelosi issued a statement Jan. 4 expressing support for the bill. H.R. 51 will allow D.C. residents the same representation in Congress that residents of states are afforded, Pelosi said.
“The right to vote and to equal representation is the foundation of our freedom and a core pillar of our democracy,” Pelosi said in the news release. “For too long, the residents of the District of Columbia have served our nation in uniform, paid taxes and contributed to the economic power and success of our country while being denied the full enfranchisement that is their right.”
Under current law, Norton and the five delegates representing Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands can only vote when the whole House votes and when the House is controlled by Democrats, according to The Washington Post. However, if the delegates change the result of a vote, that result is ignored and a new vote is taken.
The house has not voted on D.C. statehood since 1993, when the bill failed 153-277, according to The Washington Post.
Norton and other D.C. officials such as Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) have long advocated for statehood, most recently including a March 2017 bill introduced to the 115th Congress. The House did not vote on the bill even though it received support from a supermajority of Democrats. In a November 2016 referendum on statehood, over 80 percent of D.C. residents voted in favor of the measure, but no legislative changes followed. 
The House Committee on Oversight and Reform will hold a hearing and markup on the D.C. Statehood Bill later this year, according to a press release from Norton’s office. The bill has also received support from Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of House Oversight, who cited the need to protect all citizens’ rights as his reason for backing the bill in a news release. 
“We must protect the rights of everyone across the country, including the hundreds of thousands of American citizens who live in our nation’s capital,” Cummings said. “I plan to schedule a hearing and markup this year in the Oversight Committee.”
Congresswoman Norton expressed gratitude for the record level of support for D.C. statehood in a Jan. 3 press release, noting the hearing and markup as a way to increase exposure for the issue. 
“A hearing and markup will provide a prime opportunity to inform and remind Americans that over 700,000 of their fellow citizens who live in the nation’s capital are denied their basic democratic rights,” Norton said. 
Due to lack of representation for residents in Congress, 11 D.C. residents filed a lawsuit in Nov. 2018 in conjunction with the D.C. Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, Washington, D.C.’s chapter of the national of the nonprofit social justice center.
Findings supporting D.C. statehood were also included in a bill that would significantly reform campaign finance law and voting accessibility laws introduced by House Democrats on Jan. 3.
Pelosi said the push for D.C. voting rights and statehood will accompany Democrats’ efforts to strengthen the D.C. Voting Rights Act of 2007, which Congress recognized as having the power to give voting rights to a state under the district clause. 
Though new Democratic leadership has supported the bill, Republicans in the House have historically been supported measures to limit D.C.’s ability to govern itself rather than move it closer to statehood.
Georgetown University government professor Stephen Wayne expressed doubts about the success of the statehood movement due to Republican concerns about  increasing the number of Democratic senators.
“If the District had two senators, that would increase to 102 the number of senators and that would give the Democrats two more. Republicans are going to oppose that,” Wayne said in a 2016 interview with The Hoya. “Every one of the states would feel that they’re going to be losing a little power if two more senators are added.”

Washington, D.C., experienced 12 homicides as of Jan. 17, more than double the number reported at this time in 2018, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.
The homicide data follows the deadliest year in D.C. in a decade, with the exception of 2015, according to MPD’s website. 
Increases in the District’s homicide numbers do not typically affect Georgetown because of the low frequency of crime in Ward 2, according to Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber. GUPD has not yet released its crime statistics for 2018, but a 2017 report shows there were no homicides in the area. 
The rise in homicides in the D.C. area can be attributed to an increased use of guns in crimes, according to MPD Deputy Communications Director Kristen Metzger. Most homicides occurred as a result of disputes between acquaintances, according to Metzger.
“The rise in homicides are a result of the frequent use of guns in crimes and more fatal outcomes when a shooting occurs,” Metzger wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The majority of homicides in DC are a result of petty disputes between known parties where a gun is introduced, which leads to someone being killed.”
D.C.’s 160 homicides in 2018 were concentrated in District Wards 5, 7 and 8. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) provided additional resources to District Wards 7 and 8 in response to the rise in violent crime, according to a May 28 news release. As a result of Bowser’s actions, MPD increased its staffing levels by 25 percent in the Wards 6 and 7, and resources from non-law enforcement agencies were deployed around each ward. 
The District will continue its partnership with local law enforcement in an effort to reduce the number of homicides in 2019, according to Bowser.
“With precision policing targeted at illegal guns and repeat violent offenders; with strengthened resolve of our federal law enforcement partners; and with a focus on greater economic opportunity, we will reverse this year’s homicide spike in our city,” Bowser said in a Jan. 2 news release.
The Georgetown community has experienced instances of violent crime in the past. In Oct. 2018, a woman was shot while she was sitting in the passenger seat of a car at the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and Water Street in Georgetown, sustaining injuries that were not life-threatening. The shooting was not random, according to Dustin Sternbeck, MPD communications director.
Wendy Martinez (GRD ’12) was fatally stabbed while jogging in Logan Circle in Sept. 2018. MPD suspect the attack was random, according to CBS News.
MPD encourages D.C. residents to be vigilant and report all suspicious activity to prevent crime, according to MPD Public Affairs Specialist Alaina Gertz.
“It has always been a priority that DC Police safeguard the District and we will continue to do so,” Gertz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Residents of the District are urged to be vigilant and follow the motto, ‘If you see something, say something.’”

A Washington, D.C. initiative, LIVE.LONG.DC., aims to reduce District opioid overdoses by 50 percent by 2020, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced.
Opioid overdoses are at a record high in D.C., which experienced more deaths from opioid-related overdoses than homicides in 2018.
Input from the public on the plan, announced Dec. 24, as well as past efforts to combat the epidemic, will be heard in a Jan. 28 Joint Public Oversight roundtable hosted by the D.C. Council Judiciary and Public Safety and Health committees. The mayor’s office, the Department of Behavioral Health and the Metropolitan Police Department are all set to participate in the discussion.
The plan outlines seven measures, which call for support of resources for addiction prevention and recovery, increases in public health education and collaboration with law enforcement. 
Though the administration is seeking to increase joint efforts with law enforcement, the majority of efforts within the plan concentrate on the treatment of opioid addiction as a health issue instead of a legal one, according to Sean Barry, the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services’ communications director.
“The partnership with law enforcement is critical, but fundamentally, Mayor Bowser and her team approach this as a public health crisis,” Barry said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Measures in the LLDC plan will be funded by federal grants, including a $21 million State Opioid Response grant and a $21 million grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
Amid this new initiative, the D.C. government faces an audit by the federal government for previously failing to implement federally funded programs designed to combat the opioid crisis, according to The Washington Post. Federal officials will reassess the city’s plans for the $21 million grant as part of the audit, according to Jack Goldberg, SAMHSA’s financial director.
At this time, it is unclear whether the audit will impact funding for LLDC, though D.C. Councilmember Vincent Gray has expressed concern that the audit will jeopardize the status of the grant, according to The Washington Post. 
Critics have pointed out that aspects of LLDC are a continuation of previous government policies that have failed to prevent increases in deaths over the past year, according to The Washington Post. The Bowser administration said its plan is based off of the practical experience that has been gathered since it began tackling the problem of opioid-related deaths, according to a representative from Bowser’s office.
Bowser has previously opposed legislation that would require police officers to carry naloxone, a drug that counters opioid overdoses, citing redundancy and increased costs as D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services, which also respond to overdose calls, carry naloxone. Her position is being challenged by a new bill introduced by the D.C. Council which would require officers in Wards 5, 7 and 8 — areas most affected by the opioid issue — to carry the drug.
D.C. has one of the highest rates of opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States at 30 deaths per 100,000 persons. The opioid crisis is the worst public health crisis to affect the city since the HIV/AIDS epidemic after a 210 percent increase in drug overdoses from 2014 to 2017, according to The Washington Post. 
81 percent of people who overdosed from opioids between 2014 and 2017 were black. During the same three-year window, 80 percent of deaths occurred in people aged 40 to 69. 
These statistics differ from nationwide trends, as well as the national narrative that opioid deaths have been increasing mainly among young, white, suburban Americans. The plan aims to address the specific problems present in the community as opposed to targeting nationwide trends, according to Bowser.
“We know that the opioid epidemic in our city looks different than how the epidemic is talked about nationwide,” Bowser said in the Dec. 24 news release. “This plan was created in response to the specific needs of our community and focuses our resources on increasing awareness and prevention, enhancing treatment offerings and strengthening recovery supports.”
The LLDC program originated at a summit that convened in Oct. 2017, which led to the creation of seven opioid strategy groups. Leadership for these groups was finalized in April 2018. All OSGs meet quarterly, with the next summit planned for later this month.

New requirements banning businesses or organizations in Washington, D.C., from providing single-use plastic straws and stirrers when selling food or beverages took effect Jan. 1. 
The Department of Energy and Environment began reviewing businesses for compliance and issuing unofficial warnings at the start of the month. After July 1, businesses found providing plastic straws and stirrers will be sent a notification of their first violation. Subsequent violations will incur fines between $100 and $800.
The ban is part of the District’s long term goal to reduce the amount of landfill waste by 80 percent, according to Zachary Rybarczyk, an environmental protection specialist with the DOEE.
“We hope to take a small step towards achieving the District’s overall waste reduction goals, while also educating residents, businesses, and organizations about our reliance on single-use plastics and the growing number of alternatives available on the market,” Rybarczyk wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In compliance with the new regulations, Students of Georgetown, Inc., commonly known as The Corp, is set to replace one-use plastic straws with compostable plastic straws at its seven storefronts.
The organization began to work with suppliers to implement the change following the city’s announcement of the ban last year, according to Alex Gong (SFS ’20), CEO and president of The Corp.
The straw ban supplements the Corp’s ongoing efforts toward becoming more ecologically sustainable, which include only providing plastic lids to customers upon request at select locations and offering discounts to customers who use their own reusable containers, according to Gong. 
“Currently, all of our hot cups are compostable and our iced drink cups are recyclable,” Gong wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We’ve historically been ahead of the curve in using sustainable materials and are happy to hear that the D.C. government is requiring all businesses to adopt similar practices.”
Under the Sustainable D.C. Omnibus Amendment Act of 2014, District businesses and organizations are required to only use food service ware specified in the Mayor’s “List of Recyclables and Compostables.” In October, the Mayor’s List was updated to specifically exclude single-use plastic straws and stirrers from the list of allowable items. The new policy went into effect Jan. 1.
The updated regulation makes D.C. the second major U.S. city to pass a plastic straw ban after Seattle’s restriction went into effect last July.
The DOEE suggests businesses replace plastic straws and stirrers with straws made of materials such as paper or plant fiber. 
To offset the cost of replacing plastic straws with straws made of more expensive material, the department recommends that businesses only provide compliant straws to customers upon request. 
In its recommendation, the DOEE also suggests that businesses can offset expenses by passing some or all of the additional cost onto their customers.
Local businesses in the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area, including Farmers Fishers Bakers and Sweetgreen, had already chosen to eliminate their usage of plastic straws as part of the “Our Last Straw” initiative, a coalition of restaurants and businesses seeking to eliminate single-use plastic straws that launched in 2018.
The Farmers restaurants switched to paper straws in 2016 and added hay straws in 2018 after using single-use compostable drinking straws from 2008 to 2016, according to Julie Sharkey, director of marketing operations for Farmers Restaurant Group.
“Farmers Restaurant Group has always held sustainability and thoughtful sourcing at the forefront of our mission and goals,” Sharkey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The hospitality industry is one of the largest purveyors of single-use plastic straws, and so it was a natural next step to spearhead this cause.”

Georgetown University signed onto an Dec. 21 amicus brief in a lawsuit challenging a recent immigration policy change that tightens regulations on visas for international students studying in the United States.
Under the new policy, unlawful presence begins as soon as a violation of the visa occurs rather than after a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official or judge found a violation had occurred. Former visa holders who accrue more than 180 days of unlawful presence could be penalized with re-entry bans up to 10 years. 
This policy change negatively affects students and the institutions they attend, according to the amicus brief.
“America will become a less attractive destination for international students and scholars, thus making it more difficult for American institutions to continue attracting and recruiting the best international talent,” the brief reads.
Georgetown joined 64 other U.S. universities and one university system board in signing the brief, which was submitted in the case brought against Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen (SFS ’94). Guilford College, et al., v. Kirstjen Nielsen was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina on Oct. 23. 
Though not a party to the suit, Georgetown, in filing an amicus brief, is able offer its insight and express its strong interest in the matter. Other signatories of the brief include Princeton University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Duke University.
The policy change came after the DHS issued a Aug. 9 memorandum instructing the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to alter the way it calculates unlawful presence of exchange students and international visitors on F, J or M visas. F visas allow international students to pursue a degree from a U.S. university, while J visas allow professors, researchers and students to visit the United States on cultural exchange programs. M visa holders can simply enter the United States multiple times as long as the visa has not expired.
President Donald Trump’s administration requested on Jan. 10 that the case be dismissed on the grounds that the plaintiffs themselves have not suffered any injury from the policy change.
The visa policy change, however, not only harms international students, but also institutions of higher education by affecting the universities’ accessibility to students from abroad, according to the brief.
“The effectiveness of visa programs depends on their stable and orderly administration,” the brief read. “The new DHS Policy Memorandum regarding the calculation of unlawful presence, however, introduces significant and destructive uncertainty.”
University President John J. DeGioia affirmed the value that international students bring to the Georgetown community and the United States in a Jan 9. news release.
“International students and scholars are vital members of our campus communities and important contributors to our nation,” DeGioia said. “The talents, perspectives, insights and passion to serve our world that they bring our campus communities benefits our nation and contributes to the common good that we all share.”
At least 2,149 international students attend Georgetown on F-1 and J-1 visas, according to the  university. Over 3,000 international students are part of the Georgetown community, including those in optional practical training or in non-degree programs.
International students use their educations to benefit the domestic economy and are instrumental in increasing growth, the universities argue.  
“The benefits of international study extend far beyond the academy, however, and reach the wider society in the form of significant economic and technological developments,” the brief says.
This is not the university’s first challenge to the Trump administration’s immigration policy. In fall 2017, Georgetown filed an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court against Trump’s executive order that restricted travel from six predominantly Muslim countries. In defending the university’s position, DeGioia stressed the importance of international students and faculty who can bring invaluable experience and talent to the university.
“We are an institution that values the contributions of our international students, staff and faculty, and we are deeply committed to interreligious dialogue and providing a context in which members of all faith backgrounds are welcomed and encouraged to practice their faith,” DeGioia wrote in a letter to the Georgetown community Jan. 29, 2017.

Fr. Charles Currie, S.J., a former Georgetown University chemistry professor and special assistant to the university president, died Jan. 4 at 88 years old. Currie is remembered not only for his service to Georgetown, but for his fierce commitment to social justice. 
Currie’s death comes after a recent pulmonary illness, according to his brother, Fr. Rob Currie, S.J. The Georgetown Jesuit Community held a vigil at Wolfington Hall on Jan. 11, where speakers including University President John J. DeGioia, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rosemont College President Sharon Hirsh gathered to mourn Currie’s death.
The oldest brother among five siblings, Currie was born in Philadelphia in 1930 and entered the Society of Jesus in 1950. Two of his younger brothers would go on to do the same.
Currie started his career as a chemistry professor at Georgetown in 1966, three years after being ordained as a priest in 1963. Currie also worked closely with students in pushing for equal civil rights and opposing the Vietnam War, according to his brother Rob. 
Though Currie left Georgetown to serve as president of Xavier University from 1972 to 1982 and of Wheeling University from 1982 to 1985, he returned to the university in 1989. In his role as special assistant to the university president, he helped plan the university’s bicentennial celebration and response to the killing of six Jesuit priests and two women in El Salvador in 1989.
The slain Jesuits had been advocating for a peace accord in the El Salvadoran civil war between left-wing rebels and the U.S. military-backed government. Currie worked with Congressman Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) and his aide, current Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), in investigating the killings.
“Few individuals would have had the moral, spiritual, intellectual, practical and emotional range to go through coordinating the celebration to a complete immersion in the politics of Central America in a moment of tragedy,” DeGioia said at the vigil.
In addition to his work with the Jesuits in El Salvador, Currie also worked closely with people in poverty in Latin America. 
“His perspective was always dealing with those influential in society, but always from the position and the point of view of the victims of society,” Rob Currie said in an interview with The Hoya.
Currie heavily incorporated this empathy for the poor into his work in higher Jesuit education. 
“He provided a unique blend of how to have direct contact with the poor while also creating systems that are about change,” Fr. Gerard McGlone, S.J., who led the vigil, said in an interview with The Hoya. “It was like this dual sort of giftedness that we don’t see anymore, that ability to join two worlds in a common vision and mission.”
After finishing his one-year tenure as special assistant to the university, Currie went on to serve as the president of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, an organization that connects 28 Jesuit institutions of higher education, including Georgetown.
As president of the AJCU, Currie oversaw the creation of JesuitNET, an online network that provides Jesuit education outside of a traditional campus. Currie later expanded this initiative in his role as executive director of Jesuit Commons, which grants degrees from Jesuit institutions to refugees across the globe.
Currie used his position at the AJCU to strengthen ties between Jesuit education and social justice in the developing world.
In 1996, Currie led student demonstrations outside the Fort Benning, Ga., military institute, where protestors believed the Salvadoran military personnel who executed the Jesuits in 1989 were trained by the American military. This protest developed into the Ignatian Family Teach-In, an organization that annually trains an international group of over a thousand members of Jesuit education institutions to advance social justice. 
As president of AJCU, Currie also pushed for programs that bring college students in the United States to engage with the impoverished in El Salvador, Nicaragua and greater Latin America. 
Currie also advocated for the elevation of women in the Catholic faith, in furtherance of his commitment to the principles of social justice and equality, according to Hirsh.
“He kept returning to the issue of women and women in the church in his actions, in his writing, his life,” Hirsh said at the vigil, citing Currie’s contribution to the book “Jesuit and Feminist Education.” 
Currie also pushed for Linda LeMura’s appointment as president of Le Moyne College, where she became the first female lay president of a Jesuit university.
Currie’s influence in social justice has inspired those around him, giving him a reputation as “Charlie the do-er” for his focus on uplifting others, according to McGovern.
“He’s an example of being a man who believed that it’s not enough to talk the talk — you gotta walk the walk,” McGovern, who is going to El Salvador to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the killings, said in an interview with The Hoya. “Those of us who loved him and were inspired by him, we gotta change the world for the better.”

Chair of the SFS Board of Advisors Paul Pelosi (SFS ’62) and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi donated $1.6 million toward expanding the career development programming of the newly renamed and endowed Paul F. Pelosi Public Service Scholars Program. 
Formerly known as the Walsh Scholars Initiative, the Pelosi Scholars Program plans to double the number of participants it accepts to between 10 and 15 undergraduates per year, according to a Jan. 10 Georgetown University press release. The program seeks to aid students pursuing careers in public service through financial support for summer internships, mentorship and professional development. 
  This financial support also enables students to take civil service and nonprofit internships despite the fact that many of them are unpaid, Walsh School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman said.
“It has created an opportunity for students of all different backgrounds and financial means to confidently take public service internships and not worry how they’re going to get housing and food and pocket money,” Hellman said in an interview with The Hoya. “What students do in the summer has a very big impact on the kinds of career paths that they choose.” 
In addition to stipends for their internships, students have access to sessions in job training, professional development, networking and mentorship. The program also allows students to shadow Georgetown alumni working in the public sector to learn more about the field.
The Walsh Scholars Initiative was founded in 2015 by Megan Murday, the President of the School of Foreign Service Academic Council at the time. Noting that unpaid internships in the public sector might exclude students from pursuing careers in public service, Murday and the council devised the program to help students pursue public service internships without sacrificing financial stability.
With its new endowment, the Pelosi Scholars Program can not only provide more resources to its students, but can also expand to include up to 15 students for each admitted class.
Paul Pelosi had been interested in the Walsh Scholars Program as his tenure as chair came to a close, according to Hellman, due to the program’s lack of permanent funding.
“When we told him about the Walsh Scholars Program, and that what we really needed to do was endow the program so that it would become a permanent feature of the SFS landscape and expand the program, he was very excited because it fit with the spirit of his own service to the university and his family’s service to the country,” Hellman said.
Paul Pelosi has maintained a close relationship with the university after his graduation, holding the longest tenure as the Chair of the SFS Board of Advisors and having sent both his children to Georgetown.
Speaker Pelosi said the program provides students with an important connection to the international world.
“The mission of this program is to equip students with the professional experience, confidence and opportunity to address the most pressing international challenges of our time,” Nancy Pelosi said in a statement to Georgetown University. “Indeed, to advance Georgetown values, and make the world a better place!” 
This program compliments the mission of the SFS, Paul Pelosi said to Georgetown.
“This is so in our sweet spot to encourage young people who are interested in careers in public service. To the extent that we can facilitate that in a significant way is just really exciting to us,” Paul Pelosi said.
The program has been very popular among students, according to Hellman.
“One of the things that we heard from students was ‘we want more programs like this, we want to expand programs like this, because we want to create more opportunities to really enhance the commitment to service that was so fundamental to the founding of the school,’” Hellman said.

Wookjae Jung (SFS ’15) is one of 147 students worldwide to win the Schwarzman Scholarship, which provides recipients with full tuition to attend Tsinghua University in Beijing for a yearlong master’s degree in public policy, economics and business, or international studies.
Roughly 5 percent of this year’s 2,800 applicants received a scholarship, making it “one of the most selective postgraduate scholarships in the world,” according to a post on Georgetown’s website.
As past of the scholarship, Jung will complete classes in leadership, Chinese history and government at Tsinghua. Jung is excited to learn not only of China’s history spanning thousands of years but more about its evolving modern society, he wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“China is more of a civilization than a country. The history and diversity are something that I am excited to explore once I’m in Beijing,” Jung wrote. “I want to know what China is like today, and get to know the Chinese people and the society of our generation.”
Jung was a competitive candidate because he embodies qualities the Schwarzman Scholarship looks for in its candidates, according to Laura Perille, assistant director of the Georgetown Office of Fellowships, Awards and Resources. Specifically, Perille commended Jung for his leadership potential and ability to connect individuals from diverse backgrounds.
“Wookjae Jung stands out for that potential, having not only played a critical role in high-level government negotiations and ventures through his work with the Ministry of National Defense in South Korea but also created and managed the Salon Nomad Project, a social networking platform for artists, professionals, and businesses,” Perille wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Although the Schwarzman does not require university endorsement, GOFAR works closely with applicants from Georgetown to ensure they are competitive in the application process, according to Perille.
Jung majored in international political economy in the School of Foreign Service and later became a Korean Air Force officer following his graduation. Jung is the fourth Georgetown graduate to receive the scholarship since its inception in 2016. Former winners include Jose Luna (SFS ’15), Zachary Kay (SFS ’16) and Zezhou Cai (GRD ’18).
Jung intends to use his experiences from the scholarship to allow him to expand on his work with the Korean Air Force, he told Georgetown.
“I wish to continue doing that kind of work, presenting new solutions that will bring actors together towards an optimal social goal,” Jung said.
