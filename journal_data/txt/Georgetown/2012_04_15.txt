A laptop was stolen in a burglary at a Henle Village residence early Saturday morning, the Department of Public Safety reported.
According a public safety alert emailed to the campus community around 1:10 p.m. Sunday, a resident reported to DPS that he confronted an unknown male inside his apartment around 2:30 a.m. The suspect claimed to be looking for someone, and the student escorted him from the residence. Later, the student discovered that his roommate’s laptop was missing.
The suspect is described in the PSA as a six-foot tall black male wearing a red baseball cap, a black jacket and a black backpack.
No victims were harmed in the incident, and there was no sign of forced entry into the apartment.
The PSA did not indicate whether the Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the burglary.
