Fr. Schall’s, S.J., presence and contributions to our community for the past 52 years have been extraordinary. His passion for philosophy is contagious, and both his scholarship and deep caring for his students have helped to make our community and our world a better place. We are grateful for his impact — of inspiring generations of our students to be engaged, thoughtful, committed citizens and leaders — and we will miss him here on the Hilltop. He has our very best wishes in his retirement.

I first met Fr. James Schall, S.J., in April 2008 while visiting Georgetown as a junior in high school. Instead of watching Pope Benedict XVI drive by my hotel, I walked up to campus to sit in on Fr. Schall’s “Elements of Political Theory” class. Though I had a ticket to see the Holy Father later that week in New York, I chose to go see Fr. Schall over the Pope.
Admittedly I sat in on GOVT-117 because it was a government course and I knew I wanted to be a government major, in the sense that I had a passion for American electoral politics. I was perplexed when Fr.Schall spent 50 minutes talking about Plato, in what was supposed to be a class about politics. It would be almost three years before I formally enrolled in that same introductory course in political theory, wherein my life was changed.
It took until my fourth semester at Georgetown that I really began to get an education while still in college because it wasn’t until that time that I understood the importance of the life of the mind. Fr. Schall taught me that there’s more to life and more to a college education than what is on the resume. He taught me that the most important thing we can do is to seek after ultimate questions, to seek the highest things, and to do it all in the company of friends. Thanks to Fr. Schall I’m keeping my books and I’m no longer majoring in current events. Strauss says we’re lucky if we live at a time when even one great mind is alive. Not only have I lived during his time, I have been blessed to be his student.

On the advice of my high school philosophy teacher, I listed Fr. James Schall’s, S.J., “Elements of Political Theory” course as my top choice in my first semester here in 1993. To this day, I remain glad I did.
Fr. Schall introduced me to the Socratic method of teaching whereby he would pace through the room asking students questions, always returning to basic ones such as “when did Aristotle die?” In the back of that classroom, my future roommate and I became friends as we chuckled at people who couldn’t answer Fr.Schall’s questions. Of course, it wasn’t so funny when we didn’t know, which thankfully wasn’t very often. If nothing else, I gained my first lifetime college friend thanks to Fr. Schall and 322 B.C.
But, Fr. Schall also provided a deeper foundation for my education. At the heart of his teaching was his stress on the constant, lifelong pursuit of truth. In “TheRepublic,” Plato’s Socrates says that “in the knowable realm, the form of the good is the last thing to be seen, and it is reached only with difficulty,” a lesson I still carry in my mind. While I cannot say I read philosophy over and over as Fr. Schall does, I keep my copies from his class on the first row of my bookshelf and treasure the knowledge they contain.
Our text told us that “the aim of education is to turn the soul around by changing its desires.” Nineteen years later, I know Fr. Schall’s class laid the foundation for my education by teaching me to desire more in learning. No other professor has left such an impression on me; I know countless others agree. Fr. Schall epitomizes what one should want from a Georgetown education, and I am grateful that I could learn from him.

Fr. James Schall, S.J., is a wonderful Jesuit and good friend. He and I are both political scientists and from the California Province of the Jesuits. Although we might have different political views, that has never hurt our friendship or mutual respect. I have been proud of the many times he was chosen as best teacher of the year. At one such award ceremony he described his goal as a teacher — that the students after taking his course want to read more books. Ad multos annos.

It is difficult to choose just one of the personal interactions that I have shared with Fr. James Schall, S.J., as each one stands out in my mind as a significant moment where I saw the world in a different way, reflected on the higher things in life or had a conversation unlike any other. I first met Fr. Schall during the first semester my freshmen year in his “Elements of Political Theory” class. The encounter that stands out to me the most, however, exemplifies the care and consideration that Fr. Schall shows for all of his students.
As I sat in the basement of the Intercultural Center one morning very anxiously awaiting to be called into the classroom to complete a Spanish oral interview, I looked up to see Fr. Schall walking into the building. He greeted me with a, “Good Morning, Miss Schadler!” and with a smile, sat down on the bench next to me and proceeded to ask what I was doing there so early. After explaining my oral interview, he spoke with me of a book he was currently reading in Spanish about the higher topics in life, and after several minutes of intriguing conversation he gave me his best wishes and said goodbye, and I forgot about how nervous I had been prior to our conversation. He later asked me in class how it had gone, and remembered day after day to ask how the class was, knowing my apprehension toward the subject, and even encouraging me to speak with fluent students in our class.
During the final exam as he went around to each student thanking them for taking his class, we shared a moment of mutual gratitude, although I feel as if it is impossible to expresses my thanks for his compassion and words of wisdom. When I returned home for the winter break that year and spoke to a former teacher of mine, and a Georgetown alumna of ’92, about the semester, I mentioned my “Elements” class, and her eyes lit up as she said, “I can still hear Fr. Schall asking me what book of the Nicomachean Ethics talks about justice, and it has been 30 years.” Fr. Schall has been a light in the gateway toward asking the larger questions in life about happiness, virtues, justice and the like for generations of students, and I am honored to call myself his student.

In my professional life, I often meet people who do not know Fr. James Schall, S.J., but have read his books or columns. Usually, they have mistaken ideas about him as a classroom teacher. They envision him standing still at a podium, giving an uninterrupted lecture, or perhaps speaking entirely in aphorisms.
As everyone who has taken a class with Fr. Schall knows, nothing could be further from the reality. It is normal for him to pause in the midst of a profound discourse on Cicero’s On Old Age, or Yves Simon’s A General Theory of Authority, or any other great text of the Western tradition he teaches, and ask, “Miss Smith, how’s your mother in Long Island?” Or to quiz Mr. Jones on the last Notre Dame football game.
This seamless weaving of timeless ideas with very concrete discussions of small things in the here and now subtly underscores one of the truths that Fr. Schall endeavors to teach. Namely, that our daily lives are not separate from the things contained in Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, etc. This is perhaps the greatest lesson I learned in my young adult life, and I learned it from Fr. Schall.
In his 35 years at Georgetown, Fr. Schall has taught thousands of students. They flock to him because he is personally interested in them as souls, and because in his own life there is precious little daylight between his theory and his practice.
Pope Paul VI, about whom Fr. Schall has written extensively, put it well: “Modern man listens more willingly to witnesses than to teachers, and if he does listen to teachers, it is because they are witnesses.” Fr. Schall is an exemplary teacher, and his life is a witness to the truths he teaches.

Fr. James Schall’s, S.J., commitment to providing his students with an unparalleled learning experience is well documented, but his approachability and dedication to knowing his students personally are far underemphasized. Every day before class, Fr. Schall stands outside of his classroom in White Gravenor to hold casual conversation with early-arriving students, which I tried to be whenever possible while in his class. Some might be surprised to know that, in addition to his thorough knowledge of Plato’s works, Fr. Schall is equally comfortable in discussing football, baseball and many other such ordinary topics.
Although I certainly remember well the material covered and insights gained in class with Fr. Schall, the time my classmates and I spent talking with him before class was equally memorable as well. During his tenure here, Fr. Schall asked of us, his students, that we be “eminently teachable.” In return for our attempts to be as such, Fr. Schall gave to generations of Georgetown students unique concern for both our academic and personal growth, and for that, I am grateful, as are many who came before as well.

I was in my second semester as a political theory grad student in the government department here and feeling completely overwhelmed with coursework, TA responsibilities and life in general. One day as I was struggling to free a paper jam in the copier, Fr. James Schall, S.J. walked up and introduced himself.
“Stop by my office when you have a minute,” he said.
I do not have a minute! I thought. I’m behind on my reading, I’ve got papers to grade and this copier won’t let me finish this job! But despite all that, I found myself just a half an hour later seated in Fr. Schall’s office.
What followed was the beginning of a three year conversation that started out about Plato and wound its way into other philosophers, history, teaching, undergraduate education and life in general. We didn’t get together often, but when we did it was invariably illuminating for me. Fr. Schall is a paradigm of the educated individual; wise in all the ways that matter, but open-hearted and generous with his time and knowledge. His is one of the models of understanding that I often strive to emulate.

Fr. James Schall, S.J., did something for me that no other professor of Georgetown has — he moved my soul. The things I learned in Fr. Schall’s class extend far beyond the realm of teaching in an academic sense. He taught me how to love reading for its own sake, and what it truly means to learn something. These are lessons that I’m going to remember forever.

On a Friday in Dec. 2010 I made my way over to the Wolfington Hall to have dinner with Fr. James Schall, S.J. There he stood, looking sharper and stronger than ever in spite of a recently healed cancerous jawbone. Dinner seemed to fly by as we talked about everything from Chesterton and Chaucer to my summer travels to Bolivia, Fr. Schall’s cousins in Iowa and the upcoming semester, when he would become my teacher again.
Soon, there were only a few fellow Jesuits and staff lingering in the dining hall. Looking straight at me with his right eye — his “good eye” as he likes to call it — he asked me, “Miss Punchak, do you recall one of the psalms … it goes something like, “the years of our lives are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength, fourscore years, but they fade away so soon?”
I nodded silently.
“Do you ever wonder why we’ve only been given fourscore years and ten, as it is written? Or, perhaps more nowadays, I mean, Fr. Schall is an old man…but do you ever wonder why?”
It was something I had thought about fleetingly but often, though I had no answer for it.
Before I could say anything, he cut in, “Miss Punchak, we were given so little precisely because everything that we can achieve is possible and realizable in this time. I want you to know that.”
More than anyone I know, Fr. Schall taught me to think of life in terms of possibility, to regard my fellow beings with kindness and love and to approach the world with a sense of wonder, curiosity and gratitude. Thank you, Fr. Schall, for not only making a better student, but a fundamentally better person. Thank you for everything.
