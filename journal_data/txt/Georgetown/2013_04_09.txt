After years of giving back to the D.C. community through D.C. Reads, Craig Melcher (MSB ’13) and Evan Curdts (COL ’13) decided to turn their personal impact into a financial one.
Melcher and Curdts founded Working for the Kids, a nonprofit corporation that allows D.C. Reads tutors with work-study awards to donate part or all of their salary to a public charity supporting D.C. child literacy.
If each of the approximately 120 work-study tutors donates one hour of the average six hours per week that tutors typically work, Working for the Kids will fundraise close to $30,000 a semester.
“The importance of [Working for the Kids] as a whole is that it will essentially be doubling the impact of D.C. Reads,” Melcher said. “Not only are students able to actively affect these kids’ lives by tutoring and helping them learn, but it’s also having a financial impact on other organizations that are doing the same things.”
Melcher tutored with D.C. Reads during his freshman and sophomore years but decided to return when he found himself with more spare time in his senior spring. Since, in his last semester of college, he wanted to tutor on a purely volunteer basis but did not want his work-study salary to go to waste, he had the idea to found Working for the Kids.
“I didn’t want my motivation for doing D.C. Reads again to come from getting paid,” Melcher said.
Approximately 40 tutors expressed interest in donating part of their work-study salary to Working for the Kids when Melcher introduced the program March 13, but only seven have set up the direct deposit process necessary to transfer their donation to the Working for the Kids account so far. While the program appeals most directly to students with work-study awards, those who tutor with D.C. Reads without compensation are also welcome to donate.
“Fundraising development is an aspect we haven’t taken on as a program,” Curdts, a D.C. Reads coordinator, said. “It’s an opportunity to take on a deeper role and do more for the community and schools we work in.”
Depending on how much money is raised, Working for the Kids will donate to one or multiple charities.  The next step for the organization is to apply for 501c(3) nonprofit status, after which it will become a public charity, making donations tax deductible.
Though Working for the Kids is not directly affiliated with D.C. Reads, D.C. Reads Program DirectorNathanial Roloff has supported Melcher and Curdts as they have spearheaded the project. He said that this project will be especially helpful to smaller charities that are working toward the same goal of community development but have limited access to necessary resources.
“Most students ask themselves what they can do here, and what they can create here. I’m really impressed that Craig thought to himself, ‘What can I create outside of Georgetown, and how can I connect resources at a university to these larger projects that we all talk about wanting to support, especially those of us who actually see that struggle?’” Roloff said. “There is a place for students who engage in this work to be critical about the way that development in the city can work. I hope that students choose to get engaged, not just donate, but engage to help support some of the development that they would like to see outside of Georgetown.”
D.C. Reads Coordinator Allie Liotta (COL ’15) was one of the first tutors to donate to the program.
“We don’t get a lot of funding for D.C. Reads through [the Center for Social Justice],” Liotta said. “I think this project is a good way to demonstrate what we’re interested in, and what we want to see accomplished in the city in Wards 7 and 8. This is a way we can make our influence heard more effectively.”
Roloff said he hopes to see the project continue to grow in size and impact.
“Students at most universities in this city have expendable income and no specific way to think about ways to engage in that,” Roloff said. “In an ideal world this project would become the hub for students throughout the city that do engage in community work to be thinking about how they can make a contribution to growing the community development organizations that matter.”

Though the College Republicans at the University of Pennsylvania have declared support for same-sex marriage along with at least 50 Democratic and Republican student groups nationwide, the Georgetown University College Republicans remain silent on the issue.
“Same-sex marriage is an issue on which people of good will can and do disagree. This is true in the national political sphere, within the Georgetown community and within the Georgetown University College Republicans,” GUCR Chair Alex Cave (COL ’15) wrote in an email. “For this reason, it would be inappropriate for the Georgetown University College Republicans, as a group of diverse individuals of varying opinions, to take an organization stance on any side of this issue.”
The Supreme Court heard two cases at the end of last month that could dramatically alter state and national law on same-sex marriage, and the debate over this contentious issue has been amplified. Many commentators have identified a changing tide in public support for gay marriage.
GUCR Vice Chair Mallory Carr (COL ’15) agreed with the club’s statement of neutrality.
“Our position is to recruit members and to have a conversation about ideas — we want to inform young minds, not shape them,” Carr said. “To come out in opposition like that is controversial because it excludes some voices that won’t be heard. It cuts the debate off.”
However, according to GUCR board member Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16), GUCR has discussed gay marriage internally, especially under the leadership of former Chair Maggie Cleary (COL ’14).
“Last semester, Maggie, who whole-heartedly supported gay marriage, left a lasting imprint on the Republican brand here at Georgetown — she really turned the club around, made it relevant again and embraced gay marriage,” Rosenberger said.
Former GUCR board member Sam Dulik (SFS ’13) supported the pledge taken by students at Penn.
Dulik argued that the nature of political organizations is to express views on complex issues.
“I think one of the things that makes American politics, broadly, and the Republican Party, specifically, so great and so strong is that there’s such a diversity of opinion,” Dulik said. “I want to encourage and foster discussion and debates on this and other complex issues.”
Rosenberger personally agreed and commended the Penn College Republicans for their bravery.
“I think that politics is about the issues,” Rosenberger said. “Although you can have diversity of opinion, your group should take a stance. If you refuse to take a position, then there’s no point. I think it was very admirable for Penn and other Republican groups to do this to send a clear message.”
Overall, GUCR members attested to the diversity of opinion within the organization, but Dulik added that, from his experience, he has seen a large base of support for same-sex marriage from within the club.
“My belief, and what I’ve observed, not only in Georgetown in general but also specific to College Republicans, is overwhelming support for marriage equality from young Republicans,” Dulik said. “I think you see it in groups around the country — people in their teens, twenties, thirties. … They’re saying, ‘You know what, we’re done with it — we’re on board.’”
Rosenberger agreed, citing the national progress the party has shown in recent years.
“We’ve already gone from the party going from vehemently saying no to same-sex marriage to this spineless equivocating,” Rosenberger said. “It’s a sign that we’re moving in the right direction. I think in a few years everything will totally change.”
However, he acknowledged that Georgetown faces unique challenges because of its identity as a Catholic university.
“There’s going to be some hiccups because we’re a Catholic university, and we’re going to have a couple issues where we don’t agree on some issues,” Rosenberger said.
The same challenges have affected the Georgetown University College Democrats’ response. Club President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said that while his organization’s membership holds a range of views, a vast majority of his members agree that same-sex marriage should be legal. Though Tezel signed the agreement representing the relative consensus of GUCD in favor of  same-sex marriage, he stressed that GUCD, as a recipient of Student Activities Commission funding, cannot announce an official platform on positions in order to conform with university administration policies.
“The one thing we are careful of is making sure we aren’t advocating for particular pieces of legislation, especially using club resources to do so because that constitutes a direct violation of our rules,” he said.
For his part, Dulik expressed disappointment that the argument about same-sex marriage is still going on.
“There’s too much policy bandwidth dedicated to this that should be devoted to other issues. There are people who are so animated about this. I have to tell you — for people out there who are spending every equal hour making sure people don’t get this right — get a hobby,” Dulik said. “It’s important, but it should be an afterthought — of course private citizens should be able to get married, to enter basically a contract, albeit formed with love, with each other.”

Resistance by the Old Georgetown Board may delay the target August opening date for the proposed 7-Eleven store at 1344 Wisconsin Ave. NW.
In an April 4 meeting, the OGB voted down the proposal for the new convenience store citing multiple concerns, the foremost of which was the obstruction of many of the store’s windows.
“Virtually every window facing the street is blocked,” Thomas Luebke, an OGB spokesperson, said. “There was very little sense of transparency. That was the number one issue.”
OGB asked 7-Eleven to reconfigure the interior arrangement of the store as well as the main entrance to increase the number of unobstructed windows.
Luebke said that the store’s prominent location in Georgetown made the board especially sensitive toaesthetics.
“This is pretty much at the heart of the commercial district,” he said. “It’s difficult to make these historic buildings work for a modern convenience store.”
A 7-Eleven was previously housed at 1600 Wisconsin Ave. NW, but the store closed down several years ago and was later replaced by Edible Arrangements.
The OGB meeting was not the first time the proposed convenience store chain met resistance from local residents.
At an April 1 ANC 2E meeting, Commissioner Bill Starrels described aspects of the 7-Eleven building proposal as “trashy.”
Architect Robert Bell, whose firm is located on 3218 O St. NW, expressed concern about the types of customers that the store would attract.
ANC 2E Commissioner Tom Birch told the hoya that he was not opposed to the 7-Eleven, provided that the store’s design did not attract too much attention.
“It should have a very low profile and fit in comfortably with the commercial aspect of Wisconsin Avenue,” Birch said. “I think the people who own the building have decided [that] this is the tenant they want to sell it to, so we’ll make the best of it.”
7-Eleven will revise its proposed interior plans and resubmit them to the OGB.
“I have no reason to think [that] it won’t go forward, but it will continue [to be] reviewed,” Birch said. “I think [that] it will be a few months before reviews become final and 7-Eleven gets the building permits.”
Representatives of 7-Eleven had not responded to requests for comment by press time.

In the wake of highly publicized rape cases in Steubenville, Ohio, and New Delhi, Take Back the Night is holding its annual sexual assault week to raise awareness of the problem on campus.
The series of events, titled “Sexual Assault Is a Hoya Issue,” aims to address various student perspectives on sexual assault. Events include a screening of “The Invisible War,” a documentary about sexual assault in the military, and a panel discussion with the editors of Feministing, a feminist blog.
According to coordinator Kat Kelley (NHS ’14), the theme was chosen to represent the reality that sexual violence transcends gender, race or ethnic barriers.
“Sexual assault happens within all communities,” Kelley said. “But in a lot of mainstream discourse, it’s very much so [portrayed as] a white woman’s issue.”
Coordinator Deanna Arthur (SFS ’14) saw the theme as a way to unify the campus community against sexual assault.
“Even though Hoyas have different points of view on a lot of issues, we can all agree that sexual assault is something we can fight against,” Arthur wrote in an email.
The coordinators said that the event series, which comes on the heels of the Steubenville rape case (in which the media came under fire for giving undue sympathy to the perpetrators), is particularly timely.
“The week that the Steubenville trial occurred, there was so much talk about how poorly the media portrayed the trial,” Kelley said. “So many people came to me; so many people who normally don’t talk or think about sexual assault came to me and [said], ‘This is upsetting. This is not OK. I don’t know how to deal with this.’”
Arthur added that it was important for students to be aware that large cases such as Steubenvillerepresent a fraction of the many sexual assault cases each year.
“One thing that was really notable about the Steubenville case was the really inspiring amount of outrage I saw from Hoyas on social media,” Arthur wrote. “Hopefully that event will stay in people’s consciousness. … People will realize that the Steubenville case is just one of many. Most of these stories are not so heavily publicized, and even more of them don’t even go reported, don’t go to trial and don’t end in a conviction.”
According to coordinator Nora West (SFS ’15), Take Back the Night contacted every HoyaLink-registered campus group and received tremendous response from groups that pledged their support for sexual assault awareness. Participants included some unexpected groups, such as Georgetown Gaming.
Students of Georgetown, Inc. Outreach Service Committee, H*yas For Choice and the Georgetown University Student Association will also co-sponsor events.
Arthur said that she expected that Wednesday evening’s “It Happens Here,” a reading of anonymous stories from sexual assault survivors, bystanders or friends of victims, would have the largest impact on attendees.
“In terms of rape culture at Georgetown I think the issue obviously isn’t that people don’t think it’s an important issue; they see it as something big, scary, foreign and not something that happens at Georgetown,” Arthur wrote. “Hopefully, this event, along with the media campaign, will start to get people thinking about some of the difficult truths of sexual assault.”
The week will culminate in Friday’s final event, which will ask students to pledge to work against sexual assault. In particular, participants will pledge to ask for consent, to support survivors and to continue discussing sexual assault.
Although the week focuses on the shocking and frightening realities of sexual assault, the coordinators said that they hoped that people would leave with an optimistic and proactive outlook.
“It can get easy to become depressed,” West said. “Our real goal is to try to make it positive and empowering.”

Boston College’s crackdown on campus condom distribution has renewed questions among Catholic schools regarding contraception policy.
Administrators at Boston College, a Jesuit institution, threatened last month to discipline the student group Boston College Students for Sexual Health, which organizes condom distribution to students. Traditionally, BCSSH had limited condom distribution to off-campus locations but recently expanded that service to dormitories. BC administrators sent letters to the group asking it to cease on-campus distribution.
The warning has reintroduced concerns about the rights of student groups on college campuses, drawing national attention from organizations such the American Civil Liberties Union and university groups around the country.
“As a private Jesuit university, our code of conduct requires students to respect our Catholic values,” Boston College Spokesman Jack Dunn wrote in an email.
According to The Boston Globe, more than half a dozen Catholic universities prohibit the distribution of contraception on campus, and said they would discipline student organizations that refused to comply with university requests not to hand out condoms.
Georgetown was among those colleges that acknowledged the right of Catholic institutions to prohibit condom distribution in university spaces in order to maintain their Catholic identity.
The university’s Student Health Center follows the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, which prohibits Catholic institutions from supporting contraceptives.
A unique aspect of Georgetown’s birth control policy, however, is the university’s exception for free speech zones.
“Our policy would allow students who are acting in unofficial ways, meaning they are not speaking [or] acting on behalf of the university or a university funded organization, to distribute condoms in this free speech zone,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh wrote in an email.
This provision allows groups such as H*yas for Choice, which receives no money from the university, to distribute condoms in free speech zones including Red Square without fear of administrative backlash.
“We have never faced direct threats or anything that would make us feel uncomfortable from the university,” H*yas for Choice Co-Events Coordinator, Laura Narefsky (COL ’14), said. “They have turned a pleasant blind eye to us.”
Narefsky said that she supports BCSSH’s distribution of condoms on campus and accused the BC administration of violating student rights.
Some students, however, support Boston College’s defense of its Catholic identity.
“These students came to a Catholic university and are now asking it to change its policy. That’s not correct considering the resources available off-campus in the [local] area,” Right to Life Board Member Kelly Thomas (SFS ’15) said.

The National Science Foundation will limit grants for political science research to those dealing with national security and economic policy, a move that has some faculty and administration at Georgetown concerned.
President Obama signed a bill containing the amendment, which was added by Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), on March 26 as part of the effort to find a solution to the series of government cutbacks known as the sequester and to keep the federal government from shutting down.
Originally, Coburn intended to completely remove the NSF’s political science funding and cut other resources in order to reallocate $10 million to the National Cancer Institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. The cuts would only be in effect until the end of the fiscal year on September 30, and the criteria would only apply to new grants.
Although Georgetown receives less money from the NSF than it does from the NIH, Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations, said that the cuts are still symbolically significant for the university and for those in higher education.
“There are faculty members … who receive National Science Foundation money and it is very important to their activities, so we certainly want to maintain both the maximum available pool of money and minimum restrictions,” Fleming said. “All of us in the academic world find this limitation on the use of National Science Foundation money on certain types of research very troubling.”
In particular, some say that Coburn’s amendment could lead to further spending reductions in other areas of study.
“Today it was political science that got in the crosshairs for somewhat idiosyncratic reasons, but tomorrow it could be certain kinds of economics research,” Michael Bailey, chair of the government department, said. “Taking one senator’s beef with one academic enterprise, it seems kind of a dangerous precedent to whittle away at the autonomy of these academic enterprises to pursue the things that they think are interesting.”
Bailey noted the irony in cutting political science funding amid public concern about governance.
“People are worried about the political system. Left, right and center, you name it, someone’s concerned that the way we make decisions — the way democracy makes decisions — is flawed,” Bailey said. “Everyone thinks there’s huge problems with it, so it seems like not a good time to stop caring about it.”
According to Bailey, no one in the government department currently has an NSF grant, but the agency plays an important role in creating the data infrastructure and empirical work necessary for political science research. However, he noted that the current economic climate has created a challenging environment for academics.
“Certainly there’s a lot of people in Congress who just want to pare back on everything the government does and that would include research funding,” Bailey said. “But if the government doesn’t have the money, it has to stop spending, and these are the kind of places where they have to stop spending.”
Fleming agreed, saying that even though the grant restrictions would reduce research, the situation could have been worse.
“Even though this restriction, this limitation that was put into effect, is troubling, it is less troubling than the money just disappearing completely to fund research,” Fleming said.
However, the university may contend with further cuts when Obama’s budget proposal is released this Wednesday. Fleming said that the discretionary spending portion of the budget, which funds everything from research to road construction, will be something the university will monitor closely.
“I remember once somebody said that legislating is like sausage-making. You don’t like watching the process,” Fleming said. “There is seldom a piece of legislation that comes up that doesn’t have pluses and minuses, and at the end of the day, you have to decide whether the pluses outweigh the minuses.”

On April 2, President Barack Obama formally announced an initiative designed to help researchers better investigate the complex structures and functions of the brain at the White House, a move that could have immediate implications for research initiatives at Georgetown.
The $100 million Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative is the government’s largest spending project since the $3.8 billion Human Genome Project, which began in 1990 and achieved its goal of sequencing the entire human gene by 2003.
But according to Howard Federoff, executive vice president for health sciences and executive dean of the Georgetown University School of Medicine, theincreased funding associated with the BRAIN Initiative will not be enough to significantly counteract the sequester, across-the-board federal funding cuts.
“I think the sequester was, unfortunately, politics at its worst. It was not strategic, it was not thinking about the future of the nation and it was a failure of a bipartisan effort to come together and really do something that was in the interest of us as a society,” Federoff said. “The sequester will have a definable and demonstrative impact on science and funding, as it will curtail funding that has already become extremely competitive, even more than it was historically.”
Federoff added that he is even more worried about the long-term impact on the scientific community.
“It puts us at risk of losing a whole generation of scientists and clinician-scientists,” Federoff said. “The sequester will have been one of the worst things that will have ever been done to science, assuming that it isn’t rectified. … The BRAIN Initiative is a small and wonderful jewel, but I think it’s ultimately inadequate to erase a decade of what has been damaging policy toward science.”
Nonetheless, Federoff expressed optimism about the benefits of the BRAIN Initiative to Georgetown, a school with a strong commitment to neuroscience research, most of which is anchored in the Georgetown University Medical Center. GUMC has become competitively positioned to receive grants in neuroscience in the last few years, according to Federoff.
Roughly a quarter of researchers who are investigating the functional imaging of the brain at the molecular level could potentially qualify for funding from the BRAIN Initiative, Federoff said.
“The probability of success [fully receiving funding] can change dramatically based on who the competition is,” Federoff said. “But the bottom line is, although we don’t know what the numbers will look like, the folks at Georgetown are well-prepared.”
Federoff indicated that much of that success was due to the 2012 creation of the Center for Brain Plasticity and Recovery in collaboration with MedStar National Rehabilitation Network. The center focuses on the ways in which the brain learns and develops and how those processes might be helpful in treating stroke, traumatic injury, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and a number of other brain-related ailments.
Elissa Newport, a psychologist and neurologist who is director of the CBPR, added that no specific details have been released about what the initiative will fund.
“We all hope for a general increase in funding for biomedical research and for research on the brain in particular,” she wrote in an email. “Our ability to speak and listen, our memories, our ability to learn — these are at the heart of what makes us who we are, and all can be lost forever from the diseases that are increasing so rapidly across the nation.”
Federoff said that federal funding was a crucial part of the research process for the CBPR, as well as for individual researchers.
“Georgetown is a soft-money environment, which means that investigators need to secure outside funding before they can go ahead with their projects,” Federoff said. “Given where we are as a university and as a country, I think this issue of extramural funding couldn’t be more important … than it is at Georgetown.”
According to an online database of National Institutes of Health grants, Georgetown received approximately $51 million from the institutes in fiscal year 2012, but that figure has been in a downward trend since the university had about $69.4 million in NIH funding in fiscal year 2010. The vast majority of the individual grants are small, totaling between $100,000 and $400,000.
But the NIH has limited the number and amount of grants awarded due to the sequester, under which its budget will be reduced by over $1 billion. The NIH’s budget this year has been cut 10 percent compared to last year’s budget.
Federoff said that researchers will soon feel the effects of the cuts. The acceptance rate for successful grant applications, which are already extremely competitive at around 10 percent, will go down.
“What happens is, when they designate projects like this, it gets more competitive,” Federoff said. “We’re in a period [during which] people are trying to do whatever is necessary to maintain their laboratories.”

After six senators left the GUSA senate to join the GUSA executive cabinet and staff March 25, six new senators were elected to the open seats Friday and sworn into office Sunday.
The newly elected senators will hold their positions for the remainder of the academic year. It is common for a significant number of senators leave their positions to join the Georgetown University Student Association executive at this time of year.
“We picked our cabinet from the senate and we knew they would have to resign. It wasn’t a factor in our decision but it was something [that] we were aware of,” GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said.
Tisa worked closely with Senate Speaker George Spyropoulos (COL ’14) to ease the transition period.
“We made sure [that] we had elections as soon as we could. We made sure [that] the executive staff met with senators and that elections were ready to go,” Tisa said. “The expectation is that even though people transition from the senate to the exec, everyone is doing something.”
According to Tisa, the senate waited to confirm its new senators before introducing a bill to add sexual assault education to New Student Orientation.
“We did this on Sunday in particular because we wanted new senators to be involved in the discussion,” Tisa said. “Generally the senate is a consensus body — something is usually widely supported or not at all.”
Though the newly elected senators will only serve until the end of April, they say they still plan to be active during their time in the GUSA senate.According to Spyropoulos, the newly elected senators were unusually active at their first senate meeting.
‘The senators participated in the debate, which new senators never do,” Spyropoulos said.
He acknowledged, however, that the new senators will play a different role in the senate due to the limited timeframe of their tenure.
Nico Dona Dalle Rose (SFS ’15), who replaced new Chief of Staff Zach Singer (SFS ’15) as LXRsenator, said that GUSA should expand communication with the public in the remaining weeks of the semester.
“It is imperative for the administration to reform and simplify the way in which it communicates with the student body,” Rose said. “By restructuring the system of online platforms — from work orders to the Georgetown homepage —current and prospective students will have an easier time and will make the best of Georgetown’s resources.”
Mary Beth Brosnihan (SFS ’13) replaced former Chair of Finance and Appropriations Sheila Walsh (COL ’14) as townhouse senator.
As a senior and the only female elected in Friday’s special elections, Brosnihan hopes to push for change during her final month on the Hilltop.
“I have plans to continue drafting a proposal for [Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle] buses on weekends … working toward further party reform, rat eradication and expedited housing repair. It’s ambitious but I hope to see some tangible results before graduating,” Brosnihan said.
Spyropoulos pointed to the unique position of seniors elected to GUSA in their final semester on campus.
“I’m glad to see [that] people who have no future GUSA aspirations … want to join student government. It’s important to have seniors in the senate — they have a different perspective,”Spyropoulos said.
Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15) replaced Tisa as Village A senator. Danish Zaidi (COL ’13), who took a hiatus from the GUSA senate after serving in 2011, replaced former senator at-large and GUSApresidential candidate Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson (SFS ’14), who resigned to become director of group outreach in Tisa’s cabinet.Liam Detwiler (COL ’15) will serve as Southwest Quad senator, replacing Director of Special Initiatives Nolan DiConti (COL ’15). Josh Shinbrot (COL ’16) will take over as Freshman South senator for Deputy Chief of Staff Chandini Jha (COL ’16).

For most students, “leave of absence” is euphemistic for something serious. Often prompted by medical emergencies or academic stress, they are seen to disrupt the flow of academic progress and leave conspicuous holes in transcripts.
But for some, leaves of absence provide the chance to pursue opportunities beyond the bounds of the Hilltop and the constraints of traditional study abroad offerings.
While the Office of International Programs provides options to study on five continents, its programs do not necessarily appeal to students seeking to step out from the university’s jurisdiction. Georgetown also does not offer programs in countries with State Department travel advisory warnings.
Gabe Pincus (SFS ’14) took a leave of absence this fall to spend the semester in Egypt and savored the lack of university-imposed structure during his time away.
“I enjoyed having the freedom and not being restricted by really anything,” he said. “I was living right next to TahrirSquare, which is where all the action is happening. This wouldn’t be possible if I was studying abroad through Georgetown or enrolled in any formal program.”
Pincus said that students are often reluctant to go abroad through programs that are not university-sponsored.
“People underestimate their capabilities and there’s a lot to be gained from figuring things out yourself as opposed to having them organized for you,” he said.
But he said that his status as an independent student and researcher rather than as a foreign exchange student made for a more authentic Egyptian experience.
“If you’re going to be officially affiliated with the university or with any program, [it doesn’t] want [its] name on something if something bad happens. It’s bad publicity for the university,” Pincus said.
Sam Dulik (SFS ’13) took a leave of absence in fall 2011 to study at the University of the Andes in Bogota, Colombia — a country to which the State Department discourages travelling.
“Colombia has a State Department travel warning against it that is not based in reality. I had an incredibly safe experience,” said Dulik, who is writing his senior honors thesis on the Colombian government’s negotiations with major rebel groups and is relying heavily on his experience in the country. “No one touched a hair on my head. I was never unsafe. I was never threatened.”
For students pursuing work experience rather than travel, the promise of independence comes with responsibility.
Josh Zeitlin (COL ’13) stayed in the U.S. during his leave of absence last fall to work on President Obama’s re-election campaign in Charlotte, N.C. It was his second leave of absence after taking time off in fall 2010 to work for a Tennessee statehouse campaign and his third semester away from Georgetown including his semester abroad in Edinburgh in fall 2011.
While Zeitlin began his time with Obama for America during the summer as a border state fellow, he was promoted to field organizer when he decided to stay through November.
“There are important opportunities that come from seeing something like a campaign all the way through. The outcome of the campaign was too important to me and to so many other people for me to consider not continuing through the fall semester,” Zeitlin said.
Sebastian Silva (SFS ’15) also took a leave of absence to work for the Obama campaign last fall. He decided to leave Georgetown for the semester after being offered a job working for the campaign in New Mexico.
“I don’t know when I would have another opportunity to go and work on a campaign for seven months,” Silva said.
Cole Lautermilch (SFS ’14), who stayed closer to Georgetown as an intern in a public defender’s office in D.C. as an investigator for the parole commission, said that he was able to see a different side of the District during his leave of absence.
“I think I came back with a better sense of what I wanted to do after I graduated and what I wanted to do with my time here,” he said.
Along with excitement and boundless possibilities, those who go abroad without university support often face a unique set of challenges.
Rather than arriving to a welcoming host family or the relatively familiar scene of a college dormitory,Dulik landed in Colombia without housing or any guidance as to where to find it.
“I got a hotel for three nights. I had zero idea where I was going to be staying or living after that,” he said. “I literally got off the plane and purchased a copy of El Tiempo, the Bogotá newspaper, and just starting poring through classifieds.”
Leaves of absence also raise questions on college transcripts and earn students no credit, concerns that Dulik was quick to dismiss.
“I am very cognizant of the fact [that] on my transcript it says, ‘From June 2011 to the beginning of January 2012 Sam Dulik was on a leave of absence,’ but when presenting [that experience] on a job interview it wasn’t like I was just chilling. I was doing an academic experience to complement my Georgetown curriculum,” Dulik said. “You don’t get any recognition of courses you took but it was important to me to generate this study abroad experience into my broader trajectory.”
Zeitlin agreed that his leave of absence was worth any negative stigma.
“I can’t imagine that taking time off to do something you are passionate about will hurt in the job search, and if it does that’s probably not an employer I want to work for,”Zeitlin said.
Those who have taken leaves of absence were also quick to point out that the cost of going abroad independently is far less than that of studying abroad through Georgetown.
Pincus said that his entire trip to Egypt cost about $9,000, whereas if he had gone on a Georgetown study abroad program, he would have had to pay full tuition.
“Essentially I’ve saved enough money to, basically, if I want to after I graduate, go back to Egypt and not even have a job,” he said.
Dulik was able to use the money he saved during his leave of absence to travel extensively in Latin America.
“I had a massively increased amount of autonomy to chart my own course,” he said.
For his part, Zeitlin will be graduating a semester late because of his two semesters away from the Hilltop, a reality that causes him little concern.
“I looked at it as I’m going to graduate when I’m going to graduate and that these were really great opportunities,”Zeitlin said.
