Nicki Gray (NHS ’20) leads by a 6.6 point margin for Georgetown University Student Association president, according to a door-to-door poll of 615 students conducted by The Hoya on Wednesday evening. The election is set for Friday, Feb. 8.
Gray was the first preference of 34.7 percent of the 357 self-identified likely voters. Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) were close behind at 28.1 percent. Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) and Roya Wolfe (SFS ’21) came in third with 20 percent of the vote, while Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) and John Dolan (MSB ’20) came in fourth with 9.7 percent. Respondents who were undecided or wrote in candidates made up 7.5 percent of the total.
The poll’s narrow margin suggests no candidate will receive a majority of votes in the first round of voting. If no ticket receives an outright majority in the first round, an instant runoff is conducted between the top performing tickets, per GUSA’s single transferable vote system. In this ranked choice system, the ticket with the lowest vote total is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the remaining candidates based on voters’ indicated second preferences until one ticket receives a majority.
2 percent of respondents rated their current trust in GUSA as strong. 23.9 percent of students listed their trust in GUSA as medium, and 38.9 percent of respondents listed their trust in GUSA as weak.  35 percent said they were indifferent/unsure.
GUSA is somewhat relevant, according to 54 percent of respondents. 40.3 percent said GUSA is not at all relevant, and 5.7 responded it was very relevant.
A plurality of respondents, 22.1 percent, identified sexual assault policy as the most relevant issue in this election, while 18.2 percent classified affordability as the most important. Diversity and inclusivity were the most relevant issues to 14.3 percent of respondents.
Three of the four tickets have specific policies addressing sexual assault in their campaign platforms. Zuccala and Dolan’s platform does not reference any sexual assault policy or Title IX changes.
Among the students who ranked sexual assault policy as the most relevant issue in this campaign season, 33.1 percent indicated they would rank Gray first, and 25.7 percent expressed primary preference for Francis. 13.2 percent selected Nemazi as their first choice and 5.2 percent said they would rank Zuccala first.
The survey also asked about student opinions on the upcoming GU272 referendum. Slated for April on the same ballot as GUSA senate elections, the vote will give students the option to support or reject the creation of a semesterly reconciliation fee that would go toward a fund to benefit descendants of the 272 enslaved individuals sold by the Maryland Society of Jesus in 1838 to financially sustain Georgetown. 
34.8 percent of respondents said that they approved of the fee, 34.7 percent said they were indifferent or unsure, 16.3 percent said they do not support the fee and 13.4 percent said they did not plan to vote.
Among female-identifying respondents, Gray’s margin over Francis remained almost the same, though her support increased overall to 37.4 percent, while Francis’ went up to 31 percent. Nemazi dropped marginally to 19.3 percent, while Zuccala’s support decreased to 5.9 percent.
Of all respondents, 17.4 percent correctly identified Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) as the current GUSA president.
Of self-identified likely voters who accurately identified Martinez as current GUSA president, 51.4 percent said they were indifferent or unsure of the performance of the current GUSA administration. 42.1 percent said they approved of the current administration, while 6.5 percent said they disapprove of the current administration.
Students can vote in Friday’s executive election online using HoyaLink or at polling stations set up by the GUSA Election Commission in either the Leavey Center or Red Square.
Methodology:
The Hoya conducted a campuswide, door-to-door poll of Georgetown students Wednesday night in advance of the Georgetown University Student Association executive election Feb. 8.
Though the polling method is not infallible, it was designed to reduce sample bias and provide transparency for demographics.
More than 30 Hoya staff members administered the anonymous survey Wednesday evening in campus dormitories, apartment buildings and townhouses. Polling began at 7 p.m. and was completed by 9 p.m. The schedule and locations for polling were not announced beforehand.
A total of 615 Georgetown students completed the survey, which asked students about their views on the current election, including their vote choice, GUSA’s relevance, and the performance of the current GUSA executives; a series of demographic questions; a question gauging opinions on the upcoming GU272 referendum; a question asking respondents to identify the current GUSA president; and a question to gauge the main issues students want their next GUSA executives to address. Respondents were also asked whether they planned to vote in Friday’s election, narrowing the results of some poll questions to a set of 357 likely voters.
These measures limited readership bias, prevented respondents from being polled twice and sought to present a sample representative of the student body. However, as was the case in previous years, respondents to the poll were mostly underclassmen, likely because of the relative inaccessibility of junior and senior housing.

The United States must engage more with the global community to rebuild weakening alliances with regions such as Europe and Asia, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at an event in Gaston Hall on Wednesday.
Throughout her speech, Clinton said that President Donald Trump’s administration’s decision to backtrack on previous deals and negotiations has strained relationships with other countries, putting the U.S. reputation at risk.
“At some point, as another nation, you think, ‘Can we trust them?’ It’s not just administration to administration, it’s the United States of America, it’s our government. It’s about giving our word, it’s about following through,” Clinton said. “I think we have to be smarter about how we sustain our involvements and commitments going forward.”
Clinton’s speech was a part of the “Future of Diplomacy” symposium hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service at the McCourt School of Public Policy and the School of Foreign Service as a part of the Lloyd George Centennial Lectures, which began February 2018 to celebrate the upcoming SFS centennial anniversary. Clinton’s keynote was moderated by Bill Burns, former U.S. ambassador to Russia and U.S. deputy secretary of state.
Clinton’s keynote marks her third return to Georgetown since she lost her bid for the 2016 presidential election. In her 2017 and 2018 appearances, Clinton presented the annual Hillary Rodham Clinton Awards for Advancing Women in Peace and Security, which honor the peace-building work and empowerment efforts of recipients.
During a time when there is a lack of satisfaction with both the U.S. government and the governments of numerous European countries, there is a strong need for alliances between the two regions, Clinton said.
“Democracy is going through some growing pains. We are going through some growing pains, and so are the Europeans,” Clinton said. “When that happens we need our friends. We need people who we have worked with and counted on, and I think the division that is being unfortunately driven between the United States and Europe is going to haunt us.”
Trump threatened that the United States would withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance of 29 countries in North America and Europe, if allies resisted his demands for additional military spending at the NATO summit meeting last July. Over the course of 2018, Trump told senior administration officials multiple times that he wanted to withdraw from the alliance, according to The New York Times.
Clinton warned against the Trump administration’s rhetoric on NATO, which puts the longstanding alliance between the United States and Europe at risk.
“When you look at what is happening in Europe, it should be a great concern to any American,” Clinton said. “The fact that our current administration is almost egging on the breakup of NATO and to be in a hostile relationship with people who share a lot of our values who we have gone through a lot with, strikes me as counterproductive, and as I said, essentially dangerous.”
The United States is not only neglecting its European allies, but is also allowing its allies in Asia and the developing world to falter, according to Clinton. 
For the United States to repair weakening relationships in Asia, it must refocus attention to restore balance in a way that includes long-term U.S. engagement, according to Clinton.
“We are not doing everything we should to have this kind of balance that I think we need,” Clinton said. “We talked about pivoting to Asia, to rebalance, but all of this means that you got to stay engaged for the long run, not just sporadically.”
A lack of U.S. involvement across Asia, Latin America and Africa has allowed China to become a frontrunner in influencing these regions, Clinton said.
“We are losing the influence contest to China,” Clinton said. “They are engaged in an enormous amount of cultural diplomacy, of funding projects in Latin America, in Africa and elsewhere, and we are not competing.”
Clinton specifically noted that Beijing’s “Belt and Road Initiative” is enjoying a growing influence in global politics. Also known as “One Belt, One Road,” the initiative is a strategy by the Chinese government to develop infrastructure and investments across four continents, linking China to the nations of Southeast Asia, the Gulf countries and North Africa.
Maintaining developmental and financial aid in Central American countries could not only improve diplomatic ties with countries such as Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, but also help decrease the effects of drug trafficking in the region, Clinton said.
“If we spent even a relatively minor amount of money of the federal government’s budget in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, dealing with some of their problems and working against corruption, then all of this talk about poor, desperate people fleeing gang violence and drug traffickers would change into a different conversation,” Clinton said.
The Trump administration pushed to end a humanitarian program that was enacted in 2001 following the devastating earthquakes in El Salvador and allowed Salvadorans to live and work legally in the United States. However, an injunction from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in Oct. 2018 blocked the Department of Homeland Security from implementing and enforcing Trump’s plan. 
Clinton remains optimistic, however, that young people who engage in careers in public service can both help shape the future and reassert the importance of supporting diplomacy. 
“There’s a lot of hard work that has to be done, but there’s also a lot of room for imagination,” Clinton said. “It’s one of the most exciting times to be looking at a career in public service. I would hope that what we’ve done today will lead to an even longer conversation so that even more students will understand the importance of supporting diplomacy.”

Georgetown University began designating 40 single-stall, gender-neutral bathrooms in public buildings throughout campus, an initiative pushed by members of LGBTQ student advocacy groups.
Before the start of the semester, the Office of Planning and Facilities Management received the signs, which are set to identify the new gender-neutral bathrooms, and is in the process of placing them throughout public buildings on campus, according to a university spokesperson.
The LGBTQ Resource Center and Facilities have been working for a year to conduct inspections of single-stall bathrooms in public buildings to ensure that they can be designated as all-gender, according to Director of the LGBTQ Resource Center Sivagami Subbaraman.
Some buildings, such as the Rafik B. Hariri Buildingand Regents Hall, do not have single-stall bathrooms. Although they do have multi-stall bathrooms with handicap-accessible stalls, assigning multi-stall bathrooms as all-gender is not common practice, according to Subbaraman.
The LGBTQ Center used an external consultant to identify which single stall bathrooms in public buildings on campus would satisfy the regulations to be considered all gender, Subbaraman wrote.
The Georgetown University Student Association LGBTQ inclusivity policy team began the initiative to make single-stall restrooms in public buildings on campus gender-inclusive as well as compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act in March 2017.
The university had already converted many of the larger family bathrooms, such as the bathrooms in the Intercultural Center, into the new gender-neutral bathrooms on campus, according to GUSA LGBTQ+ Policy Chair MacKenzie Grimm (COL ’21).
Still, the university could communicate more openly about its progress on designating gender-neutral bathrooms, Grimm said.
“My first semester, I only knew two gender-neutral bathrooms,” Grimm said. “Even though there has been some progress, the university is not super transparent where they are in the stages of development.”
While most single-stall bathrooms comply with the rules for being assigned as all-gender, not all meet the regulations for handicap access, Subbaraman wrote.
Many of the old buildings met all regulations in place at the time of their construction but have not changed to reflect evolving regulations, according toGrimm.
“A lot of the buildings were made in the fifties, or the sixties, and the stalls are cramped together so it’s not even accessible for anyone at all,” Grimm said.
Although recently the university has been more responsive to students wanting access to single-stall bathrooms, this was not the case last semester, according to Al Castillo (SFS ’22), deputy communications director of GU Pride.
“During my first semester at Georgetown, the option to even access the single-stall bathrooms were unavailable for me,” Castillo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The single-stall bathroom in the HSFC was always closed, so I was reduced to using the female restrooms. The single-stall bathrooms in Lau were never to be opened.”
In the past, LGBTQ students have voiced concerns over inaccessibility to some gender-neutral bathrooms. Students reported that the single-stall bathrooms meant for all genders were sometimes locked, causing inconveniences for some students.
Using a gendered bathroom has become a source of fear and discomfort for Castillo, who said he tries to avoid gendered bathrooms after experiencing unpleasant stares in both restrooms.
“The last time I used the men’s restroom on campus, the one occupant there quickly stormed off when he caught sight of me,” Castillo wrote. “I feel much more comfortable using the single-stall restrooms because they allow me to not feel pressure from any other occupants for using the ‘wrong’ bathroom.”
The administration has been receptive to student advocacy on gender-neutral bathrooms, according to Crossroads Living Learning Community faculty adviser April Sizemore-Barber. Crossroads is a living learning community centered on gender and sexuality located in Village C East.
“Gender neutral restrooms have been a priority for LGBTQ students on campus for quite some time now,” Sizemore-Barber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is great that the university has been responsive to the concerns of students who, essentially, just want to be able to pee in peace.”
The decision to install gender-inclusive signage comes amid reduced national protections for trans students. In recent years, the federal government has overturned previous legislation regarding rules on bathrooms for transgender students. In 2017, President Donald Trump rolled back federal protections for transgender students in public schools, reversing former President Barack Obama’s policy.
The expansion of the gender-neutral restrooms helps to fight the marginalization of trans identities on campus, Sizemore-Barber wrote.
“The university’s action expresses solidarity with and concern for its trans/non-binary students’ wellbeing,” Sizemore-Barber wrote. “The visibility of gender neutral bathrooms will hopefully further normalize trans presence on campus and make trans/non-binary students feel more comfortable and supported while at Georgetown.”

Presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) supported statehood for Washington, D.C., in a tweet calling on followers to sign her petition to make D.C. the fifty-first state Jan. 28.
Warren’s petition for D.C. statehood comes on the heels of her Dec. 31 launch of her presidential exploratory committee and amid a strong push from local politicians to increase autonomy for the District.
Warren’s support for D.C. statehood, however, is not a new development. Warren co-sponsored legislation aimed toward achieving D.C. statehood in 2014, 2015 and 2017.
Residents of the District are a significant disenfranchised population, Warren wrote in a tweet. 
“700,000 people is more than the populations of Wyoming or Vermont. But DC residents don’t have an equal voice in our government – despite paying federal taxes,” Warren tweeted.
Washington, D.C., operates as a district under federal jurisdiction rather than as a traditionally represented state. D.C. voters regularly participate in mayoral and city council elections and elect a delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. The delegate can only participate in procedural votes, however, and cannot vote on the House floor.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.’s delegate to the House, introduced a D.C. statehood bill H.R. 51, the D.C. Admission Act, to the 116th Congress on Jan. 3. The bill has gained more support than previous statehood efforts, and currently has 194 cosponsors in the House, all of whom are Democrats.
Norton announced the bill in a joint press conference Jan. 4 with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who is an active proponent of statehood for D.C. Bowser frequently cites the nearly 80 percent of D.C. voters who supported a 2016 D.C. ballot advisory referendum in favor of statehood. Norton’s bill is part of a series of bills called “Free and Equal D.C.” that aim to increase the District’s independence and seek statehood. 
However, because D.C. votes overwhelmingly Democratic in presidential elections, support for D.C. statehood tends to track closely with political party affiliation, according to Hans Noel, a professor of government at Georgetown, whose research focuses on political parties, polarization and ideology.
“Completely separate from any sort of merits of whether or not D.C. should be a state, the partisan division has been pretty clear for some time now,” Noel said in an interview The Hoya.
Warren’s endorsement of D.C. statehood makes sense because of its large popularity among Democratic voters, Noel said. He sees D.C. statehood as a likely point of consensus among Democratic presidential primary candidates.
“A lot of Democrats have long thought that this would be a great idea to address what Democrats see as in imbalance in the Senate over representing rural states. Republicans have likewise been opposed because they see it as a way of giving extra votes to the Democrats,” Noel said.
The issue fits as a component of the larger narrative Democrats are crafting about voting rights and voter disenfranchisement, according to Noel. 
“It’s a very different issue technically from, say, voter ID laws, but they’re both very similar in they let us get more representation and worry about the folks that are disenfranchised,” Noel said. “It’s hard to make a really good case against representation of people who are Americans and should be able to vote.”
Discussion of D.C. statehood and even representation within American territories ought to be encouraged, Georgetown College Democrats Chair Rebecca Hollister (COL ’20) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Everyone always says DC Statehood is ‘never going to happen,’ but that is only true as long as no one is talking about it,” Hollister wrote. “I’m very pleased to see big-name candidates discussing this issue and hope that it continues.”
Navigating the constitutional requirements for bringing a new state into the union and changing the District’s representation and role are complicated legal questions, and it may be a long time before efforts surrounding D.C. statehood culminate into actual policy change, according to Noel. 
“There may well be progress on it, but it’s an uphill fight for Democrats and for the district,” Noel said.
