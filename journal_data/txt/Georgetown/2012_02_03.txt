Hoping to boost awareness of Black History Month on campus after years of low visibility, Georgetown’s chapter of the NAACP is planning to dramatically increase the number of events celebrating African-American culture this month.
“Last year, there weren’t enough events for Black History Month and it seemed like leaders in the organization lacked enough people to put on a successful event,” Thea Fowles (COL ’14), the Students of Color Alliance representative for Georgetown’s chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said.
The NAACP and its peer organizations, including the Black Student Alliance and the Black Theatre Ensemble, have identified African-American history as the primary focus of the month. According to the NAACP board, African-American history is often left out of the curriculum in standard American history classes.
“My biggest concern is that Georgetown students won’t feel the need to attend Black History Month events. I really would like to see the campus community come together and celebrate Black History Month and recognize that it is an integral component of American history,” NAACP Press and Publicity Chair Deborah Williams (COL ’13) said.
Fowles said one of the highlights of the month’s festivities will be a performance by the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater at the Kennedy Center.
“I’m extremely excited about Alvin Ailey because it amazes me how the company is able to take a story that truly reflects the African-American experience and transform it into art,” she said.
Other events will include a screening of “Malcolm X,” a day of service at Ballou High School in Southeast D.C., a dinner honoring NAACP Founder’s Day and a coffeehouse night to honor African-American culture.
“Our community has a lot to offer and has offered a lot to American society,” Williams said. “We want to emphasize that the African-American community is diverse and that we have an array of experiences.”

Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E has long been an arena for perennial neighborhood relations debates.
With the D.C Zoning Commission preparing to make its ruling on the 2010 Campus Plan next week, the commission’s monthly meetings are frequently the sites of heated battles about issues ranging from student noise to safety regulations in rental apartments.
But despite long-standing tensions between the ANC and the university, commissioners believe that there is potential for cooperation between the two groups.
“We’re one community,” ANC 2E Chair Ron Lewis said. “We have a lot of the same interests in the same things, although we don’t always come out on the same side of a particular question.”
 
“Grassroots” Government
ANC 2E, which is comprised of seven commissioners, each representing a geographical district, focuses on matters of municipal government in Georgetown, Burleith and Hillandale.
Ron Lewis, who is in his second two-year term as chair of the commission, described it as a bridge between residents and the often-complex D.C. government.
“It’s really grassroots democracy. It’s a connection between people and the city government,” Lewis said.
According to the commission’s website, D.C. government agencies are required to give ANC testimony “great weight” in making rulings. City agencies must issue their decisions in writing, explicitly address ANC arguments and send a copy of their responses to the ANC.
While some government agencies that affect ANC 2E residents, such as the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the National Park Service and water and sewer departments, are not considered D.C. agencies and are thus not required to give the ANC “great weight,” the ANC still holds lobbying clout.
“ANCs are not able to pass laws, per se. … [But they] can offer their opinions, in the form of resolutions, to any governmental agency in D.C.,” Sticka said.
 
Conflict and Cooperation in Committee
The ANC’s ability to offer its opinion to D.C. agencies allows it to wield tremendous clout in local decision making.
Historically, this has proved to Georgetown’s disadvantage. During the approval process for the 2000 Campus Plan, the ANC’s proposal to the D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment heavily influenced the board’s final vote.
The ANC’s submission to the BZA raised concerns that will sound strikingly familiar to students and neighbors involved in the current Campus Plan debate. The Hoya reported in 2001 that the ANC called for increased on-campus student housing, stricter punishments for student littering and noise and restricted use of some campus facilities, including Harbin Field and McDonough Gymnasium.
As a result, the BZA denied a request by the university to extend its enrollment cap by 389 students, forcing Georgetown to file a complaint with the D.C. Court of Appeals.
The plan was not officially approved until 2005, delaying the start of several key construction projects.
The ANC’s influence extends beyond the Campus Plan debate.
In 2009, the ANC facilitated the removal of the popular Philly Pizza from its Potomac Street address when it was found to be in violation of zoning laws. Heavy student foot traffic late at night was creating disturbances for neighbors.
Lewis added that since the entirety of Georgetown is designated a national historic district, the ANC plays an active role in reviewing design modifications to homes and businesses before they reach a historical review board. The need to maintain the neighborhood’s historic nature is what delayed the opening of the Georgetown Apple Store in 2010 and has been part of the argument against student group homes.
Lewis stressed that he considers all constituents of ANC 2E — both permanent residents and Georgetown students — one community, though the commission and university often stand opposed.
Lewis cited public safety as an example of cooperation between the university and the ANC.
“Safety is an example of where the student community and the permanent residential community look at things in pretty much exactly the same way. We want safe streets, we want to be able to be outside at night and know that there’s enough police presence here. … We all feel that way,” Lewis said.
Commissioner Bill Starrels has long used his post to foster better landlord accountability for student homes to ensure the health and safety of Georgetown students. Years before the university developed its landlord pledge, which places landlords on an online list of approved landlords in exchange for their compliance with D.C. licensing requirements, Starrels was working with the DCRA to ensure landlords obtained mandatory basic business licenses.
“Some of these landlords are not user-friendly. They never have been, never will be. … People end up spending too much money and accept houses that are in a condition that nobody but a student would live in them, and that’s unfortunate,” Starrels said.
 
Bridging the Divide
Sticka said that while he joined the ANC to remedy what he considered the unfair way in which student interests are addressed in local politics, he remains disillusioned by the commission’s antagonism toward the university, most recently in its opposition to the 2010 Campus Plan and a redistricting proposal that would give Georgetown students a chance at three seats on ANC 2E.
“I became a member of the ANC because … throughout my freshman year I was frustrated by the way that students were discussed in the community and about how our interests never seemed to be taken into account,” Sticka said.
Lewis argued that the ANC’s insistence that the university provide more on-campus facilities and services takes into account the interests of students.
“The on-campus environment ought to be more inviting and more welcoming and offer more activities. There are so many steps the university administration could take to make the campus an inviting, fun environment,” Lewis said.
“Now that the Campus Plan is almost behind us, I want to work closely with the Georgetown student community because there are a lot of things I think we can do together.”

The Metropolitan Police Department reported a decline in the number of calls to 911 for noise violations in Georgetown and Burleith in recent months, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr.
Kerr said the decrease came as the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program has stepped up its patrols of the area.
“Part of this could be attributed to the effectiveness of SNAP teams deterring noise, as they are patrolling, not just to respond to calls, but also to proactively prevent noise levels from rising in residential areas,” Kerr said.
A team of 12 SNAP security officers patrol the West Georgetown and Burleith areas between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. on weekends, and is often the first to respond to noise complaints from neighboring residents.
In its recent filings in support of the 2010 Campus Plan, the university argued that SNAP’s heightened presence has contributed to a reduction in the number of 911 calls from residents.
“The number of 911 complaints regarding students has been low and [is] trending downward evidencing the efficacy of [this] program,” the report said.
According to the university, SNAP is designed to help students avoid interactions with MPD, especially in light of the D.C. noise ordinance passed last spring. The law sanctions those who make loud noise between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. with a $500 fine or up to 90 days in prison.
Though no Georgetown students have been arrested for noise violations so far, two were given a warning on Jan. 5, according to DPS reports.
Meanwhile, 19 percent of the calls made to SNAP last semester either did not involve Georgetown students or were regarding neighboring residences not occupied by Georgetown students, according to Kerr.
But Chris Clements, president of the Burleith Citizens Association, said that residents of Georgetown and Burleith have found SNAP to be ineffective in mitigating concerns related to student noise and rowdiness.
“The general sense that I have gotten from Georgetown and Burleith residents, as well as the majority of the people who have called SNAP in the past, is that they haven’t been very effective in addressing people’s concerns,” Clements said.

As part of a reinvigorated campaign to make D.C. the 51st state, Mayor Vincent Gray and several other district officials travelled to New Hampshire last week to rally support for the cause.
The trip was the first step of what officials hope will be a nationwide tour pushing for D.C. statehood. Gray and five city council members testified before the New Hampshire House of Representatives Friday after Rep. Cindy Rosenwald (D-N.H.) put the resolution on the legislature’s agenda.
“For me, the issue is not so much about statehood. I see statehood as a tactic to get what I see is really important, and that is full representation that is a right of American citizens,” Rosenwald said.
Though the bill was ultimately voted down, District officials plan to continue the push, according to DoxieMcCoy, a spokeswoman for the Mayor’s office.
“It is seeking D.C. democracy, voting rights, statehood. … It is something we are constantly pushing. … It is something we are constantly fighting for,” McCoy said. “We have to keep it in the public light and continue to use different tactics to try to reach our goals.”
Last year, the campaign for District statehood was re-energized after this spring’s Congressional budget crisis jeopardized the District’s ability to spend its own funds. Less than a week later, Gray was arrested in a protest for D.C. voting rights.
“It was worth being arrested,” Gray said in a press conference after his release from jail. “Enough is enough. We’re tired of being dictated to by people who don’t have a clue about the District of Columbia.”
According to McCoy, Congressional oversight of the D.C. budget is one of the major issues District officials have with the status quo.
“The biggest benefit [of statehood] is for the District to have autonomy — legislative autonomy, budget autonomy — and for the rights [of] the residents of the District of Columbia and those who are elected to represent them to have control [of] our finances and control [of] our laws,” she said.
Gray’s office remains hopeful that their efforts will eventually be successful.
“We are not letting [the New Hampshire] vote discourage us, and we are continuing to fight,” McCoy said.
