Less than two months before the presidential election, anger continues to brew among the American electorate partially due to the lack of honesty from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump, according to a panel sponsored by the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life on Tuesday.
Panelists at the event, titled “Faith, Anger and Trust in Campaign 2016,” included syndicated columnist and PBS NewsHour commentator Mark Shields, visiting fellow at The Catholic University of America’s Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies Melinda Henneberger, The Atlantic Magazine Senior Associate Editor Emma Green (COL ’12) and the Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Jerry Seib.
Director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life John Carr moderated the event. According to Carr, this year’s presidential campaign has been driven mostly by anger instead of money.
“It’s been an unusual year,” Carr said. “It’s been a year where, in some ways, anger and movements have mattered more than money.”
Seib said this anger is rooted in economics, corrupt institutions and a broken political system.
“The two most powerful emotions in politics are fear and anger: a fear of the future and an anger at the present. And that’s I think where we are,” Seib said.
Henneberger said social media has placed an entertainment value on anger.
“I think it turns out that venting constantly, instead of being cathartic, just leads to more venting,” Henneberger said.
Many polls point to a theme of resignation among voters who prefer neither candidate, according to Green.
The polls for this election also include a new fourth response. In the past, the most common responses included were either “Candidate A,” “Candidate B” or “I don’t know.” This year, however, a fourth answer was added: “neither,” due to the large partition of the population who have made purposeful decisions to not vote for either candidate because of a strong dislike of both Clinton and Trump.
Henneberger said voters do not trust politicians because of their dishonesty. Bernie Sander’s (I-Vt.) popularity during the Democratic primary exemplified this fact, according to Henneberger.
“In American politics, someone, like we saw with Bernie Sanders, could do very well trying something way out of the box, like telling the truth and letting the chips fall,” Henneberger said.
Shields said both Clinton and Trump tailor their speeches based on whom they are addressing in an effort to appease voters — further confirming their dishonest images.
“They are saying what they think the group wants to hear, to please them. It’s a terrible, distorting, contorting experience,” Shields said.
Both candidates also lack strong religious identities, according to the panelists. Seib said the vice presidential candidates, however, have strong religious backgrounds.
“They’ve really thought about faith; they have an idea. I think you could have a very interesting faith conversation between Tim Kaine and Mike Pence,” Seib said. “I find it hard to imagine what the faith conversation would be between the two presidential candidates.”
Despite the lack of focus on religion from the presidential candidates, Shields said religion still plays an important role in presidential politics.
“There wouldn’t have been an abolitionist movement in this country but for the Quakers, the Anglicans and the Methodists. There wouldn’t have been an anti-war movement or a women’s movement but for the churches,” Shields said. “Religion and politics had their troubles, but America is a far better place and a far more just place because of the political engagement of committed religious Americans.”
Irene Koo (COL ’16) said she found the talk useful in understanding the current political climate.
“I thought that it was really refreshing. Everything they were saying about how we can learn lessons from this election and how all of the longer-term boiling emotions of anger and distrust can form how we make decisions about politics and change the discourse for the future,” Koo said.
Alexis Larios (COL ’18) said he appreciated that the panelists addressed the election from a Catholic perspective that she had not previously considered.
“I think a lot about how my other identities intersect with my voting, but I never think about how my Catholic identity intersects, so it was interesting to hear that side revealed and how other Catholics are dealing with that,” Larios said.

As the university approaches its December contract renewal deadline with Aramark, the two finalists for the meal service contract — Sodexo and current auxiliary services provider Aramark — presented their plans for future dining offerings, covering programming initiatives, sustainability issues and meal plan structures, at open house events on campus this week.
Sodexo has faced at least nine documented boycotts on university campuses since 2006.
Sodexo and Aramark showcased their different offerings to hundreds of students Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. In both plans, the top floor of O’Donovan Hall would be replaced with retail space for contractors, while the lower level would remain a dining hall.
The two multinational companies also have in common a history of conflicts with labor groups over fair treatment and pay at several universities, correctional facilities and military bases around the world.
In January, students at Northwestern University joined dining employees in a march and rally against Sodexo, while an editorial in The Cavalier Daily at the University of Virginia urged the university to reconsider its contract with Aramark after Progress Michigan reported that Aramark fed inhumane food to inmates at Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Mich., in 2015. Emory University decided last year not to renew its contract with Sodexo amid concerns that Sodexo prevented employees from unionizing and providing independent feedback on their employment experience, while students at Seattle Pacific University called for Sodexo’s contract to be dropped amid concerns over workers being paid sub-poverty wages in Latin America.
Last spring, Aramark workers at Georgetown spoke out about poor work and wage conditions — including accusations that they experienced inconsistent wage payments, racial discrimination and verbal abuse. After the community presented a petition of 2,021 signatures to Aramark’s management and several demonstrations, the company reached a contract agreement with its employees to implement a fair process for worker unionization and improved working conditions.
In its plan, Sodexo, which provides dining services to schools including George Mason University, Northwestern University and Loyola Marymount University, emphasized its proposed changes on sustainability, social justice and meal exchanges.
Students from schools with dining halls operated by Sodexo report mixed feelings about the company’s management.
Georgetown University Student Association Deputy Chief of Staff Samantha Granville (COL ’17), a sophomore transfer student from Loyola Marymount University – which uses Sodexo – in Los Angeles, Calif., said her experience with Sodexo dining far exceeded Aramark’s quality.
“I loved the food at Sodexo at LMU. Everything was really fresh and made to order right in front of you. I was never shocked about what I was getting. There were always a ton of options,” Granville said. “I think Aramark gives us frozen food, and sometimes they defrost it and sometimes they don’t. With Sodexo, I could always count on having a good meal.”
However, not all students with Sodexo dining halls are satisfied. Dan Waldman, a sophomore at Northwestern University, said Sodexo employees often feel uncomfortable reporting to management.
Service workers at Northwestern wanted the ability to work 40 hours per week, a more manageable work load and fair wages.
Sodexo Spokesperson and Director of Business Development for Universities Merlyn Bowen said the company shares Georgetown’s ideals of social justice.
“I’m hoping that [students] can see the differences in the company philosophy, especially our focus on food and the focus of our institution in terms of the Jesuit culture and what’s important to us as an organization as it relates to fair practices, social justice, sustainability, the type of dining partner that we are, not just from a food perspective, but in all of the other issues,” Bowen said in an interview with The Hoya.
However, Waldman said Sodexo employees at Northwestern tend to express frustration while at work.
“It seems like most workers don’t stay for more than a month and they can often be kind of surly,” Waldman wrote. “I’ve heard workers talk about not liking Sodexo to each other and a lot of them talk under their breath but I haven’t seen anything really that has caught my eye.”
Workers’-rights advocacy group Georgetown Solidarity Committee Member Joseph Gomez (SFS ’19) said GSC has not been involved in the selection process but is aware of the reports about Sodexo’s working conditions.
“No one from the Georgetown Solidarity Committee is directly involved in the selection of the new dining vendor, but we’re very aware of what’s at stake, and we’re monitoring the situation closely,” Gomez wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Bowen said fair labor treatment is a priority for Sodexo.
“How we treat people is fundamentally at our core-most self, in terms of an organization, a huge piece of how we operate. It permeates through our entire philosophy from human resources, staffing, how we build our concepts, how we build our labor models, how we work together with unions.” Bowen said. “It’s fundamentally a huge part of who we are.”
Similarly, Aramark Higher Education Vice President of Strategic Development Tim Grant said supporting workers’ professional development is crucial for Aramark’s success.
“A critical element to what we are prepared to bring forward is further development of the individuals who are Georgetown dining services today,” Grant said in an interview with The Hoya. “The training, development, career, personal advancement, professional advancement for really the entire staff, because in order to deliver something new, the people that are expected to deliver it need the skills, they need the tools, they need the environment to work in to enable the execution of the program so that’s a critical piece of what we are displaying here.”
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) met with Sodexo and Aramark representatives to discuss protecting workers’ rights, and said that both providers were similar in their policies.
“So far as we have heard with both providers, there won’t really be much of a difference of treatment and benefits overall just sort of social justice oriented policies. It looks relatively the same for both,” Khan said.
GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) said he has met with student activists to listen to their concerns about the providers’ history of workers’ rights violations.
“We’ve been putting them in contact with each district manager each day,” Fisk said. “We’ve been asking questions of the same sort, talking about union relations, what will the process of transition be for both companies, things like that, so it has not been something that we have taken lightly. We’ve been in the process of asking the same pointed questions to both companies over the past two days.”
The Office of Auxiliary Business Services’ Request for Proposal Committee, which oversees the dining provider selection process, began searching for providers last year, ahead of the expiration of Aramark’s contract with the university.
Both providers indicated that the first floor of Leo’s could include retail offerings including Chick-fil-A and the Habit Burger Grill.
According to GUSA Senator Saad Bashir (SFS ’19), the RFP Committee provided the two companies with guidelines for their proposed changes to meal plans, meal exchange, retail options and overall dining experience, which include significant renovations to Leo’s.
Vice President for Auxiliary Business Services Joelle Wiese said the presentations demonstrate improvements that can be made in dining services.
“Both companies presented very well, they have very interesting programs and I think everybody was able to kind of go around,” Wiese said. “There’s tons of detail when it comes into what Leo’s could look like in the future, what Hoya Court could look like in the future, what is the people experience for the employees with their training development programs, what are the social justices and sustainability elements that both of these companies have, and I’m really understanding the food, the quality of the food.”
Wiese also said any structural changes to Leo’s would be funded by the contractor, not student tuition.
According to Khan, the RFP Committee is planning to host a town hall in coming weeks after the results of feedback forms sent to students who visited the showcases are examined.
“The open houses were a result of student advocacy and saying ‘we really need engagement’ and, moving forward, that model will continue,” Khan said. “So whether it’s a town hall [where] we will have with the administration for students to voice explicitly, ‘we like this provider versus this provider,’ throughout the process we would like to continue that [effort].”
Correction: This article previously stated Joseph Gomez (SFS ’19) is in the College; he is in the School of Foreign Service. This article also previously stated Think Progress Michigan reported that Aramark fed inhumane food to inmates at Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Mich., in 2015; the group’s correct name is Progress Michigan.

As a former Aramark employee at an university in SC. I will say that it is extremely difficult to make a living wage. Aramark laid off employees three full months a year. During this time your health insurance was suspended.  The only employees who were not laid off were managers. At the university where I was employed there is only one minority manager, and seventy percent of the staff are minorities. Aramark at this university had high levels of absenteeism and low morale. I honestly believe it’s because of the poor wages and the inconsistency in work availability those issues persist.  Probably the most disturbing thing about the experience was that during the times of layoffs Aramark encouraged employees to go on unemployment; which to me is subsidized corporate welfare.

The Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service’s third class of fellows consists of five individuals from varied backgrounds with extensive experiences in politics, government and media, including former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley (D).
GU Politics, an institute of the McCourt School of Public Policy, also selected former Chief of Staff at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing Scott Mulhauser, The Washington Post’s Deputy National Political Editor Rebecca Sinderbrand (COL ’99), former Senior Policy and Political Adviser to the Jeb Bush presidential campaign Michael Steel and CNN Politics Editor Juana Summers.
In an interview with The Hoya on Wednesday, the fellows discussed their goals for the upcoming semester and their thoughts on the current U.S. political landscape.
Why did you decide to come be a fellow with GU Politics?
Sinderbrand: This is a return trip for me to the Hilltop. This is eerie. I literally would sit at this table and use an Exact-O knife to cut out headlines and paste them with cement, that’s how old I am. I’m very happy to be here. I know – or I think I know – exactly what I’ll get when I come back here, which is fantastic discussion with Georgetown students, the kind that I miss. I’m also going to have a built in focus group where I can hear what people think of coverage, get idea, get thoughts. It’s the kind of opportunity reporters dream of.
Summers: I’m really excited to be here because I think it’s really important as a working journalist to be able to have an opportunity to get beyond the headlines and beyond the sound bites that can often drive campaign coverage. I do a really specialized job. I’m an editor for CNN Politics that focuses on data and I don’t have an opportunity in my day job to have a lot of rich conversations with people who are consuming the news that Rebecca and I and other journalists produce. I think that, much as Rebecca said, this will be a really great opportunity to be able to have those conversations with students who are smart and engaged and curious about the world around them.
Steel: I’m excited because young people are less and less interested in traditional politics. But that doesn’t mean they are unaffected by it or that it’s any less important. So I think it’s critical to learn from students why they’re not engaged by how the system works now and how the system can improve so that people have a greater interest in being involved.
Mulhausser: I just moved back to Washington from Beijing seven days ago, so it’s great to be home. After two years in China and 20 years in politics, I’m both frustrated and excited by all of this. Nothing is more exciting than coming back here, figuring out my own road ahead by talking to the students here, learning where they think things are going.
O’Malley: I ran for president and there was nothing more enjoyable about that frustrating experience than every day being with the young people that were the core of my campaign and that I got to work with every day. That give me a tremendous amount of faith and hope in our country and in our future as a people. So I’m looking forward to spending time with these young, forward-looking, terrific students at a great university, Georgetown.
Could you give me a sense of what you hope to achieve this semester as an IPPS fellow and what you think you bring, given your very different backgrounds?
Sinderbrand: I am going to be talking about campaign 2016 through a reporter’s point, which is not as someone running a campaign but someone who is observing it very closely, who is talking to the people who are involved in the campaign, who is making decisions about what they think is the most newsworthy element of a story and how we handle those stories. I was telling someone earlier that I hope there are people at Georgetown who would like to be journalists for a living, but I know there are people who are going to be working with journalists in their career, on Capitol Hill or elsewhere. Everyone is interested, I think, in news, to some extent. They’re news consumers, they’re paying attention to what’s happening, they have opinions on coverage, they’re curious about how the process works. I want to pull back the curtain a little bit about how we do it at the Washington Post every day.
Summers: My discussion group is about race and politics in 2016. I think that will be particularly exciting this political cycle and on this campus. For a variety of reasons, I think now is the time to have that conversation and conversations about race, and what our lived experiences are as it relates to the political cycle … I think we’ve really seen that come to life in having eight years of the nation’s first black president in President Barack Obama and the rise of the white working class voter that has largely fueled Donald Trump and the demographic changes that will make Latino and Hispanic voters one of the largest voting blocks in this country. I think it’s a really important moment to have this conversation. I hope when students come to my discussion group they feel safe and comfortable to have those conversations with their peers that they share this campus with, where race is obviously a big focal point right now due to Georgetown’s history.
Steel: There are a lot of institutions in Washington that aren’t working right now, that are designed more to serve interests rather than the people as a whole. There are a lot of ideas for reforming those institutions that also serve various interests, but not the people. I think we need to start fresh with a blank piece of paper and ask the question, ‘If you were organizing Congress today, how would you do it? If you were setting up the system to fund our presidential and other elections, how would you do it?’ Hopefully by going back to first principles and figuring out kind of an ideal system, we can come up with proposals that actually help with the way it’s done currently.
Mulhausser: I think when we look at what’s coming up in 13 days, the presidential debate that could be the most-watched event of our lifetimes, there are things that do work. So what makes campaigning work and how can campaigning be better? What makes debates work and how can they be better? What makes the media work? The media is doing a tremendous job covering this race. They are exposing things everyday and yet they’re being pilloried. We’d like to hear more about what they’re doing right and, both with them and others, what can be done better.
O’Malley: We’re going to be asking the question every week whether our country is becoming more polarized or less, has the pendulum swung, are we going to be able to recapture some common ground? So we’re going to be looking at issues starting with marriage equality, an issue that moved faster and gained a consensus very, very quickly. We’re going to look also at issues like criminal justice, which we can’t talk about without talking about race in America. We’re going to look at climate change, immigration reform and ask whether or not the pillars of Catholic social teaching — the dignity of every person, the common good we share and the unity of spirit and matter — might provide some framework and language for consensus.
What are your thoughts on the current U.S political climate, given your different backgrounds?
Mulhausser: I came back from two years in China, so it’s pretty rosy from that perspective. Maybe I’m wearing rose colored glasses but when you’ve got an electoral system that’s not done behind closed doors, where there is an incredibly dynamic back and forth, it’s not pretty or necessarily what any of us were hoping for but sometimes comparatively, it depends where you’re standing.
Steel: I’m personally incredibly frustrated. I’ve been part of a group that has spent the past 10 years of so recovering from the political effects of the last Bush presidency, winning the House in 2010, helping in a small way to take the majority in the Senate in 2014. This was a year when we had a great opportunity to elect a conservative reform president who would build on those ideas that had been developed the past several years and put those into practice. It is intensely frustrating every day to see that we seem to have nominated pretty much the only presidential candidate who couldn’t accomplish that goal.
Sinderbrand: For a reporter, every single campaign you have to learn something new. The way you deal with people on campaigns, that doesn’t change. But the way we report the news, the pace, the technology, every single time it’s been different. So that’s always an interesting experience.
O’Malley: I’m deeply concerned with where we are right now in our country’s politics. I’m so deeply concerned that I ran for president myself. I believe that this election poses a very non-traditional choice, a very stark choice and also presents a bit of a constitutional dilemma given the very unconstitutional positions that Donald Trump has taken on many issues. This, I believe, could well be the most important election. You hear people say that, it almost becomes trite. But we’ve never quite had a constitutional crisis like this, with so much anger, so much polarization, such a deep and broad sense of alienation from our own political leaders as you have in the electorate right now. Add to that declining wages and you have a very volatile soup here within which this constitutional crisis will be played out with the choice we all make or don’t make in November.

The Georgetown University Student Association pushed back against a campus-wide email discouraging the presence of Greek life on campus sent by Associate Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Dr. Jeanne Lord and Vice President for Student Affairs Dr. Todd Olson this week.
In a statement emailed to the student body and posted on Facebook on Thursday, GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17), Vice President Chris Fiske (COL ’17) and the GUSA Executive expressed their disagreement with Olson and Lord’s email.
In a campus-wide email Wednesday, Olson and Lord wrote that Greek organizations are both high risk and counter to Georgetown’s values. Olson and Lord sent a similar email reminding students of the university’s policy against Greek life last year.
“Experience and national data have shown that social Greek organizations are often associated with serious high risk behavior, including hazing and alcohol abuse,” Olson and Lord wrote. “Georgetown’s decision not to support a social Greek system reflects our concerns for the safety and well-being of our students, and is rooted in the values that have animated this university for more than two centuries.”
In its statement, GUSA defended the role of Greek life on campus.
“As we have gotten to know members of different Greek organizations here, we are overwhelmingly convinced that students in Georgetown’s Greek community are Hoyas first and foremost,” GUSA’s statement read.
“The Greek letters they wear are in no way a replacement for the Blue and Gray, but rather an affirmation and celebration of their experiences on the Hilltop and a commitment to passing the Georgetown experience on to the next generation of Hoyas.”
GUSA Liaison to Greek Council Tucker Cowden (MSB ’17) said GUSA hoped the statement would affirm to students their right to join Greek organizations.
“The response was not adversarial but really just designed to affirm to the student body, particularly new students who are still sorting through various opportunities to get involved on campus, that GUSA supports their rights to freedom of speech and association and that the university does not need to formally recognize an organization for it to be a worthwhile opportunity for Georgetown students,” Cowden wrote in an email to The Hoya.

As the presidential election plunges Americans across the country into a fresh bout of political soul-searching, the Georgetown community is grappling with the same conversations unfolding on the national stage.
Georgetown’s status as a premier national university and its Catholic tradition of social justice contribute to a culture in which Washington, D.C., looms as more than just the backdrop.
Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) said this distinctive heritage is instrumental to the university’s political identity.
“If I were to say this university has a political compass of any kind, I would say it is one that points to social justice and the common good,” Elleithee said. “The whole Jesuit identity, which is the mission of the university, engaging young men and women to engage in service to others. That is its persuasion. No matter how you approach that, it is up to you. It wants you to find your own path to it.”
GU Politics was established to increase political engagement and interest in public service among young people. As part of these efforts, GU Politics established a fellows program with politicians, political operatives and political journalists including former Gov. Martin O’Malley (D-Md.) this semester and has hosted a series of speakers, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) last spring.
Having hosted speakers ranging from Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) to former Republican Presidential Candidate Carly Fiorina in the past year alone and panels broaching topics like conservative feminism, the university caters to students of every political stripe, according to Elleithee.
“I think the conventional wisdom is that as a whole it is slightly left of center but I would argue that it is about as diverse as the country,” Elleithee said. “Just in my short time back on campus, when I came back about a year ago, I have seen a very active group of progressive students, an active group of conservative students and an active group of libertarian students in terms of ideology.”
Agreeing to Disagree
When government professor Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., conducted an anonymous poll in his comparative political systems class on Sept. 15, he discovered 59 percent of his 230 responding students identified as Democrats, 22 percent as Independents, 15 percent as Republicans, three percent as Libertarians and one percent as Green Party voters.
He further found 71 percent of his class planned on casting their ballots for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, while nine percent planned to vote Donald Trump. While Carnes said the sample was not perfectly representative of the student body as a whole, the results likely represent the political distribution at Georgetown.
“I would put Georgetown’s political standing left of center as probably the average university of the United States, but I think we have more outspoken Republican students willing to speak up, and more moderate students than you might see at a university if you were just to pick at random,” Carnes said. “I’m really impressed by how committed to open and rigorous debate Georgetown is.”
Georgetown’s political groups exemplify a high level of student engagement by Georgetown students in national politics. The GU College Democrats host more than 100 members in its leadership this semester, and nearly 1,300 members in its mailing list — roughly one in five undergraduates, according to GUCD President Mattie Haag (COL ’18). Comparatively, the GU College Republicans estimate 250 members in its club, 70 of which are active club participants, according to GUCR Director of Membership Hunter Estes (SFS ’19).
During a simulated Iowa Caucus event hosted by the McCourt School of Public Policy’s Institute of Politics and Public Service in February, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton swept an 89 percent victory over Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (D-Vt.) 11 percent, while Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) won the largest share among Republican students at 30 percent. GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump failed to place within the top three Republican candidates after being edged out by Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio.) and former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.).
Despite Clinton’s popularity during Georgetown’s informal Iowa Mockus, GU College Democrats Chair Mattie Haag (COL ’18) said she initially worried the more progressively liberal members of her organization would be too disillusioned with the Democratic establishment to support Clinton as the nominee. Yet Haag found, coming into this semester, almost all GUCD members uniformly backed Clinton.
“It’s been cool to see that everybody regardless of their differing views within the Democratic Party has been getting behind and excited about Hillary,” Haag said. “When it comes to the really big, important ideas, so things that matter to moderates and progressives, it really has not been as much as a problem as I would have foreseen, and I think we would have become very strong as an organization coming into the election.”
Kevin Toohers (COL ’17), editor-in-chief of the GU College Republican’s publication The Right Way – which is set to relaunch in October with an expanded staff under the name The Georgetown Review – said many within the organization have been reluctant to embrace Trump as their nominee.
“In general, there is an uncomfortableness with Donald Trump among Georgetown conservatives,” Toohers said. “We’ve been focusing more on congressional-level campaigns rather than being involved in the presidential election, largely due to the lack of support toward Donald Trump here on campus.”
However, Trump supporter Zach Hughbanks (MSB ’18) said a sizable amount of Trump backers at Georgetown are driven underground by a stigma that accompanies identifying with the nominee, which precluded the creation of a formal student organization centered around his election.
“There are a sizable amount of people who would be willing to join; it’s just no one would want to deal with the horrible backlash you would receive to start a Hoyas for Trump group,” Hughbanks said. “I’ve had classes where teachers have said ‘I’m sure there’s two or three Trump supporters,’ but no one would want to be handed that mantle.”
Hoyas for Hillary has been active on campus this election cycle. Hoyas for Hillary organized campaign trips to New Hampshire and Pennsylvania in the spring through Hillary for America.
Navigating a political campus
Sociology professor Leslie Hinkson, who teaches a course titled “Education and Society,” emphasized the university’s role in not only developing political ideas but also their expression. She said the more publicly divisive displays of political affiliation that often occur at large, public universities are typically tempered at smaller, private universities such as Georgetown.
“At state schools, you’ll see things like an affirmative action bake sale or things like students mimicking crossing the border, things that are intended to shock, whereas in smaller, private, more established universities, you’ll see there are spaces for college conservatives to do the same thing except with accessible or acceptable discourse out in the open,” Hinkson said. “It’s a lot more polite and less controversial at Georgetown.”
Despite this, Michael Parmiter (MSB ’18), a Trump supporter, said this belies a climate of political correctness that can prove stifling for political discourse on campus, particularly for conservatives.
“I would say that it’s the same here as other universities. The politically correct movement doesn’t want to offend anyone, they want safe spaces and trigger warnings, which I think is very antithetical to what a university is supposed to be,” Parmiter said. “They just label people as racist, sexist, all these kinds of things, and it doesn’t foster dialogue really to understand where people who support Trump are coming from.”
Rooted in religion
Toohers acknowledged the difficulty of being a conservative student at Georgetown after observing a tension between the school’s Catholic identity and some of its liberal policies.
“I think it’s a constant question that Georgetown wrestles with, often framed as how Georgetown can be a Catholic university in the 21st century,” Toohers said. “So I think there can be a disconnect at times. I think one of the bigger examples of this was last spring when the president of Planned Parenthood came to campus and that was really a time when conservative students felt slighted by the administration’s response to the issue and how they handled the issue.”
However, Carnes said the university’s Catholicism has taken an unprecedented role in shaping the university’s political discourse.
“I would argue that the Catholic identity has never been more vibrant and what that means is a Catholicism that’s intelligent, that’s willing to open a dialogue, a Catholic university in which every aspect of the Catholicism is to affirm and cherish and vibrantly alive,” Carnes said. “I would argue actually that it’s the more informed Catholicism than in an earlier generation was unquestioned or often the only voice at the table.”
McCourt School of Public Policy professor E.J. Dionne, who teaches the course “Religion and American Politics,” said the university’s Catholic roots are conducive to an openness that facilitates polices that transcend party lines.
“We have had in our class some really wonderful discussions that cross a lot of different lines — Denominational lines, racial lines, different views on social issues, and I’ve always had the sense that Georgetown may be more diverse in the range of views among students, partly because of our Catholic identity, but partly because our being in Washington means we draw a lot of students with an activist orientation, from all over the spectrum,” Dionne said.

The Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department is investigating a possible relation between a string of recent sexual assaults on four Georgetown students that occurred in the Georgetown, both on and off campus, according to a statement released by its office Wednesday.
The four assaults currently being investigated by the Criminal Investigations Division Sexual Assault Unit of the MPD took place between Aug. 3 and Sept. 12. The students were reported as victims of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault.
The Georgetown University Police Department uses public safety alerts to notify the campus community of crimes reported to either GUPD or MPD that represent threats to students or to employees. GUPD sent public service announcements regarding sexual assaults Aug. 3, Aug. 24, Sept. 5 and Sept. 12.
The Aug. 3 assault targeted a Georgetown University Medical Center student and occurred on the 1600 block of 35th Street NW, with the perpetrator carrying a knife. An assault targeting an undergraduate student occurred Aug. 24 as the student was entering her residence in Village A. Another student was assaulted Sept. 6 on Potomac and N Street NW. A fourth student was sexual assaulted on 35 and N Street NW.
Additionally, MPD listed another sexual assault, occurring Aug. 23, near the intersection of 37 and T Street NW.
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said GUPD will be increasing patrols in areas around campus such as the townhouses, Alumni Square, LXR and the Walsh building in response to the recent assaults.
Gruber also noted that MPD is aware of the increase in assaults in the area and will also be increasing its patrols in areas surrounding Georgetown’s campus in conjunction with GUPD.
“We’re working with the Metropolitan Police Department, second district,” Gruber said. “They have let us know that they will increase patrols and pay special attention to this area.”
According to the MPD, it is investigating a possible connection between the incidents.
Gruber said the suspects are still at large. He noted there appeared to be two people committing the crimes based on the descriptions provided by the victims. A suspect in two of the attacks has been described as a possibly Hispanic male in his early twenties, 5’6’’ in height. Another suspect has been described as 6’1’’ in height. The other suspect was described as a black male between 5’9’’to 5’11’’ in height, with a slim build.
“I think that some of them are connected; some of them are the same suspects. But, we have two different descriptions of two different males,” Gruber said. “But it looks like at least a couple of these have been perpetrated by the same offender.”
Gruber said students who are out at night should take advantage of Georgetown’s safety resources such as SafeRides shuttle and police escorts available 24 hours per day. Gruber also advised students to exercise caution when walking at night.
“Our expectation is to be able to walk wherever you want and be unfettered,” Gruber said. “Reality is that in the city, there are people that do these things. So, people need to take the extra step to keep themselves safe.”

Georgetown Counseling and Psychiatric Services has reduced its fees starting in the fall 2016 semester by 89 percent for follow-up psychology visits and by 80 percent for follow-up psychiatric visits and expanded free services in an effort to increase undergraduate student access to mental health services.
Follow-up psychotherapy visits now cost $10 while follow-up psychiatric visits now cost $15. Students’ first CAPS visits are always free.
Under the previous payment policy at CAPS, follow-up psychotherapy visits would cost students $90 per visit while follow-up psychiatric visits would cost students $75 per visit, with a $10 copay if students had insurance.
Additionally, any student who is in the Georgetown Scholarship Program may receive any CAPS services free of charge as of this fall.
Over the past year, the Georgetown University Student Association and the Mental Health Advisory Board have actively pushed for CAPS services to increase accessibility for those who require their services.
GUSA Mental Health Policy Team Chair Sylvia Levy (SFS ’18) said CAPS’ latest efforts will help make its services more accessible.
“I think this goes a long way to decrease financial barriers to accessing mental health care on campus,” Levy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This year, GUSA and other student groups will need to work with CAPS to get the word out about these changes.”
Previously, CAPS incorporated private insurance policies into payment calculations and was required to make private arrangements with students unable to afford service fees.
CAPS Director Phil Meilman said he sees the revision of the payment policy as part of a universitywide — as well as nationwide — endeavor to meet the often-neglected mental health needs of undergraduate students.
“[Changing the payment policy] is one step in the process,” Meilman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Almost every college counseling center around the nation is challenged to meet the full range of demand for services, and some centers even have three-to-four-month waiting lists. The good news is that it has never been the case at Georgetown.”
CAPS has also hired new staff this semester and is working to add members throughout the year in anticipation of increased demand for mental health services in response to lower fees.
“We hope to add more staff and space next year,” Meilman wrote. “The unknown factor is what effect the new fee schedule will have on staff availability. Irrespective of this, emergencies will continue to be seen on a same-day basis.”
A 2015 study by the Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Pennsylvania State University shows the number of mental health service requests on college campuses is growing five times faster than the national rate of university enrollment.
GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) said the program will help cover the often overlooked indirect financial costs associated with surviving a sexual assault, which can be particularly burdensome when combined with the cost of mental health services.
“The economic costs of violence for survivors of sexual assault can include but are not limited to: medical expenses, tutoring, counseling services, lost tuition if a student has to withdraw, lost scholarships, transit to court hearings, alternate housing, student loan interest, and course drop/change fees,” Hinerfeld wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In April, CAPS implemented a program providing a semester of free counseling for students reporting that they are dealing with a sexual assault as well as alleged perpetrators.
The average cost of violence for a survivor can cost as much as $151,423, according to Hinerfeld.
Aidan Thaggard (MSB ’19) said there has been a shift in the attitude of college students toward seeking mental health services but that there is still room for progress.
“Obviously the most ridiculous thing in the case of providing mental health care on campus would be to prevent people from being able to receive the care just because they can’t afford it,” Thaggard said. “But I don’t know if [changing the payment policy] changes the problem of misinformation about mental health and what mental health issues look like. I think a lot of people still wouldn’t seek initial care regardless of what the cost for follow-ups is just because they don’t think they have mental health problems or aren’t interested in seeking mental health care.”
Levy said the process of expanding access to CAPS on campus will not only entail changing prices and policies, but also ending the stigma related to seeking help for mental health issues.
“In a perfect world, CAPS would not only be inexpensive for students, but it would also have the resources to offer long-term care and would be socially accepted as a normal resource for all students to utilize,” Levy wrote. “The GUSA Mental Health Policy Team will keep working to push for increased resources for CAPS, and student groups like Active Minds will continue to create conversations on campus around mental health and improving our community on the Hilltop.”

Interim Dean Rohan Williamson has served in the McDonough School of Business for a little over a month, replacing former Dean David Thomas, who stepped down after five years in the role.
A finance professor in the McDonough School of Business faculty since 1997, Williamson has had a far-reaching career in the MSB. Williamson has served on several committees during his time at the school, including the McDonough School of Business Undergraduate Curriculum Committee, the Academic Leadership Council and the Diversity Committee. Williamson also served on the committee that helped select Thomas as dean five years ago.
Williamson has received numerous accolades for his research papers, including the 1999 Michael Bensen Prize from the Journal of Financial Economics and the 2003 William Sharpe Best Paper Award from the Journal of Financial and Qualitative Analysis. He ranks 169th of more than 300,000 influential authors on the Social Science Research Network.
In an interview with The Hoya, Williamson discussed the value of research, the MSB’s increasing prestige and the role Georgetown students play in the world after graduation.
What contributed to the decision, in your opinion, for the administration to select you as interim dean?
That’s hard for me to say, I was on the other side, but [President John J. DeGioia] and [Provost Robert Groves] made the decision. Just thinking about myself, this is my 20th year, I’ve had several leadership positions in the business school and at the university level, have been a part of dean searches, so I imagine that has something to do with it. I don’t know their specific decision criteria but I know they wanted someone that was here to maintain stability and maintain leadership of the school.
How long will you serve as interim dean? 
There is not a specified time frame. The way the process is there will be a search for someone permanent. The agreement is for at least a year, potentially longer — so the amount of time has not been specified.
Tell me about your role as the Bolton Sullivan and Thomas A. Dean chair of iinternational business? What does that entail?
So I pride myself in my research and to become a chair professor it’s mainly given on the level of research that one’s accomplished. So that chair was based on research accomplishments. The other part of it is teaching, obviously. I primarily teach international finance but I’ve developed a reputation in international finance and risk management and corporate governance and those are my areas of expertise. And that earns you a chair position, so as I mentioned before as a professor that’s primarily what you do, beyond the leadership of what I’ve done in the school I’ve developed a research reputation that earned me that chair.
What recent accomplishments of the McDonough School of Business do you think have contributed to its increasing prestige in the academic world, and what changes do you foresee for the future to maintain or improve its position?
I think in a relatively short period of time we’ve come a long way. All of our programs are ranked in the top 20, which is astonishing compared to other schools. Some schools are much older than we are that aren’t doing nearly as well. I think that’s primarily been driven by the quality of students; I think the Georgetown reputation goes a long way.
We have top-quality students and top-quality faculty that really engage in the teaching process. Over the years we have become very strong in our research productivity because as a research-based school we are creating knowledge, not just teaching what’s already been done. And I think those two combinations are a very important part of it.
That’s also building the Jesuit tradition, we get students here that are focused on their success, which are a big part of progressing in rankings. And we’re able to attract the best. I think our faculty and students are very committed to the institution, and they broadcast Georgetown and the quality of it. And recruiters know that, they know when they come to Georgetown that they get top-level students and that they’re taught by the best. And alumni are part of this too because success breeds success and as they graduate they reach back and are really committed to the university.
I think those are the main ingredients in making Georgetown so successful.
Recently the university has made business courses available for non-McDonough School of Business students. What do you think motivated that decision? 
I think several things. I think the growth and the quality of the business education is something that is attractive to other parts of the university, and Georgetown has a tradition where probably the majority of students at least have a minor and a lot have double-majors. Because students are very interested not just in one particular field but they know about other parts, and they are creative in wanting to combine certain disciplines to get those tidbits of knowledge that will help guide them in a particular career.
So I think other parts of the university want that link to the business school that gets them that knowledge to advance them in a special career that they may have. There’s also business school students that go the other way, so it’s only natural that opening a minor for other parts of the university is a good thing to do. It helps other parts of the school and it helps the university.
Why do you think so many Georgetown students pursue careers in business after graduation, regardless of whether they graduate from the McDonough School of Business?
I think Georgetown students are leaders, they’re go-getters. They want to make a contribution to society in various ways. There are different approaches to that, through medicine, law and other things. I think we’ve built a unique niche, sort of developing the whole personality in the Jesuit tradition, where students just want to do more.
In a global society, the way to make your contribution globally is through a good knowledge of business and business principles. It can be applied to nonprofits and in governments and other places. I think students go into business as a way to make a contribution. At Georgetown, we talk about how you get more so you can give more.
That’s something that’s in the DNA of Georgetown students beyond just the business school, this desire to do more to help society and business can do this.
What are your plans for after your tenure as interim dean comes to a close? Is this experience going to change your approach at all returning to your role as a faculty member?
What this experience gives you is an opportunity to see the school and the university in general. Your main focus as a faculty member is direct contact with the students, so you don’t have contact with the rest of the university.
This position as dean gives me more contact with faculty, alumni and with all aspects of the university—incoming students, graduation, staff, etc. And that’s something I can take back to being a faculty member is seeing how the whole system works and a greater appreciation for the contributions of all the members of the Georgetown family.
I guess not everyone can have that experience but it’s a tremendous learning experience. I now have an understanding of the whole system that I always knew was there but I didn’t understand the importance of a lot of roles besides those just in the classroom. I now appreciate the roles of everyone much more including students and student leaders.

District of Columbia Public Schools saw a 73 percent increase in the number of students taking Advanced Placement exams since 2010, as well as a 34 percent increase in the number of students passing these exams, though their passing rate is still well below the national average, according to The Washington Post.
Nearly 3,000 District students took AP tests in May, a success that DCPS spokesperson Janae Hinson attributed to the collective effort of area guidance counselors, teachers and students.
“Over the past few years, DCPS guidance counselors have encouraged students to take AP courses, teachers have helped raised the bar by teaching these rigorous courses, and more students have risen to the challenge,” Hinson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Despite District students passing their AP tests at higher rates than five years ago, their 35 percent passage rate is far below the national average of 60 percent.
Although participation in AP courses has also increased in the District’s lower-income schools, there is still a wide gap between students taking the tests and students passing the tests. At Anacostia High School, 47 students took AP tests in 2016 and none passed. At Ballou High School, 74 students took AP tests this year and only one passed.
Anacostia High School and Ballou High School did not respond to a request for comment as of 2:30 a.m.
Hinson said DCPS is committed to raising this percentage through improving resources and training for AP teachers and developing pre-AP courses to ensure that students are prepared.
“DC Public Schools is committed to equity and access, and we’re proud of the progress we’ve made in the number of students taking AP courses and AP exams,” Hinson wrote. “In addition, AP courses are open to all students who are willing to put forth the work that it takes to succeed in a college-level class while still in high school. Though we aspire for all students to pass their exams, we believe that every student benefits from the experience and rigor of taking college-level courses in high school.”
This academic year, every DCPS high school is required to offer at least eight AP courses. However, some schools such as Woodrow Wilson High School have more than 30 AP course offerings for students. Wilson High School had the highest number of students in D.C. taking at least one exam this year, an accomplishment Principal Kimberly Martin attributes to school counselors and teachers identifying the best courses for students to take within the program.
“I think part of the success is that our counselors really do a great job of trying to encourage students who have an interest or a passion in a particular subject area to pursue the most rigorous content in that course area,” Martin said. “Also, our teachers are very well-equipped at recognizing a student’s ability in, say, history or English or math or science and then moving those students to the right area as far as the most challenging AP class that they can take.”
This year also marks the first time in over 15 years Wilson High School has had over 50 percent of its students receive a passing score of 3 or above on their AP exams. However, Martin stressed that Wilson High School supports all students in their AP program.
“We’re incredibly proud of that number, but we’re also proud of the student who gives it their very best shot, maybe a student who is learning English as a second language or a student who has an [Individualized Education Plan] and says ‘I’m going to give this a shot no matter what’ and gets exposure to content that is very rich, to classroom discussions that are complex, rich and multifaceted, just like they will receive in college” Martin said.
At the School Without Walls, a District magnet school, students must take “AP Language and Composition” as well as “AP World History” in order to graduate. Principal Richard Trogisch said this helps give students a leg up when applying to college, but he added that the School Without Walls’ primary focus is introducing students to rigorous material.
“It gets students prepared to the rigor of college, and it introduces them to more thought-provoking critical thinking and problem-solving that wasn’t necessarily involved in our traditional curriculum,” Trogisch said.

Eleven clubs – from the recently reinstated men’s club lacrosse to the new Saudi Students Association – have joined more than 200 existing clubs recognized by the Council of Advisory Boards at Georgetown this fall.
Other new clubs include education charity One World Youth Project, visual arts group bodoni creative, bipartisan political group No Labels and activist group Georgetown Student Farmworker Alliance.
The process to become an active club takes approximately one semester. All the recently CAB-affiliated clubs applied for recognition in January of last year. CAB started the process to launch new clubs this year on Sept. 15 and expects to confirm all new university-recognized student organizations on campus by Oct. 2. These clubs will be able to participate in the spring semester CAB fair.
CAB contains the six advisory boards on campus — the Student Activities Commission, the Advisory Board for Club Sports, the Performing Arts Advisory Council, the Media Board, the Campus Ministry Student Forum and the Center for Social Justice Advisory Board for Student Organizations — that decide which organizations will be accepted. Organizations are given access to university benefits, ranging from funding to rights to reserve on-campus space.
Two key criteria for assessing potential student organizations are sustained interest and originality, according to Advisory Board for Club Sports Chair Daniel Fain (COL ’18).
“CAB wants to ensure that each club we accept into New Club Development will have sustained, significant interest, and will serve a mission that is both in line with our university’s values and is not currently served by another group on campus,” Fain wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Council of Advisory Boards Chair Janhvi Bhojwani (SFS ’17) said CAB is committed to addressing student interests, as long as the club is not duplicative of any other organization on campus.
“We want to continue to improve student life on campus and we want to make sure that if there is an interest, then we want to be able to provide an outlet for it,” Bhojwani said. “We have a lot of meaningful discussions as to if [clubs] will overlap with any clubs in existence right now or if it’s something that Georgetown really needs and has an audience for but no outlet for.”
According to Bhojwani, another criteria is ensuring that new clubs attract a varied and committed group of students.
“Part of the concern with the new club development process is making sure there are people in varieties of different years to ensure members aren’t all seniors who graduate and the club dies out,” Bhojwani said.
In addition to verifying that a potential organization serves a unique purpose and will have at least 12 members to sustain it, the advisory boards have also engaged in a dialogue asking clubs to re-evaluate their level of exclusivity, according to Fain.
Several clubs at Georgetown are known for exclusivity. Students of Georgetown, Inc. had an 18 percent acceptance rate last fall, while the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union had a nine percent acceptance rate.
“CAB places particular focus on ensuring that new organizations are as inclusive as possible by actively discouraging unnecessarily competitive application structures,” Fain wrote in an email to The Hoya.
No Labels, led by Musa Bassey (COL ’18), was established under the Student Activities Commission. No Labels seeks to write about, discuss and organize programming around domestic political issues through a lens of bipartisan cooperation and consensus.
No Labels was launched last year, but only gained CAB affiliation this semester.
Bassey said that nonpartisan dialogue on campus is important, particularly during the current presidential election cycle.
“What we’re trying to do with No Labels is create a space where everyone can express their views, so that we can get past the toxic process of 2016, acknowledging the divisions that have come up, while also moving past them,” Bassey said.
Film group Hoyawood founder Chad Davis (SFS ’19) said he helped found Hoyawood when he realized there was no a longer a creative outlet for his passion in film.
“When I came to Georgetown I really wanted to get involved in Hoyawood because I am really passionate about film as an art form. But once I found out that it no longer existed at Georgetown, one of my friends, J.J. Woronoff (MSB ’19), and I decided to reboot it because we knew that there were definitely other people who have that same interest,” Davis said.
Newly established organizations are assigned to the advisory board best suited to their club’s subject and purpose.
Bhojwani said she was optimistic for the future of the Council of Advisory Boards and hopes to establish a larger volume of clubs on campus.
“I would definitely love to see more clubs out there. I’m a transfer student so I came from a school that had over 600 clubs, and now coming to Georgetown I feel like there are a lot more clubs that can be here, so I’m really excited to be a part of the process,” Bhojwani said. “Personally, I want the advisory boards to be as efficient and transparent as possible and help student activities further.”
