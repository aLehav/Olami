While Georgetown is a popular destination for prospective undergraduates, it is even more popular among law school hopefuls. Last year, the Law Center received 12,404 applications – the most of any law school in the nation – for 592 spots; one in every seven law school applicants nationwide submitted an application to the Law Center.
Georgetown undergraduates in particular feel the lure of the university’s own law school. In 2009, they sent the Law Center more applications than did the undergraduates of any other school. This fall, 44 of the 592 members of the entering class had an undergraduate degree from the university, according to Patrice Robinson, special assistant to the Law Center dean of admissions.
Eight percent of students from the Class of 2009 headed to law school directly after graduation, according to the Career Education Center’s senior survey. Among those students, the Law Center was the most popular option, followed by the Washington College of Law at American University. Of last year’s senior class, 326 applied, according to the Career Center’s pre-law adviser, Victoria Turco.
One of the key factors in stimulating interest in the Law Center for Georgetown undergraduates is the Early Assurance Program, created in 2009 to allow Georgetown juniors to apply directly to the Law Center without having to take the LSATs. Last year, 66 students applied, of whom 10 were accepted, according to Turco. The program is rigorous – it suggests that applicants maintain a 3.8 GPA – but it still appeals to students.
“The standards are rigorous, and the university advertises that fact, but in terms of the actual application, it’s much less complex than the regular application, if only because you don’t have to deal with the LSATs,” Ena Dekanic (COL ’11), who was accepted last spring, said.
The program has a lot of pull for students with firm plans for the future.
“I wanted to apply to law school, and so I thought that the sooner I could hear, the better,” said Frank Bond (COL ’11), a student accepted into the program last year.
Dekanic said that she applied because Georgetown law’s offerings were unique compared to other schools. Now, she is relieved to have her plans finalized.
“I already knew that I was interested in studying law at Georgetown, because of the Human Rights Institute, and the international human rights degree,” she said. “I’m definitely attending Georgetown Law. I haven’t taken the LSATs or applied to other universities. I considered taking the LSATs, but I felt that all the time and effort and energy required to take them could be better invested in something else.”
The majority of law school applicants come from the School of Foreign Service and the College.
The Admissions Office of the Georgetown University Law School declined to discuss trends and statistics dealing with the current applicant cycle, citing a lack of data.

Georgetown graduates on both sides of the political spectrum are on the ballot as incumbents and challengers in elections across the country today.
Eighteen graduates currently hold seats in Congress, seven of whom received their undergraduate education at Georgetown.
In Michigan, Democratic Rep. John Dingell (COL ’49, LAW ’52) is seeking to enter his 29th term in Congress. In February 2009, Dingell became the longest serving member of the House in history. He has held his seat since 1955.
Dingell is accustomed to wide margins of victory in his district. He won his seat with 70 percent of the vote in 2008. This year Dingell faces a stiffer challenge than usual, however, with an increasingly unfriendly climate for incumbents and a tough opponent in Republican Rob Steele.
“This is probably the nastiest climate I’ve ever seen,” Dingell told The New York Times.
“It’s worse than the fights during civil rights, it’s worse than the troubles during the Depression.”
Still, recent polls show Dingell leading with 53 percent of the vote. Steele has 36 percent.
But Dingell is not the only incumbent graduate facing a challenge. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) (COL ’80) has attracted national attention for her election, due to her status as a write-in candidate. In September she lost the Republican nomination to Tea Party candidate Joe Miller, a “Papa Grizzly” of Sarah Palin’s. But according to the most recent polling by Dittman Research, Murkowski leads both Miller and Scott McAdams, the Democratic candidate.
“I’m very fond of Senator Murkowski,” Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming, who contributed to Murkowski’s re-election fund, said in an email. “I think she’s a terrific legislator and has made an effort to engage with the university since [she’s] been in D.C.”
If she wins, she will be the first write-in candidate to win a Senate seat since Strom Thurmond won in South Carolina in 1954.
In Massachusetts’s 4th District, Sean Bielat (COL ’98), the Republican candidate competing with incumbent Rep. Barney Frank, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, is using the surge of frustration with incumbents to his advantage. In February, Bielat trailed Frank by more than 30 points, according to polling aggregation service FiveThirtyEight.com. He has now cut that margin in half.
Georgetown is among the most well-represented universities in politics. Notable alumni include Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates (GRD ’74), Illinois Sen. and Democratic Party Whip Richard Joseph Durbin (SFS ’66), and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) (LAW ’66). The alumni presence on the national political scene comes as no surprise to on-campus political groups.
“Everyone comes to Georgetown with very high political expectations and it’s great to see that you really can go from here to Congress,” Georgetown University College Democrats President Bryan Woll (COL ’12) said.
“If you look at public service as a higher calling, in terms of serving your community and serving your state, that’s definitely something that is in line with Georgetown’s Jesuit ideals,” Woll said. “I think it’s a big part of why so many Georgetown graduates go into public service.”

Diane von Furstenberg addressed a well-heeled and predominantly female crowd in Gaston Hall on Monday night, telling the audience of her life as a fashion designer, all in the hope of inspiring her audience to act with confidence and clarity.
Dean Carol Lancaster of the School of Foreign Service introduced von Furstenberg, characterizing the designer as unusual in that she has been very successful in three different fields: fashion, business and philanthropy. Von Furstenberg also spoke about Vital Voices, a nongovernmental organization on whose board she sits.
Vital Voices’s mission statement reads, “We identify, invest in and bring visibility to extraordinary women around the world by unleashing their leadership potential to transform lives and accelerate peace and prosperity in their communities.”
Clad in a black cowl neck turtleneck and brown, white and black print pants, von Furstenberg said her goal has always been empowerment. “My mission really was to empower women,” she said. “And I do [it] through my fashion, by making nice, pretty clothes that will make [the wearer] feel confident and empower them.” She added that she also empowers women by mentoring them and through her philanthropic work.
“I learned very early on that the most important relationship is the relationship you have with yourself,” von Furstenberg told the audience.
Von Furstenberg was born in Belgium and claims her confidence was inspired by her mother, an Auschwitz survivor who weighed only 49 pounds when the war ended, but went on to regain her health and give birth to Diane.
It was her upbringing, von Furstenberg said, that taught her how strong women are. “I have never met a woman who is not strong, ” she said. “Sometimes they are afraid to show it. . Sometimes they don’t even know that they are strong. And then comes a tragedy and the strength always comes out.”
“I never really liked fairy tales,” von Furstenberg joked of her early marriage to and ensuing separation from Prince Egon von Furstenberg. “The girl marries the prince and that’s the end of it. In my fairy tale, that’s the beginning of it.”
She spoke of entering the fashion industry and creating the iconic wrap dress, for which the brand is still known today.
“There was a little wrap top that came with a skirt [in the collection],” she said. “I thought maybe I should turn that top into a dress, and that became the wrap dress.”
She added, “The wrap dress became immediately, immediately just something incredible, and everyone wore it.”
The true testament to the enduring nature of the wrap dress is its versatility.
“Madonna is a perfect example. You would say she is someone who wears very outrageous clothes,” von Furstenberg said. “But when she goes and wants to be serious, when she launched a children’s book or met the president of Argentina, then she wears a wrap dress.”
Conversely, first lady Michelle Obama wore a wrap dress on the cover of the White House holiday card last year. The same print, in fact, that von Furstenberg had modeled herself in the line’s first advertisement.
Those in attendance were impressed by von Furstenberg’s story.
“[Von Furstenberg] was quite a diva, but she seemed genuinely interested in telling her story and the idea of women’s empowerment. She spoke very personally and told us real stories rather than generic fluff,” Libby Hambleton (COL ’13) said.
The event was sponsored by the SFS, the Georgetown Women’s Leadership Initiative, The Center for Public & NonProfit Leadership, Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity, The Mortara Center for International Studies and Georgetown Women in International Affairs.

Most signs point to Democratic candidates winning the D.C. area’s congressional races and mayoral election, with three of the four congressional districts surrounding D.C. predicted to vote for Democratic candidates.
In the D.C. mayoral election, the Republicans have not put up a candidate to challenge Vincent Gray. Gray, the D.C. Council chairman, beat incumbent Mayor Adrian Fenty in the Sept. 14 Democratic primary.
Fenty’s term was marked by a push for education reform, notably seen through his appointment of Chancellor Michelle Rhee as head of D.C. Public Schools; Rhee resigned Oct. 13. While Rhee earned accolades from both documentaries and publications such as Time Magazine, she failed to win the support of Fenty’s constituents, who voted him out of office despite Rhee’s lobbying for Fenty’s re-election.
Although no Republican is officially registered for the mayoral election, Gray still faces competition from Carlos Allen, an Independent, Faith Dane of the D.C. Statehood Green Party and Omari Musa of the Socialist Worker’s Party.
Congressional elections in the area are also likely to go to Democratic candidates. In Virginia’s 11th District, made up of Fairfax and Prince William Counties, the major candidates are Republican Keith Fimian and Democrat Gerry Connolly. As of Oct. 30, The New York Times FiveThirtyEight Forecast predicted that Connolly will win, with polls showing that 49.8 percent of the votes will go to Connolly and 47.9 percent will go to Fimian.
Fimian, a small business leader according to his official website, is committed to make companies hire more employees. Connolly’s platform is instead based on school reform tax relief.
In Maryland’s 5th District, which stretches from Prince George’s County to St. Mary’s County, the FiveThirtyEight Forecast shows that Democratic House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer (LAW ’66) has a 99.9 percent chance of winning over Republican Charles Lollar. Hoyer is expected to claim 65.9 percent of the votes, with Loller taking only 31.5 percent.
According to Hoyer’s official website, he wants to rebuild the economy by creating more jobs. Lollar instead advocates for low taxes and reigning in government spending.
In Maryland’s 8th District, which includes Bethesda, Democrat victory is just as likely as in Maryland’s 5th District. According to The New York Times, Democrat Chris Van Hollen (LAW ’90) is almost guaranteed a victory over Republican Michael Lee Philips, likely claiming 69.6 percent of the vote compared to Philip’s 27.8 percent.
Virginia’s 8th District, which makes up most of Arlington County, as well as Alexandria and Falls Church, appears to be safely Democratic. Incumbent Rep. Jim Moran holds a 13-point lead, according to his opponent’s internal survey on Sept. 22, the Alexandria Times reported.
The only currently Republican district bordering D.C., Virginia’s 10th District, which stretches from West Virginia to McLean, was rated as safely Republican by both CQ Politics and The New York Times, with the Times predicting incumbent Frank Wolf to win with 62 percent of the vote.
Due to the Senate rotation, neither of Virginia’s senatorships are up for election this year, while Maryland’s senatorial election shows incumbent Democrat Sen. Barbara Mikulski holding between a 56 to 38 percent lead, according to an Oct. 24 poll by Rasmussen.

When Francisco Gutierrez (MSB ’13) was a sophomore at his high school in Brooklyn, N.Y., he had plans to apply for an internship like all of his friends. There was only one problem: The application called for a social security number he did not have.
Gutierrez was 14 years old when he first asked his mother for his social security number, only to discover that his parents brought him to the United States when he was two years old. This is when Gutierrez realized he was living in the United States as an undocumented immigrant.
“It was really hard for me to comprehend at that time,” Gutierrez said. “I was very depressed for a whole year. If it wasn’t for the help I received from my high school counselor and all the other faculty in school, I don’t think I would have made it.”
He faced a new set of challenges throughout high school, and after a long journey to his sophomore year at Georgetown, Gutierrez has become an advocate for the DREAM Act.
The DREAM Act, if implemented, would allow undocumented immigrants who entered the country as young children to become citizens pending two years of U.S. military service or higher education.
The act would allow Gutierrez a chance for citizenship and an opportunity to join the job market after graduating.
For Gutierrez, this issue not only affects him, but also his family, closest friends and countless other strangers.
“I know there’s at least 2.1 million other undocumented students in this country, and it’s so unfair just to deny them an education,” Gutierrez said. He added that many, like himself, were brought to the United States at a young age without their consent.
“On a more personal level, [the DREAM Act] is a very sensitive and touching issue simply because I would be a DREAM Act beneficiary if the legislature were to pass,” Gutierrez said.
Unfortunately for Gutierrez, the 2010 DREAM Act failed to pass in September, leaving the future of many undocumented students hanging in the balance.
Many critics of immigration reform argue that immigrants should go through the process of citizenship rather than entering the country illegally. Opponents of the DREAM Act argue that the legislation would reward illegal actions by allowing illegal immigrants to earn spots at colleges and universities that would otherwise go to legal U.S. citizens. Furthermore, this education comes at the expense of citizens-effectively subsidizing illegal behavior and encouraging more illegal immigration.
Gutierrez said he knows the process is not easy, and that he would most likely be deported to Mexico until he is able to gain citizenship.
“They keep emphasizing this word `home,’ but what they don’t realize is the [United States] is our home,” Gutierrez explained, adding that he would be lost between these two cultures.”I’m actually terrified [at the thought] of going back [to Mexico]. I’ve actually lost some of my Spanish, so I can’t speak it fluently.”
Gutierrez added that process takes years, and there is always the possibility that he could be denied.
Alma Huerta (SFS ’13) knows firsthand the challenges associated with applying for citizenship. Huerta, who is a legal resident, is currently undergoing the process to be granted citizenship.
“Getting U.S. citizenship was never easy, and it was made worse by the situation with 9/11,” Huerta said. “Getting started on the process requires you to get an official pardon from the government .. This costs more money than immigrants usually have, and they are usually tricked by lawyers pretending they can side-pass this step.”
Huerta added that for those who wish to immigrate legally, it takes years to process. They are also faced with people analyzing every part of their lives.
“Basically, it’s an emotionally and monetarily draining process. The DREAM Act would give so many students that are, for all intents and purposes, American the ability to go to pursue higher education. It would give them back the American dream, and the [United States] can only benefit from having more highly skilled workers in our labor force.”
Gutierrez, along with a group of student activists, has coordinated a table in Red Square where students can send letters to their senators encouraging them to support the act. The issue is so important to Gutierrez that by coming out about his immigration status, he risks facing deportation. Still, he said, it’s worth it to show others that there is hope.
“I remember last year [being on campus] was so surreal. I couldn’t believe I was actually walking on campus with the sons and daughters of some of the elites of the world,” Gutierrez said.
“I am so grateful to be here, and that [is] exactly why I want to go back to my community back in Brooklyn and to be able to inform people that you don’t have to drop out of high school because you don’t have a certain status. . I want to let them know they have options, and Georgetown University is one of them.”
For Gutierrez and the millions who are currently facing this challenge, the road is hard.
“I’m not asking for money,” Gutierrez said. “I’m just asking [that people] see the humanity behind the issue … We’re humans. Before I crossed the border, before I became what they call a criminal, before all of that, I was a human being and to be treated unfairly and to be treated unjustly just hurts me, it hurts my family, it hurts everyone and that shouldn’t be the case. I’m simply asking to be recognized as a human being and to be treated fairly [and] equally in this country [that is] called the land of opportunity.”

Fears about the journalism industry’s future hasn’t stopped 1,396 writers vying to become “America’s Next Great Pundit.” The winner of the contest will receive a three-month contract with The Washington Post. On Thursday, Connor Williams (GRD ’11), a PhD candidate in the government department, was announced as one of three finalists. Williams has had to make it through rounds of elimination, writing articles such as “Real Educational Reform, Tolerance and Learning to Love the USA.” Williams talked with THE HOYA about the competition, politics and his studies.
What motivated you to participate in the pundit challenge?
I really like the teaching element. What I am really frustrated by is that as an academic, it’s really hard to get powerful people, or even the mainstream of America, to read what we write. Therefore, I’m always tempted and excited by the chance to get a broader audience. I thought any round that I advanced to in the contest would be another chance to have my voice heard across the nation.
How do you prepare for writing one of your pieces?
It depends on the type of piece. For the blog posts, I would try really hard to find something really small to focus on. The piece that I will have on Monday in the Post is a column that I have been working on for a long time, rather than what I’ve been working on before [such as blog posts].
I’m the sort of guy who is shooting out his mouth all of the time, so what I try to do is look at something that I’ve been arguing with people about a lot lately. I try to write about some position that I have taken that a lot of people find interesting or at least provocative.
The good news is that being a graduate student means that I get a lot of chances to argue about politics with other very smart people. I spend a lot of time working on what my opinions are on American politics, and the various political issues we are struggling with now. Therefore, I got a ready stock and trade to make use of.
How would you say your experience at Georgetown has prepared you for your competition?
Georgetown has been very good to me from the beginning. They have supported me with funding but also with the classes that I have taken, which challenge me a lot. I came into Georgetown very sure of myself and what it was I thought about politics. Georgetown has been much more diverse than I ever expected. I was very taken by the many different angles that people have brought to the table, from professor Patrick Deneen to professor Joshua Mitchell and professor Richard Boyce [all in the government department].All the professors I have had have made it very difficult for me to just sit on the very settled beliefs that I had when I first showed up at Georgetown, and I can’t thank them enough for that. The criticism and reflection that my classes have prompted me to undergo have been fantastic preparation for this competition, not to mention, that when I went on the video challenge, the style of the last round, I was more than ready to argue, since that’s what I do for a living right now, in my classes and as a [teaching assistant] for [the class] Political and Social Thought.
You mentioned influence from a number of professors, how much you enjoyed discussions in Political and Social Thought, and how handy your experiences in academia have been. Do you have specific aspirations using your experience in academia and participation in the pundit competition as a springboard?
I really love teaching, I enjoy being at Georgetown and teaching and I think that part of a professor’s life is something that appeals to me a great deal. I also really like people taking me seriously, people reading what I write. Academics can spend months working on articles and years working on books that are then ultimately read by 50 or maybe 100 people. I have actually written a couple of articles for them, and after the first one, they told me that almost 10,000 people had read my article. Because of that, I’m also really tempted by journalism, think-tanks and advocacy, where people would actually be paying attention to me and where I could be taken seriously.
In your teaching experience, how did you feel about the level of political awareness in your students? What would you do to change this if necessary?
The Georgetown student body is very politically astute and very excited about politics, and has strong opinions. Almost everyone is ambitious, being very excited about getting engaged in Beltway politics. But political theory, which is what I study, is often about criticism and reflection, so I challenge my students, who are very confident and ambitious, to not rest on their laurels. They are all very smart, but they often have not given enough thought to the reasoning behind their beliefs. I try to make sure that by the time students have left me, they have a better sense for what it is they believe and why they believe it.
How did you feel about the Stewart/Colbert Rally?
I am really glad that happened, that a more reasonable centrist voice stood up and said the Tea Party is not the only movement in town. On the other hand, I think it is embarrassing that there is nobody else to do it but a pair of comedians. There’s nobody among the Democrats, the Republicans or the labor movement.
It seems damning to admit that we had to reach out to Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert to get this kind of populism going and that’s what people have to admire about the Tea Party. These are people who actually care. Sure there is some corporate money involved, sure they are not completely as grassroots as people maybe believe, but at the end of the day it’s more organized than anything going on in the left and I think that’s embarrassing.
As a former member of Teach For America, how do you think students can be more civically involved?
Teach For America is a great place to start. It’s a perfectly positioned program because on the one hand it has some public funding because it is affiliated with Americorps, but on the other hand it is also a private effort, with lots of philanthropy from private donors, keeping it from becoming a wing of the government. So in that regard it is an interesting way to be trying to promote civil participation without having to be directly government-run.
Another thing about it is that it appeals to a lot of young idealistic students who are finishing up college and who want to make a difference, while being a leader. Teach For America lets them have some responsibility and to get at least an average paycheck doing it. Teach For America lets them go into a really difficult position where they can make a difference and where they can be responsible for whole classrooms full of students, while being community leaders and classroom leaders. It puts an enormous amount of pressure on them, but if they are idealistic and energetic it puts them in the situation to succeed. Everybody who was in Teach For America with me left active and engaged with making a difference in education. I think that’s why I wrote about this for my first piece. I wrote about educational reform because this was something that I not only knew a lot about, but was deeply passionate about.

The Kennedy Institute for Ethics was awarded the coveted Cornerstone Award by the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities on Oct. 23.
The institute was recognized for its crucial role in advancing bioethics and medical humanities since its inception in 1971.
This honor can only be granted to institutions that have been established for over 30 years and must be awarded solely by the ASBH board of directors. The previous recipient of the Cornerstone Award was the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y. The Hastings Center was also granted the award for its work in the field of Bioethics and public policy.
As of today, the Hastings Center and the Kennedy Institute for Ethics are the only two institutions that have been presented with the esteemed Cornerstone Award.
“The recognition from our peers . re-energizes us as we begin planning for our next 40 years,” Kennedy Institute director and associate professor of philosophy Margaret Little said in the press release.
The Kennedy Institute boasts an expansive bioethics library, a highly ranked graduate program and an eminent faculty whose expertise in the field is highly respected. The institute was founded in order to advance both graduate and undergraduate education, to promote research to guide public policy, and to serve as a source of information for bioethics.
One unique aspect of the Kennedy Institute is its quarterly publication of the same name. The Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal further emphasizes the institute’s commitment to open dialogue by serving as a forum for the discussion of pressing issues in bioethics.
Originating from an initial 1.35 million dollar grant in 1971, the Kennedy Institute expanded greatly with the help of additional public, private and government grants. The Kennedy Institute Research Library currently has the largest collection of bioethics resources in the world.
In order to receive the award among her peers, Little traveled to San Diego with Doris Goldstein, director of the institute’s bioethics library, Tom Beauchamp, philosophy professor and a senior scholar at the institute, and Laura Bishop, academic program officer for outreach, library and international initiatives. “It stood out to the committee,” Chris Welber, ASBH executive director, said in the press release. “The Kennedy Institute is recognized as a leading institute within this field, and the board and the award committee felt that this was some long overdue recognition for their effort.”
Ben Burdick (COL ’13) said he considers bioethics a very important field of discussion in today’s modern world. “Georgetown’s recent honor has made me very proud to be a philosophy major,” Burdick said.

When Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart announced their plans to hold rallies on the National Mall last month, tens of thousands eagerly pledged their attendance. On Saturday, an estimated 215,000 supporters descended on the nation’s capital to witness the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear, an event centered on the role of satire and reason in the media.
Georgetown students joined the throngs that came to the Mall from across the country.
On Saturday morning, the Georgetown University College Democrats led a group of interested students, including visiting students from Cornell University’s College Democrats, to the rally.
Beth Goldberg (SFS’12) attended the rally with three friends from Chicago who had come to D.C. via buses organized by students from Illinois universities.
“It definitely met my expectations on the funny and absurd factor,” she said. “There were lots of stand-up [acts], lots of classic Colbert/Stewart theatrics, and lots of entertaining unexpected guests.”
Even with today’s midterm elections, Saturday’s rally did not advertise itself as a political gathering. Instead, the two satirists amused the crowd with nonpartisan jokes and irony and the distribution of the Medal of Reasonableness and the Medal of Sanity. Many felt that the message was one of conciliation.
“Everyone just wanted peace, compromise, and a more united and sane America,” Goldberg said. “That shared goal was refreshing to see, expressed both on signs and in everyone’s interactions.”
By the conclusion of the rally, however, the event took on a more serious tone when Stewart criticized the lack of political compromise and the pervasiveness of the nation’s 24-hour news cycle.
“If we amplify everything, we hear nothing,” Stewart said. The comedian emphasized that in today’s culture, the media depicts Americans falsely and negatively through continuous amplification of images and events.
Prior to the event, Comedy Central estimated that around 60,000 would attend the afternoon event. According to estimates by AirPhotosLive.com, commissioned by CBS News to take aerial pictures of the rally in order to calculate crowd size, about 215,000 people were in attendance. Whether it was in the spirit of Halloween or the afternoon’s festivities, many dressed in costume, including Colbert.”The Colbert Report” host emerged from a “fear bunker” beneath the stage, donning a red, white and blue jumpsuit.
During the three-hour event, multiple musicians entertained the crowd, including the Roots, John Legend, Sheryl Crow and Ozzy Osbourne. As those in the audience listened to the music, many were holding signs that ranged from the witty to the ridiculous.
“I’m an Ice Cream Socialist,” read one sign. Another proclaimed, “I want my country back. Or a pony. One of the two.” Vail Kohnert-Young’s (SFS ’13) said that her favorite sign, “I disagree with you, but I’m pretty sure you’re not Hitler,” accurately captured the spirit of the event.
“I was beyond excited for the rally and fully supported its mission of bringing levity and most importantly sanity to increasingly absurd political discourse,” Kohnert-Young said.
Yet even with the music and lively atmosphere, some felt the rally failed to live up to its hype.
“I thought it was pretty good, but not sure if it lived up to my expectations,” Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) said after the event. “A lot of the humor seemed very forced and too staged, and the rally didn’t know whether it wanted to be serious or funny.”

Georgetown’s Office of Student Financial Services plans to increase funds for financial aid and scholarships by 14 percent this academic year in response to the number of appeals submitted by current students.
This year’s appeal cycle has yielded 400 appeals for more financial aid, down from 500 appeals last year. According to Dean of Student Financial Services Patricia McWade, the decrease is due to greater fulfillment of financial need in the first round of financial aid requests.
According to McWade, students appealing for more substantial scholarships can expect some relief this year due to the 14 percent increase in spending. The office increased spending for freshman financial aid last year, offering packages to 44 percent of accepted students, which resulted in a greater enrollment rate for the accepted Class of 2014.
All students are welcome to apply for increased aid, McWade said, and Georgetown is sensitive to changing economic and familial needs. Some financial differences such as unemployment, salary reduction or unusual circumstances in the last year must be reflected in the family’s spending and income numbers in order for the appeal to be honored, however.
Although the amount of the endowment allotted for aid packages has remained steady this year, the Office of Student Financial Services is looking to the 1789 Scholarship Imperative to increase the amount of scholarships available, McWade said. The imperative aims to raise $500 million in
scholarship money solely for undergraduates by 2014. According to the project’s website, this would result in 1,789 $25,000 philanthropic scholarships annually. So far in 2010, 692 scholarships have been awarded to students.
Although Georgetown’s endowment has returned to $1 billion this year, the money raised for the initiative will not be available for five years.

RJ takes full advantage of Lauinger Library, but he is not a Georgetown faculty member or student. As if to prove that he does in fact belong in the main campus library, he pulled the government-issued ID that grants him daytime library access from his tattered, Ziploc-bag wallet.
“I am a citizen of the United States in transit who is visiting his capital,” RJ explained, grinning from behind his full gray beard and adjusting his gray woolen cap.
While Lauinger invites the general public – anyone with a government-issued ID as well as high school students and children accompanied by adults – to utilize its resources from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m., a growing influx of public patrons prompted the library to tighten its policy shortly before the start of this academic year.
Beginning Aug. 5, Lauinger restricted access to most of its computers to Georgetown faculty and staff with a net ID. The practice of limited access is not uncommon for universities in high-traffic urban areas. Both The George Washington University and Columbia have closed university libraries.
“We want to be good neighbors, given our Jesuit and Catholic values,” said John Buschman, associate university librarian for scholarly resources and services. “But ultimately, our primary concern is meeting the needs of Georgetown students and faculty.”
Since administrators clamped down on public access, the staff at Gelardin New Media Center, home to the largest computer lab on campus, has noticed a difference. Now, all of the lab’s public computers are restricted access, leaving only the VCRs and DVD players open to outside users.
“We had a lot of people who came to just hang out on the computers,” said Timothy Cash, Gelardin multimedia specialist.
While Georgetown faculty and students have always taken precedence over public patrons, any disputes over use of computers or DVD players rarely surface now, according to Gelardin users and employees.
Historically, most of Gelardin’s public patrons have been students from other universities, independent researchers and people from the Georgetown neighborhood.
A former school principal, RJ can often be found on the second floor of Lauinger on a computer or reading at a table outside The Midnight Mug. But he is not just here to pass the time. Public education is his passion, and RJ uses Lauinger’s resources to research and draft a makeshift report on what he calls “things that look unusual,” looking for creative ways to improve the nation’s school system.
Maddie Howard (COL ’12) has been manning the front desk at Gelardin for two years, and has noticed all types of patrons from outside the university.
“We have also had some homeless folks who come here because it’s warm,” Howard said. “There was even one guy who was running a business from here.”
Only a few weeks into her job at Gelardin, Howard was, as she put it, “really spooked out.” One man, after asking to use the desk phone, called Homeland Security and began to forecast a terrorist attack that he claimed would cause thousands of casualties. The Department of Public Safety was called in to escort the man out.
“But that’s not representative of the public patrons who come in,” Howard said.
With the stricter policy now in place, a limited number of computers on the second, third and fifth floors remains available for public use. Despite the reduced number of public computers available, Judith McManus, the philosophy, psychology and sociology bibliographer who works at the third floor Reference Desk, said she does not believe the restrictions have created a shortage of public-access computers.
“They seemed to have adjusted,” she said, referring to Lauinger visitors.
This year, students will not likely have to wait for a computer in Lauinger any longer.
“Now, when I’ve been walking around, I have not noticed students waiting,” Buschman said.
Still, public patrons say they continue to take advantage of the opportunity to use Lauinger’s vast resources.
“I live nearby and I like coming here,” said David, who frequents Lauinger about three times a week. “I’ve used the religion section, the computers, the newspapers — this is a wonderful library.”

Local liquor stores report significant increases in sales of the popular alcoholic beverage Four Loko, and most students praise the product, which is known for its potentially dangerous combination of alcohol and caffeine.
Four Loko comes in a 23-ounce can that contains the equivalent of a cup of coffee and three beers. Comprised of alcohol, taurine, guarana and caffeine, the drink has both accelerating and depressing effects. A pack of four cans costs $2.50, boosting the appeal of the drink for students bound to a budget.
Four Loko has made its way to the Hilltop, with 60 registered locations selling Four Loko within five miles of Georgetown’s campus, 46 of which are located in Arlington, Va. Towne Wine & Liquors and Dixie Liquor, the closest liquor stores to Georgetown, have also begun selling the drink. Dixie has been granted an exemption from a ban on single beer sales from the local Advisory Neighborhood Commissions board. According to a Dixie employee, the liquor store’s sales of Four Loko are still at 100 percent. Employees from Towne Liquor were unavailable for comment.
The beverage has received rave reviews from many Georgetown students.
“I am personally a fan of Lokos,” Kristen Janiszewski (NHS ’11) said. “I think they taste great, which is probably why other people like them.”
Aneesh Gupta (COL ’11) agreed with Janiszewski about the great taste, and noticed its impact on parties.
“I’ve noticed that parties tend to be more intense when Four Loko is present, and they start getting wild earlier,” Gupta said. “But at the end of the day, it’s just another drink that we use to have fun. Nothing special.”
But the unique caffeinated qualities of the malt beverage, which has acquired the nickname “liquid cocaine,” have begun to worry medical professionals and community leaders alike. According to CBS News, attorney generals in states from Connecticut to California are all launching investigations into the potential health risks that arise from Four Loko consumption. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) recently sent letters prompting an investigation of the drink, and potentially calling for sanctions against the drink and its manufacturer, Phusion Projects, to the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission.
uch of the publicity and government actions are in response to the hospitalization of nine Central Washington University students last week due to excessive consumption of alcohol, including Four Loko. The incident spurred an upswing in press coverage of the dangers posed by caffeinated alcoholic beverages.
Central Washington University temporarily banned the drink on campus; New Jersey’s Ramapo College followed suit after 23 students were hospitalized after consuming multiple drinks including Four Loko. The University of Massachusetts’ director of Student Health Services sent a letter to all students, faculty and staff, encouraging students to avoid consuming caffeinated alcoholic energy drinks.
Phusion Projects defended the drink in the face of the negative publicity, stating on their website that Four Lokos are popular products with no inordinate health risks.
“Having coffee after a meal with wine, or consuming rum and cola, an Irish coffee or a Red Bull and vodka are all popular practices. Our products contain less alcohol than an average rum and cola, less alcohol and caffeine than an average Red Bull and vodka, and are comparable to having coffee after a meal with a couple glasses of wine,” Phusion Projects said on its website.
Despite the ongoing FDA investigation into the drink, many students do not view Four Loko as a threat. Janiszewski said she believes that the media frenzy surrounding the beverage is purely an effort to find a tangible scapegoat for college binge-drinking issues.
“Students end up in the [emergency room] all the time for health problems related to alcohol, and I think the sudden media attention to these occurrences is just hype targeting a specific, identifiable product,” she said.
Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service could not comment on whether they have seen any cases
involving Four Loko, but said that they will report any cases involving the product to the D.C. Department of Health.
“The D.C. Department of Health has asked all EMS agencies in the District of Columbia to report any cases involving consumption of Four Loko energy drinks. However, it is important to understand that all EMS agencies in the District routinely report abnormal cases to the DOH as required by state law,” Mary Jane Reen (COL ’11), GERMS director of public relations, said in an email.
Other cases reported to the DOH are ones involving hypothermia, heat-related illness or injury, and pediatric deaths.
Janiszewski said that the problem lies with the behavior of students, not with the product.
“Yes, caffeine is a stimulant, which masks your body’s natural reactions to alcohol so that your body doesn’t realize how much you’ve had, but in most cases, you’re still with it,” she said. “If after one can of Loko you can’t remember what you just drank, your friends are probably already calling you a SafeRides or [getting ready] to walk you home.”
