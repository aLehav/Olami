The Muslim world must practice interreligious understanding if it is to sustain democracy, said president of the People’s Justice Party Anwar Ibrahim, expected Malaysian prime minister, at an event Tuesday.
Ibrahim is a senior fellow at the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding and served as a Georgetown professor of Islam in Southeast Asia from August 2005 to December 2006. 
After more than a decade in prison, Ibrahim and former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad joined together to oust former Prime Minister Najib Razak. The Mahathir-Ibrahim coalition took control of the government, with Mahathir assuming the role of prime minister. At 93 years old, Mahathir has promised to pass down the prime ministership to Ibrahim within two years, according to The Washington Post.
The event was hosted by the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Copley Formal Lounge and was moderated by John Esposito, founding director of the ACMCU.
Although Malaysia is a majority Muslim country, 38.7 percent of Malaysians practice other religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity. The Muslim communities in Malaysia and across the world must embrace interreligious cooperation to fight issues of corruption, Ibrahim said.
“Unlike a more exclusive view about Islam, or Islamic movements or Islamic parties, Muslims in Malaysia realize that we must work as a community of Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists with a clear agenda,”  Ibrahim said. “We want democracy, we want justice, we want to rid the country of corruption, we want then to make sure that no one community will be marginalized or ignored. I hope we can share this with many of our friends in the Muslim world and also the West.”
Ibrahim’s rise in the political ranks of Malaysia as a founder and leading figure in the People’s Justice Party comes after two separate terms in prison, according to The Washington Post. As deputy prime minister and finance minister during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Ibrahim had a falling out with Mohamad. Shortly after, Ibrahim was jailed on charges of corruption and sodomy, which he has claimed were fabricated.
Ibrahim was found guilty of corruption in 1999 and of sodomy in 2000 for a cumulative sentence of 15 years, according to The Guardian. However, he was released in 2004 after six years in solitary confinement because of a lack of credible evidence.
Ibrahim re-entered politics in 2008 and lost the popular vote to Razak after the opposition party, led by Ibrahim, failed to gain the majority of seats in Parliament in the general election of 2013, according to The Guardian. Following the election, Razak sentenced Ibrahim to a second jail term on new charges of sodomy.
Ibrahim, who was released from prison after receiving a formal royal pardon from Sultan Muhammad V in March 2018, thanked University President John J. DeGioia for his support during the time he spent in prison. DeGioia attempted to persuade then-Secretary of State John Kerry to allow Ibrahim to receive medical treatment in a U.S. hospital while he was jailed, according to Ibrahim.
Interreligious dialogue depends on Christian, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist studies programs in Islamic institutions as well as strong Islamic studies programs in western institutions like Georgetown, according to Ibrahim.
“I come here to a Jesuit university and I have a sense that we have a university encouraging these sessions; professors attending and showing their respect and support to the students,” Ibrahim said. “This is to me a great tradition that we can also do towards the Christians or the Hindus or the Buddhists in Malaysia.”
In October 2018, Ibrahim won a parliamentary seat that prepared him to assume the role of prime minister. He won with 71 percent of the votes in the town of Port Dickson, defeating six other candidates.
As a practicing Muslim and expected prime minister of a pluralistic country, Ibrahim highlighted the importance of ruling without bias toward one’s own faith.
“I’m not saying that in order to be a Malaysian I must disregard Islamic values, no; but in order to serve as a Malaysian this is my campaign slogan: To me, to be an effective leader you must be able to rise above and say ‘a Malaise child is my child, a Christian child is my child, a Hindu child is my child.’” Ibrahim said. “Then you past the test, the litmus test, of being Malaysian. If you have any bias, if you ignore the poor of any race, then that is not acceptable.”
Ibrahim’s appearance at Georgetown is symbolic of the kind of interreligious unity that he based his political campaign on in Malaysia, Ibrahim said. 
“And also of course because I am a Muslim, and this is a Jesuit university, to some it may be a contradiction,” Ibrahim said. “I think this speaks volumes, more than books or lectures, by sheer commitment and passion for justice and concern for the welfare of humanity.”

Student residences Darnall Hall, Arrupe Hall and Henle Village experienced a complete water outage Friday night, with the university and local authorities yet to determine its cause. 
The water outage began at approximately 10:30 p.m. Friday and was resolved across campus by 8 a.m. Saturday. Neither the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, which conducted system repairs Friday evening, nor the university is claiming responsibility for the outage.
The university was working closely with D.C. Water to restore water across campus, according to an email sent to affected students during the outage at 12:30 a.m. Saturday morning by the Office of Residential Living.
Although D.C. Water isolated a section of the District’s water distribution system in the affected area to make repairs Friday evening, Marlee Franzen, D.C. Water manager of operations, said the authority was not responsible for the outage.
“We did isolate a main along Reservoir Road Friday evening, but we made sure that the hospital still had service,” Frazen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We do not believe that we did anything to affect the University pressure.” 
The university is communicating with D.C. Water to determine the reason for the outage, according to a university spokesperson.
“We are grateful DC Water was able to restore service and apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are continuing to work with DC Water on identifying what happened and how to prevent it in the future.”
None of the water utilities in Darnall Hall functioned during the outage, according to Darnall Resident Katie Bracken (COL ’22). 
“Around 10:30 p.m., we noticed that the water wasn’t running out of the water fountain; none of the sinks were working, or showers; none of the toilets were flushing,” Bracken said.
This water outage comes after several infrastructure-related issues during the 2018-19 academic year, including the discovery of black mold and elevator failures. Most recently, the university relocated 85 students living in the top floors of Alumni Square because of concerns about the ability of the roof to withstand heavy snow or strong winds.
Darnall resident Lucy Chatfield (COL ’22) was advised by her Residential Adviser to go to the Leavey Center to get water during the outage.
“It was 1:30 and we were really tired and we just wanted to brush our teeth and go to bed, but we had to go to Leavey, which was annoying because it was cold,” Chatfield said. “People were in their pajamas. We ran into a lot of people getting water from a vending machine.”
In the days preceding the outage, a pipe burst and fire alarms malfunctioned, going off inadvertently three times, in Darnall Hall, according to a Feb. 4 email sent to Darnall residents by Darnall Hall community director Tom Mangano. 
Many Darnall students have become frustrated with the frequent facilities issues in their dormitory. The general sentiment in Darnall during the water outage was annoyance as a result of repeated problems in the dorm, according to Chatfield.
Students in Henle Village were also concerned that flushing the toilet would exacerbate the problem during the water outage, according to Henle resident Amelia Walsh (SFS ’20).
“I am not placing blame, but it was hard for us because we didn’t know originally if we could flush the toilet because we were like ‘Oh my gosh we aren’t going to have any water anymore after that,’” Walsh said.  
Although Walsh had never experienced a water outage as a Georgetown student prior to last week, she has encountered a variety of facilities issues as a Henle resident.
“Our stove wasn’t working for a long time, one of our sinks was dripping, one of our showers wasn’t working, a couple of our lights kept going out,” Walsh said. “Once those were fixed, we were pretty excited, so then when the water was out we were like, ‘no!’” 
D.C. Water has offered to work with Facilities to prevent future outages, according to Frazen.
“We are more than happy to work with Georgetown University to troubleshoot their pressure issue,” Frazen wrote. “In addition as a precaution we will check some system valves just to ensure they are operating properly.”

Students urged Georgetown University to disclose the details of the timeline on a solar panel initiative that would deforest 240 acres of land but provide half of the university’s electricity needs at a Feb. 10 forum.
The university is contracting a third party to review the project, a decision supported by student-run environmental advocacy groups.
Samantha Panchèvre (SFS ’19), chair of the Georgetown University Student Association’s sustainability policy coalition, said she sees the decision as a response to the efforts of student advocates.
“It looks like they’re listening,” Panchèvre said. “The way she made it sound to me was that it was in response to the negative press and the concerns that have been raised.”
Students in the forum said they want the university to keep students informed throughout the process. GUSA’s sustainability policy coalition seeks to determine who is performing the review, as well as obtain a timeline for the review process, according to Rowlie Flores (COL ’22), the coalition’s outreach coordinator.
The university reached the solar project agreement with Origis Energy in September 2017 to meet its goal of halving the university’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. La Plata, Md., the proposed site of the solar panels, is located 25 miles south of Washington, D.C., and has been deemed an important bird area, according to the Audubon Society, a bird conservation group.
The Maryland Department of Energy scheduled a hearing for Feb. 27 in Charles County, Md., in response to criticism the project has received from local environmental activists who argue the site holds important ecological value and that Origis should consider other locations to install their solar panels.
University officials maintain that the benefits from the project would outweigh the deforestation in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.
“The US EPA’s public greenhouse gas calculator tool estimates that the proposed offsite solar project would reduce greenhouse emissions equivalent to planting more than 429,000 trees, which is the amount of carbon sequestered by approximately 30,000 acres of forest,” university spokesperson Matt Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Origis is working to address environmental concerns, including with an initiative to plant flora that will attract pollinating insects, according to Edwin Moses, the project’s managing director.
“Our Pollinator Plan will contribute back to the community and surrounding habitat and our Forest Conservation Easements will provide perpetual forest protection, a sound community investment which we are honored to contribute,” Moses wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This amount of solar on this site is an excellent solution for Georgetown and for Marylanders.”
While the forum’s attendees focused on the solar project, students also took the opportunity to push university administrators on other sustainability measures, such as reducing single-use plastics on campus and divesting from fossil fuels.
Student-run group Georgetown University Fossil Free submitted a proposal Jan. 17 urging the university to divest from companies that sell fossil fuels. The proposal was submitted to the Committee for Investing in Social Responsibility, which advises the university on financial decisions.
CISR has not responded to the group’s request to meet in advance of the committee’s Feb. 24 meeting when it will consider the proposal, according to Celia Buckman (SFS ’21), a member of GUFF.
“We worked hard to create our proposal and the bureaucratic infrastructure that enabled its submission, and expect that level of dedication and effort to be matched by CISR in reviewing it,” Buckman wrote.

Is there information on where to find the contractor’s environmental impact assessment?

Ablison says 
November 15, 2019 at 6:53 pm
Keeping people informed should be the standard for most initiatives. Negative press or not, at the very least, if the project makes up for the deforestation like it is supposed to then it isn’t something that should be hidden. These projects should not be out of discussion for reasons like that.
[…] work out. After each discussion, it’s crucial to record what was stated for future reference. Solar Power Battery can be relied upon to offer a recorded expense price quote prior to the beginning of any kind of […]

The Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees elected 14 members to the union’s bargaining committee Feb. 8 as it prepares to begin negotiating worker contracts with the university.
The bargaining committee aims to win a contract that addresses the top four issues identified by graduate employees, including increased worker compensation, dental and vision insurance, expanded health insurance coverage and reduced out-of-pocket costs for health insurance.
The election represents a step towards a university contract that meets the needs of graduate student workers, Chad Frazier, a seventh-year doctoral student and member of the GAGE organizing committee, said.
“We’re all very excited to be at this stage of the process, I mean, this is kind of what we have been working for: the opportunity to sit down at the table with the university and bargain for a contract that really reflects our contributions and really addresses the issues that are important to us,” Frazier said.
The election came after GAGE voted to unionize in Nov. 2018 following a year-long push to receive official recognition as a union from the university. The university initially refused to recognize GAGE as a union because it considers graduate student employees primarily as students, not as workers.
The graduate union held a general body assembly on Feb. 6 to assess the bargaining committee’s future priorities. During the general body assembly, members reaffirmed the outline of the organization’s purpose and shared excerpted results of a survey GAGE conducted among graduate employees, both members and nonmembers of GAGE. The survey flagged the key concerns of graduate workers from expanded health insurance to increased compensation.
The bargaining survey’s results, which are not yet fully available to the public, provided the basis for discussion at the meeting, according to Frazier. 
“Since we won our election last November, we’ve been talking to grads, getting their issues and we recently completed a bargaining survey that we circulated to our members that was designed to identify those issues that they wanted to raise at the bargaining table in a more systematic way,” Frazier said. 
The results of the survey will provide meaningful representations of the needs of graduate students, according to Avram Reisman (GRD ’19), a bargaining committee member in the social sciences.
“I hope that the administration listens to our stories and data collected by the GAGE bargaining survey and we can find some common ground on what graduate employees deserve,” Reisman wrote.
Of the respondents to the survey, the results showed that 69 percent missed or delayed medical care because of inaccessibility, according to a Feb. 6 GAGE news release. The survey results revealed healthcare, including basic dental and vision care, is one of the main priorities of graduate employees, according to Deidre Nelms, a fourth-year doctoral candidate and bargaining committee member.
Graduate students are also frustrated with unclear terms of employment, Natascha Otoya, a second-year doctoral candidate and GAGE member, said.
“There should be clear expectations of what graduate work is,” Otoya said. “We’re supposed to work for about 15 to 20 hours a week but we end up working for much more because the expectations aren’t clear.”
The bargaining committee will work to advance GAGE’s more concrete goals drawn from student concerns highlighted in the survey, Frazier said. 
“They’ll be the ones crafting the proposals that sort of translate those issues that members have raised in conversations with organizers, and also in the bargaining survey—just sort of practical proposals, bottom-line proposals that address issues like healthcare, food insecurity, compensation, benefits,” Frazier said. 
The bargaining committee members are split between discipline categories including humanities, social sciences and natural sciences, mathematics, computer science and analytics.
Voting for the bargaining committee was conducted through an electronic ballot, which closed Feb. 7. Those eligible to vote included graduate students with a signed GAGE membership card who are working as research assistants, teaching assistants or instructors of record during the current semester or who are set to fill one of those positions in the Fall 2019 semester, according to the GAGE website.

Matias Burdman (COL ’21) and Anna Landre (SFS ’21) were sworn into positions on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E by Feb. 4 following a Nov. 6 election.
Burdman and Landre replaced Zachary Schroepfer (SFS ’19) and Mara Goldman (SFS ’19), who have filled the seats for the last two years. Burdman currently serves as treasurer of the committee, while Landre serves as secretary. 
Eight people comprise the ANC 2E, which meets monthly to pass resolutions on issues affecting the areas of Georgetown University, Burleith, Hillandale and Georgetown. After discussing the resolutions, the ANC’s proposals are sent to the Washington, D.C. city government for consideration. Landre and Burdman, who both ran unopposed in the fall, filled seats for single-member districts 4 and 8.
Landre said in her role as commissioner, she plans to fight for accessibility for her constituents.
“While on the ANC, I hope to make accessibility one of my main priorities,” Landre wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This means everything from repairing unsafe sidewalks to working with local businesses to encourage them to become more accessible to potential customers.” 
Individuals with disabilities comprise a larger portion of the population than many believe, and their obstacles should be better addressed, according to Landre.
“Accessibility solutions serve many of these citizens, as well as elderly residents and families with young children,” Landre wrote. “We should promote common-sense infrastructure that works for all, rather than just some.”
Landre also hopes to continue Schroepfer and Goldman’s goal of providing students with affordable and accessible transportation to the greater D.C. area. 
“I also want to ensure that students have access to affordable, convenient transportation from Georgetown to the greater DC area,” Landre wrote. “All too often, it’s easy to feel disconnected, and it’s not financially feasible for many students to rely on services like Uber.”
Burdman echoed Landre’s sentiments, focusing on improving transportation options for constituents in his role as commissioner. 
“I would say that Georgetown is chronically under-connected and underserved when it comes to the whole Washington, D.C. transportation network,” Burdman said in October. “I think that is something that should be addressed and something we can definitely work on through the ANC.”
The main responsibility of commissioners is to bring attention to the issues affecting their constituents, according to Schroepfer.
“Much of the role of student ANC commissioners are to be responsive to specific pieces of advocacy that come as a result of events, crises, or new policies,” Schroepfer wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Landre looks forward to maintaining strong relationships with university officials to address the key concerns of constituents, namely problems with maintenance on Georgetown’s campus.
“On campus, infrastructure and deferred maintenance will be another one of my priorities,” Landre wrote. “I look forward to working with administration to create welcoming living and community spaces on campus now, and plan more for the future. I’m very excited to work with my fellow Commissioners to reach these goals!”
The process for students to be elected into the ANC is a not a simple one, according to Schroepfer. 
Students who aspire to run for ANC with their name on the ballot are required to collect signatures from voters who both reside in their district and are registered to vote in D.C. The signature collection must occur during the summer break period, making it challenging for students.
The policies around signature collection are challenging and can act as a barrier for some students, according to Schroepfer.
“I was lucky enough to be able to come to Washington, D.C. to canvas for signatures, but the current policies that are in place are non-inclusive for students across the ANC,” Schroepfer wrote.
In the last two years, Schroepfer and Goldman helped the ANC pass several resolutions while serving on the commission. Initiatives passed by the ANC during their term include the institution of Georgetown University Transport Shuttle buses that run on Saturday and accessible pathways through construction areas on campus. 
The pair also passed an ANC resolution responding to D.C.’s proposed “Access to Justice for Immigrants” legislation that strongly recommends the city include provisions for undocumented students residing in D.C. to receive financial assistance for legal representation. 
The resolution was a collaborative effort between student leaders and university administration, according to Schroepfer.
“This resolution came from coordination with GUSA, the university administration, and neighborhood leaders who wanted to ensure students who were currently protected under the DACA program would continue to be protected by the Government that represents them,” Schroepfer wrote.

Black student affinity groups have organized a series of events celebrating black history and culture and bringing awareness to present-day issues of race and identity in observation of Black History Month this February.
Among the scheduled events are panel discussions, movie screenings, student conferences and campus outings. This year’s itinerary includes 24 events, more than double the number held last year.
The schedule was organized by the Black Leadership Forum, a coalition of student organizations that plan events directed toward black students on campus. The goal of the month’s events, which are held annually, is to engage in the ongoing appreciation of the rich culture and history of black people around the world, the Black Leadership Forum wrote in a Feb. 7 email to the student body sharing the schedule of events.
“Throughout the month, we will actively appreciate the service, art, literature, innovations, and resiliency of Black people across the globe,” the Black Leadership Forum wrote. “It is important to remember that Black history is not just limited to the month of February, because the celebration of Black history and Black peoples’ contribution to the world is endless, immeasurable, and ongoing.”
The events are sponsored by student groups and organizations across campus, including the African Society of Georgetown, the Black Student Alliance, Georgetown University Women of Color, the Georgetown chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Caribbean Culture Center, the Minority Pre-Law Association, and Georgetown Aspiring Minority Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs.
Regina Titi-Ofei (NHS ’19), president of the African Society of Georgetown, said that events celebrating black identity, while concentrated in February, are also held year round. 
“The month has been very eventful in terms of thoughts and reflections, making sure that we are always cognizant of the fact that February is the month that we must celebrate our blackness, and our Africanness, and our identity as part of the diaspora,” Titi-Ofei said. “More broadly, over the course of the academic year, we will do small things too.”
  Black History Month helps strengthen black communities on campus, according to Titi-Ofei.
“It’s also just a chance amongst black people to find time to mingle with themselves to celebrate their rich culture and to just do things, not to exclude other races, but for them to just have some time to say that, ‘Yes, this is time for us to really have a cause to celebrate our blackness,’” Titi-Ofei said.
This year’s celebrations come at a time when issues of race are at the forefront of campus dialogue. Students have continued to advocate for the descendant community of the 272 enslaved individuals sold in 1838 by the Maryland Society of Jesus to financially sustain Georgetown, with students hanging artwork in Red Square to honor the lives of the GU272 in September. On Feb. 3, the Georgetown University Student Association approved a referendum set for this April on a semesterly reconciliation fee of $27.20 that would go toward a fund to benefit descendants.
This year also marks 400 years since the first African slaves were brought to the continental United States, according to The Washington Post.
Black History Month encourages open-mindedness and a willingness to learn about other cultures, according to Marcus Board, an associate professor in the department of African-American studies.
“Black History Month, one of the initiatives, one of the deeper meanings behind it is to try and encourage people to care to know,” Board said. “Everybody is not gonna be super conscious of every issue or grievance in the world, but our willingness to actually learn about it — that I think is in the spirit and in the core of Black History Month.”
However, Board said that there is still room for further improvement, such as encouraging sustained dialogue about the university’s history with slavery and matters of race more broadly.
Black History Month is an important time to raise awareness about pressing issues faced by black people today, both in the United States and within the university, according to Titi-Ofei.
“We have to come to terms with the fact that racism still exists in a lot of places in this country and discrimination against people of color is real, and we need to acknowledge that as a university,” Titi-Ofei said. “We have miles to go in terms of reconciling with our past.”
The university must also do more to make sure that people of color on campus are heard, according to Titi-Ofei. 
“For a university that claims to be working extremely hard to bridge that gap between different races and to make stronger and more concerted efforts towards their past with the slave trade, I think more needs to be done with having people of color on this campus and making sure that the voices of people of color on this campus are equally as valued as their white counterparts,” Titi-Ofei said. “Georgetown has a long way to go when it comes to that.”

The Washington, D.C. Council gave initial approval in a narrow vote to a bill that would allow Intralot, the operator of the D.C. lottery, to become the sole operator of a mobile sports betting platform Feb. 5. 
The bill, introduced by Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), would give Intralot a monopoly over the creation and operation of mobile-based sports betting in the District. The proposed legislation enables Intralot to run a mobile sports betting platform that would allow residents and visitors to cast bets on games from anywhere in D.C., including their homes or hotel rooms.
Titled the Sports Wagering Procurement Practices Reform Exemption Act of 2019, the bill would also allow private businesses, such as fantasy sports providers DraftKings and FanDuel, to apply for licenses to operate brick-and-mortar sports betting facilities throughout D.C. These facilities would not be allowed within two blocks of four stadiums and arenas that were granted unique privileges, including Nationals Park, Audi Field, Capital One Arena and St. Elizabeths East Entertainment and Sports Arena.
As a result of legalized sports betting, D.C. would take in money through license fees and a 10 percent tax on betting facilities’ earnings. The legislation could bring the District approximately $92 million over the next four years, according to D.C. radio station WAMU. 
One million dollars of proceeds raised annually from sports betting would go to toward expanding affordable child care options in D.C., and funding violence prevention programs under the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results Act, which uses a public health approach to reduce violence. An additional $200,000 would help fund gambling addiction treatment, according to The Washington Post.
By opening up the market to multiple apps offered by private operators, D.C.’s revenue from legal sports betting would drop to $26 million over the same period, according to WAMU. However, private operators such as FanDuel believe privately-run apps will generate more money for the District because a competitive market will enable more betting, according to DCist.
FanDuel has hired local consultants to speak with every member on the D.C. Council to persuade them to amend the legislation. The company hopes residents will be able to legally engage in sports betting via private companies’ apps anywhere in the District instead of betting exclusively through the D.C. lottery apps, a representative from the company wrote in an email to The Hoya. FanDuel is not likely to suffer significant financial losses if the legislation is passed, according to the representative.
Six council members voted against the bill, including Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large). Grosso is opposed to legalizing sports betting because of the higher risks of gambling addiction among individuals in low income neighborhoods, Communications Director Matthew Nocella wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
This bill comes as numerous states consider legislation that would enable them to gain financial benefits from the sports betting industry. Last May, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a 35-year-old law that had banned sports betting in every state except Nevada.
On Dec. 18, D.C. joined seven states in legalizing sports betting by passing the Sports Wagering Lottery Amendment Act of 2018, which is set to take effect June 6 after the 30-day congressional review period, in which Congress can decide to block the bill. This legislation would be the first to legalize a new form of gambling in D.C. since voters approved a lottery in 1980.
Legalizing sports betting in the District is a necessary step to modernization, Executive Director of the Office of Lottery and Charitable Games Beth Bresnahan said in a Jan. 28 testimony to the D.C. Council’s Committee on Finance and Revenue.
“The Lottery’s current gaming system contract with Intralot, which expires on March 29, 2020, did not contemplate sports wagering when it was procured nearly 10 years ago,” Bresnahan said. “This new contract is essential to implementing sports wagering and modernizing the Lottery.”
Numerous pieces of legislation over past decades that would have legalized various forms of gambling in the District have been introduced but ultimately failed. While proponents of these efforts argued gambling would bring D.C. much-needed revenue, others, including civic associations and faith-based groups, argued these laws would promote crime and pull money from low-income residents, according to DCist.
The legalization of sports betting will help stimulate the local economy and attract consumers, Evans said.
“We take the first steps towards capturing this exciting new stream of revenue,” Evans said in a Sept. 18 news release. “The city should take advantage of our ability to act before the Maryland or Virginia legislatures to create a thriving sports betting market, which will attract consumers to the District and generate more revenue for district residents.” 
The Council has to vote on the bill a second time before it can be sent to D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) for approval. A second review date has not yet been set.

Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia cosigned a letter urging Congress to safeguard the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status programs.
DeGioia joined 400 other university presidents pushing for a legislative solution that protects the recipients of the programs. DACA grants immigrants without documentation who arrived in the country as children protection from deportation, and TPS provides a legal path for immigrants fleeing ongoing armed conflict or environmental disaster to live in the United States. 
The Feb 4. letter continues the university’s public support for the two programs. Georgetown launched a lobbying campaign to protect DACA that included letters to members of Congress soon after President Donald Trump’s administration announced in September 2017 that it would revoke the program.
Trump’s executive order ending DACA originally gave Congress six months to find a legislative solution before the program terminated. Congress failed to find a solution, but a lower federal court held up Trump’s decision. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on DACA, leaving the program in limbo. 
Congress could protect the program through passing legislation the childhood arrivals, commonly referred to as Dreamers. While the Senate passed legislation in 2013, it failed to pass the House. More than 700,000 people are currently protected from deportation under DACA.
The Trump Administration ended Temporary Protective Status for immigrants of different countries in 2017 and 2018, but a federal judge blocked the moves in October 2018.
The politics surrounding DACA have brought about uncertainty for the program’s recipients, according to Arisaid Gonzalez (COL ’21), co-president of Hoyas for Immigrant Rights.
“It’s having to deal with my status and having to deal with academics at Georgetown and social life, so it brings a whole other factor into being able to not just be mentally stable, but also emotionally,” Gonzalez said.
The university provides on-campus resources for students with documentation, such as free legal services through Catholic Charities Immigration Legal Services, which provide pro bono legal assistance for thousands of immigration cases each year, and on-campus advising, as well as through public advocacy.
The university is dedicated to supporting students without documentation, and DeGioia’s action is just the most recent example, according to Associate Vice President for Federal Government Relations Katy Button.
“Georgetown has been and always will be deeply committed to advocating for Dreamers,” Button wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are proud that President DeGioia joined more than 400 university presidents encouraging a resolution for DACA and TPS holders and continues to be a vocal advocate for Dreamers as a founding member of the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.”
While many undocumented students such as Gonzalez are pleased with DeGioia’s letter to Congress and the ongoing support that Georgetown offers them, there is still concern over whether or not congressional action in favor of DACA recipients is plausible in the near future.
Amid the government shutdown last month, Trump offered a legislative compromise that included three years of protection for the dreamers in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a  border wall. The proposal was quickly shot down by conservative and liberal groups.
Gonzalez remains pessimistic after the 12 years of inaction on the DREAM Act, which first proposed protection for the group in 2001. Though DeGioia’s letter is a positive sign, a legislative solution for the recipients seems far away, according to Gonzalez.
“I highly doubt that something will happen, but it doesn’t hurt to have some hope,” Gonzalez said.
The letter comes less than six weeks into the the 116th Congress and was addressed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).
The effects of programs protecting DACA recipients extends further than many commonly think, according to Gonzalez. 
“If something does start to happen with deportations or an increase of border patrol or building a wall, it’s going to start to affect students on campus, faculty, workers, and it’s just going to be a domino effect,” Gonzalez said. “You may not feel impacted now, but you may have a friend that you don’t know is undocumented, because they’re just too scared to come out.”
Associate Director for Undocumented Student Services Arelis Palacios said students are encouraged to utilize the resources provided by Georgetown and to reach out with any concerns regarding immigration status.
“Georgetown will continue making resources available and accessible to undocumented students across our campuses,” Palacios wrote in an email to The Hoya.

The United States should shift the focus of diplomacy efforts to engage with civilians affected by international crises, former diplomats said at a Feb. 6 panel. 
The panel, which was a part of the Lloyd George Centennial Lectures that brought former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to campus the same day, addressed potential U.S. responses to the problems of global migrant and refugee crises.
Hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, the event was titled “The Essential Diplomat,” and held in the Intercultural Center Auditorium at the McCourt School of Public Policy and the School of Foreign Service.
The rise of isolationism and non-state actors poses new challenges to diplomacy, according to Bernadette Meehan, who served as special assistant to former President Barack Obama. Meehan also moderated the panel of former U.S. diplomats.
“When we look at the world as it is, we see an increasingly complicated place,” Meehan said. “The forces of disorder and disruption are growing. And diplomacy is no longer conducted simply between governments, so it’s a whole new landscape.” 
The event featured Barbara Bodine, former ambassador to Yemen; Linda Thomas-Greenfield, assistant secretary of state for African affairs; John Negroponte, former deputy secretary of state; and Uzra Zeya (SFS ’89), former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Paris.
Countries should address underlying issues surrounding international migrant and refugee crises by working with citizens external to government, according to Zeya. 
“Obviously, as diplomats, government-to-government engagement is paramount and is the essence of what we do, but we have to go beyond the borders of power to engage with civil society,” Zeya said. “And by engaging, that means listening, that means empowering, and that means supporting local actors and local solutions on the ground.” 
The level of global migration has risen consistently over the past 17 years, reaching a total of 258 million people in 2017, according to a United Nations report. President Donald Trump has proposed reducing legal immigration and capping the number of refugees allowed into the United States annually at 30,000, the lowest level since 1980, according to The New York Times.
Despite the actions of its current administration, the United States should use its legacy of immigration to defend refugees abroad, according to Zeya.
“We can not roll up our own welcome mat,” Zeya said. “We have our own treaty obligations and really live up to — what I found to be in my own career the most compelling case for America — our story that we are a nation of immigrants. If we don’t live up to that in our policies, I think the ultimate result is diminished American influence.”
To address the changing climate of U.S. diplomacy, the State Department must focus its recruitment efforts on hiring diplomats who are capable of tackling new problems that arise, according to Bodine. 
“If you know the questions to ask, you’re going to work more comfortably in the complexity and the ambiguity that is diplomacy and so much of our world today,” Bodine said. “We can’t train to current events. We can’t train to current issues. We need to educate to a mindset, an intellectual skill set, to go off and deal with issues and problems we don’t even know the names of yet.”
The State Department should also recruit more people of color into the diplomatic corps as diversity can only be an asset to U.S. Foreign Service, Thomas-Greenfield said. 
“It’s the richest element of American culture, our diversity,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Having served in the Foreign Service for 36 years, I saw how important it was as I travelled across the globe.” 
The U.S. civil service corps is 82 percent white and 40 percent female, Foreign Policy magazine reported in 2016. This stands in contrast with a U.S. population that is approximately 76 percent white and 51 percent female, according to 2017 U.S. Census data.
Thomas-Greenfield proposed the State Department reach out to more U.S. citizens by exposing them to foreign service at a younger age before they have already selected a different career path.
“When we start at recruiting at a college-level, we have already lost most of the people that have already decided they are going to be lawyers or doctors or teachers or whatever,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Many of them has not seen foreign service as a career choice. We need to plant that seed early.”
