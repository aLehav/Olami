On Jan. 27, exactly one week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, University Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara interrupted a meeting between students and administrators, carrying with him an announcement.
Trump had just signed an executive order imposing an immigration ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Student members of the Muslim community, called to an emergency meeting after hearing rumors of a discriminatory policy proposed by the Trump administration, were crestfallen.
The order restricted citizens of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya and Yemen from entering the United States under any visa category for 90 days, and also restrained admission of all refugees for 120 days and of Syrian refugees indefinitely, citing concerns for national security.
The ban effectively restricted entry to the United States for about 218 million people, according to a CNN report with data from the World Bank. The order has been challenged by government agencies and the courts, with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refusing to reinstate the travel ban Thursday after U.S. District Judge James L. Robart (LAW ’73) temporarily suspended the executive order Saturday.
According to Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh, about 20 students were affected by the executive order. In a series of interviews with The Hoya, five members of the Georgetown community recounted their stories.

Moved by Empathy
Indra Acharya (COL ’18) had just returned from his job as an advocate for Jesuit Refugee Services, which seeks to support refugees around the world, when he decided to take a mid-afternoon nap. He woke up to dozens of missed texts and calls from the displaced people he worked with, who were seeking resettlement in an unsettled United States.
A few years before the order, Trump’s inauguration and the 2016 election, Acharya was living in a refugee camp in Nepal after his family fled ethnic persecution in Bhutan. He grew up in a chaotic environment, not knowing if he would be alive the next day — a reality that, according to him, Trump has overlooked.
“There is no hope. There is no food to eat. There is no place to call home,” Acharya said. “There are huts that are made from bamboo. When there is rain you’re not going to be leaving there. If it is really hot, the plastic heats up, and you won’t be able to survive there.”
His losses from the dire conditions of the refugee camp are many: His best friend, his father and his grandfather all passed away in Nepal.
Acharya questions whether empathy played any role in shaping Trump’s immigration policy.
“Does he even understand what it means to be a refugee?” Acharya said.
Through the United States Refugee Admissions Program, which has admitted over 3 million refugees since 1975, Acharya settled in Vermont. Arriving in America, he said, was a humanizing experience.
“I was well aware that America had its own problems, and I realized that I was different,” Acharya said. “But in the meantime I regained some sense of hope because I was in a country where I was a human being. Because before I came to America, I was just a number.”
Bridging Two Worlds
Rasoul Naghavi (GRD ’19), a visiting researcher from Iran with the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding and an imam at local mosques, immediately thought of his community. For months, he had asserted in his prayers that there were no borders between the Islamic and Western worlds. Now, he was at a loss for words.
“How would I be able to say the administration is not against Muslims and Iran and all of the sudden I see the rhetoric of the president?” Naghavi said. “The same [is happening] with a student that I am working with. What we say doesn’t matter because the narrative we were saying was exactly against the narrative the president was preaching.”
Naghavi said Trump’s rhetoric is detrimental to the image of the United States abroad. According to Naghavi, it is becoming increasingly difficult to convince his friends that the United States has no animosity toward the Middle East.
“I saw the United States only under Obama, and the narrative that he had was that you’re welcome here, no matter who you are,” Naghavi said. “The powerful words of a president are able to damage the whole image of the country.”
The Classroom, A Saving Grace
One year and nine months before the ban, visiting professor Mohammad AlAhmad hired a smuggler to drive him and his family from Raqqa, Syria to the Turkish border. He walked through barbed wire and muddy waters with the hope of continuing his lifelong career as a professor of Arab literature elsewhere — someplace where bombs were not raining down on classrooms.
Surrounded by books in his office in Arabic and English on the topics of diaspora, government and the masculinity of Arab society, AlAhmad, who has published works on refugees, questions the logic behind Trump’s actions.
“The problem of this decision is not in how it is being executed in and of itself, but the problem is what is the discourse behind this decision,” AlAhmad said. “The problem is that these Muslims in the U.S. have never posed a problem to American security.”
After enduring dire conditions in escaping al-Assad’s regime, he struggles to find the humanity in Trump’s decision.
“If you have an individual from one of these seven countries who is unfortunately disabled and needs to come to the U.S. for treatment, does this disabled individual pose a threat to U.S. society?” AlAhmad said.
Speaking for a Whole Community
Soon after the ban was announced, Noor Shakfeh (GRD ’17) was inundated with calls and emails from journalists requesting comments on the implications of this policy for the Syrian community. As a child of Syrian parents and raised in the United States, many have looked to Shakfeh to provide insight into the Syrian American perspective on the conflict and its effect on families of Syrian descent.
“I haven’t been able to see my family since 2009, but now they can’t come,” Shakfeh said. “[Syrian President Bashar al-Assad] kind of fractured my family in that sense and then Trump put the cherry on top.”
Inspired by John F. Kennedy and the American democratic values, Shakfeh’s father came to the United States to practice medicine. Shakfeh’s American identity has given her a duty to help her mostly lower-middle class family in Syria — a social class she says is very different in relation to U.S. standards.
“I always felt like I had more privilege and more opportunity, so I felt a sense of guilt,” Shakfeh said. “I want to use my life to try to bring other people the opportunities I have through bettering their lives.”
A Campus United Toward Safer Havens
In the days following the executive order, the Georgetown community came together in solidarity.
On the morning of Jan. 31, students found hope chalked on the walls of the Intercultural Center: “All are welcome here,” the message read.
The next day, about 200 members of the community gathered in Red Square for a vigil to send a message of solidarity to all of those who feel targeted by the Trump administration, including Muslims, students without documentation and members of the LGBTQ community.
School of Foreign Service faculty hosted an emergency town hall Feb. 2, featuring panels of immigration lawyers and other advocates.
University President John J. DeGioia has signed multiple letters and nationwide statements of support for the Muslim community.
In an interview with The Hoya, SFS Dean Joel Hellman opened the possibility of the satellite Qatar campus serving as a place where displaced students can continue their formation. Today, Georgetown remains committed to educating a richly diverse student body, according to Hellman.
“We have a special mandate, a mission. It’s so much more core to our identity as a school and why we were created,” Hellman said. “This school was created for a purpose: Not only to educate and to educate the best minds in it, but we were created around the very themes of globalization that this order really contradicts.”

As the Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump work to overturn or block local District legislation, the Hands Off D.C. organization plans to prepare D.C. leaders to resist federal plans that intervene in local policymaking.
A local effort by District Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), Hands Off D.C. will meet for the first time at the Atlas Performing Arts Center on Monday at 6:30 p.m., with more than 500 D.C. residents expected to attend.
Andy Le, Allen’s communications director, said the councilmember hopes the organization will consolidate support from D.C.-area residents to oppose federal Republican intervention in District initiatives, such as President Trump’s plan to rescind federal funds based on the District’s status as a sanctuary city.
“We have seen signals from Congressional members who want to meddle in local affairs and we have to resist and defend our values,” Le wrote in an email to The Hoya, “The Council was elected by District residents and are ultimately accountable to them. Congress was not elected by the people of D.C. and should play no role in our affairs.”
Over the past month, House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has indicated attempts to block D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) Death with Dignity Act, which legalizes assisted suicide, and cut off funding for the District’s abortion services. Congressmen have also moved to overturn D.C.’s gun control laws.
Le also said he hopes to provide meeting attendees with a list of action items and contact information so they can connect with those with similar interests to continue work on these issues over the next four years.
“This is a marathon and we have a long road ahead,” Le wrote. “There are many issues to discuss with different timelines and success metrics.”
According to Le, Hands Off D.C. participants will decide how they want to address the issue of protecting the interests of District residents.
“This meeting is about action but we’re not here to tell people what to do. We’re just providing a space for democracy and direct action to take place,” Le wrote.
Neighbors United for D.C. Statehood, an organization in support of Hands Off D.C., seeks to increase District representation in Congress.
The District’s 680,000 residents do not have a senator, and D.C. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton is not allowed to vote on the House floor.
Neighbors United for D.C. Statehood, a volunteer group focused on advocating for D.C. Statehood, founder Josh Burch said he hopes Hands Off D.C. brings District residents together to advocate for the policies important to them.
“We want people to come together and believe we can all make a difference,” Burch said. “We have members from all over the District — if people can give us five hours or five minutes a month, we can give them something productive to do.”
Burch said the number of people who registered to attend the Monday meeting gives him hope.
“My biggest hope is that everyone who participates walks away knowing what they can do to help,” Burch said. “We want to prevent Congress from messing with us now and also prevent it in the long term.”
Burch also said residents must remain vigilant and get involved to push the movement forward.
“We want to maintain a constant presence on Capitol Hill,” Burch said. “Each of us has a role to play and we can’t just wait for our elected leaders to act. We need everyday citizens to become actively involved.”
A referendum for statehood gained approval from 80 percent of D.C. residents in the Nov. 8 election; however, all legislation passed by local lawmakers must be approved by Congress and the president, which is highly unlikely given that if D.C. ends up becoming the 51st state, there would likely be two new Democratic senators as well as one new Democratic representative in the House.
Georgetown Students for D.C. Statehood Vice President Maddy Taub (COL ’18) said the organization is important because it has the potential to raise awareness and bring District residents together to discuss future goals.
“The first step is to bring all Washingtonians together supporting Statehood and understanding what rights we deserve,” Taub wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The second step after that will be to get the rest of the United States to understand what D.C.’s lack of Statehood and representation actually means.”
Additionally, Taub said the growing movement for District rights could raise the voices of area residents.
“D.C. citizens do not have a vote in the Senate or in Congress, meaning that we have no say in laws that affect our lives,” Taub wrote. “This movement is important because D.C. citizens deserve a say.”

Julia Marsan (COL ’17), a classical languages major, will appear next week on “Jeopardy!” — alongside 14 other contestants from universities across the United States and host Alex Trebek.
Marsan traveled to Los Angeles, Calif. for two days of filming after an almost five-month-long process to appear on the game show. The process involved an online test, a screen test in New York City and an in-person trivia test.
In an interview with The Hoya, Marsan discussed preparing for a trivia show, the experience of meeting Alex Trebek and the role trivia can play in educating young people.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
What was it like being on a game show?

It was so cool to be on the Sony set. I did see Channing Tatum, that was my big star moment. It was like “Oh my god,” because he has an office on the Sony lot. And it was really cool, you don’t actually get to hang out a lot with Trebek because he knows all the answers to the questions, so he’s not allowed to interact with the contestants when he’s not actually filming. But we did get to see him pull up and he drives a pickup truck. And he dresses like an old grandpa. He wears high-waist denim jeans and T-shirts with various alcohol company logos on them. He’s super, like, a handy guy. Then he changes into the suit and he has this aura of being Alex Trebek, who knows all the answers, and he has this aura of intelligence that he just projects when he’s actually on camera. But off camera he’s very down to earth.
What about trivia is so appealing to you?
I love the validation of knowing when you get the question right. I love learning things, I always have, and getting the chance to kind of show off a little bit what you’ve learned is the major appeal of wanting to be on something like Jeopardy.
How do you prepare?
I just watched a whole lot of old Jeopardy episodes. There’s a light that comes on whenever Trebek finishes a sentence and that’s when you’re allowed to buzz in, so what I did was I just watched a whole lot of episodes and clicked a pen in my hand every time Trebek finished a sentence so I would be prepared. Because at that point, once you get up there it’s not about whether you know the answer to a question or not, because most of the time you do know the answer to the question, it’s more about who buzzes in first.
Can you think of how many episodes you watched?
I was watching like three or four episodes a day for several weeks, most of Christmas break I think I spent watching old Jeopardy episodes, which are mostly on YouTube.
What about the “Jeopardy!” format appeals to you?
I would say the categories are what appeal to me the most. Getting the categories at the beginning of the game and getting to kind of choose for yourself which questions you can and cannot answer. Because there will be categories that you know you’re really good at, like for me that was literature, or reality television, mythology, things that are my specialties, and getting the chance to say, “Okay if I can answer this question I’ll get to answer a question I know I’m going to get right,” and I think that’s what really appealed to me as opposed to just having to answer the questions in order, being able to choose from different categories is probably the big appeal I would say.
Did going to Georgetown prepare you at all for being on a game show?
Just going to class gets me prepared honestly. Because I do learn so much from my major, which helps a lot, I’m a classical languages major, and classics is so underrated, I would say, in terms of how much it helps you with trivia. Because in all my classes I learn things about history and literature and arts and culture, that generally just helps me in all different areas of study.
Do you see any day-to-day life applications for trivia besides “Jeopardy!”?
I’m teaching next year in the Milwaukee area. I’m going to be working as a teacher’s aide at a school in Milwaukee, which is where my family lives. But I would say for me it’s not so much about the act of playing the games of trivia, but more about learning fun facts, which is something I’ve always really loved. I’ve always been the kind of person who tells you what is on my Snapple cap. You know, “Hey, did you know that a gold wire can be stretched 50 feet wide from one ounce of gold?” Just little things like that, silly things. I love sharing that, and I honestly think that learning things in the format of trivia helps you remember them, especially when you answer a question correctly in trivia. Because it gives you a sense of pride in knowing the answer to that question, I think it helps it stick in your memory. I think that’s why trivia games are so much fun to play in classrooms with younger children, because they get such a kick out of not only the competitive nature of trivia games, but also the pride that they take in getting to learn things that are different besides than just through a written test.
Is “Jeopardy!” your favorite game show?
I mean, it is now! There were some people at the Jeopardy games who were like “Oh, I’ve been watching Jeopardy every day since I was in middle school,” and I was not one of those people. I didn’t know that much about how to bet or what the format of the game was, but it is definitely now my favorite game show because I’ve been on it and I won money.

Washington, D.C., is the fourth-best city to live in the United States based on factors such as quality of life and desirability, according to a study from U.S. News and World Report released Tuesday, despite reports of an increase in racial and economic inequality across the city.
The “2017 Best Places to Live” report placed the District only behind Austin, Texas; Denver, Colo.; and San Jose, Calif. The 100-city ranking consisted of a scoring system that ranked each city out of a total 10 points as an average of five categories. D.C. recorded 7.3 points compared to Austin’s 7.8.
While recognizing that the District’s cost of living is above the national average — with the average cost to buy a home at $371,772 compared to the nation’s average of $211,731 — the report cites the attractions of living in the nation’s capital, including monuments, museums and national landmarks.
Additionally, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s performance, diversity in the city and the cherry blossom season are among the assets listed in the description of life in D.C. included in the report.
“The D.C. population is diverse, with the area’s strong job market attracting people from around the world. Cultural variation can be seen throughout the metro area, from the colorful Chinatown archway to the Ethiopian and Latin American restaurants lining Adams Morgan’s streets,” the report reads.
D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute Executive Director Ed Lazere also noted the vibrancy of the city, but said that the attractiveness of living in the District does not apply equally to all its residents.
“I would say that D.C. is a booming and vibrant city, and that D.C. government has done a lot to invest in the quality of life — schools, libraries, parks, health care and more. But the benefits clearly are not equally shared, and in fact many residents have become victims of D.C.’s growth, rather than beneficiaries,” Lazere wrote in an email to The Hoya. “More families are homeless, more are spending upwards of 80 percent of their income for housing, and incomes are not rising for any group other than college educated residents.”
A December 2016 report from the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that Washington ranks No. 1 in rates of homelessness among the 32 cities it studied, with a significant increase in homelessness between 2009 and 2016. A study from the Urban Institute released in October 2016 called “The Color of Wealth in the Nation’s Capital,” also showed that white households in the District have a net worth that is 81 times greater than that of black households.
Jessica Chilin-Hernández, who works at the Georgetown Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor and advises Alternative Spring Break program Worker Justice D.C., said the District’s historic ties to the black community have been forgotten as gentrification accelerates.
“It is important to remember that D.C. was the first city in our country to have an African American majority. Yet as of 2011, this is no longer the case. Revitalization projects have driven out long-time residents of historically black neighborhoods such as Shaw and Petworth,” Chilin-Hernández wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Rent and property taxes in these neighborhoods have increased dramatically over the last decade.”
The Georgetown neighborhood is an example of the report’s description of the city’s attractiveness due to its residential areas and diverse commercial districts, according to Georgetown Business Improvement District Communications Director Lauren Boston.
“From the historic C&O Canal to unique small businesses on Wisconsin Avenue, world-class shopping on M Street, amazing dining in every direction, and a recreational paradise on the waterfront, Georgetown represents the very best that the city as a whole has to offer,” Boston wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is a vibrant community, with engaged, caring and happy residents, employees, students, locals and tourists alike.”
U.S. News used indexes on job markets, value, quality of life, desirability and net migration in its ranking. Each factor was weighted in the total score based on a nationwide public survey on the importance of each.
The job market index, which accounted for 20 percent of the total score, included the unemployment rate and average salary. The value index looked at blended median annual household income and blended annual cost of living and made up 25 percent of the score. The quality of life index was 30 percent of the score and included the factors of crime rates, quality and availability of health care, quality of education, well-being and commute time. The desirability index was 15 percent of the total score while net migration into D.C. was 10 percent.
Surveys like U.S. News’ do not take into account the quality of life of all D.C. residents, according to Eliza McCurdy (COL ’17), who participated in a project with Carlo Izzo (COL ’17) as part of their “Research Methods in Justice and Peace” class to outline the dangers that homeless residents face when temperatures drop. They collaborated with the Center for Social Justice and the Georgetown Ministry Center to create an interactive map of services in the District for individuals experiencing homelessness.
“Clearly reports like that ask only about the quality of life of residents who have permanent addresses. In fact, most of our Georgetown community only consider property owners to be our neighbors,” McCurdy wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Izzo added that the U.S. News report overlooks the areas of the District that are seen as less desirable to live in. While the report cites public transport in D.C. as above the national average in terms of commute time, Izzo said Metro does not serve all residents equally.
“In terms of transportation, there’s one Metro stop in Wards 7 and 8 so I think it’s interesting what parts of the city people actually care about getting to and what parts people don’t,” Izzo said. “Whenever people think about it, they always think of the monuments and politics and I think they completely ignore the rest of the city, which is the parts of the city that obviously aren’t the ‘best places to live,’ aren’t being gentrified, all those other things.”
According to Chilin-Hernández, to counter the inequality in D.C., policy must account for the differences in marginalized communities living in the District.
“Any policy that seeks to address housing must by default also address, disability, family structure, racial and gender disparities,” Chilin-Hernández said.

Students of Georgetown, Inc. is hosting HoyasForShe week from Feb. 12 to Feb. 17, as part of a larger effort by student to groups to promote gender equality on campus.
HeForShe, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women’s gender equality initiative, named Georgetown one of 10 IMPACT organizations exceptionally dedicated toward the advancement of women last year.
The university contacted The Corp, the Georgetown University Student Association, the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and the Blue and Gray Tour Guide Society to promote this new initiative, according to Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17), chair of social impact on the board of directors for The Corp.
Bank of America Women and the Economy Fellow at the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security Andrew Walker (SFS ’16), said student support for gender equality is critical to ensuring success.
“Part of our goal in collaborating with student organizations is to empower a parallel student movement related to the commitments that President DeGioia made at the institutional level,” Walker wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As a university, our students make us unique in how we contribute to the encouragement of gender equality around the world.”
As part of its participation in the Georgetown iteration of the initiative, The Corp will host a series of events with a gender equality theme, including film screenings and a Congressional phone-a-thon. The Corp will also make donations to women’s programs on campus.
Hinerfeld said The Corp made three main goals for its HoyasForShe initiative: women’s mentorship, health and education.
The Corp has planned daily activities and fundraisers relating to female empowerment next week, according to Hinerfeld.
These activities include a screening of the documentary “Misrepresentation” Monday night in the Healey Family Student Center, an open mic event Tuesday night at Uncommon Grounds, a wage gap education bake sale Wednesday in the Leavey Center and a Wednesday night phone-a-thon at Midnight Mug, where students can call their representatives in Congress about gender issues they care about.
The Corp will also provide resources such as menstrual health products at prominent university locations.
“We are donating $2,000 to place six dispensaries in Regents Hall and the Leavey Center bathrooms, and that will be coming in the next few weeks,” Hinerfeld said.
Hinerfeld said The Corp is focusing not just on educating Georgetown students about these issues, but also on promoting gender equity within its own organization. The Corp has launched a new mentorship initiative to encourage female employees to rise to leadership positions.
“One thing we’ve been doing in the last month is launching a professional leadership development mentorship program,” Hinerfeld said. “Our hope is to connect employees to older class years and younger class years across all different services to help them foster different networks and connections.”
Hinerfeld said The Corp has a new, clearer sexual misconduct policy, hoping other student groups use the new policy as a guide.
“We also have developed a new sexual misconduct policy, and this is something we’re now developing an infographic for, so we can both better educate our employees and also share this with other student organizations,” Hinerfeld said. “Something I personally have seen is a lot of clubs don’t have a specific protocol on how to address a sexual assault when it happens in their organization.”
Outgoing Corp Chief Operating Officer Alexandra Donovan (SFS ’17) said The Corp’s HoyasForShe initiative also led to addressing internal gender inequity.
“It was something we casually talked about, and then when we got serious about HoyasForShe, we really got serious about it,” Donovan said. “It was a good chance to formalize what we talked about it, because it always gets tossed around in meetings, and we all know it is important, but I don’t know if we would have launched this mentorship program without HoyasForShe.”
Hinerfeld said she hopes the HoyasForShe week has a larger impact on the Georgetown community.
“Our hope is that it will be pretty comprehensive, and in some way touch every student on campus to get them passionate about this project, and show that this is not something The Corp is just doing for a week,” Hinerfeld said. “This is something we are making a commitment to into the future.”

While expulsion and suspension rates during the 2015-16 school year are down in D.C. Public Schools compared to previous years, black students are still disproportionately affected by school disciplinary methods, according to a report released by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education.
While fewer than 1 percent of white DCPS students were suspended during the 2015-16 school year, more than 10 percent of black DCPS students were suspended at least once during the same period of time, according to a report titled “Reducing Out-of-School Suspensions and Expulsions in District of Columbia Public and Public Charter Schools.”
The report was published Jan. 6 as required by the Attendance Accountability Act of 2013, which requires the OSSE to annually report the rate of student suspension and expulsion and to recommend initiatives for schools to reduce these rates.
In the 2015-16 school year, total suspensions were down 27 percent in all DCPS schools with 7,324 students suspended during the year compared to 8,400 students suspended during the 2014-15 school year. During the 2015-16 school year, DCPS expelled 99 students, down 26 percent from the 134 expulsions in the previous school year.
The report credits these decreases to new initiatives introduced during the 2015-16 school year.
According to DCPS spokesperson Fred Lewis, the OSSE directed schools to adopt a new set of procedures to address student behavior, including practices such as communicating directly with parents and guardians to address student conduct and creating alternative school settings that discipline students without forcing them to miss school.
However, the report found that there are still discrepancies in the suspension and expulsion rates between white and black students. Black DCPS students are nearly seven times more likely to be suspended than their white counterparts.
At Kramer Middle School, where 98 percent of students of its 247 students are black, almost 42 percent of students were suspended during the 2015-16 school year. At John Hayden Johnson Middle School, where 97 percent of its 290 students are black, 33 percent of them were suspended during the same period.
Lewis said the OSSE is encouraging schools to examine cases of expulsion and suspension and create individual initiatives to reduce these rates at each school.
“The guidance also emphasized implementing discipline practices that are non-discriminatory in nature or application and do not result in a disproportionate and unjustified effect on a particular subgroup of students,” Lewis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
DCPS spokesperson Janae Hinson said DCPS is actively working to close the gaps through programs such as restorative justice.
“At DCPS all means all, so we want all of our students in class every day,” Hinson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Both Kramer Middle School and Johnson Middle School have started restorative practices this school year, so we will begin seeing reductions in suspensions.”
Daphne Chiang (MSB ’19), a member of Georgetown’s D.C. Schools Project, an organization that sends Georgetown students to tutor in underserved District schools, said the rates of expulsion and suspension along racial lines is alarming, and issues such as language barriers should play a role in student discipline.
“Since the majority of students we work with are newcomers struggling to learn English as a second language, there is difficulty in explaining what happened — perhaps resulting in an uncalled for suspension of all students involved,” Chiang wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Instead of blanketing restorative measures across schools, it’s important to recognize the specific needs that need to be addressed.”
Georgetown University Program in Educational Transformation Director Douglas Reed, who is also a professor in the government department, said the gaps in the report show more progress needs to be made.
“While the data seem to show some progress, the gulf between charters and neighborhood schools, as well as black-white divide, means there’s still a lot of work to do,” Reed wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Angelica Garcia (COL ’18), another member of the D.C. Schools Project, said DCPS must strive to address the racial barriers at play in their rates of suspension and expulsion going forward.
“No one would want to want to participate and learn in an environment where their struggles are not recognized and in many cases, outright dismissed,” Garcia wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Education is a powerful weapon that provides more than just a pathway to college.”

Georgetown Student says 
February 12, 2017 at 4:05 pm
Interesting article! The data is certainly concerning. I wonder though, in addition to any racial biases in the disciplinary system, how much of the disparity is due to black students actually having disciplinary issues at school at an increased percentage as compared to white students? Would be really interesting to see how other factors across the racial divide, like percentage of two parent households, family income, and domestic stability affect the underlying rates.

The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library, Washington, D.C.’s central library, will close March 4 until 2020 to undergo a $208 million complete modernization.
The project plans to add an estimated 100,000 square feet of additional space. The D.C. Public Library organization plans to maintain various services provided by the MLK Library over the course of the renovation at the 25 other branches located throughout the city.
While the exterior and first floor of the library, which is located in central Chinatown at 9th and G streets NW, will remain untouched, the new design includes a transparent entryway, a large auditorium and conference center, creative spaces for music production and art creation, a ground-level café, a double-height reading room, a rooftop event space and newly designed spaces for special collections and research.
According to D.C. Public Libraries Media Relations Manager George Williams, the new design will allow for greater community building and more interaction among library patrons.
“There aren’t a lot of buildings in the District that bring residents together. The modernized Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library is going to do that,” Williams said. “It will be a state-of-the-art, centrally located civic hub for all D.C. residents to create, learn, relax and, of course, read.”
The new design was spearheaded by award-winning Martinez+Johnson Architecture, a D.C.-based firm, and Mecannoo, an award-winning Dutch firm. The selection process began in August 2013 with 26 firms applying for the project.
The firms have been approved by the National Capital Planning Commission, the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.
According to Martinez+Johnson Architecture Co-Founder and Principal Thomas Johnson, the conception for the planned design came from a desire to modernize the building, which originally opened in 1972.
“The design has always sought to make the library not only more legible and accessible, but to make it an exciting destination place for a wide band of citizens,” Johnson wrote. “Libraries are about access to information be it through books, periodicals or electronic media, and MLK will always be about that. In our century, we have only begun to use libraries as incubators, workshops and meeting places.”
The library has sought community input in the process since the fall of 2013 by convening an advisory panel of community stakeholders, hosting eight citywide community meetings to share the latest designs, conducting focus groups and surveys with local residents and encouraging public comments through their “MLK Jr. Library Idea Community” portal.
Williams said the planning process included more than 70 planning meetings, 13 focus groups, hundreds of surveys and the input of over 4,000 people, both online and in person.
“Because of feedback from the public, we have a library that will serve District residents now and well into the future,” Williams said.
Johnson said their design was based on four principles — creating space for new technology, upgrading building systems, conserving the historical significance of the building and enriching the influence and memory of Martin Luther King Jr.
The firms designed their four-principle approach in coordination with public comment from the Ward 2 community, library staff and other libraries around the world. Johnson cited the vision of the original architect, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, as integral to their plans, though they plan on focusing on modernization.
Johnson attributed the idea for a great reading room spanning the third and fourth floors to ideas from the public.
“Although we didn’t always agree, we did more often than not, and had wonderful discussions about the widest range of issues, and many suggestions were carefully considered and incorporated,” Johnson wrote.
The renovations also plans to showcase the life of Martin Luther King Jr. by respecting the historic designation of the original building design and creating an open and welcoming space.
While the library is closed, it is taking several measures to ensure that patrons have continued access to library resources, including Washingtoniana Collection, which contains historical documents and books documenting the development of the District.
According to Williams, a planned retail location called Library Express will open 1990 K St. NW to provide services such as the Adult Literacy Resource Center and the Center for Accessibility.
All other locations plan to extend their hours, increase the number of computers in their labs and house most of the library’s collections, DVDs and CDs.

Student groups are sponsoring a schedule of 18 events to commemorate and raise awareness of African-American history and present-day issues of race, activism and identity, in observance of Black History Month this February.
This year’s schedule includes six more events than that of 2016. Among the events planned are film screenings, panel discussions, roundtables and musical performances.
Various events are presented by the Black House, the African Society of Georgetown, GU Women of Color, the Arab Society, Black Movements Dance Theatre, GU Riqueza Dominica, Georgetown Aspiring Minority Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs, the Georgetown chapter of the NAACP, GU Film Society and Caribbean Culture Circle.
The first event, a discussion on race and allyship within communities of color, was held by GUWOC on Wednesday. The events will be held predominantly on weekends through the end of February.
All of the events were planned by the separate groups except for one joint event, according to Black Leadership Forum coordinator Lauren Leavell (SFS ’17).
“Each group within the Black Leadership Forum’s coalition individually plans their own events that their specific organization sponsors,” Leavell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The BLF as a whole comes together to help further sponsor and support the individual events that the various orgs organize. The BLF will also come together as a whole to help plan a combined event that all the organizations will sponsor.”
Leavell said the higher number of events this year was not a purposeful decision, but reflects the current climate of heightened racial tensions and anxiety.
“With the increased racial tensions that are so evident in American society, we as the Black Leadership Forum want to ensure that there are many events and dialogues present on campus to continue to help educate Georgetown’s community on Black History Month and its importance,” Leavell wrote.
African Society of Georgetown President Ibilola Owoyele (SFS ’17) wrote in an email to The Hoya that she hopes the events will help inform the university community about the complex history, culture and contributions of African Americans in the United States.
“I hope Georgetown community members learn about the significant achievements that African Americans have contributed to American culture and history, and about the diversity, the struggle, and the overwhelming beauty of African culture, history, and resistance,” Owoyele wrote. “In this current political and social climate, it’s so imperative that Georgetown fosters a learning environment that celebrates the diversity and blackness of our school, of our country, and of this world.”
ASG’s events include dance and cooking classes and a roundtable discussion on the African identity. Owoyele said the group’s events complement the other groups’ events with a celebration of Africa.
“At the end of February, we plan to hold an event in conjunction with the Arab Society that highlights and discusses the diversity, complexity, importance, and relevance of the African Identity on the continent and abroad,” Owoyele wrote.
According to Leavell, the purpose of all Black History Month events is to share an appreciation for the black figures in history who have made the United States what it is.
“We hope that the celebration of Black History Month causes people of all various identities on Georgetown’s campus and in the community to understand and take the time to realize that Black people and our history is interwoven within the fabric of American history as a whole,” Leavell wrote. “We want to take the whole month of February to honor the legacies of those who have come before us and take their hard work and pay it forward for the advancement of future generations.”

Political tensions are putting progress toward a peace deal between Israel and Palestine on hold according to think tank The Washington Institute for Near Eastern Policy fellows Ghaith al-Omari and David Makovsky in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room on Tuesday.
“What are the main threats right now? I think it is politics. Often, people — they look at this conflict and say that it’s unsolvable,” al-Omari said. “These are difficult issues that I believe are solvable.”
A new student initiative, Georgetown Bipartisan Pro-Israel Dialogue, hosted the panelists to discuss the future of U.S.-Israel relations, for its first-ever event.
The event was co-sponsored by Georgetown University College Democrats, Georgetown University College Republicans, Georgetown Israel Alliance, J Street U Georgetown, the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition and the foreign policy discussion group Alexander Hamilton Society. GBPID Director Matthew Gregory (SFS ’17) moderated the event.
Al-Omari has been a negotiator for the Palestinian Authority and the executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine, an organization that promotes Palestinian statehood in the United States.
Makovsky has served as a senior advisor to the Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations and as the executive editor of The Jerusalem Post.
Al-Omari said domestic political troubles in both Israel and Palestine are making progress on a peace deal challenging.
“On the Israeli side, we see a coalition that is quite right-wing, a coalition that cannot, in its current formulation, actually make the concession that would let us reach a peace deal,” al-Omari said. “And on the Palestinian side, what do we see? We see a divided politic. We see a president who is in the twelfth year of a four-year term. We see a parliament that is also long defunct. We see the Palestinian public — 80 percent of Palestinians believe the government is corrupt.”
According to Al-Omari, although most Israelis and Palestinians believe that peace is desirable, they fear that peace is not possible.
The two sides were able to make progress towards peace under former President Barack Obama’s administration, according to Makovsky, but regional troubles in the aftermath of the Arab Spring prevented a deal from being reached.
Makovsky stressed the success of the Obama administration in improving the borders and security of Israel.
President Donald Trump has made a series of policy announcements with respect to Israel, from planning to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, to charging Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner, who is also Trump’s son-in-law, with the task of advancing peace in the region.
The nature of the situation regarding U.S.-Israel relations in the Trump administration, al-Omari said, is uncertain as of yet.
“What we don’t know, we simply do not know, in foreign policy, at least, in the Middle East, where this administration is. We will not know for a while. Policy is not only made by a president,” al-Omari said. “So, on foreign policy as yet, I am withholding judgment. If I were to judge, I would even say cautiously optimistic.”
Al-Omari said the early policy indications are positive.
“On the Palestinian-Israeli issue, I think, frankly, political things aside, he has shown restraint,” al-Omari said. “He came as a president who was against the establishment, yet, as I look at the practice at the embassy — not moving any time soon.”
Makovsky said it is important to be optimistic regarding the ability to make progress toward a peace deal.
“There’s always, in the American imagination, the idea of American interest and American values,” Makovsky said. “I think what [al-Omari] said was accurate: don’t write things off so fast, because the way our leaders have reacted over the Iran nuclear deal and the other issues where they thought that the U.S. would—they thought the U.S. was going to throw them over the edge.”
Gregory said GBPID is looking to establish dialogue on the peace process with guaranteed Israeli sovereignty.
“The fundamental premise upon which this program is based, however, is actually quite simple,” Gregory said. “Once parties agree to accept Israel’s right to exist as a sovereign state, particularly one retaining its Jewish and democratic character, only then may constructive dialogue be held to determine how best to go about achieving peace in the region.”

The Writing Center launched its application for the second year of its Writing Awards program Jan. 31, expanding to include four different awards of $1000 each, sponsored by U.S. News & World Report.
The awards seek to promote the creation of high quality writing at Georgetown and the editing process through the Writing Center.
The awards began in 2016 as two separate awards of $500 each in support of the writing requirement for undergraduates.
Submissions for the award are due April 5.
The Writing Center funds the award and will select judges for the contest. The writing center will also help edit all pieces.
Submissions must fall under one of four categories: natural and physical sciences, social sciences, public policy and data and computer sciences.
The essays will be judged by a panel of writing center tutors. The submissions will then move on to a second round, judged by a panel of outside experts in the different fields.
Writing Center tutor Sara Carioscia (COL ’17) (full disclosure: Carioscia is a Hoya Staff Writer), along with Director of the Writing Center David Lipscomb, reached out to U.S. News & World Report Editor-in-Chief Brian Kelly (COL ’76) for help with creating the awards in spring 2016.
“We believed that U.S. News & World Report supported our mission to help develop students’ writing to the level required in the professional world,” Carioscia wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Writing Center tutor Caroline Genster (COL ’19), the award draws attention to the necessity of good writing in all fields.
“The ability to communicate effectively and clearly about a topic is an important skill for anyone,” Genster said. “It’s awesome they’re putting this much money into supporting clear writing in science fields.”
Writing center tutor Isabella Perera (SFS ’19) said she hopes the award will grow to encompass a wide variety of topics.
“There is a need for writing in every single subject area no matter what your major is,” Perera said. “No matter what, there is a demand and a huge value to be able to clearly explain what you are doing towards a large audience. It’s something that will transcend through your Georgetown experience.”
Olivia Matthews (COL ’18), who won one of the two awards last year for an essay she wrote as part of her Writing and Culture seminar, said the program pushes students to keep refining their writing.
“It’s a good award to have,” Matthews said. “By making it run through the Writing Center, it’s getting kids who are usually pretty confident in their schoolwork to go to the Writing Center.”
Tyler Welsh (COL ’18) (full discolosure: Welsh is a Hoya Staff Writer, who won the other award in the 2016 Writing Awards program for a 20-page creative nonfiction essay from an integrated writing course, said the award motivates good writing by offering a reward for hard work.
“It’s great to be validated for your work, because writing is so subjective,” Welsh said. “I really like the fact that the Writing Center is emphasizing this culture of writing at Georgetown, which goes unnoticed.”
Welsh said he hopes the awards will increase awareness for the services offered at the Writing Center.
“I’ve definitely noticed that when students come in, they come out feeling better, satisfied, more comfortable about their paper,” Welsh said. “Hopefully this will draw attention to the writing center and the greater writing community at Georgetown.”

Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld announced Monday plans for repairs and renovations for its rail cars starting next Wednesday, in addition to preplanned Safetrack Safety Surges that will continue for the remainder of the month.
Safety Surges are planned outages on Metro’s tracking system that facilitate the completion of three years’ worth of repairs in approximately one year. WMATA has planned 16 total Safety Surges between June 2016 and June 2017 and has completed 11 so far.
The next surge is planned on the Blue Line between the Rossyln Metro station and the Pentagon City station from Feb. 11 to Feb. 28.
According to a Feb. 6 press release, Wiedefeld has committed to having all old and low-functioning cars out of passenger service by the end of this year under the “Back2Good” program.
Metro has begun retiring its 4000-series cars, which are the least reliable cars and were responsible for significant delays in 2016, according to a press release from WMATA.
Since February 2016, Metro has been replacing its 1000-series cars and intends to continue to replace this series together with the 4000-series beginning next week. Both models are being replaced with the newer models as those cars arrive.
According to WMATA, the 4000-series rail cars being replaced are Metro’s least reliable car, and only travel about 27,259 miles between delays, while their best performing cars, the 6000-series, are nearly four times more reliable.
The repairs themselves are expected to close the Blue Line running from Rosslyn to the Pentagon for 18 days starting next week.
The scheduled outages and renovations come after high and low points for the transit agency.
Metro received widespread praise for its service during the presidential inauguration weekend for both the swearing-in ceremonies Jan. 20 and the Women’s March on Washington the following day. The agency increased service on both days and recorded more than a million rides during that weekend without disruptions to service.
However, a severe power failure Monday at a Friendship Heights Metro station caused major delays on four lines during the morning rush hour. Red Line riders were delayed up to 40 minutes while trains were forced to share a track for one stop between Van Ness and Friendship Heights.
A problem with a power switch near the Stadium-Armory station and a broken-down train at the Foggy Bottom stop delayed commutes for Blue, Orange and Silver line riders.
Grady Willard (SFS ’18) takes the Metro to his internship downtown, from Rosslyn to Farragut West. According to Willard, these repairs will not impact his commute since his route also runs along the orange and silver lines.
“Both should be running and maybe a bit more frequently, which will be good,” Willard said. “The only problem is for students who are trying to get somewhere in Virginia south of Pentagon. That will take extra time, but I’m trying to get from Rosslyn into the city, and trains should still be operating.”
Peter Hamilton (COL ’20), who uses the Orange and Red Lines to commute to his internship, said he notices the need to replace older train cars.
“Metro gets the job done. The cars aren’t filthy or anything like that, but there is a very retro feel when you get onto the older cars,” Hamilton said. “It feels like you’re getting pushed back to the 80s.
Everything is strangely carpeted and the seats are cracked. The new cars are super nice.”
Although he says he will not be affected by delays, Hamilton said he knows people who frequently must wait extended times to use the Red Line.
“I haven’t been personally affected by the delays too much, but I did have one of my friends who was waiting at a station for 30 minutes for a train that passes every five minutes, so that’s been a problem for them, but honestly, the service is good,” Hamilton said.
Metro is also amid debates over cutting costs and is considering fare hikes to offset costs it incurred this year due to repairs and extended services, including a deficit from increased service during the inauguration weekend. Over the weekend, the WMATA board met to discuss ways to improve the agency’s fiscal standing, proposing either cuts to service or increased fares.

Two people were arrested Feb. 2 in London for hacking the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department’s closed-circuit surveillance camera system eight days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
About two-thirds of cameras were infected with ransomware, a type of attack that denies users’ access to computer systems unless a form of digital ransom is paid.
In total, 123 of the 187 cameras in the system were affected, including several located along the inaugural parade route.
The United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency listed the perpetrators of the crime as a 50-year-old British man and a 50-year-old Swedish woman. Both were released from jail after posting bail Feb. 2.
According to The Washington Post, MPD officials reported Jan. 12 to the District Office of the Chief Technology Officer that four cameras were not working. The District’s Chief Technology Officer Archana Vemulapalli said the office discovered the devices that had been hacked and removed all software from the system.
Though hackers demanded a ransom, Vemulapalli removed all of the cameras from the District’s interface, cleared the virus and did not pay the ransom.
The U.S. Secret Service is leading the investigation into the hacking, and indicated this week that the investigation may expand to more countries. CBS News reported the Secret Service’s Electronic Crimes Task Forces based in Rome and Paris are now participating in the investigation.
Security during President Trump’s inauguration was not compromised, according to the Secret Service.
The hacking follows the District’s efforts to reduce and monitor crime by providing cameras to property owners in exchange for their registration in the MPD’s database. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) launched the Private Security Camera System Incentive Program in February 2016 to create a network of more than 1,000 security cameras.
MPD did not respond to a request for comment on whether or not these cameras were affected.
According to Georgetown University Police Department Police Chief Jay Gruber, the university’s surveillance system is not connected to the District’s surveillance system and has not experienced a breach.
“The Georgetown University Police Department works closely with the University Information Security Office to implement security measures and monitoring to protect these systems,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Gruber also said GUPD has nearly completed an upgrade to the university camera and video monitoring system.

The obstacles to ending mass incarceration in the United States are numerous but not intractable, according to four panelists at the “How to End Mass Incarceration” panel in McShain Lounge on Wednesday.
The event, sponsored by the Prisons and Justice Initiative, the Office of the Provost and the Department of African-American Studies, featured the first-ever president of the nonprofit news organization Marshall Project Carroll Bogert, executive director of the prison reform advocacy group Sentencing Project Marc Mauer and William Lawson, a former inmate who now works with Urban Preparedness, Inc.
Moderated by Georgetown English professor Henry Schwarz — formerly the director of the Program on Justice and Peace — the panel also included Marc Howard, founding director of the Prisons and Justice Initiative at Georgetown. The speakers aimed to answer not whether or not the United States needs to end mass incarceration, but how.
According to Bogert, the biggest problem with mass incarceration is the power of prosecutors.
“They have too much power in our system, they can decide whether they’re going to charge you with a misdemeanor or felony, and there’s very little review of what they do,” Bogert said. “What drives mass incarceration is people being charged with felonies who do not need to be. How you actually get into the minds of prosecutors and change them, I don’t know.”
Bogert said the problem of mass incarceration cannot be solved just with reforms inside prisons. Some of the most important reforms are social programs that keep people from entering prison in the first place, or returning after they leave.
“If there’s nothing for them on the outside, then as a society we’re not actually handling the problem,” Bogert said. “We’ve got to build up other capacities in our society to deal with social needs, because we are dumping all of it into this system, and this system is overloaded.”
Howard pointed to problems with the judicial system itself that contribute to excessive incarceration. Howard said states that elect judges, a rare feature of judicial systems internationally, lead judges to campaign on fear.
“One underlying element that I think is driving all of this, and is completely insane and American, is the politicization of judicial politics,” Howard said. “This role of politics should be taken out of these decisions; otherwise, it’s all about fear.”
Lawson said one of the difficulties of returning to life after prison is a lack of economic opportunity.
“Most of them come home with high expectations and once the reality hits them that they’re hungry and the people that they are with are hungry — that feeling of having to survive — kind of forces us to do what we think in our minds that we have to do,” Lawson said. “At the end of the day, they find themselves right back in the same situation that they were in prior to going to jail.”
According to Mauer, much of the relevant prison reform in the United States is happening at the state level.
“We have 51 criminal justice systems in the country, in the states and federal governments, so the vast majority of people behind bars are in the state or local prison or jail. There has been momentum in every state to reduce the population, reexamine criminal sentencing, reexamine the drug war,” Mauer said. “I think the momentum that we’ve seen hopefully can continue regardless of what comes out of the White House.”
Howard said the key to a more reasonable justice system is institutions that are free from political considerations and comfortable with risk.
“We need counselors, psychologists, experts, have them be immune to political consequences and tolerate a little bit of risk,” Howard said. “Because there’s always gonna be some risk, that’s part of life. but the way we’re doing it now is just lock them up, warehouse them, throw away the key, and that doesn’t make any sense.”
