This is an updated story. 
A potential ticket announced its intention to join the executive election ballot Jan. 23 after Georgetown University Student Association members Nicolo Ferretti (SFS ’21) and Bryce Badger (MSB ’21) officially launched their campaign for GUSA president and vice president Jan. 22. 
Ferretti and Badger became eligible by attending one of the required information meetings held Jan. 16 and 18 by the GUSA Election Commission. Candidates can still enter the race by collecting and submitting 100 student signatures to the GUSA Election Commission by 11:59 p.m. on Jan. 25. Julio Salmeron-Perla (SFS ’22) and Gabrial Elliott Brault (SFS ’21) began gathering signatures to join the ballot as president and vice president Jan. 23. This year’s election will take place Feb. 6.
Salmeron-Perla and Elliott Brault started petitioning to avoid an uncontested race and represent more student perspectives, according to Elliott-Brault. 
“We thought that it wasn’t fair that there was only one ticket. It wasn’t fair that not all student voices are represented in that ticket,” Elliott Brault said in an interview with The Hoya. “We don’t claim that we represent all student voices, but we want to expand the options that students have. We want to try to make sure as many students are heard as possible, and we think a one ticket ballot doesn’t do that.”
Salmeron-Perla previously served as a GUSA senator from October 2018 to April 2019, working as the vice chair of the Socioeconomic Advocacy Committee. Elliott Brault is the president of the United Feminists Club and mentors freshman in the Georgetown Scholars Program, and she formerly worked as Socioeconomic Advocacy Policy chair in the GUSA executive branch. 
Ferretti and Badger welcome the challenge and hope to have a dialogue with other candidates, according to Harper Thomas (SFS ’22), director of communications for the Ferretti-Badger campaign. 
“The Ferretti-Badger campaign strongly believes in campus discourse and encouraging a diversity of viewpoints, and we would look forward to engaging with other candidates for the GUSA executive,” Thomas wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “We believe that the Georgetown community deserves the best possible ticket for the GUSA executive, and will endeavor to be that ticket by providing a realistic, proactive, and inclusive platform for GUSA.”
Ferretti and Badger were the only pair to put up posters in Red Square alongside staff members at midnight Wednesday to officially start the campaigning period, per GUSA campaigning tradition. Four tickets, including current GUSA President Norman Francis (COL ’20) and Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20), announced their candidacy at this event last year.
Ferretti and Badger will focus on four main policy areas during their campaign: sustainability, sexual assault and misconduct, facilities and inclusivity. As GUSA Executive, the pair can implement initiatives surrounding these issues, Ferretti said. 
“I think I’ve kind of developed an understanding of the realistic pathways through which we can achieve change for the Georgetown community,” Ferretti said. “Advocacy and public service is kind of what I want to do with my life, and GUSA is kind of the best way to do that for my community here at Georgetown.”
Ferretti currently serves as the GUSA Executive’s director of university affairs and has worked with the university on accessibility, sustainability and technology policy. As executive director,  Ferretti helped facilitate the university’s partnership with Capital Bikeshare and worked with the university to offer feedback on the revamped school webpage. He previously worked as a GUSA senator until he resigned to join the executive branch in spring 2018. 
Ferretti and Badger will focus on being proactive and realistic and recognizing and embracing intersectionality, Badger said in an interview with The Hoya. 
“These three core values are how we centered our entire campaign, and it is kind of like what we want students to know about us because that is how we are going to be attaching meaning to our administration — our policy points — and so we are really excited to launch that platform,” Badger said.  
Badger currently serves as the chief of staff for the Francis and Olvera administration, and he also sat on the GUSA Senate during his freshman year. Badger also works as the GUSA representative on the SaxaFund board, a student fundraising program responsible for financing the Hoya Hub and other projects. 
Badger also served as student engagement director for former GUSA President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) when Elliott Brault served in the executive branch. In fall 2018, Badger and Elliot Brault, alongside Rahman and eight other executive cabinet members, resigned to put pressure on Nair to resign amid sexual assault allegations against him. 
In past years, students have conveyed dissatisfaction with student government institutions. Days before the 2019 executive election, an Abolish GUSA movement emerged. Thirty-two percent of the student body voted in last year’s election, marking the lowest voter turnout since the 2007 executive race. 
To engage the student body and instill faith in GUSA, the organization must work toward meaningful, achievable goals, according to Ferretti.  
“Small wins are huge. I would like to have as many small wins as possible, things that students see,” Ferretti said. “Those small wins remind people that GUSA actually does something.”
Feasibility is an important facet of the Ferretti’s challengers’ campaign, according to Salemeron-Perla and Elliott Brault. 
“We really want to focus on tangible goals for the student body, and given our background in GUSA, especially with a focus on socioeconomic advocacy, we believe that we are the appropriate people to do that,” Salemeron-Perla said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The debates for vice presidential and presidential candidates are set for Thursday, Jan. 30, and Monday, Feb. 3.

Students will vote on whether or not to support Georgetown University’s divestment from fossil fuel companies by 2024 in a Feb. 6 referendum after the Georgetown University Student Association Senate approved the initiative Jan. 20. 
GU Fossil Free, a student group that advocates for the university to adopt socially responsible investment policies, began making plans for a referendum in the beginning of the fall 2019 semester. The bill proposing the referendum passed with 19  GUSA senators voting in favor, four voting against and one abstaining, surpassing the senate’s two-thirds voting majority required to put forward referenda. 
The referendum will be attached to the Feb. 6 GUSA Executive election. If students approve the referendum by a wide margin, the vote could be the final push for the university to take action on divesting from fossil fuel companies after GUFF’s years of campaigning, according to Victoria Boatwright (COL ’22), a member of GUFF who introduced the referendum proposal before the senate.
“This referendum is really just to show the board of directors that this is a priority for students,” Boatwright said at the Jan. 20 senate meeting. 
The referendum is the latest phase of years of advocacy by GUFF, which has worked since 2012 to encourage the university’s board of directors to fully divest from fossil fuels. Through previous GUFF initiatives, the university divested from coal in 2015 and from tar sands in 2018. 
In January 2019, GUFF submitted another proposal to the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, which is made up of students, administrators and faculty, advocating for full divestment. GUFF met with CISR in March 2019 to discuss the proposal and answer questions, according to GUFF member Celia Buckman (SFS ’21).
After the meeting, GUFF submitted a memo to CISR that elaborated on potential steps for divestment from fossil fuels over a five-year timeline. At the start of this semester, GUFF had not heard back from CISR about the proposal or the memo, despite repeated requests for follow-up meetings, according to Buckman. 
Since the university had not responded to the student group, GUFF began making plans for a referendum at the beginning of the fall semester to apply additional pressure on the university, Buckman wrote.
“GUFF followed the proper protocol for proposing a change to the endowment, and we feel the administration did not hold up their end of the bargain,” Buckman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “When an administrative body simply refuses to meet with students making a good faith effort to engage them, we will only amplify our message across campus until they do.”
Over the past semester, CISR has conducted further research to develop a response to the fossil fuel divestment proposal submitted by GUFF, according to a university spokesperson. The university expects to receive CISR’s recommendation in the coming days, the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The university reached out to GUFF on Tuesday after the senate vote asking to meet, according to Sadie Morris (SFS ’22), a member of GUFF who also introduced the proposal at the senate meeting. At the meeting, CISR will provide an update regarding GUFF’s proposal.
“We were really grateful to hear from them after fairly limited responses by email last semester and no meetings with us,” Morris wrote. “We are pleased that university admin are taking our campaign seriously and look forward to a productive meeting.”
The referendum proposes immediately freezing all new direct investments in fossil fuel companies. The referendum also outlines a set of standards, coined Clean Energy Standards by GUFF, by which the university should judge companies in its investment portfolio. These standards include renouncing disinformation on climate science, supporting government policies that reduce carbon emissions and publicly announcing support for the Paris Agreement on climate change.
If a company does not currently meet the Clean Energy Standards, the referendum calls for the university to form a working group of students, faculty and administrators to urge the company to align with the standards. By 2024, either Georgetown will have divested from all fossil fuel companies or the companies will have adopted the Clean Energy Standards, according to the terms of the referendum.
The Clean Energy Standards are a strict set of guidelines meant to push for divestment from these companies, according to Morris.
“Essentially any fossil fuel company would not meet the clean energy standards so divestment would be achieved from all fossil fuel companies,” Morris wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “Companies that are in the process of switching to non-fossil fuel industries could keep investment.”
For a referendum to appear on a GUSA presidential ballot, it must either obtain 300 signatures from the student body and approval from GUSA’s Election Commission or be introduced through a current senator, according to GUSA bylaws. Last week, Senator Leo John Arnett (SFS ’22) agreed to bring the referendum forward, he said.
“Honestly, I had heard about GUFF for a really long time and I’ve heard about divestment, but I didn’t really know what kind of steps were being taken,” Arnett said. “Most importantly, it’s something that I support, but I think it was really pretty awesome that they reached out.” 
The university remains committed to stewardship for the planet, the university spokesperson wrote.
“Georgetown plays a leading role in addressing critical sustainability challenges through its academic mission and prudent management of its physical and financial resources,” the university spokesperson wrote. “As a global research university guided by our Catholic and Jesuit heritage, we are committed to engaging the complex issues of sustainability to advance the common good for current and future generations.”

This semester’s five Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service fellows discussed their hopes to gain new perspective by engaging with students and help guide future generations of politics in a Jan. 17 interview with The Hoya.
The fellows include former Congressman Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), Communications Director for Kamala Harris for President Lily Adams, BuzzFeed News Washington Bureau Chief Kate Nocera, co-founder of Torchlight strategies John Rogers, and Head of Public Affairs for Facebook Robert Traynham.
The spring 2020 semester marks the 10th class of GU Politics fellows. The program invites professionals involved in government and advocacy to share their experiences and expertise with the Georgetown community. The fellows host open weekly discussion sessions and office hours, among other events, for students seeking to learn more about practitioners’ perspectives on politics. 
Why did you decide to become a GU Politics fellow? 
Nocera: “It has been wild the past three years, and so I kind of wanted to take a step back and talk to people who maybe aren’t in it as much every day — talk to folks about what the media is doing right, what we are doing wrong, thinking about ways to build trust back in the media. … I have talked to the same people and follow the same people on Twitter and see the same people in the hallways on the Hill who really are in it all the time, which is great — it is great for my job — but getting a fresh perspective I think is important, so that is really why I wanted to come here.” 
Adams: “I think the fresh perspective thing is — you’re gonna hear it from all of us, I think we all have been in politics for a decent amount of time, so I think this is a good opportunity not only to share our experiences with students here at Georgetown, but also hear from them. I’ve been doing campaigns for more than a decade, and so there is a lot that I’ve picked up along the way that I hope that I can be helpful to young people who are thinking about doing campaigns and working on the Hill, but I also know that we don’t have it all figured out.” 
Rogers: “I kind of look back at my own career and see starting out without a program like this and having to find my way through politics and remembering how unknown all of that was. You just didn’t even know where to start or how to start. I just want to give back to close that gap for students out there who may be interested in a career in politics. … Having worked in politics for the better part of 20 years, it is just great to see that fresh set of eyes, and that pure excitement from students is something that I’m excited about.”
Traynham: “I really, really enjoy intellectual conversations and rigorous debate on both sides. I feel as though I become a much more stronger, grounded person when I hear different perspectives, particularly that are different than mine, and so I cannot think of a better place than to be with my colleges here but also here at Georgetown. … My hope is — over the next two months — is that we can almost be a recipient of that and that we can really learn from all of you and from your readers in terms of what you’re thinking and how you’re feeling, but just as importantly how you are going to create a better world for all of us.” 
Crowley: “Including everything everyone else already said, when I was in college, I remember taking a class: ‘How to Run for Congress.’ … No one ever came to the class who was actually a member of Congress and told us what they do and what their experience was. I think that this is an opportunity for me to have that exchange with young minds and ideas and new ideas and fresh ideas.” 
As part of your role as fellow at GU Politics you have to lead discussion groups. Can you all talk about how you decided on your discussion group themes and topics? 
Crowley: “My discussion is “Of The People: 30 Plus Years in Elected Office,” and it’s kind of soup to nuts in terms of my experience of what drove me — what drives people — to run for political office. … What attracted people today to be involved in politics — why do they want to do it? What do you do when you’re successful? What do you do when you’re not successful initially and keep at it, and then when you get to Congress how do you build coalitions, and what are the ramifications if you don’t? Ultimately leading up to why people choose to leave and under what circumstances, and what they choose to do later with their lives.”
Nocera: “Mine is about covering politics when old rules don’t apply. I feel like especially, you know, the last decade, and especially the last three years, norms have been totally shattered in terms of what’s acceptable for journalists to do, what’s acceptable for our sources to do, what’s acceptable for the president to do on Twitter, so just that environment is something that I wanted to take a step back and look at.”
Adams: “We’re going to take a look at the Democratic primary that’s going on. I worked in this one, I worked in the last one, and so my hope is that sometimes it can seem a little far off, and seem a little distant to folks who are just watching it on TV or to students here, so I’m hoping to close that gap and talk to students about what it’s like to be on a presidential campaign, or any campaign for that matter, and to try to look at what decisions campaigns are making and candidates are making throughout the process and to try to help the students understand why that’s all going down the way it is.”
Rogers: “Part of mine is going to be that current event of Iowa Caucus, New Hampshire, Super Tuesday, and then another part of that is on that practical campaign side, leaning on my experience of getting through ads and polling and things of the sort and how to get careers in politics, and just kinda get into a little more of the nitty gritty on the campaign side of things.”
Traynham: “I read a statistic a couple of days ago that 87% of Americans consume data and digital in a new way, and they’re constantly evaluating the way they use technology because it’s always changing. So the discussion group I’m fortunate to lead is around the intersection of technology and democracy, and specifically how members of Congress or future members of Congress, along with other public officials, will communicate with this vast new thing we call the internet.”
American political discourse can be very polar. How would you plan to facilitate dialogues from students across the political spectrum? 
Crowley: “I welcome it. I look forward to that.”
Nocera: “I think we all have had instances in being either in a tough conversation, a tough interview, in my case, or you know, Joe worked with Republicans for many years — you can have a civil conversation and totally, totally disagree with the person that you’re having a conversation with. I think that a lot of the political discourse we see is online, where you’re not sitting across from someone, you’re not engaging with them, you’re not seeing them as people, right? … I think having the opportunity to work out some of this stuff in person lends itself to a healthier and more civil discussion.”
Traynham: “I would hope in our discussion group that we’ll do more listening as opposed to talking, and setting up some ground rules by saying, ‘Please, come passionate to the living room with your thoughts and ideas, but just as importantly, please stop and listen, and listen to the other person’s voice, because they have a right to be able to express themselves.’ You don’t have a right to your own set of facts, but you do have a right to express yourself.”
How would you characterize your initial experiences with the Georgetown community? 
Adams: “I think probably the biggest takeaway — we were here all of yesterday — is just the level of engagement from students who are on campus. These are young people who are showing up not because anybody is giving them extra credit or not because there may be food, but overall, they’re showing up because they’re excited and want to make the most out of their Georgetown experience.”
Nocera: “It was not my college experience to show up to things you weren’t required to do, just generally not anything I’m familiar with. Just generally the fact that people seem like not only eager, but interested in what we have to say and what GU Politics is offering here is amazing to me.”
Traynham: “Yeah, this is a special place, and you guys know that. I mean, this place is a place that, in my view, really reveres and respects tradition, but also is rooted in a sense of purpose. … Even if you’re a biology major, or whatever major you are, it appears that you still show up for things that are important not only to the Georgetown community, but important to the whole entire country, and that’s a really, really special thing that I think is pretty unique on this campus.” 
Crowley: “As of an hour and 20 minutes ago, I got an ID card that says I’m a member of the Georgetown faculty. I’m telling you — I’m telling everybody! I’m excited about it! … This is a premier institution — this is a fabulous place — and you know, getting the opportunity to really be with some really, really, smart young people is all good.”
Rogers: “It’s been great to see how excited students are. It’s just been great seeing the energy level out there, total engagement, super smart questions we’re already getting.”

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate passed a resolution calling on Georgetown University to recognize the Lunar New Year on the official Georgetown University calendar and social media platforms at their most recent meeting Jan. 20.
The resolution, which was introduced and sponsored by at large senator Charlie Wang (SFS ’22) and passed the GUSA Senate unanimously, additionally called for the university to work with Southeast Asian and Chinese student groups on campus to support Lunar New Year celebrations on campus. Senator Peter Hamilton (COL ’20) was listed as a co-sponsor of the resolution.
The resolution will provide recognition of an important holiday for many students and faculty on campus, Wang wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“The Georgetown administration does not formally recognize the Lunar New Year on its calendar nor on its social media platforms,” Wang wrote. “A significant amount of student and staff population on campus are people of Asian descent who celebrate the annual Lunar New Year. Hence, I wrote this resolution to request the Georgetown administration to formally recognize the festival.”
The Lunar New Year is a holiday celebrated in Asia and around the world by people of East and Southeast Asian heritages. Over 450 undergraduate students, nearly 1,700 graduate students and 190 professionals are from the Asia-Pacific area, according to the university website. 
While Lunar New Year is neither an academic holiday nor listed on the university calendar, the university supports student organizations’ Lunar New Year celebrations, a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The Georgetown University calendar is limited to academic holidays, but we acknowledge the Lunar New Year is an important date for many of our students, faculty and staff, and we will continue to acknowledge the holiday on University social media accounts and through other University channels,” a spokesperson wrote. “We also encourage organizations on campus to find ways to celebrate this important date, and we look forward to supporting them in this endeavor.”
Holidays listed on the main campus academic calendar include Easter, Labor Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and President’s Day. Previously, the university recognized Columbus Day as a holiday until two years ago when it was formally changed to a mid-semester holiday.
Wang plans to continue pushing university’s administrator to consider the measure because of the increasing support by student affinity groups, he said. 
“My resolution has gained the support from the wider Asian cultural clubs and communities on campus, and I have already reached out to Todd Olson, the Vice President of Student Affairs, for further action,” Wang wrote.
In the past, the university has recognized the Lunar New Year on its social media accounts, last year they posted an image of Jack the Bulldog on Feb. 6, 2019, celebrating the start of the year of the pig.
While the resolution is a positive step in recognition of the holiday on campus, past initiatives and further efforts should be spotlighted, Bryce Badger (MSB ‘21), co-president of the Asian American Student Association, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“We are excited that GUSA has taken steps to recognize an event which is so important to many API students on campus,” Badger wrote. “We are surprised to learn that nothing like this has been done before but commend the efforts of Senators Wang and Hamilton in spearheading this as well as Senator Rassieur who co-sponsored a resolution to commemorate API Heritage Month in November.”
In November 2019, the GUSA Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by senator Leo Rassieur (COL ’23) and Hamilton, calling for the university to formally recognize Asian American and Pacific Islander heritage month in November. The measure ultimately passed the senate unanimously.
The Chinese Student Alliance supports the resolution and lauds GUSA’s efforts to recognize the Lunar New Year, according to CSA Co-Presidents Shine Aung (SFS ’21) and Linda Wen (COL ’21). 
“The mission of the Chinese Student Alliance is to promote understanding between the Chinese and American communities here at Georgetown as well as create a community for Chinese Americans rooted in the celebration of Chinese culture,” the copresidents wrote. “The passing of this resolution shows us the dedication of the Georgetown community to this mission and we hope to continue to work with GUSA in the future to promote intercommunal understanding on campus.”

Members of the Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee have circulated a petition through social media this week seeking to establish a Student Empowerment Fund. 
The Student Empowerment Fund would appropriate money from the Student Activity Fee budget  to help bankroll large campus projects, according to the petition. The FinApp Committee would allocate $50,000 from the approximately $1.09 million Student Activity Fee budget to create the fund at the start of the fiscal year 2021, with continued allocations being made in coming years. 
The Student Empowerment Fund would offer students important leverage in negotiations with the university and increase the influence students have over university initiatives, according to GUSA Senator Eric Bazail-Eimil (SFS ’23).
“Money speaks when you can negotiate on a project and get what you need,” Bazail-Eimil said in an interview with The Hoya. “Money shows that students would be interested in it, that students have power there and want to be engaged with the decision to spend that money overall.”
In 2001, GUSA began setting aside funds from the Student Activity Fee to sustain club funding in the long term, according to the Georgetown University website. GUSA began apportioning these funds to campus projects in 2010; the $2 million fund was then designated to help establish the Healey Family Student Center in 2011. 
The goal of the Student Empowerment Fund would be to emulate this success, according to Bazail-Eimil.
“We envision it to look sort of like what happened when GUSA dissolved the first student endowment to help create the Healey Family Student Center,” Bazail-Eimil said. “Our end goal would be ultimately that we have that money and follow that similar role, where we can get involved in these projects, hold the administration accountable and then also advise them on what students want out of the spaces they are creating.”
The fund is expected to grow from $50,000 with continuous mandated annual allotments at an approximate interest rate of 3%, according to GUSA Senator and Finance and Appropriations Committee member Peter Hamilton (COL ’20). After the fund appreciates for 15 years, GUSA will consider student recommendations for where to direct the money, according to the petition. The university establishes plans for new projects and programs every 20 years, with Fiscal Year 2036 designated as the next planning period. 
To implement the fund, the GUSA Senate would have to pass bylaws outlining the structure of the fund, according to Hamilton. However, organizers decided to first launch the petition to gauge student support for the initiative. Hamilton did not disclose how many students have signed the petition. 
Ultimately, the fund would grant future students more power in campus affairs and planning, according to FinApp Committee Chair and Senator Juliana Arias (SFS ’20).
“The general consensus of FinApp was that this is our chance to empower future Hoyas,” Arias said in an interview with The Hoya.
The previous endowment process in the 2010-11 school year involved the creation of a GUSA-appointed Endowment Commission and a university-wide referendum. GUSA hopes to enact similar measures in the future to enhance student involvement in the process of allocating the money, according to Hamilton.
“The idea would be that ideas for spending the fund would be brought to the student body either through a referendum or through petitions, so we get a process where the average student is informed about how the money is being spent and actively supportive of the ideas that are being promoted,” Hamilton said in an interview with The Hoya. 
If the Student Empowerment Fund were to take effect, GUSA plans to create a student committee to oversee the allocation of the money, according to Arias.
“We would create a body in GUSA that would allow student representatives to come over and present their proposals for different projects in the future so that they can use that fund,” Arias said.

As the Institute of Turkish Studies prepares to close this fall due to an inability to secure sustainable funding, students and the organization’s leadership expressed frustration and disappointment over the end of the program’s scholarly work and grants. 
The ITS, established in 1983 through a fund by the Republic of Turkey, provides grants to students in order to pursue Turkish studies at U.S. institutions of higher education, according to the institute’s website. In May 2019, the ITS’ board of directors announced plans to close effective Sept. 30, 2020, citing terminated funding from the Turkish government-initiated trust in late 2015 and the institute’s inability to find replacement income.
The institute provided recipients special opportunities to explore Turkish and Ottoman scholarship. The ITS’ closure has upset many academics and may inhibit better cultural understanding of the region, according to Sylvia Onder, a member of the ITS board of governors. 
“While the closing of ITS is a loss for Georgetown and for the USA, it is also a great loss for Turkey and the Turkish people,” Onder wrote in an email to The Hoya. “American scholarship about the Republic of Turkey and the Turkic world is essential if Americans are to understand and explore the historical riches, the linguistic particularities, and the cultural and natural wonders of Anatolia and Central Asia.”
Funding provided by the program allowed recipients to study their dissertation topics in greater depth, according to Matthew Sharp, a doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania studying the final two decades of the Ottoman Empire. 
“One of the goals of the ITS is to advance research on Turkey’s history and culture,” Sharp wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In my last year of writing my dissertation, I was no longer funded by my University. So, the ITS writing grant was critical for sustaining me and my family to cover our expenses.”
The closure of the program not only restricts access to the field of study, but also can lead to new financial burdens for students studying related topics, according to Johannes Lohnes, a doctoral student at Cornell University who received a grant from the ITS in the 2019-20 application cycle.
“I would not have been able to conduct my research without the grant. Ottoman documents are expensive to obtain in large quantities, difficult to access, and even more difficult to read,” Lohnes wrote in an email to The Hoya. “For researchers on the US side of the equation this is no small tragedy: ITS offered one of the few remaining lines of dedicated funding for long-term dissertation research in Turkey.”
While the institute plans to cease operations in September, it anticipates that it will continue to grant funds up through the 2020-21 cycle. Sinan Ciddi, executive director of the program, will continue to oversee the distribution of funds until September, according to the online letter announcing the institute’s closure.
In the past, ITS has faced criticism for reportedly advancing the Turkish government’s agenda through academia, including avoiding references to the 1915 Armenian Genocide. After the Turkish government withdrew its funding in 2015, historians and anthropologists speculated that the Institute had grown too independent for the Turkish government’s liking, according to InsideHigherEd.
Despite accusations against the institute, ITS fulfils an important mission as the only nonprofit, private educational foundation dedicated solely to the advancement of Turkish and Ottoman studies in U.S. higher education, according to Onder. The issues currently facing the program have arisen largely from foriegn relations challenges between Turkey and the United States, she wrote.
“This is mostly a political problem based on a disrupted diplomacy between the United States and Turkey,” Onder wrote. “Turkish Studies at Georgetown is one of the strongest programs in the USA, with three (and sometimes four) levels of Turkish taught for twenty years without interruption. We are now the only consortium university in Washington, D.C. with a full Turkish program.”
Since 2014, the Turkish government has shifted toward authoritarian rule, according to The New York Times. Current president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has led efforts to imprison journalists and limit the power of his political opponents. 
The current Turkish political climate makes the ITS’ pending closure more disheartening, according to Lohnes.
“I am not privy to the circumstances surrounding the closure of ITS, but I do know that it couldn’t come at a worse time, for Turkey or for the field,” Lohnes wrote.

S.Y.Nielsen says 
February 4, 2020 at 5:11 am
This is a shame to close such an important institute. Especially at such a volatile time where knowledge and research is the key. It is sad that no funding can be found to sustain academic scholarship on important issues in the world, where millions are spent on frivolous causes.

Acceptance of the LGBTQ community is essential, Rabbi Mike Moskowitz said at a Jan. 22 event, drawing from the lessons he learned during his 20-year tenure as an ultra-Orthodox rabbi. 
The event, titled “Rabbinic Practice in LGBTQ Allyship,” was hosted by the Center for Jewish Civilization. At the event, Moskowitz, who is currently a rabbi at a progressive synagogue, spoke about LGBTQ acceptance and allyship within the Orthodox community. 
Orthodox Jewish policies regarding the inclusion of the LGBTQ community typically adhere strictly to the Torah. Rabbinic teachings prohibit same-gender relationships, according to the Human Rights Campaign.
The Jewish community has an obligation to advocate for the LGBTQ community, as it is a community facing prejudice, Moskowitz said.
“It’s a little bit awkward because I’m not trans and I’m not queer,” Moskowitz said. “But allyship is a little bit awkward because it’s predicated on the world being broken. If we didn’t dehumanize people, then we wouldn’t need other people to stand up.”
Amplifying the first-person narrative and getting to know people is an important step toward shedding preconceived notions, according to Moskowitz.
“It’s really easy to hate people and things that you’ve never met or experienced,” Moskowitz said. “The greatest advancements for modern LGBT inclusivity and equality have come from the availability of people being able to tell their own stories.” 
Moskowitz currently works as the scholar-in-residence for trans and queer Jewish studies at the Congregation Beit Simchat Torah, a progressive New York synagogue that welcomes LGBTQ people. Moscowitz is also working toward a doctorate in Hebrew literature at the Jewish Theological Seminary and focuses his scholarship on the relationship between LGBTQ issues and Jewish thought, according to the event description.
While he has three ultra-Orthodox rabbinic ordinations and identified as ultra-Orthodox for 20 years, Moskowitz now identifies as religiously nonconforming, according to his website. 
Overly focusing on religious text rather than keeping an open mind is a barrier to inclusivity, Moskowitz said.
“In speaking about homosexuality, homophobia, more than any sort of text-based argument is, I think, the greatest opposition to progress for LGBT inclusivity,” Moskowitz said. “And unfortunately, like antisemitism or Holocaust denial, it’s not because there’s a lack of evidence, that somehow we could offer one more proof that people would accept the reality.”
The event comes as a part of a larger effort to expose students to a diverse range of voices from the Jewish community this semester, according to Rabbi Rachel Gartner, the director for Jewish Life at Georgetown. 
“It’s long been the policy of Jewish Life at Georgetown to find a variety of ways to bring diverse Jewish voices to campus,” Gartner said in an interview with The Hoya. “This semester we are doing that through robust programming that features guests and students from a range of Jewish backgrounds.”
Jewish Life at Georgetown will host a panel of students titled “Meet the Jews” on Jan. 28 to showcase the diversity of Jewish thought on campus. Jewish Life at Georgetown will also experiment with offering a traditional Orthodox prayer experience Jan. 31, according to Gartner. 
Moskowitz’s message of acceptance was a strong and important message to students, according to assistant professor of Jewish civilization Jessica Roda, who helped bring Moscowitz to campus. Moskowitz’s views on allyship can be extended to other spheres of prejudice and hate, according to Roda. 
“I think that the message that he’s sending is about acceptance of otherness and fighting against hate,” Roda said. “He’s extending it to hate speech and racism, antisemitism and the idea of creating opportunities to know the others and to create safe spaces for multiple experiences, sexual experiences, gender experiences and religious experiences.”

A panel including former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon discussed the move of the Doomsday Clock to 100 seconds to midnight at an event Jan. 23, attributing the updated time to the increasing threats of climate change, nuclear war and a reactionary media climate. 
The Doomsday Clock was established in 1947 by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and the Elders, a nonprofit organization that analyzes international security issues. The clock serves as an indicator of global threats. As the minute hand approaches midnight, the world metaphorically approaches apocalypse. The Bulletin and its Security Board updates the minute hand of the clock on an annual basis based on the severity of global crises. 
To remedy these crises, concerned global citizens need to approach current events through an international perspective, according to Ban. 
“What is a global citizen? Global passion and global commission, I think that is what is needed to be a global citizen and global leader,” Ban said. “Just keep in mind, look beyond yourself. Just try to be ready to extend some helping hands.”
The event was hosted by Georgetown University’s conflict resolution program in collaboration with the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and the Elders. Joining Ban were former Irish President and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, former Governor of California Jerry Brown and Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists President and CEO Rachel Bronson. The panel was moderated by conflict resolution program Director Desha Girod.
The pushing of the clock closer to midnight comes as global political institutions have struggled to reach resolutions to modern international crises, including climate change and nuclear proliferation, according to Bronson. 
“As our board was putting that together, what they really focused on was the worsening challenge but really the capacity to deal with these problems is deteriorating,” Bronson said. “The multilateral environment that is required to solve these big global challenges is being dismantled before our eyes. We are going to need to find ways to collaborate across the globe to tackle these huge challenges that we face.” 
Recent nuclear tests by North Korea and the dismantling of the Iran Nuclear Deal have brought the issue of global nuclear proliferation to the forefront. In 2011, the New START treaty, a nuclear arms reduction treaty, was ratified by the United States and Russia. 
The New START treaty must be renewed by the U.S. House of Representatives to prevent nuclear disaster, according to Brown. 
“No START, no budget,” Brown said. “Force the House of Representatives to vote no on the budget unless Trump signs the extension of New START.”  
International governments also need to take action to prevent climate change and citizens should hold their elected officials accountable for failing to address the climate issue, according to Robinson. 
“On the climate issue, every country should be taking its responsibility and those more responsible should be taking more responsibility. Until we make it uncomfortable for governments not to act, they won’t act,” Robinson said. “We have governments with elected representatives, and elected representatives have a big desire to be reelected, and therefore they’re not going to make hard decisions in the meantime.”
Panelists also addressed how media coverage can influence political responses to global challenges. The media should prioritize pressing issues over immediate shock-value stories like President Donald Trump’s tweets, according to Brown. 
“The media only report what they call ‘news of the day.’ That’s a tweet from Donald Trump, a scandal, an accident, but these big questions like thermonuclear war, that’s not news,” Brown said. “It’s very hard to get these kinds of large ideas as news because if you don’t hear it every day, it doesn’t seem as real. We’re in a type of unreality that is engendered by all media communications who provide information. Our first step is that we have to break through that.”

The School of Foreign Service announced Jan. 17 that a degree from the school will no longer require a minimum number of courses, making the SFS the last of the four schools to remove the course minimum requirement.
Previously, undergraduate students pursuing an SFS degree needed to take at least 38 three-credit courses in order to earn the degree. Students must still complete 120 credits, including core requirements and major requirements. However, the course minimum has been removed, Associate Dean and Director of the SFS Undergraduate Program Mitch Kaneda announced in a Jan. 17 email to SFS students.
The SFS’s decision comes after the Georgetown College and the McDonough School of Business announced in April 2019 that they were removing the minimum number of courses. The School of Nursing and Health Studies does not have a course minimum requirement. 
The university-wide shift towards eliminating course requirements will give students greater agency over their education, according to SFS Vice Dean Daniel Byman.
“Georgetown as a whole is embracing classes that involve a range of credits,” Byman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Under the new system, students will be better able to take advantage of classes with different levels of credit.”
This change marks the second time the SFS degree requirements have shifted in the last two years. In March of 2018, the SFS announced significant changes to its core curriculum, including a decrease in the course minimum requirement from 40 to 38. The changes also included revising the degree program to reduce the number of required major courses and economics courses while introducing a new mandatory science course.
First- and second-year students enrolled in the revised BSFS degree program will no longer have a minimum course requirement following the announcement. The change will have no effect on third- and fourth-year students, who still must take 38 courses in order to graduate, according to a separate Jan. 17 email Kaneda sent to students clarifying the change.
Last semester, the SFS Academic Council worked with the Dean’s Office to bring forward the resolution eliminating the course minimum to the SFS Curriculum Committee, which studies and recommends revisions of the school curriculum, according to SFS Academic Council President Forrest Gertin (SFS ’20).
The proposal was then passed by the SFS Executive Council, the governing body of the SFS comprised of students, faculty and deans, according to Kaneda’s email.
The removal of the course minimum requirement will allow students more flexibility when creating their schedules, according to Gertin.
“This means that students currently enrolled in the BSFS revised curriculum (students with a science requirement) can take one-credit courses to fulfill their 120-credit graduation requirement,” Gertin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Plus, taking lab sciences or intensive languages worth more than three credits will now bring you closer to graduation.” 
The SFS degree requirement change takes into account students who are enrolled in intensive language courses to satisfy the school’s modern language proficiency requirement, according to Grace Shevchenko (SFS ’22), who took three semesters of intensive French.
“I think by getting rid of the course minimum requirement it makes graduation requirements a lot more simplified and properly recognizes the differences between three and six-credit classes,” Shevchenko wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The change will benefit students who could have easily met the credit requirement, but would have needed to enroll in more courses to meet the course requirement, according to SFS Academic Council Junior Representative Siddharth Muchhal (SFS ’21).
“It definitely helps students whose schedule includes more four and five-credit classes, as well as those who want to take one-credit classes, in order to meet their graduation requirement in a more flexible manner,” Muchhal wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
Without a course requirement, fewer students will need to enroll in expensive summer courses, according to Gertin. Tuition for Georgetown undergraduate summer sessions is $1,496 per credit, according to the summer sessions website. 
The removal of the course minimum will not diminish the integrity of an SFS degree, according to Kaneda.
“Several considerations inspired this amendment to the degree,” Kaneda wrote in his Jan. 17 email. “We expect the change to make life easier on all students, without compromising the strength, breadth, and depth of the BSFS degree.”

Poetry served as an important coping mechanism for poet Terrance Hayes after the 2016 presidential election, he said at a book reading and discussion Jan. 21.
The event was hosted by the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice as part of the center’s Readings and Talks Series and Symposia, which brings poets and writers to Georgetown University to share their work. During the reading in Copley Formal Lounge, Hayes discussed his poetry and the inspiration behind some of his published works.
As someone who was deeply impacted by the 2016 presidential election, Hayes used writing as a coping mechanism. After the election, Hayes began work on his book of poems “American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin,” which won the 2019 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Poetry and was a finalist for the 2018 National Book Award for Poetry.
“I started writing these poems in November of 2016, and I thought I was going to need these poems for just the next four years as a way of coping,” Hayes said in the discussion. “Too much language, too many questions, too much noise. But I still write them because we’re still here.”
While many poems published in his book reflect Hayes’ reactions to the 2016 election, Hayes still stressed the importance of writing even if the works are not published.
“I think maybe one or two of the poems that I’ll end with tonight have been published,” Hayes said. “If I only write for the book then we’re pretending that somehow we’re past it and we’re not.”
Hayes criticized the current practice of sharing writing via platforms like Twitter, alluding to tweets from President Donald Trump as an example of the lack of substance behind such forms of writing.
“If you live in a culture where everybody’s writing and no one can write, that’s Twitter,” he said, provoking laughter from the audience. “To me, that’s apocalyptic, even before, you know, tweeting presidents.”
Since his inauguration in 2017, Trump has written more than 11,000 tweets, according to The New York Times. Trump sent out 142 tweets and retweets on Wednesday alone, marking his all-time highest number of tweets in a single day since becoming president, according to Factba.se.
Hayes is also known for his books “To Float in the Space Between: A Life and Work in Conversation with the Life and Work of Etheridge Knight,” which won the Poetry Foundation’s 2019 Pegasus Award for Poetry Criticism, and “Lighthead,” which won the 2010 National Book Award for Poetry. Aside from writing, Hayes currently serves as a professor of English and artist-in-residence at New York University.
All of the poems in his book “American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin” share the title “American Sonnet for My Past and Future Assassin.” Hayes said he gave all his sonnets the same name so he could focus on the writing of the poems.
“Once I called them all the same thing, I could do anything,” Hayes said. “It actually was very exciting for me to not have to be, like, naming them anymore, to say, ‘no matter what I write,’ and you can see that in the poems. It means I can concentrate on the poem, not the superficial, you know, naming.”
Readers can find meaning from his poetry, regardless of whether they agree with the political inspiration behind it, according to Hayes.
“Forget about everything else; forget about Trump; forget about books, audiences,” Hayes said. “Whether you agree with it or not, I’ve already told you everything’s got a bunch of sides, so if you’re with that then you might be flexible to whatever I might propose to you.”

Great information and I earn knowledge reading your article. Poetry is the unconstrained flood of amazing sentiments: it takes its source from feeling remembered in quietness. You can check my blog some other time on How Poetry Heals and Inspires
Hope this will help.

The Georgetown University Student Association Senate struck down a proposed student referendum that would have granted students the opportunity to designate Georgetown University a Blue Campus at their weekly meeting Jan. 20. 
The Blue Campus label would have functioned as a university pledge to promote environmentally conscious practices focused on ocean preservation. The referendum failed to pass the two-thirds majority threshold required to put forward referenda, with 17 senators voting in favor, seven voting against and four absences. During the same session, the GUSA Senate passed a separate sustainability referendum on which students can vote to support the university’s divestment from fossil fuel companies. 
The Blue Campus referendum was introduced to show the administration that students support strong environmental protection, according to Leo Rassieur (COL ’23), the senator who introduced the bill. 
“Everything from the way we source our energy to the education modules that incoming freshmen receive to how we deal with consumer waste is addressed by the referendum,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya. “If the student body at large does not have the opportunity to add their voice to this declaration, then the declaration is meaningless.”
The Blue Campus referendum outlined goals for the university, including a published list of campus energy sources in partnership with the Office of Sustainability by 2021, investments in carbon offset programs by 2025 and continuing efforts to transition all Georgetown University Transportation Shuttles to zero-emission vehicles. 
GUSA President Norman Francis (COL ’20) and Vice President Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) expressed support for the Blue Campus initiative in a press release published Oct. 15. The GUSA Senate agreed to establish a Blue Campus working group Nov. 24 to explore the possibility of introducing a Blue Campus referendum. 
The broader mission of the Blue Campus referendum was to spread awareness about environmental issues on campus, Rassieur wrote. 
“Our ultimate goal is simply to change the way that the student body and the University does things and to make people more conscious about the environment and the oceans,” Rassieur wrote. “For us, the way that we achieve those goals is less important than actually being able to say we did everything we could to preserve the oceans and the world’s environments for future generations.”
The GUSA Senate had a responsibility to support the environmental policies outlined in the Blue Campus referendum, Senator Eric Bazail-Eimil (SFS ’23) said during a debate period at the meeting, according to the meeting minutes. 
“I don’t know if you noticed the quote on the wall: ‘Look on to the rock on which you are hewn. We are called upon to support the Earth we live on,’” Bazail-Eimil said. “This is an incredibly well-written objective, and if we can actively pursue change we should.”
The Blue Campus referendum may have lacked the specificity necessary for a two-thirds majority passage, according to Senator Leo John Arnett (SFS ’22), who voted in favor of the bill. 
“I think that the Blue Campus was a little bit too general and I think that it was slightly confusing to what the students would be voting on,” Arnett said in an interview with The Hoya. “But when it comes to Georgetown’s administration, especially with referendum, it has to be very specific for the board of directors to really take it seriously because they care most about the money side of things.”

Concerned residents and school administrators of the Georgetown, Burleith and Glover Park neighborhoods gathered to express their opposition to the management transfer of Duke Ellington Field at a Jan. 15 community meeting.
In July, the District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation announced its intent to take over control of the field from District of Columbia Public Schools. The meeting, hosted by DPR, was held at the Georgetown Neighborhood Library and drew a crowd of approximately 100 residents who voiced their concerns to representatives from DPR and the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Education. 
At the meeting, administrators and parents from Hardy Middle School, School Without Walls High School and Duke Ellington School of the Arts expressed concern that their sports teams’ access to the field will decrease following the management transfer. 
There are other recreational spaces around Washington, D.C., that would be better served from DPR management than Ellington Field, according to Martin Welles, vice president of Hardy Middle School PTO. 
“Why not some other field throughout the city, and I can name about four or five, that already have lights, that already have unused space — why don’t you go target those fields, let this one sit for a little bit?” Welles said at the meeting. “Why don’t you start cleaning house on some of these long-term contracts that deprive the citizens of their right to the fields that are paid for and maintained by taxpayer dollars?” 
Local schools’ access to the field will not be affected by the transfer, according to Tommie Jones Jr., DPR chief of external affairs who led the meeting and fielded most of the questions. 
“DPR will permit and manage the field under the regulations during hours not scheduled by public schools” Jones said at the meeting. “Duke Ellington, Hardy and School Without Walls will have first priority. We’re not hiding away from it.”
Last September, Georgetown residents pushed back against DPR’s granting of exclusive after-school hour access to Jelleff Field, a recreational space in Georgetown, to a prestigious Northwest D.C. private school.
Fears that a similar arrangement would occur with Duke Ellington Field are a major reason for community opposition, according to Advisory Neighborhood 2E Commissioner Kishan Putta.  
DPR’s communications with the community over the terms of the Jelleff Field transfer were inadequate, which led Putta to seek written confirmation from the department over the specifics of its plan for Ellington Field, he wrote. 
“They gave written assurance of school priority, BUT not about long-term private contracts or neighborhood access,” Putta wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “I asked again last week – they said that is their intention – but I said we need it written. The neighbors and the schools are worried DPR won’t listen to them – after feeling completely ignored by Jelleff decision.” 
Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), who represented the Georgetown neighborhood on the council as well as other sections of the District, announced his official resignation from the D.C. Council in a Jan. 7 letter following accusations of ethical misconduct. A special election to fill Ward 2’s open seat will be held June 16.
Evans’ resignation leaves residents without representation on the council. Some residents believe the transfer should not be attempted until his seat is filled, according to Putta. 
“At the meeting, dozens of residents and school representatives spoke and not one of them said they support the transfer. Most were very much against the transfer – both residents and schools,” Putta wrote. “Many think it definitely should not be transferred until Ward 2 has a new Councilmember (after June 16 special election). And they feel that if the priority is schools and neighbors, then DCPS should continue to manage it – like they do at fields citywide.”
In response to community concerns, DPR has extended the commenting period, which was set to end in January, until Feb. 12.

Immigration policies enacted under President Donald Trump’s administration have harmed the global reputation of the United States regarding refugee protection, two United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) union members said at a Jan. 21 event. 
USCIS operates as a division of the Department of Homeland Security and features two branches supervising refugee affairs and the asylum programs within the agency. The event featured two representatives from the American Federation of Government Employees’s (AFGE) National CIS Union. The AFGE is the largest federal government employee union and exclusively oversees the National CIS union, the body that represents USCIS employees. 
Asylum officer Michael Knowles, who serves as a special representative for the National CIS Council 119, which represents 14,500 USCIS employees, spoke at the event. Jason Marks, a union representative with the AFGE branch that represents USCIS employees of the Washington, D.C. area, also addressed students. Both Knowles and Marks spoke in their capacity as a union members at the event, titled “A Conversation with the USCIS Asylum Officer’s Union,” hosted by the Institute for the Study of International Migration.
Prior to U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, many USCIS employees and migration experts viewed U.S. refugee and asylum programs as functional and well-organized, despite partisan disputes over several smaller issues linked to migration, according to Knowles.
“We don’t usually get involved in public policy, especially in the area of asylum, because frankly at least from our point of view, it’s been a pretty good program, and the employees have been usually well-engaged in helping create and build and perfect that program over an almost 30-year period of time,” Knowles said. “There are always disagreements about how many we should bring in and law enforcement considerations and vetting and making sure our national security is covered.”
Though the CIS union branch has focused on advocating for workers in the past, they have increased their attention to include advocacy for various issues since 2017. The National CIS Union 119 wrote an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court concerning the Trump administration’s travel restrictions on seven different countries in Sept. 2017. After a series of appeals, a different version of the restrictions was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court. On Jan. 21, Trump reportedly considered adding new restrictions on seven additional countries, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The union decided to file their amicus brief to lend their experience to the case, according to Marks. 
“You know we felt, in talking to these folks, talking to these advocacy groups, you know, that the court would want to hear from the folks who actually do this work,” Marks said. “And we approached this, you know, so we found a lawyer that would handle this on behalf of our union, we worked with this legal team, we worked with our members, and essentially we filed a brief in support of the petitioners who were opposing the travel ban.”
In past decades, the U.S. has led the international community on accepting refugees, those who have fled their country of origin, and asylum seekers, people searching for protection out of fear of persecution. The 1980 Refugee Act raised the annual refugee admission ceiling and established communication policies and regulations between Congress and the President about refugee and migration issues. 
After the act passed, the U.S. emerged as a global leader on this immigration policy, according to Marks.
“The United States has been the world leader in refugee resettlement by far,” Marks said. “I think out of all the other countries in the world combined, it doesn’t even come close to the numbers of refugees the U.S. has resettled since 1980, probably more before that, until 2018 or 2019 when Canada actually started to resettle more folks than we did.”
Current rhetoric and policies pushed forward by lawmakers under the Trump administration contrast previous U.S. conduct around immigration, according to Knowles. 
“Refugees and asylum was always a very patriotic thing. It was always good politics, whether you were left, right, or center until 2017, when we saw this new administration coming in,” Knowles said. “One of their signature campaign things, and now we’ve seen one of their signature wrecking balls, I don’t know how else you could call it, has been to radically change the face of immigration without any legislative action whatsoever.”
While many of the policies enacted by the Trump administration have more visible short-term effects, the long-term impacts of the policies are more serious and unseen by the American public, according to Knowles.
“But it does, long term, has dire implications for our institutional capacity,” Knowles said. “Let’s suppose we have a new administration in a year, or four, whatever it is, it’s really hard to rebuild what the wrecking ball has done and we have lost hundreds of very talented, committed people, not because they weren’t laid off, they just said we’re not gonna be here.”

Georgetown University students at the McCourt School of Public Policy are assisting city officials by developing a new algorithm to improve rental housing inspections after several controversies relating to inspection negligence in Washington, D.C. 
In recent years, the Washington, D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs has faced blowback after negligent building rental inspections. The issue received attention after the D.C. Council held a hearing in November 2019 about a fire that killed two people, including a 9-year-old boy, in a Northwest row house that seemed to have been illegally rented, according to The Washington Post.
Amid other recent reports of oversight in safety checks by city inspectors, graduate students involved in the new data science for public policy program have been working with the DCRA to improve inspection efficiency since last year. The partnership benefits McCourt students and the greater D.C. community, according to program professor NaLette Brodnax. 
“The purpose of our partnership with DCRA has been two-fold,” Brodnax wrote in an email to The Hoya. “First, to provide students with the opportunity to learn data science with a hands-on, real-world problem. Second, to assist DCRA in leveraging their existing data to improve agency processes.” 
Students have been working alongside DCRA to focus on developing a system for more thorough housing inspections, according to Brodnax. 
“After some discussions with the agency, the students participated in several projects using data on housing inspections, construction, and permitting,” Brodnax wrote. “Subsequently, the class worked to identify patterns in housing complaints and inspection reports in order to develop an algorithm that could be used to identify properties for proactive inspection.”
The algorithm, called the Proactive Inspection Program, routinely assesses properties for adherence to code compliance, according to Neha Tiwari (GRD ’20), a graduate student who began working on the project in fall 2019. 
“The aim was to help DCRA solve certain specific problems using data science as well as gain practical experience through the same by working with a real and messy dataset with actual uses and implications,” Tiwari wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The current system relies on law enforcement officials filing reports of unsafe conditions. Before the rowhouse fire, investigators from the DCRA or the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department did not inspect the building despite notifications to both agencies. However, a police officer who surveyed the building noted multiple safety concerns, according to The Washington Post. 
A more standardized process would make it more difficult for violations to go unnoticed, according to Tiwari. 
“Currently, the way inspections are alloted is completely random. In the interest of resource
management, it was prudent to allocate inspections by prioritizing properties which were more
likely to be in noncompliance,” Tiwari wrote. 
The Proactive Inspection Program attempts to correct the inspection process and prevent tragedies by taking a building’s violation history into account, according to Tiwari. 
“My approach was to improve the allocation process. The way to do this was to take into account the inspection and violation history besides the neighborhood and building characteristics when allocating inspections,” Tiwari wrote. “The intuition was that the buildings which have a history of violations may have a higher likelihood of being in violation in future as compared to ones that don’t.”
Expansions to the algorithm will be ready within the next few months, according to Brodnax. More information about buildings and neighborhoods might be added, but new features will be introduced to avoid the risk of stereotyping and improve the algorithm, according to Tiwari. 
“Adding more neighborhood characteristics and demographic information to the model is a future consideration,” Tiwari wrote. “However, we should be careful to not let implicit demographic and other biases affect model’s inspection allocation unfairly.”
Representatives for the DCRA did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment.

A photo of a bobcat roaming the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal near the Palisades neighborhood in Northwest Washington, D.C., was uploaded to Facebook last week, sparking excitement on social media.  
The photograph was captured Nov. 9 at 6:22 a.m. approximately three miles from Georgetown’s campus. Dan Herrera, a field technician for the Humane Rescue Alliance, posted the photo to the Capital Naturalist Facebook group Jan. 10 after uncovering the snapshot. The post has since accumulated 805 reactions, 92 comments and 306 shares. 
While the bobcat sighting was exciting, it does not come as a surprise after previous sightings in the Delaware, Maryland and Virginia area according to Alonso Abugattas Jr., naturalist and founder of the Capital Naturalist Facebook.
“We had a video of one in Arlington that made the news last year, and several had been hit on the roads in NOVA as well,” Abugattas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “So it’s great, really neat, but not a great surprise either.”
The bobcat’s D.C. visit indicates there are suitable paths for wildlife movement from rural areas to urban centers, according to William J. McShea, wildlife ecologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.
“If one animal can make that transit than others can as well.  Young males are more likely to move, but the pathway will be similar for mature females.  These animals will keep moving unless they can find a suitable amount of habitat for residency,” McShea wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There might be sufficient area within Rock Creek Park or along the Anacostia/Potomac for a small population but it will never be large due to the cat’s aversion to people.”
The camera that captured the bobcat is operated by DC Cat Count, a three-year project estimated to conclude in June 2021. DC Cat Count is a collaboration between the Humane Rescue Alliance, Petsmart Charities, the Humane Society of the United States, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the SCBI. 
The initiative utilizes a combination of cameras, surveys and data collection and analysis in an effort to estimate the population of cats in D.C., according to Annalisa Meyer, deputy director of communications at the SBCI. 
“At the conclusion of this project, we will have estimated the number of all cats within Washington, D.C. and illustrated how cat population segments interact,” Meyer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Furthermore, we will have developed logistically feasible and scientifically sound tools and protocols that can be used by a wide variety of animal welfare or municipal organizations to facilitate data-driven cat population management.”
DC Cat Count launched the population project to better understand cat dynamics and especially to address the controversy surrounding population management and other feline debates, according to the DC Cat Count website. 
Three years ago, female bobcat Ollie escaped from the Smithsonian National Zoo, sparking media attention.The escape triggered a large search effort in surrounding neighborhoods. She was found and returned safely to her enclosure after two days. 
As for threats posed by a bobcat population in D.C., Washingtonians have nothing to worry about, according to McShea.
“All carnivores eat other species of animals, but I would not consider that a threat. Bobcats are generalists that eat a variety of small mammals and birds,” McShea wrote. “They do not usually associate with humans or their waste (garbage) and will not likely have any impact on humans in DC.”
The bobcat’s appearance is a good sign for D.C. and its surrounding areas as many counties are attempting to provide more habitats for native species, according to Abugattas.“These days, some animals are making comebacks and many local counties are trying to combat invasives, providing more habitat for these animals. So that we see one, is a good sign,” Abugattas wrote. “Hopefully we will see more of these and other less common animals as we improve our habitat.”

After a recent drop in temperatures, pipe breaks caused water outages and street closures in the Georgetown neighborhood on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20.
The first break occurred on P Street between 29th and Dumbarton Street NW on Sunday, according to Pamela Mooring, external communications manager for District of Columbia Water and Sewage Authority. After being repaired, the water main broke again early Monday morning, with workers commencing repairs at 7 a.m. and working throughout the day, finishing at around 7:30 p.m. 
The breaks affected approximately 100 homes on the south side of P Street, according to Mooring. 
In addition to outages in Georgetown, 200 homes were affected by a Monday morning water main break in the residential Michigan Park neighborhood at Sargent Road between South Dakota Ave. and Gallatin St. NE, according to The Washington Post.
Repairs were performed at a routine pace, according to Mooring. Water main breaks become increasingly common in colder months.
“Most required 24-hour or less for water service restoration,” Mooring wrote in an email to The Hoya. “DC Water averages 300-450 water main breaks per year, on average, with higher numbers in the winter months due to the cold.” 
Every year, the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, which provides safe drinking water and wastewater treatment for Montgomery and Prince Georges County in Maryland, handles about 1,800 water main breaks. Two-thirds of those breaks take place between November and February, according to WAMU. 
The temperatures on Sunday and Monday hovered around 20 degrees Fahrenheit, falling below the historic average lows for those two days in January, based on data from AccuWeather.  
Frequent water main breakages in the winter are a result of standing water freezing in pipes, according to information published by DC Water. 
“When water standing inside a pipe freezes, it can expand causing the pipe to break,” DC Water’s website reads. “Pipes that freeze are often exposed to the outside or are in unheated interior areas such as kitchen cabinets, attics, garages, basements and crawl spaces.” 
Another major factor causing water main breakage in the District is aging water system infrastructure, with some pipes dating back to the mid 1800s, according to a 2016 infrastructure report card from the American Society of Civil Engineers.
“The pipes’ median age is 79 years, which is beyond the design lifespan of 50 years, and 9% of pipes were installed during the period between the Civil War and the 1890s,” the report read. “Recently, DC Water started replacing 1% of pipes a year. While 3 times the previous year’s replacement rate, it is still a 100-year replacement cycle.” 
Damage from pipe breaks have triggered maintenance issues on Georgetown’s campus. In February 2019, fire alarms malfunctioned, going off inadvertently three times in a two-day span in Darnall Hall. The error was caused by physical damage from a nearby burst pipe, according to a Feb. 4 email sent to Darnall residents by Darnall Hall community director Tom Mangano.
Water main breakage is not the only issue brought up by the District’s aging pipe system. The D.C. government has struggled with contamination in water sources because of the common use of lead pipes in public and private facilities, with a lead contamination crisis in the early 2000s heightening awareness of the issue, according to The Washington Post.
Lead pipes were most commonly used in buildings constructed before 1986, according to the EPA. The Washington Metropolitan Water and Sewer Authority has been gradually replacing lead pipes under public streets, as well as partnering with homeowners to replace pipes on private property, according to the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment.
While Georgetown has not publicly provided information about the composition of pipes in many of its older buildings or in off-campus buildings, a September 2019 study conducted by Georgetown graduate students found that water from numerous sources around campus tested above or near the EPA’s standards for lead contamination.

The fourth annual Women’s March on Washington drew a crowd of around 10,000 people Saturday, approximately a sixth of the estimated 65,000 people who attended last year’s march.
Several Georgetown University students attended the march in downtown Washington, D.C., on Jan. 18. This year’s march marked the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote in the United States.
While the first Women’s March in 2017 drew an estimated 500,000 protestors, the past three years have failed to reach the same level of participation.
One possible explanation is that the march has become increasingly partisan. Attendees and speakers at the march often openly oppose President Donald Trump’s rhetoric and policies, discouraging more conservative women from attending, according to Sophie Bennett (COL ’23), who attended both this year’s march and the march in 2017.
“I think partially it’s because the message has become more anti-Trump,” Bennett said. “That can be isolating even for women who identify as Democrats who are maybe more centrist or fear that not being centrist about the way you approach feminism isolates right-wing voters and Americans.”
The Women’s March has also faced controversy in the past because of claims of antisemitism within the movement, which may also be a factor behind the decline in participation. The march was accused of promoting antisemitic rhetoric last year when Co-President Tamika Mallory refused to apologize after posting a photo of her alongside Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the black nationalist group Nation of Islam, who referred to Jews as “satanic” in a 2018 speech.
Despite the claims of antisemitic rhetoric surrounding the march, many students still chose to attend to demonstrate their dedication to women’s rights and equality, according to Bennett.
“Being a feminist has always been a part of my identity and it’s something that’s evolved over the past few years of my life,” Bennett said. “There are still plenty of women that recognize that the current administration is bad for women and dangerous for people of all gender identities and sexual orientations.”
The march also took place just three days after what would have been the 91st birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., as pointed out by humanitarian and activist Arndrea Waters King, who spoke at the event. 
The dream that King fought for over half a century ago has been revived in the modern fight for gender equality, according to Waters King, who is the wife of Martin Luther King III.
“It’s ironic that America now more than ever is challenged to realize its dream by fulfilling the dream of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King,” Waters King said at the march. “In their spirit, we can and we must work to seize the urgency of the moment, for the only way to keep from moving backwards is to keep moving forward.”
The march began around 11 a.m., with speakers rallying up the crowd before marching toward the White House.
Protesters marched to the White House, where they chanted “Un Violador en Tu Camino,” a feminist protest anthem that denounces patriarchial norms, rape culture and violence against women. The protestors pumped their fists into the air as they chanted, led by Las Tesis, a Chilean feminist collective.
Despite the freezing temperatures and snow, partaking in the march this year was an empowering and patriotic experience, according to Maria Howard (SFS ’23), who attended the march.
“I was very cold, but it was also very empowering and it was cool to see that there were so many people that were fighting for the same thing,” Howard said. “It made me appreciate being an American more because we have the opportunity to voice our opinions and petition and practice our rights.”
This year’s march begins the decade with renewed hope for achieving greater respect and equality for all, Arndrea Waters King said.
“This can be the decade that ushers in a new freedom, new responsibility for each other, and new dignity of human behavior,” Arndrea Waters King said. “Today I call for you to remember the power that resides with and within each of us, to remember the power that we can embrace the vision that another world is possible.”
