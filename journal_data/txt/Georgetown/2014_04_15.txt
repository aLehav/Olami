Although fundraising for the American Cancer Society through this year’s Relay for Life again declined from its 2010 peak, participants at Friday’s event were more active than in years past.
This year, the event brought in a total of $113,681.78 for the ACS, compared to the nearly $150,000 that was raised last year, then the lowest total in the Georgetown program’s history. In 2010, the organization raised $400,000. The chapter did register an increase in on-site fundraising compared to last year, amassing $5,228.23.
Similar dips in fundraising results have been observed at other Relay for Life events throughout the country.
“Fundraising has been down or flat in a lot of places because of the weak economy, but we’re still really pleased that the participation is up,” ACS Director of Media Relations Vivienne Stearns-Elliott said. “That really speaks volumes because it means that more students and more community residents are interested in finding out more about the American Cancer Society. There are more ways to fight cancer than with your pocketbook.”
The 2013 incarnation of Relay for Life counted attendance at around 2,000 people, a dip from 2012. While 2014 attendance totals had not been calculated as of press time, around 1,500 participants had registered online prior to the April 11 event. Organizers said they believe, however, that the main event at the MultiSport Facility drew a more dedicated audience because of adjusted hours and a wider variety of activities.
“We really tried to focus throughout the year on changing the event, on making sure we were revitalizing the event, on making sure that we were focused on the mission,” Relay Marketing Director Liz Teitz (COL ’16) said. “It wasn’t something where we went into it and every single meeting we were saying that we want to raise [a certain] amount of money.”
The event’s coordinators aimed to revitalize Relay and increase participation by altering the timeline of the night. In previous years, the 12-hour event typically began at 7 p.m. on a Friday evening and continued until the early hours of Saturday morning. This year, Relay started at 3 p.m. on Friday afternoon and ended at 3 a.m.
“We definitely saw that most of the people did come to the event were staying there for a longer period of time than they usually do. We got a lot of people to come in the afternoon,” Relay for Life Co-Chair Dana Sievers (SFS ’14) said.
This year, nearly 50 participants stayed until the final lap, whereas last year less than half a dozen students remained. Coordinators noted that in the past students typically began to leave the event around midnight, rather than staying until the end.
“When we had our final lap last year, it was pretty much just the executive and the committee left, whereas this year there were a lot of participants still there, a lot of people really active and really energetic about it,” Teitz said. “We had a little more engaged participation.”
Stearns-Elliott said that although this increase in participation was not reflected in fundraising results, it was still beneficial because Relay’s goals include raising awareness about cancer prevention, not just raising money for the ACS.
“One of the important things that we do through Relay for Life is that we promote cancer education so that people spread the word to their families and friends to eat healthy, exercise, do those things that we know lower your cancer risks,” Stearns-Elliott said.
Relay teams took on a larger role in providing entertainment at Relay this year. Previously, the event’s coordinators relied on funding from What’s After Dark, a program that supported sober nightlife activities and was discontinued by the university last year.
“We had to make a couple of adjustments with the entertainment so we outsourced some of our entertainment options to teams to do fundraisers. Instead of hiring an artist to do henna, one of our teams at the event did henna as a fundraiser,” Sievers said.
Members of Sigma Phi Epsilon, for example, stayed at Relay throughout the night, selling merchandise as an on-site fundraiser. The Georgetown Running Club had members running on the track throughout the entirety of the event.
“It was really great because it wasn’t just one person running at every time, it was multiple people. It was a good chance to talk and bond and reflect a little bit,” Running Club member Eamon Johnston (SFS ’17) said.
Additionally, the layout of the event was opened up to allow room for casual activities such as games of Frisbee and soccer.
This increase in active participation among teams marked a milestone for Relay.
“We want to engage people in the fight against cancer on all different levels,” Stearns-Elliott said. “Certainly the fundraising is very important, as are the volunteer aspect and the education aspect, which we feel we really succeeded at this year. The money might come next year.”

An astronaut, a crisis communicator and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist all sat onstage in Lohrfink Auditorium on Saturday. Along with 25 other leaders, the unusual group shared common experiences and advice as women in leadership roles from a wide variety of fields.
Georgetown University Women in Leadership brought these 28 leaders to campus for the group’s inaugural Own It Summit. The all-day event focused on helping women gain knowledge and leadership skills and empowering them to succeed.
“We created [the summit] when we realized that there is an actual need to connect with these female leaders that exist right now and learn from their experiences, learn what they’re going through and how they got there,” Summit Co-Chair Helen Brosnan (SFS ’16) said at the start of the event.
The summit, sponsored by Bloomberg LP, is the biggest event that GUWIL has held and marks one year of the organization’s presence on campus. It was the first conference of its kind at Georgetown.
“I think about the really accomplished women that I went to Georgetown with, and how we would have loved a summit like this. … I’m so glad to see that the women here at Georgetown have conceived this and there’s no doubt in my mind that it’s going to grow,” said Norah O’Donnell (COL ’95, GRD ’03), co-anchor of “CBS This Morning,” in an interview after speaking at the summit.
Poet Azure Antoinette presented a poem dedicated to the students who planned the summit at the start of the event.
“The fact that there’s all of this empathy and this desire and want to do something now, I think is just mind-blowing. It says so much about millennials. It says so much about how much we want to affect change and be a part of the undercurrent,” Azure said in an interview with The Hoya.
During the first keynote presentation, Kara Swisher (SFS ’84), a technology columnist for the Wall Street Journal, interviewed former CEO and Chairman of America Online Steve Case and Case Foundation CEO Jean Case. Their conversation focused on technology’s growing role in igniting social change and the part that women play in helping to create this change.
“Women are not lacking for ideas and I’m really excited about the future because … I actually think it comes more naturally to women to figure out how to solve these problems than it does to men,” Jean Case said. “That may be a bias … but the most important thing is making the fearless ask.”
Washington Post journalist Mary Jordan (CAS ’83) interviewed Dee Dee Myers, who served as the first-ever female White House press secretary during the first two years of President Bill Clinton’s (SFS ’68) administration, for the second keynote presentation. The two discussed the ways in which being a woman impacted Myers’ career.
“I think there’s much less room for [public] mistakes,” Myers said. “There are certain assumptions that make the threshold for making a mistake and recovering from it higher [for women].”
After the presentation, the summit’s coordinators presented Myers with the Own It Award. She was selected to receive this recognition both because of her exemplary leadership qualities and her status as a pioneer in her field.
In addition to the keynote presentations, there were four panel discussions throughout the day featuring female leaders in the fields of business, media, politics and STEM. During these dialogues, panelists shared their personal experiences of working in their respective fields and offered advice for overcoming some of the challenges that they have faced as female leaders.
“For me, in terms of working and focusing on the work, is deciding early on, as a woman, the kinds of things that are important to you. … Things like ethics and values and hard work, and deciding what kinds of issues you’d like to get behind,” Judy Smith, a crisis manager who served as the inspiration for Olivia Pope of “Scandal,” said during the politics panel.
During the media panel, speakers advised young women to be tenacious as they begin their careers.
“There are a ton of people who are really smart, as smart as you. … What really makes the difference is drive, almost obsessive drive. If you have that quality, employers tend to notice it, maybe exploit it a little, but you tend to get somewhere,” New York Times Washington Bureau Chief and Political Editor Carolyn Ryan said.
Hannah Sullivan (COL ’14), who attended the summit, said that this advice both impacted her and inspired her.
“After listening to the media panel, a lot of what we were hearing was this push for tenacity and this push for perseverance and for working really hard, so I think that was inspiring to see that you will have to put in this hard work, but it will get you somewhere,” Sullivan said.
Throughout the day, attendees also broke out into experiential sessions. These small workshops ranged in topic from salary negotiation strategies to exploring the role of women of color in leadership. Additionally, several speakers held office hours during which they engaged in open conversations with attendees.
Anna Lignell (COL ’17) attended a workshop that focused on networking strategies.
“The advice that has stuck the most with me is to not be afraid to put yourself out there, because what’s the worst that’s going to happen?” Lignell said.
Journalist Maria Shriver (CAS ’77), the former first lady of California, gave a brief presentation at the start of the summit urging women to be leaders in all aspects of life.
In an interview, Shriver said that she felt that she cultivated many of the qualities that are necessary for leadership during her time at Georgetown.
“I think that’s ethics, I think that’s values, being able to see the world as a bigger place than just you,” Shriver said. “Everybody who goes into work, you’re faced with decisions along the way. … You’re constantly asked in life to make decisions and I think this institution does a good job of talking to you about what’s ethical, what’s moral, what’s right, what is social justice, how to look at the world in a bigger way than just yourself.”
Moving forward, GUWIL has plans to consolidate pre-existing efforts to promote women in leadership at Georgetown. The group hopes to continue its partnership with the university.
O’Donnell said that she believes the world is at a tipping point when it comes to female leaders, pointing out the disproportionate representation of women in Congress and the Supreme Court.
“I think that the 21st century is going to be the century for women and girls,” O’Donnell said. “Tom Brokaw first coined that phrase that the 21st century is going to be the century for women. And I completely agree with him. I think it’s the cause of our generation: the empowerment of women and girls.”

Sports journalist Stephen A. Smith, radio show host and host of ESPN’s “First Take,” spoke about issues ranging from race and leadership to current basketball debates and the weakness of Tim Tebow’s arm in Lohrfink Auditorium at the fifth annual Michael Jurist (SFS ’07) Memorial Lecture on Monday evening.
Smith brought his usual candidness and energy to the talk, as well as his signature dramatic changes in volume and pitch, while relating sports to his life and the lives of Georgetown students.
“You have to understand that everything in this world, in essence, to some degree, is about branding, even though it sounds like a bad word because it sounds too commercial, too orchestrated and choreographed,” Smith said. “At the end of the day it’s real, because even when you’re talking about you, you’re talking about branding you.”
He spoke about expectations and standards, and emphasized that students represent not only themselves but also their family names and their university.
“I have an obligation to hold up that standard that ESPN has established, and it’s a bit harder for us, do you know why? Because who owns ESPN? Walt Disney. Haven’t you all heard of the movie ‘Frozen’? I’ve seen it seven times. … They don’t sell sports, they don’t just sell animation, they don’t sell radio. They sell happiness,” Smith said. “You can’t sit up there getting arrested, being seen in mugshots.”
Sebastian Hart (MSB ’17), who attended the lecture, felt that he could relate to this sentiment.
“I thought the whole conformity, acquiescing, sort of playing the role that you’re expected to be played by corporations, fitting in, instead of going your own way … that really rang true for me,” Hart said.
Smith detailed his path through education before he attended Winston-Salem State University, and how early struggles, such as being held back in fourth grade, motivated him throughout life.
“They were telling me I was stupid and I wasn’t going to be anybody. And I said, ‘We’ll see.’ And from that day forward I was on a mission. And my mission was one thing, above all else: No one would ever laugh at me again,” Smith said. “You will laugh with me, but you will respect me, because I’m going to bring it. And you’re not going to have any choice but to respect me.”
On sports, Smith discussed branding as it relates to money, citing the NFL’s $23 billion television deal and the NFL brand as an example.
“Listen up: Everything’s about money. They try not to tell you that. We really want you to behave well. We really want you to just work hard and do the right things. … Just be about the team. Ladies and gentlemen, have you ever heard of the notion that there are lies in every truth?” Smith said. “That would apply here, because that’s not all they want. See, what they want you to do is protect the brand, because the brand makes money.”
Students who showed up for a sports discussion said that they were surprised at the topics Smith chose to broach.
“I know he always talks about sports, obviously, on his talk shows,” Ben Ringwood (COL ’15) said. “But him just talking about leadership and holding yourself accountable and personal branding was a nice change of pace. It was good to hear from him, and he was very genuine about leadership.”
Smith also generalized his discussions of branding and money while talking about the problems that exist in the world outside of college.
“The problem that I’ve noticed is that if you’re not prepared to deal with the world that awaits, you contribute to extending the problem instead of alleviating it. And the problem that you have as a younger generation is that the world that we live in has looked upon you to resolve issues,” Smith said.
During the question-and-answer session, Smith talked about New York Knicks owner James Dolan’s “nonexistent” basketball acumen.
The only topic of discussion Smith ruled out involved his “First Take” co-host Skip Bayless, with whom he regularly engages in intense debates.
“I don’t like to talk about him too much,” Smith said. “I have to deal with him two hours a day. I’m not trying to add to that responsibility, to add more hours of Skip Bayless in my life. Trust me when I tell you, two is enough.”

Work on the first phase of the Silver Line is complete, according to paperwork filed Wednesday by Dulles Transit Partners, the contractor hired to build the first addition to the Washington, D.C. metro system in over two decades.
The work must now be reviewed by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to receive approval for passenger use.
MWAA Communications Manager Marcia McAllister said that this is the second time DTP has filed paperwork claiming that the construction of the line was complete. The first submission by DTP was rejected after numerous operational problems were found upon inspection of the line.
“We rejected the declaration of completion the first time around and told them they had a long list of things that needed to be accomplished before we could accept it,” McAllister said.
Project officials had hoped to open the Silver Line in December 2013, but the project was stalled by numerous delays in the process, including the replacement of all the speaker systems in every station on the line.
“The problems included a variety of electrical and systems situations,” McAllister said. “There were problems with the overhead speakers in all the stations; those had to be replaced. We’re looking forward to seeing how DTP has worked toward fixing that issue and others with the system.”
The MWAA has until the middle of next week to either accept or reject the corrections DTP has made over the last few months. If those corrections are accepted, the oversight role will then be given to WMATA, who will continue testing on the line.
“Once that hand off is made to WMATA, they can continue testing for as many as 90 days to test it and decide when it enters into service,” McAllister said.
The WMATA declined to comment on the inspection of the line until MWAA made a decision about its readiness.
In all, the line will add five new stops and 11.4 miles of track to the Metro system. Estimates have put the price tag of the line at around $5.6 billion.
Among the stops on the first phase of the line will be the town of McLean, Va., a hub for companies like Mars, Geebo and ServInt, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency and the home of Tysons Corner, a popular shopping mall.
The second phase of construction will include an extension of the line to Dulles International Airport, an often difficult place to reach for many D.C. residents and Georgetown students. Construction for this phase is expected to begin sometime this spring, presumably following the green light on the first phase.
While the addition of the Dulles stop is highly anticipated by D.C. residents, WMATA has stressed that it may not completely solve the traffic issues of commuters trying to get out to the airport.
“There is no single solution to the area’s traffic problems. But Dulles Metrorail is a central part of an integrated solution that maximizes our investments in Metro, buses, carpools, [High Occupancy/Toll] lanes, road improvements and teleworking,” the WMATA website for the Silver Line says.
However, Georgetown students like Jacob Jensen (MSB ’16) have expressed excitement about how the new line will help Georgetown students with the headache of having to get to Dulles from campus.
“It’s usually a $60 cab ride to Dulles, which is money that not a lot of students have to spend on a ride to the airport,” Jensen said. “Hopefully this new line will get up and running soon. I’m not sure how many more $60 cab rides I can afford.”

In the wake of recent tragedies such as the Navy Yard and Fort Hood shootings, some administrators and students working in public on-campus offices are worried for their safety in case of a similar emergency at Georgetown.
An administrator who wished to remain anonymous due to the threat of job termination expressed a desire for increased security measures on campus, including the installation of panic buttons under desks in order to alert the Georgetown University Police Department if an emergency situation arises. Prime candidates for placement include offices with large public traffic, including the admissions, financial aid and human resources offices.
“I think increasingly, every day it seems like there’s a news story about someone with a mental health issue who loses their mind and puts people in danger, if not worse,” the administrator said. “I certainly feel the admissions office should be covered, because some people who aren’t pleased with decisions could just walk right into White-Gravenor, and usually a student worker sits up at that front desk. If you were to walk into financial aid and human resources, those are other hotspots. They’re right here and central to campus.”
According to the administrator, staff members have asked GUPD for emergency buttons in the past but have been turned down. Administrators are not authorized to purchase their own call buttons, as they must be authorized by the police department. Without emergency buttons, students and staff in danger may not be able to easily or discreetly reach the phone to call GUPD in the event of an emergency.
“You don’t want your mind to go there, but news has shown that we have to, as university employees and members of this community, we have to think that way,” the administrator said. “We have to think of the worst-case scenario, and a lack of a response or an insufficient response [from GUPD] is so frustrating. … I worry about our students, who are more vulnerable and are out in front.”
According to GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber, GUPD has never considered installing panic buttons because they fail to provide officers with pertinent information about the situation at hand.
“When somebody hits one of those buttons, we really don’t know the situation that the officer is responding to,” Gruber said. “We don’t know if it’s a fight, if it’s a person with a gun, a person having a heart attack or a person acting suspiciously. The officers going up to this call in an expedient and emergency manner need to have the benefit of knowing what they’re getting into, so we really count on the phone call that we’re getting from people and we’re encouraging people to download the EmergenSee app. That provides us with better situational awareness.”
The EmergenSee app is available as a part of the Georgetown Mobile App. It allows students and administrators to alert GUPD in the case that an emergency occurs on campus.
“Using that app provides us with great information,” Gruber said. “It gives us your location, it provides us with video feeds and audio feeds from where you are. It really is very helpful for us in responding to these emergencies.”
Liz Sellers (MSB ’14) works at the front desk in the Office of International Programs and said she felt the need for a panic button at her desk after a potentially dangerous student entered her office early this semester. Sellers had seen a picture of the student, who had been banned from the university, and was instructed to notify authorities if she saw him. Sellers recognized the student and alerted her superior through a computer system, but could not directly alert authorities without the student overhearing.
“When I realized that it was him, it was kind of nerve-wracking. I wasn’t afraid for my safety, but it was alarming,” Sellers said. “He was sitting so close to me that if I called and said that this person is here, he could’ve done something without anyone being there to intervene.”
Sellers said that she is not aware of any specific protocol to follow in case of a major emergency, but that a panic button could help her feel safer in the office.
“I work in Car Barn, so we’re right on the street. It’s not like we’re embedded in the Georgetown campus, so it definitely would be worthwhile to have something like [a panic button] especially since we’re so close to the outer D.C. area,” Sellers said.
Gruber said that he understands concerns about a potential safety breach on campus and that GUPD is acting to improve its response to emergency situations.
“We’re always trying to improve what we’re doing,” Gruber said. “We are always updating our response policies and standard operating procedures on how to respond to crises.”

Dizzy says 
April 15, 2014 at 8:30 am
I spent a year and a half sitting at the front desk at admissions almost every day, so I understand the concern.  When I was there, we had one denied applicant in particular who appeared to have a mental health issue and was generally just not operating on the same wavelength.  I didn’t really fear for my safety at any point, but it did cross my mind.
Having said that, what the Chief says makes sense – a “panic” button gives zero info, so unless you can specify and enforce it only being used in true absolute emergencies, like an active shooter situation, it could well do more harm than good.  
The EmergenSee app sounds like a good alternative.  Something similar for computers would be helpful – front desk pretty much all have computers in front of them so they could have the computerized equivalent of EmergenSee available where they could input information quickly and submit it to DPS (can’t get used to calling them GUPD) without the person in question knowing it.

As civil war continues in Syria, members of the Catholic community worldwide remain fixated on the country’s people and violence. But the Syrian conflict struck even closer to home April 7, when a Jesuit priest, Fr. Frans Van Der Lugt, S.J., was killed outside his house in Homs.
Van Der Lugt, who was 75, refused to evacuate Homs two years ago when the Syrian government siege started, maintaining that he would remain in Syria while Christians were still living in the city. His death was met with horror and grief by members of his order, including those at Georgetown.
The priest’s death was confirmed to the Agence France-Presse by Secretary of the Dutch Jesuit Order Jan Stuyt.
“A man came into his house, took him outside and shot him twice in the head in the street in front of his house,” Stuyt said.
This direct and deliberate killing is indicative of a targeted assassination — although according to BBC News, the intention behind the murder is unclear.
Members of the Jesuit community and those who knew Van Der Lugt understand why he stayed in Syria despite escalating violence.
“The death of Fr. Frans Van Der Lugt is a horrible tragedy. The only way to make sense of something so senseless is to recognize that Fr. Frans was doing what he was called to do. Because the Jesuits are a missionary order, there have been many Jesuit martyrs who wind up in war zones, decide to stay and wind up offering their lives,” Secretary for Communications for the Society of Jesus Tracey Primrose said. “While not every missionary stays when things get difficult, the great majority do. They feel called to be there, and they want to accompany the people they have come to know and love. And that’s exactly what happened with Fr. Frans. He fell in love with the people of Syria, and he refused to leave them.”
Paul Heck, an associate professor of theology at Georgetown University who worked closely with Van Der Lugt on a number of occasions, praised him for his commitment and spirit.
“He was very committed to the people of Syria, Muslims and Christians alike. All his activities were really open to anyone and everyone,” Heck said.“He was also a leading psychologist and psychiatrist. In general, he was committed to the people of Syria irrespective of their religious affiliation, and that’s a very important and respectable thing.”
According to Heck, Van Der Lugt alone was willing to stay in Syria amid the violence and political turmoil.
“He was the only one that stayed there; the other Jesuits there left,” Heck said.
Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., explained that the decision to stay as a missionary in a dangerous country is up to each individual Jesuit.
“Every Jesuit discerns with his superior as to whether it is wise to remain in a dangerous place and sometimes that means it’s wise to leave, sometimes it means staying. So there’s not one rule,” O’Brien said. “We truly leave it to the discernment of the Jesuit and his superiors to decide what is best for that person.”
The last murder of Jesuits occurred on November 16, 1989, when six Jesuit scholars and priests were murdered in their shared residence during the Salvadoran Civil War in San Salvador, El Salvador.
“Part of our mission is to go wherever there are needs of people not being met, and that means we often go to dangerous places where people are weak, which includes various civil unrest. Our other mission is to accompany people, which means to be with them in times of peace and violence and not leave them,” O’Brien said.
Heck praised Van Der Lugt for his commitment to the Syrian people, regardless of religious differences.
“In no way did he feel it was possible to abandon the people there. He felt very committed to them as their pastor in Homs. He wanted to be a witness at a time when the nation was at war,” Heck said. “He did not take a side and he opened up the Jesuit residence to all people, Muslims and Christians, when the city of Homs was destroyed. He was very keen on them being a witness. He wanted to show that the true character of the nation was not violence — it was interreligious solidarity.”
Van Der Lugt was selflessly willing to give his own life in the name of self-sacrifice, Heck said.
“His decision to stay in Homs, he knew that it was highly likely that he would offer his life over the last decade in terms of serving people. There was no expression of anger at his death, which is amazing; all the responses from the people were of gratitude for his life, the life that he had left,” Heck said.
Pope Francis, also a member of the Jesuit order, praised Van Der Lugt for his bravery and dedication to his mission.
“[Van Der Lugt was] a man of peace, who with great courage had wanted to remain faithful, in an extremely risky and difficult situation, to the Syrian people to whom he had dedicated, for a long time, his life and spiritual service,” Francis said in a statement.

In order to conserve energy and cleanly generate power, D.C. Water plans to get dirty this summer by embracing sewage.
The water utility’s plant proposal involves converting all waste from the surrounding Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia area into Class A biosolids and energy. The company hopes to use the green solution to reduce its energy bill and pass on savings to its customers.
The new technology, called thermal hydrolysis, was originally developed by Cambi, a Norway-based company focused on discovering ways to efficiently convert biodegradable substance into renewable energy.
“It had been used in several places in Europe, but never in North America,” D.C. Water Manager of Biosolids Operations Bill Brower said.
The D.C. Water plant will collect the sewage into large steel vats where it will undergo a preheating step, similar to a pressure cooker, sitting at high pressure and temperature. After 30 minutes, the pressure is lowered, causing cell walls to burst and allowing microorganisms to digest the material.
“It makes a Class A biosolids product and the main thing it does [is] it breaks down the cells and the solids before it goes into anaerobic digestion, which allows for higher loading of the digesters,” Brower said.
After this anaerobic digestion — when microorganisms break down biodegradable substances without the presence of oxygen — the vats are filled with Class A biosolids material void of pathogens, which were killed by the high temperature. This material can then be used as soil in green infrastructure, tree plantings and community gardens, among other things.
The real power source from thermal hydrolysis, however, stems from the natural release of methane gas from the digesters. D.C. Water plans to use the 13 megawatts of power from the methane gas in order to power 11,000 homes in the D.C., Maryland and Virginia area.
D.C. Water will also be able to reduce its electricity bill, which primarily comes from local electricity utility Pepco, by powering a third of its plant on its own with the energy from the sewage. It can then pass on those savings to nearly 2.2 million customers who will send their waste to the plant located in southeast D.C.
Brower hopes the reduced dependence on Pepco will eventually result in a self-sufficient process.
“We are [a] water utility so we are not used to running a power plant.” Brower said. “Pepco energy services are going to be running that part of the plant for us for the first 15 years at least.”
Georgetown student Jane Xie (SFS ’14), who works for the university’s Office of Sustainability, voiced her support for the proposal.
“This sounds like a viable solution to solve multiple regional problems — reducing biosolid waste, increasing water quality by reducing the wastewater runoff and sourcing a more sustainable energy source,” Xie said.
Caroline James (COL ’16), a member of GU Fossil Free and the GUSA secretary of sustainability, agreed.
“This initiative by D.C. Water is a great example of taking advantage of natural biological processes to help humans live more sustainably,” she said. “I’m excited to see how D.C.’s energy production improves over the next few years, and I hope other cities begin similar programs.”
Xie and James both expressed their enthusiasm for the solution, adding that they hope the plant sets a precedent for other cities.
“If it’s an economical solution, I would love to see D.C. start this trend and expand it into other cities,” Xie said.
Vice President of EcoAction Margaret Stebbins (COL ’15) lauded the initiative as a means to provide billions of people with energy.
“We have such a consumer culture where we just take and take and we don’t know how to deal with 9 billion people; all these people need energy and don’t have energy available in the future,” she said.
Charlotte Cherry (SFS ’16), board member of Georgetown Energy, also praised the initiative for its cost efficiency.
“Although waste-energy plants are a bit less glamorous than solar panels, people tend to complain about the aesthetics of many energy production techniques. It seems that this type of project will have benefits on many fronts, transferring waste to useable energy, saving energy costs and processing wastewater to a state where it can be used by farmers immediately. It’s a win-win and I am excited to hear about the impact going forward,” Cherry wrote in an email.

After the Georgetown University Student Association’s decision to end funding for the Collegiate Readership Program was met with widespread student dissatisfaction, GUSA administrators and cabinet members are surveying student interest and working with campus groups and administrators to find funding to keep the program running.
The program, which has intermittently run for six years, provides free copies of The Washington Post, The New York Times and USA Today to the campus community. It cost $14,000 last year and was cut from GUSA’s fiscal year 2015 budget.
GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) originally supported keeping the program and is now working with his administration to find alternative funding.
“Ultimately, we’re still seeking short-term solutions to keep the program going, understanding that we might be working on a very short timeline,” Tezel said. “We are still reaching out to relevant academic and administrative departments to see if we can get short-term solutions. We’re also looking at the long-term sustainability of the program. We’re doing that right now working with various different individuals on both the executive and senate side.”
According to GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Megan Murday (SFS ’15), GUSA sent out a survey in a campus-wide email Monday about media readership that has received over 140 responses.
“The survey hopefully will gauge student interest, what sort of outlets are most convenient to them, something that they’d be most likely to use,” Murday said. “We know that The Washington Post and The New York Times are very popular. We’re gauging undergraduate interest and seeing if it would really be worth the money that we’d be putting into it.”
GUSA’s Intellectual Life Chair Shweta Wahal (SFS ’16) said that the survey will help the GUSA administration decide how to approach the issue. It is considering both print and online newspaper subscriptions, depending on the feedback that it receives.
“We’re trying to find out what would be most effective, whether it would be to collaborate with university departments and have it be something that everyone has access to,” Wahal said. “We’re also benchmarking with other universities. For example, Case Western University has the students pay a media fee to fund their collegiate readership program.”
Some student groups have expressed interest in contributing to the program’s funding, according to Murday.
“[The Graduate Student Organization] was interested in looking into ways that they could help with funding,” Murday said. “We’re really trying to find the money allocation for the program if it’s not through GUSA’s budget.”
Tezel said that he has received positive feedback from university administrators, as well.
“What we’ve found when talking informally to a lot of different departments is that they’re very supportive of the program and they want to see it continue in the future,” Tezel said. “We’re getting a positive reception, but really what we need to do is make sure we can translate that into financial commitments, and that’s what we’re doing right now.”
According to Murday, the program is an important part of academic life on campus.
“I think that so much of an education at Georgetown is rooted in practicality and how we’re going to apply this to the real world,” Murday said. “In order to effectively do that in the classroom, we need to be cognizant of national and international affairs and stay current in news because a lot of my professors expect us to read a newspaper every morning and be up to date, so that when we talk about different issues in class, we know the latest news on them.”
Patty-Jane Geller (COL ’17) said that she would benefit from an online subscription.
“Personally, I read my news on my phone or on the computer, so I wouldn’t really ever pick up a physical newspaper, but reading the news is pretty important to me,” she said. “If there were actual subscriptions that we could use online, I would really like that. It would be really convenient and a good use of money.”

Five new student-elected Georgetown University Student Association senators were sworn in Sunday to replace those who left the senate, because of executive cabinet appointments and other reasons. The senators will serve for the remainder of the academic year and over the summer until a new senate is elected in September.
Sam Kleinman (COL ’16) is a new senator-at-large, while Jayme Amann (COL ’15) and Peter Cohen (COL ’15) will represent Village A, Matthew Mazzeo (COL ’15) will represent the townhouses and Ebony McKeever (COL ’17) will represent Darnall and Harbin Halls.
GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said that the competitiveness of the elections made him hopeful for the future of the senate.
“It’s great. I watched the campaigns and I live in Village A, so I was able to vote for three spots in the current senate,” Tezel said. “It was really encouraging to see a competitive race with a lot of strong candidates, and I think that says a lot about GUSA as an institution and where it is right now.”
The new senators met with the existing senate after being sworn in Sunday, and according to GUSA senate Speaker Sam Greco (SFS ’15), they are enthusiastic about their new positions.
In order to prepare the senators for their jobs, Tezel, Greco and the rest of the GUSA administration will train the senators and discuss their goals.
“We’ll do an orientation to get them accustomed to how we operate, how we write bills, the projects we’re working on at the moment,” Greco said. “We will show them how to launch their own projects and find the right administrators to work with and get the resources they need to accomplish what they’re interested in doing.”
Although the senators will be serving for a short time, Tezel said that the amount that each senator accomplishes will depend on his or her interests and motivations.
“I think that falls onto however much that individual senator wants to accomplish,” Tezel said. “We are in the process of reaching out to see what the new senators are willing to collaborate on in terms of projects, but especially as we work our way to the end of the year into the summer, we definitely will want these individuals on anything they might be particularly interested in.”
As senator-at-large, Kleinman plans to prioritize increased free speech on campus.
“I ran on a free speech platform. It’s really what I care most about at Georgetown. It was what I cared most about at Tufts where I went last year. I was a transfer,” Kleinman said. “I, like many, was incensed when H*yas for Choice was kicked out of Healy Circle back in January. … I realize that if there’s one thing that GUSA needs to be doing that it hasn’t been doing, that’s advocating for free speech.”
Mazzeo, who will work on the Student Life Committee, said that he hopes to help transfer students as they adjust to life at Georgetown.
“I’m hoping to make transitions for transfer students easier – as a former transfer student myself – as well as to ensure that students’ needs are represented,” Mazzeo wrote in an email.
Amann will work on the Intellectual Life Committee in order to ensure that internship experience is noted on students’ transcripts.
“I hope to discuss what is hampering getting internships put on transcripts,” Amann said. “Many senators have suggested credit for internships in the past, but I’m suggesting we just get notations on the transcript. That way it acknowledges the work for the semester and is a small stepping stone toward eventually getting credit for internships.”
McKeever said her main goal as senator is to incorporate more student voices into GUSA.
“I want to get the peoples’ voice heard,” McKeever said. “I was in Darnall, and there are a lot of complaints that they feel neglected. I haven’t heard a lot of complaints for Harbin, but I definitely want to make sure that I can get those people’s voices heard as well.”
Cohen, however, doubted whether his time in office is enough to make any substantial changes, although he is interested in adding green space to campus and working to prevent sexual assault.
“I’m in a very weird position, because we just won the special elections, so there are one or two more meetings before the end of the year, so I’m not aiming for terribly ambitious goals right now,” Cohen said. “I’m just trying to assimilate myself into the new GUSA lifestyle, try to figure out how everything works and how I can possibly use my role to the best of my ability and for the best Georgetown future.

A series of bicycle-focused measures spearheaded by students and the Georgetown University Police Department aims to foster the biking culture on campus. However, plans for a university bike share have reached a stalling point.
The Georgetown University Office of Sustainability is working in collaboration with GUPD to inspect bicycles on campus, tagging for removal those that appear to be abandoned.
On April 9, three GUPD officers and three student volunteers tagged over 90 bicycles on campus that met the appropriate criteria as “abandoned.” Such criteria included rusted chains, flat tires and bent wheels. If unclaimed by April 16, the tagged bicycles will be removed and held by GUPD for 90 days. After this time period, any unclaimed will be donated to Bikes for the World, a charity that provides fixed bicycles to those in need.
In a university-wide email sent April 9, Chief of Police Jay Gruber stated that the purpose of the initiative is “to promote a bicycle-friendly campus, promote safety and protect property on campus.”
According to Joseph Smith, the deputy chief and associate director of GUPD, there have been three similar bike-tagging projects at Georgetown in the last five years, all of which successfully created space for active riders on campus while simultaneously serving as a crime deterrent.
Greg Miller (SFS ’14), a sustainability research fellow, stated that the lack of air pumps and bicycle repair resources available on campus forced students to stop riding. Additionally, many bikes are left in disrepair when students graduate, creating a buildup of broken and abandoned bikes.
Miller has worked closely with the university on additional bicycle initiatives throughout the year. Most recently, he helped bring a free full-service bike repair stand to Red Square. The stand was donated by The Bike House D.C., a local bike co-op, with the Georgetown University Student Association funding its installation. The program might see further expansion if it proves to be a success.
“The bike repair stand is designed to be outside and withstand the elements, and thus should not require regular maintenance,” Miller said. “It has an air pump and all the basic tools that someone would need to keep their bike in good condition.”
In addition to the abandoned bike project and the repair stand, Miller has also recently helped Georgetown become a certified Bicycle Friendly University after submitting an application to the League of American Bicyclists. Georgetown is the first school in Washington, D.C., to earn this recognition.
With the growing popularity of student-owned bicycles on campus and the award from the League of American Bicyclists, university administrators have begun to provide more support to the issue.
GUPD offers a bicycle registration service where students, faculty and staff can officially register their bikes with the university, allowing the department to keep track of bicycle issues and thefts.
“Based on a count done this past fall for our parking report, there were about 630 bikes parked on campus during peak occupancy during the day,” Miller said.
According to Deputy Chief Smith, only 13 students are currently registered in the system. DPS hopes this number will increase thanks to the raised awareness of campus cycles.
Miller hoped for his final project to bring a university bike share to campus in his last semester with former GUSA Secretary of Sustainability Gabe Pincus (SFS ’14), but the program has been put on hold with the two seniors’ impending graduation.
The original vision for the program included hourly bicycle rentals, similar to the Capital Bikeshare program outside the front gates. Eventually, it evolved into a semester-based rental system to best serve the students and increase space on campus for bicycle storage.
“For some rental fee, we would provide a bike, a lock and lights, and [students] could take the bike for the entire semester and use it at their convenience,” Miller said.
The two leaders of the initiative are searching for underclassmen who express interest in continuing the project but have been unsuccessful.
“We still have a long way to go to make Georgetown really bike-friendly,” Miller said. “But I am confident that with some demonstrated support of the administration for bicycling programs, it will become a mode of transit that more people consider and use.”

As a Georgetown alum (C’01, MPP’07), a neighbor, and a regular bicyclist, I am thrilled to see the strides that Hoyas are taking to make the university a more bicycle-friendly campus.  I would strongly encourage the students leading this effort, though, to push for more Capital Bikeshare stations on and around campus–as was, I believe, committed to in the agreement with the neighborhood for the last Campus Plan–rather than trying to create an alternative bike-sharing program.  
More Capital Bikeshare stations, in places like 37th and Reservoir, 36th and Prospect, Outside Leo’s or the new Healey Family Student Center, and Leavey, would transform the way that students connect with the community and the District as a whole, in addition to providing easy ways to make short trips on or near campus.  These stations would tie into a network of more than 315 stations in the region, with easy access to countless destinations.  And if there was money available, the university could subsidize annual memberships for students, making the $75 annual membership even more affordable.

Washington, D.C. officials announced a proposal to redraw elementary school boundary lines for District of Columbia Public Schools on April 5. If enacted, this marks the first DCPS redistricting since 1968.
Claudia Lujan, a media representative from the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Education, stressed the necessity of redistricting in order to adjust to D.C.’s demographics and data, which have shifted over the past four decades. The realignment would consider both current and projected city populations as well as closures and openings of new schools.
“We have a very complicated, very confusing system. And so the initial emphasis of this was to essentially do what we should have done many years ago and to address the challenges that the current system faces because we haven’t done this in so long,” Lujan said.
The proposed boundaries aim to accommodate both overcrowded and underused schools as well as address travel and safety issues for students and families. Additionally, the new proposal introduced three new “policy examples,” as they are referred to by Deputy Mayor of Education Abigail Smith’s office, which would significantly change the way that students in D.C. are assigned public schools.
The first policy example proposed the idea of a lottery-based elementary school enrollment system. Under this proposal, rather than allowing families to choose to attend a specific neighborhood school, students would be given the choice to enroll in one of the three or four elementary schools within the “choice sets” near their homes, where admission would be determined by lottery. For middle school, students would then be presented with two options of nearby schools from which to choose. High school admissions would be determined by a citywide lottery, giving preference to students who live nearby or have a sibling already enrolled in the school.
Lujan stressed that this policy example is not proposing a citywide lottery for elementary school students.
“We have not in any way proposed citywide lottery for the elementary school level, but it is on the table for high school level,” she said.
The second policy is most similar to D.C.’s current education system of boundaries and assigned schools within those boundaries, but with the added proposal that 10 to 12 percent of seats be reserved for students living outside of that school district whose assigned school is performing under par. Under this policy, elementary school students would be eligible to attend one public elementary school in their district, which would then feed into one middle school and one high school. If students gain a spot via lottery into an elementary school outside neighborhood school boundaries, they would also be eligible to continue to feed into middle and high school with their classmates.
The third policy serves as a compromise between the first two policies. Under this proposal, 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds would be eligible to attend neighborhood preschools. Elementary school students would attend the one elementary school in their district based on the new boundaries and middle school students would enter a lottery for admissions to one of two or three middle schools near their home. High school students would participate in a citywide lottery that did not prioritize residence.
D.C. Reads Coordinator Allison Link (SFS ’14) criticized the first policy example, as it would signify the end to neighborhood schools.
“I currently work as a teacher’s assistant at Anne Beers Elementary School, and several of the kids I work with are second- or even third-generation Beers students. This policy would almost completely sever this meaningful tie between families, their communities, and their schools that remains prevalent in DCPS,” Link said to Greater Greater Education.
Mayor Vincent Gray, recently defeated in the Democratic primary for re-election by Ward 4 Councilmember Muriel Bowser, is scheduled to release a final policy in September, which would take effect immediately in fall 2015.
Lujan emphasized that the proposals are still in a preliminary phase and that feedback from the community is welcome.
“We have not come out with one proposal that we want people to weigh in on; we’ve come out with a lot of different options that people should weigh in on at the elementary, early childhood and secondary school level,” she said.
Nico Lake (SFS ’16), a coordinator for D.C. Reads, addressed the effects that redistricting could have on the students as well as the school’s resources.
“The new system has some major changes for some of the schools we work with in Ward 7, like Thomas, Smothers and Drew,” Lake said. “All three schools will see their boundaries expanding, meaning a rise in enrollment and students from new neighborhoods attending the schools. It’s important to ensure the students are able to get to the school safely and in a timely manner, as well as confirming that the schools have the resources to house the influx of students.”
Although he praised the officials’ receptiveness to community feedback, Lake expressed concern over the process’ lack of transparency.
“Not enough information on the process has been given out and I worry that many have not had the opportunity to share their voice on this important issue because of not receiving information on the subject,” Lake said. Adam Barton (COL ’16), a coordinator for D.C. Schools Project, echoed this sentiment.
“It seems like DCPS is making an honest effort to listen to the community, which is great. The worry, however, is that the redistricting process is always going to leave some community behind. It will change the feeder patterns to the benefit of some neighborhoods while throwing others into underperforming schools for the sake of diversifying,” Barton said.
Barton further elaborated on how the changes could affect the D.C. Schools tutoring system. Partnership with some public schools may have to be reconsidered in order to achieve the community impact they are trying to sustain, he said.
“At our on-site afterschool programs at schools like Marie Reed in Adams Morgan, we will potentially have a very low student continuity between the 2014 and 2015 school years. Our tutors may not be able to continue working with the students they already serve, and we as an organization may have to change our plans and partnerships entirely if feeder patterns land in such a way that the population of English language learners in our schools shifts greatly,” he said.
Despite the disadvantages, however, Barton praised the redistricting proposal for giving certain students opportunities they may not have received otherwise.
“The biggest advantage to redistricting, of course, is that it means that certain students may get the chance to attend a higher-performing school if it is zoned into their neighborhood,” he said.

To me, this means that the public schools in dc will be integrated. Am I wrong? In the neighborhood that I used to live in, the kids at the schools in that area were mostly all black.  Will they be mixing the schools up?  I had to move to Mo. Co. in order to give my children a more mixed environment for school.  If it means that the schools will begin to be diverse, then i am all for it.

Edilma Yearwood, an associate professor of nursing at the School of Nursing and Health Studies, was honored with the Hendrix Lectureship Award at a recent meeting of the International Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses.
Yearwood won the award because of her abilities as a speaker and her leadership in extending the field of psychiatric and mental health to include marginalized people, particularly children and adolescents.
Yearwood said that she was overwhelmed when she received news of the award.
“When I was hearing the snippets of the award nomination letters [from my peers], I was sitting there, and I got emotional, because it was touching to hear that your peers see how much work you put into a particular area, and took the time to say how you have impacted them and the profession,” Yearwood said.
Yearwood’s colleagues Pamela Galehouse of Seton Hall University and Vicki Hines-Martin of the University of Louisville nominated her for the award.
“As a leader, in both mental health care and the movement to establish both equity for and understanding of our diverse professional and consumer population, she is well deserving of this premier form of recognition,” Galehouse said in a press release from the Georgetown University Department of Communications.
Yearwood received ISPN’s President’s Award in 2012 and, in April 2013, was elected to a two-year term as a division director of ISPN, focusing on the Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nurses. She promised at the time of her appointment to advocate for mental health services for at-risk youth and has since been working to advance that goal both at home and abroad.
“Last month I had the opportunity to go to Jamaica to set up a research collaboration with the Caribbean mental health organization, so that’s one thing we’ve been working on. The other is just locally in Washington, D.C., trying to get some research done with high-risk youth, with immigrant kids, with kids who have some behavioral challenges,” she said.
She identified problems such as abuse, neglect, trauma and the potential for substance abuse as significant issues in D.C. that she hoped to address with increased research.
As part of the Hendrix Lectureship Award, Yearwood will give a lecture at the annual ISPN conference in Seattle next year. She said that she plans to focus on the importance of recognizing global influences on mental health.
“In the reality of our world, my interest is in kids and their mental health and their well-being, so what I want to talk about is how the local is global.” Yearwood said. “I think a lot of the kids in the area are kids from other places. We need to understand that those kids are coming with specific needs, and we have the responsibility to meet those needs.”
The award is presented by ISPN in honor of late University of Kentucky professor Melva Jo Hendrix, who was a leader in mental health nursing. Although Yearwood did not know Hendrix personally, she was inspired by her dedication to her work and her students.
“Besides her work with underserved populations, [Hendrix] was a really, really strong mentor for her students, and I really try to do that with my students,” she said.
Yearwood said that she tries to share her passions of child and adolescent mental health with her students.
“I talk a lot about well-being, the importance of looking at where people come from, not just what’s in front of you at the moment, but taking the time to talk with people and learn information about their experiences,” she said.
Students who have interacted with Yearwood have been impressed with her pedigree and her care for students.
Yearwood was Betsy Weston’s (NHS ’14) clinical instructor for mental health nursing.
“She’s very knowledgeable and approachable in terms of clarifying questions that I have or providing some advice on how to talk to patients in an in-patient setting,” Weston said. “She’s been a really helpful mentor in my pursuit to be a mental health nurse.”
Lindsay Howell (NHS ’14), who came to the nursing program as a second-degree student with little background in the sciences, found Yearwood’s mentorship instrumental in her success in the program.
“Coming into this program, I was nervous how my past educational experiences would translate into my studies at NHS considering my non-science background,” Howell said. “Studying and working with Dr. Yearwood as a professor was to me the quintessential learning experience. Dr. Yearwood is patient, thoughtful, hardworking and an incredible resource for any matter within the realm of mental health and nursing.”

Saleh Abdel Jawad delivered a lecture about Palestinian perceptions of Ottomans during World War I in an event sponsored by the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies and the Georgetown Institute for Global History on Monday evening. The lecture was part of the 2013-2014 Middle East and North Africa Public Lecture Series and Workshops “The New Middle East: The First World War 100 Years Later.”
“While my research is trying, as many other scholars have, to deconstruct the Arab-dominant narrative that participates in painting a counternarrative, which obviously has political implications, my argument, however, should be taken as a contribution to an academic debate, not as an opinion piece,” Abdel Jawad said.
Jawad is the 2013-14 Andrew Carnegie Centennial Fellow at the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies. He is also the author and editor of several books and articles on the Palestinian national movement.
“My research reveals an enduring loyalty for the Ottomans among the non-elite Palestinians before and during the war, and, in some cases, even after the war,” Abdel Jawad said.
Abdel Jawad stated that Arab-Turkish relations remain a challenging subject to define in historiographical and political terms.
“The Turkish view wanted to portray the Arabs … as those who stabbed them in the back,” Abdel Jawad said. “This is interesting because Muslims and Turks that served during the war knew that hundreds of thousands of Arab soldiers fought until the end with the Ottoman Empire.”
Numerous historians of Arab nationalism, Turkish nationalism, Zionism and the West have depicted Arabs as being opposed to Ottomans during the war. They describe the “Great Arab Revolt” as Arabs aiming to secure independence from Ottoman Turks.
“For the most part, the history of the war we have in Arab and Palestinian historiography has been viewed primarily from the [perspective of the] Ottoman national elite,” Abdel Jawad said. “The nature of this line of argument, as some will remind us, recalls [the warning] of the danger of considering advancing national ideas as the sole measure of agency in the 20th-century Arab world.”
Using oral sources, Abdel Jawad found that, contrary to popular opinion, Palestinians held pro-Turkish sentiments before and during the war.
Abdel Jawad noted that oral arguments have developed because of the societies from which they come. Information is primarily spread by mouth in Arab countries, which makes it difficult to locate and validate.
“It was almost impossible not to use oral sources to write about the 1940s because most of our Britain documents were either destroyed or confiscated,” Abdel Jawad said. “But most important of that, Arab societies, even still today, are oral societies.”
Another difficulty that Abdel Jawad faced with oral sources was a lack of firsthand experiences. Many of the people who experienced the era were of old age or deceased during his research.
“Some of the interviews are done by their grandsons,” Abdel Jawad said. “They have also memories from their grandfathers but they died.”
Since history was spread by word of mouth, Abdel Jawad hypothesizes that the memory of what sentiments were toward Ottomans changed over time.
“If you go today, to the West Bank, and you do oral interviews, most of the people will give you an anti-Ottoman view,” Abdel Jawad said. “Why? Because the collective memory was infiltrated later. It was very important in this case to have those who lived the moment.”
Abdel Jawad argued that those who were against the Ottoman Empire were their own soldiers.
“This idea is that most of the rebels of the revolt in 1936 were also the main leaders were soldiers in the Ottoman army or they were friends of the Ottoman army,” Abdel Jawad said.
Abdel Jawad concluded by explaining why there were different narratives of the war that contradicted his findings.
“There is not enough data to explain fully the enduring loyalty of the auxiliary people but what seems obvious through my interviews is that Islam, which was a main component of the Ottoman identity, was a rallying point for this solidarity and loyalty,” Abdel Jawad said.
Tyler Patrick (SFS ’15) attended the lecture because he was interested in how the history of the Palestinian movement could relate to his international economics major.
“The speaker noted that more Muslims were pro-Ottoman during that period because of the shared link of Islam and someone asked the question if that continued today,” Patrick said. “That spurred for me an economic question of, if there were free trade between the different Palestinian territories and their neighbors, would shared feelings of Islam impact the degree of international trade?”

The Hoya’s new editorial and publishing staff began their terms Saturday, after selections April 5 and 6, and produced their first issue today.
Former Campus News Editor Mallika Sen (SFS ’16) is now executive editor.
“I’m intrigued to expand beyond the confines of news and work with other sections,” Sen said. “It’s a very unique vantage point in the office.”
Robert DePaolo (COL ’16), former copy chief, replaced Sheena Karkal (COL ’15) as managing editor.
“I’m very happy to take on this larger role and help make the office a fun and exciting place to work,” DePaolo said.
Karkal was elected chair of The Hoya’s board of directors for a yearlong term.
“I’m thrilled to take on this new role at The Hoya, expanding from my experience in the editorial division and connecting that with our newspaper’s growing business side,” Karkal said.
Ian Tice (COL ’16) will serve as The Hoya’s third online editor after two semesters as layout editor.

Editor-in-Chief Emma Hinchliffe (COL ’15) and General Manager Michal Grabias (MSB ’15) will remain in their respective positions for the next semester.
