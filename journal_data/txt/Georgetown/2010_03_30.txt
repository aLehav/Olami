A student was physically assaulted by a burglar upon entering her Village A residence Monday evening.
The victim entered her living room at 8 p.m. and found an unknown black male standing inside, according to the Department of Public Safety’s Public Safety Alert. The suspect then pushed the victim against the refrigerator and began choking her. The victim began screaming, causing the suspect to flee in an unknown direction. The victim sustained minor injuries and was treated on site by the Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service.
Nothing was stolen from the apartment, according to DPS Investigative Sgt. David Ruiz. The suspect is not affiliated with the university. The suspect is described as a thin, black man in his mid-twenties with short hair. He was wearing gray sweatpants and a black shirt.
At least five burglaries have occurred on or near campus in the last two weeks. As in three of the previous cases, the suspect in the Monday burglary entered through an unlocked door.
The university is responding by increasing safety measures and encouraging students to be more cautious.
“I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that everyone lock their windows and doors at all times, even when they are home,” said Director of Media Relations Andy Pino.
DPS is increasing its high visibility patrols and informing students to lock their doors at all times, according to Ruiz. Suspicious activity should be reported to DPS immediately.
The case is under investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department. MPD was unavailable for comment.
