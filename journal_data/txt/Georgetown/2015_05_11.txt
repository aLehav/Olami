University President John J. DeGioia honored three Georgetown University Police Department officers for the arrest of an armed robbery suspect in a brief ceremony on the steps of Healy Hall Monday morning.
Officer Scott Connor, Sgt. Fred Johnson and Sgt. Joe Twiggs received medals for their work arresting the armed suspect in the Leavey Center on Friday. University administrators and other members of the campus community were in attendance.
Both DeGioia and Chief of Police Jay Gruber spoke at the ceremony, thanking the officers for their efforts.
“We commend them and thank them for their exemplary actions this past Friday under very difficult circumstances and all they have done to keep our community safe,” DeGioia said. “We recognize them for their selflessness, their careful judgment and their courage in responding to circumstances that affect the safety of our community.”
The officers responded to a student tip and observed the suspect inside the Leavey Center. When the suspect attempted to leave the building, the officers successfully disarmed and detained him.
Most recently, GUPD officers were also honored for saving a person who attempted suicide in February 2015 and for their response to the March 2013 ricin incident in McCarthy Hall.
According to Gruber, GUPD and the Metropolitan Police Department have not yet located the female suspect in the robbery.
“The female suspect is still at large and we are actively looking for her along with MPD,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya.
