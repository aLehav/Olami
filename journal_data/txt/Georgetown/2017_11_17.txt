Emergency, fire and hazmat units responded to a chemical fire in a Regents Hall science laboratory Friday evening.
The fire involved a “small amount of a chemical” and occurred in a “controlled environment,” according to a spokesperson for D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services. The incident was declared “all clear” by the university at 10:22 p.m.
Rachel Pugh, a university spokesperson, said damage to the chemistry lab is “limited” and the cause of the fire “appears to be accidental.”
A spokesperson for D.C. Fire and EMS did not say which chemical was involved in the fire. The Georgetown University Police Department declined to comment Friday night.
The fire was extinguished by university staff soon after it started around 8:30 p.m., according to D.C. Fire and EMS. Fire units arrived minutes later. Hazmat units prepared to enter the building around 9:30 p.m. as firefighters conferred with university officials to identify the materials possibly involved in the fire. Hazmat units remained on the scene to assist university staff with cleanup, with the last units clearing out by 10:22 p.m.
Three staff members — two campus police officers and one facilities worker — were taken to the hospital for medical checkups. The staff members were hospitalized “out of an abundance of caution,” according to Pugh.
The three staff members were released by Saturday morning and are now able to resume normal activities.
Opened in 2012, Regents houses five floors of research laboratories and the university’s chemistry, biology and physics departments. The labs feature “technologically advanced instrumentation and environmental controls necessary to conduct sensitive experiments and research,” according to the university website.
This is a developing story. The post will be updated as more information becomes available.

After Georgetown University Student Association President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18) won the 2017 GUSA executive election in February by a 34-vote margin, they promised to establish a “Fresh GUSA” focused on affordability, health resources and student entrepreneurship.
Since then, Mack and Andino have engaged Georgetown’s administration to address concerns over the status of students without documentation and “hidden costs” that make Georgetown campus life less affordable.
They have also had to react to external events, including early tensions with the GUSA senate, free speech challenges among student groups and anti-Semitic vandalism in various residence halls in September and October.
In an interview with The Hoya, Mack and Andino discussed their successes and shortcomings in achieving campaign promises, giving themselves a B+ grade so far. Despite progress on specific projects, Mack and Andino acknowledged the long-term nature of their campaign goals.
Steps Toward Affordability
During their campaign, Mack and Andino made affordability a central issue, calling it “the most pressing issue affecting Georgetown students” in a February pre-election viewpoint.
Mack and Andino promised to push the administration to adopt “more cost-saving measures” in the budget and to facilitate “Georgetown-specific discounts” with neighborhood businesses including Safeway and Trader Joe’s.
The second proposal has been implemented in a modified program launched in August as Mack and Andino’s first affordability initiative. The project distributed 1,500 coupon cards offering discounts at local businesses to students, particularly to those from low-income families.
The cards offered modest discounts at 21 clothing stores, restaurants and entertainment options, not grocery stores as Mack and Andino originally planned. Moreover, most of the markdowns offered no more than 15 percent off original prices — and some were already available with a student ID.
Missy Foy, director of the Georgetown Scholarship Program, a university program to support low-income students on Georgetown’s campus, said the discounts on the card were meager and largely applied to nonessential luxuries.
“While we’re appreciative of any discount offered to students (and certainly students for whom finances are a significant stress should be front of line), our candid reaction is that local companies could and should do more,” Foy wrote in an August email to The Hoya.
Mack and Andino stood by the initiative, though Mack acknowledged that the project could have been more successful with more outside input.
“The lesson I learned from it is that engagement is key,” Mack said. “When students feel left out of the loop, they aren’t as good and aren’t as well-received. I don’t regret it, I just think we could’ve done a better job.”
As their second major affordability effort, Mack and Andino proposed a program through the Cawley Career Education Center that would give students stipends for working unpaid internships. They secured $15,000 in funding for a 10-person pilot program for spring 2018, according to Aaron Bennett (COL ’19), the press secretary for the GUSA executive.
Mack cited the GUSA executive’s involvement in the expansion of Saturday GUTS bus service to Dupont Circle and the Trader Joe’s grocery store in Foggy Bottom. The change expanded free weekend transportation options from the main campus to popular locations by reallocating funding from a late-night bus service to Adams Morgan.
Discussing the prospect of securing funding and organization for a food pantry for students who stay on campus during holiday breaks when O’Donovan Hall is closed, Mack expressed restraint.
“It’s a project that transcends our administration,” Mack said. “It’s an important topic.”
Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship has been a guiding theme for Mack, who has taken the topic up as a personal project.
Mack cited as one of his proudest accomplishments the growth of organizations centered on supporting student startups, such as the Yellow House, a townhouse located at 1239 37th St. NW that hosts training and mentorship programs sponsored by the university’s Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative. Mack similarly pointed to the student group Georgetown Ventures, which connects undergraduates entrepreneurs with funding and consulting services, and individual startups.
Mack acknowledged GUSA was not directly involved in the Yellow House’s  creation. Planning for the house started before Mack and Andino took office: The application deadline for students seeking to live there was March 15, three days before Mack and Andino were inaugurated.
“GUSA involvement in the Yellow House wasn’t direct. GUSA didn’t necessarily say, ‘Hey, we need the Yellow House,’” Mack said. “But GUSA’s role is just that the conversation of entrepreneurship is on the Provost’s mind so that when he sees a proposal for a Yellow House, they choose that over other uses of that space.”
Mack did not claim GUSA’s involvement in developing individual startups or Georgetown Ventures. Mack sits on the board of Georgetown Ventures, though not in his capacity as GUSA president.
Another entrepreneurship-related initiative, an entrepreneurship minor in the McDonough School of Business, will benefit from consistent activism, Mack said.
“It’s hard to say it’s going to be accomplished by the end of our term because these are the long-term projects,” Andino said.
Supporting Students, Activism
Mack emphasized the role the executive plays in bringing the needs of students to the attention of university administrators.
“Jessica and I meet with administrators all the time, but we recognize that there are a lot of students at Georgetown who have never and will never meet with an administrator,” Mack said.
Over the summer, Mack and Andino joined efforts by student advocates, including members of the student group UndocuHoyas, to push for a full-time coordinator for undocumented students. The administration hired Arelis Palacios as full-time associate director for undocumented student services, who was previously serving in the role part time.
On the mental health front, Bennett pointed to the work led by Kenna Chick (SFS ’20), GUSA mental health policy coalition chair, in pushing for the university to subsidize a pilot program for off-campus mental health care, while Mack spoke approvingly of the expansion of mental health dialogue on campus.
Mack and Andino also indicated support for further sexual assault prevention policies at the academic and student activities levels, including a push to finalize a department of women and gender studies and bystander training for all new students.
Campus Planning and Housing
Andino said petitioning directly to the university involved a learning curve, but that administrators are frequently receptive to the executive’s ideas.
“At first it’s always hard to navigate all the different names of administrators, and you realize how many offices exist at this campus. But I feel like a lot of the times in our initial meetings, administrators would be like, ‘We are here to help you,’” Andino said.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said Mack and Andino are doing “very thoughtful work in their leadership of GUSA.”
“I have really enjoyed working with Kamar and Jessica, and have great respect for their leadership, and their focus on listening to and representing student voices,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Mack highlighted the pair’s involvement in discussions on campus construction and planning, including working with Vice President of Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey to ensure morning quiet hours by pushing back the daily start times for planned construction at Medstar Georgetown University Hospital.
Morey spoke favorably about his collaborations with Mack.
“He and his GUSA team have been great partners and have helped us advance our work in improving the Georgetown University community,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The executive also successfully advocated for the repeal of a no-warning policy for noise violations in freshman dorms. Freshmen are now offered a single warning before they are written up for noise violations, a return to a policy discontinued in 2016. The policy provides freshmen “with a more forgiving policy as they transition into college life,” Bennett wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Ben Baldwin (SFS ’19), the speaker of the GUSA senate, said Mack and Andino have brought an untraditional vision of GUSA advocacy.
“In our interactions and work with the executive, we certainly think they have a brought a new perspective to GUSA that had not existed in recent administrations,” Baldwin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I hope moving forward we will see greater cooperation between the executive and the Senate, and I know that our newer Senators look forward to working more closely with the policy coalition chairs.”
Reflecting on his term so far, Mack said he would have to take time to consider running for a second term.
“I need to call my mom about it. One thing I will say is I want to see someone in the role who has a background and who is doing it for the right reasons. If you are doing it as a joke, I don’t think that’s appropriate,” Mack said. “That’s what I really care about, is making sure that GUSA is in good hands next year.”

Student mental health advocates launched a petition advocating for the university to fund a pilot program to subsidize off-campus mental health care for 40 students.
The petition, addressed to University President John J. DeGioia on Monday, requested funds for the pilot program from the Office of the President and through the creation of an alumni fund. The proposal was created by the Georgetown University Student Association’s mental health policy coalition.
GUSA’s proposal would provide a stipend to subsidize care for students who are no longer eligible for mental health care through the university’s Counseling and Psychiatric Services.
Chick said financial barriers prevent some students from accessing care once their time with CAPS expires.
“Although all students have health insurance, the exorbitant costs hinder a student’s ability to seek out care,” Chick wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The costs of high deductibles and additive copays prove to be obstacles for students who are seeking care.”
The average cost of therapy in Washington, D.C., ranges from $150 to $225 per hour, according to Chick. Under Georgetown’s student health insurance plan, the average deductible fee for medical services is $250 and the average co-pay is $25.
Chick said GUSA hopes to expand subsidized off-campus care options to cover more students if the initial pilot program is a success.
“The purpose of the pilot program is to collect data on the financial contributions required to subsist the subsidized off-campus therapy on 40 students,” Chick wrote.
Chick said the next steps for the development of the program after receiving funding from the President’s office and collecting the data include setting up an alumni fund and receiving private donations.
College counseling centers nationwide have reported high demand for mental health services this year, according to Pugh.
“Counseling directors are reporting three-to-four week waits and in some cases even two-to-three month waits despite ramping up staffing and finding new and creative ways to deliver services,” Pugh wrote.
According to Pugh, senior university leaders — including Assistant Vice President for Student Health Vince WinklerPrins and CAPS Director Phil Meilman — have met with GUSA mental health advocates to discuss their concerns.
“Georgetown remains committed to working with students on a range of initiatives to improve health services on campus and will be forming a student health advisory board in January to seek continued input from students,” Pugh wrote.
The university has started taking steps in recent semesters to provide platforms for students to air health-related concerns. Administrators initially planned to establish a student health advisory board this semester, a plan that was announced in February but has not yet come to fruition. The university now hopes to establish the board by the spring, WinklerPrins said at a graduate student health care roundtable Nov. 10.
Aaron Bennett (COL ’19), press secretary for the GUSA executive, said GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18) support actions taken to improve off-campus mental health availability for students.
“The Mack-Andino administration has always included mental health of the student body as a top priority for GUSA advocacy,” Bennett wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This proposal, which increases access to adequate care for a number of students who are most in need, is a step in the right direction to make sure everyone in our community is healthy and able to thrive here.”
In the past, GUSA has worked with the Mental Health Advisory Board, a joint student and faculty task force formed in fall 2015 by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson to explore and address policy for mental health issues on campus, and university offices like Health Education Services and CAPS to improve mental health care accessibility and medical leave policies.
According to GUSA’s website, they plan to advocate for greater mental health programming in New Student Orientation and Blue and Gray campus tours.
Chick said GUSA’s proposal aims to equalize access to mental health services to further Georgetown’s Jesuit values.
“Currently, unlimited systems such as Yates and Campus Ministry exist for students to care for their bodies and souls, respectively,” Chick wrote. “This program ensures that everyone can have access to mental health services, especially the specific population that has a high need for service.”
The pilot program would cost between $34,000 and $40,000, approximately half of a Georgetown student’s tuition, according to Kenna Chick (SFS ’20), GUSA’s mental health policy coalition chair and the leader of the petition drive.
Chick said besides approaching the Office of the President for support, GUSA would solicit funding from private donors and alumni and student crowdsourcing platform SaxaFund.
The pilot program would provide data on the funding required to sustain the program for each student. Advocates hope to use the results of the pilot program to advocate funding for a further-reaching program that would serve more students.
CAPS currently provides individualized mental health care for a maximum of two semesters, after which the service refers students to off-campus providers, according to Rachel Pugh, the university’s senior director for strategic communications. Only about 55 percent of psychiatrists accept private insurance, according to a 2014 study by the National Institutes of Health.
“CAPS operates on a short term model and can provide a semester or two’s worth of services, consistent with what is typically done at other university counseling centers. Long term care is typically referred to community resources. Where finances are not an issue, such referrals work well,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “CAPS also maintains a list of low cost and no cost providers in the local community to whom referrals can be made.”

Pope Francis welcomed seven Georgetown students and four faculty members to Vatican City last weekend for an international conference on nuclear disarmament.
The conference, hosted by the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, took place on Nov. 10 and 11. Over the two days, the Georgetown delegation heard from 11 Nobel Peace Laureates, representatives from the United Nations and NATO, diplomats and acclesiastical officials on their approaches to reaching a world free of nuclear weapons.
Fr. Drew Christiansen, S.J., a professor of ethics and global human development and a senior research fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, led the Georgetown delegation.
Christiansen, who served as one of the chief advisers to the Vatican’s work at the United Nations Force, spoke at the conference on the urgent need, in the long term, to rid the globe of nuclear arms.
“Nuclear weapons must be treated as a wholly different class of weapons,” Christiansen said at the conference. “We should cease to imagine them as tools we can manage but rather as a curse we must banish.”
Representatives from Israel, Jordan and Japan also spoke on the negative impacts of nuclear weapons worldwide. Masako Wada, a survivor of the Nagasaki nuclear attack, gave a personal testimony.
The Catholic Church opposes the use and possession of nuclear weapons and has advocated for full abolishment of nuclear weapons. In April 2015, Pope Francis began to push for active disarmament of nuclear weapons, hosting international conferences to discuss methods of global nuclear disarmament.
Pope Francis spoke on the first day of the conference, noting that the threat, use and possession of nuclear weapons is reprehensible.
“Weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, create nothing but a false sense of security,” Pope Francis said. “They cannot constitute the basis for peaceful coexistence between members of the human family which must rather be inspired by an ethics of solidarity.”
Nuclear experts noted the need for students around the world to get involved in the commitment to eliminating nuclear arms. Student delegations from Catholic University and Notre Dame University were also in attendance, an outgrowth of the organizers’ effort to involve young people in the initiative.
Daniel Rosenberg (SFS ’18), who attended the conference, noticed the positive feedback from the speakers on the attendance of the students at the conference.
“Everyone was super excited that we were there just because one of the things that they’ve really been focusing on is involving the youth,” Rosenberg said.
Students from the Georgetown delegation had the opportunity to engage in one-on-one conversations with some of the speakers. Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) spoke briefly with Pope Francis.
“The opportunity seems surreal, while particularly interested in the issue, being Catholic myself and
having the opportunity to actually meet the Pope and talk to him for a few minutes was easily one of the best moments of my life,” Estes said.
Many of the students in attendance, who were invited to go on the trip because of their academic interests in international security, were inspired to hear the leaders in their fields speak on pressing international security issues.
“My interest in terms of academic and security stuff at Georgetown and what I’m studying is very much motivated by my faith, and my hope to help people around the world,” Estes said. “To see that so tangibly being carried out by the leaders of my church feels like a dream, it still does.”
Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19) said he appreciated hearing from leaders with different opinions about approaches to nuclear disarmament.
“It was an impactful academic experience, it provided me the opportunity to listen to a different perspective on nuclear weapons that I had gotten here,” Mondolfi said. “I got a much deeper understanding of what the Church’s position is, which is important both as a person and as a Catholic.”
For the Georgetown students who attended the conference, the experience of hearing distinguished lecturers speak on nuclear disarmament will impact their remaining time on the Hilltop and as they continue into their professional lives.
“So often as students, we spend four years working on a set of topics, but at times we don’t really see how it plays out in real life on the world stage,” Estes said. “Especially as a [School of Foreign Service] student, this was the nerdiest opportunity available and was just like an absolute dream.”

The Georgetown Scholarship Program held its fourth annual ProudToBeGSP promotional campaign to highlight its support for first-generation and low-income students.
The ProudToBeGSP week, running from Nov. 13 through Nov. 18, started as an initiative to spread awareness about low-income and first-generation students at Georgetown. GSP provides more than 650 undergraduate students with mentorship, advising and financial assistance. Over 70 percent of GSP’s current students are among the first in their family to attend college.
Called GSProud in previous years, the week launched under its new name this year to focus more on student
stories, according to GSP Assistant Director of Marketing and Events Mariana Gonzalez (MSB ’15).
“They wanted to focus more on the stories of students and, in past years, a lot of people had shared stories about how impactful the program was or how the staff was, which was great,” Gonzalez said. “But we like to say a lot of our secret sauce of GSP lies in students and their own stories, so that’s where the focus of ProudToBeGSP has come from this year.”
The ProudToBeGSP week consisted of programs including a social media campaign, a family dinner for GSP students and a community art share that helps GSP students share their experiences and become more comfortable with their identity.
GSP Director Missy Foy  said the ProudToBeGSP week makes the GSP community and its contributions to Georgetown more visible.
“This campaign is a powerful statement about our program and our students, and hopefully about Georgetown as a whole: demonstrating that these students belong and are valued and integral members of our campus; they enrich it and make it a better place,” Foy wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Since its inception in 2004, GSP has served over 1,400 students. Originally comprised of 50 students and created to raise money to offset student loans, GSP has grown into an essential support network for many first-generation students on campus.
GSP member Emilio Joubert (COL ’19) said the ProudToBeGSP campaign helps break socioeconomic barriers on campus.
“People get to see that it’s not just legacy students or just third legacy students or super rich students who go to Georgetown,” Joubert said. “People are seeing that there’s another dimension to what a Georgetown student is, and I feel like ProudToBeGSP really promotes that fact.”
GSP held a Social Media Day of Action on Wednesday, where GSP students shared their stories and why they are proud to be GSP students on social media platforms with the hashtag #ProudToBeGSP. The campaign also encouraged students outside of GSP to share why they are proud that GSP exists on campus according to Emily Kaye (COL’18), GSP’s student board chair.
Kaye said the Social Media Day of Action helps facilitate dialogue about diversity on campus.
“It’s a space for students to think about and reflect why diversity is valuable to the entire campus and how they’ve benefitted from students’ feeling empowered to talk about themselves within the classroom,” Kaye said.
The social media campaign also contributes to a shift in how scholarship and first-generation students are perceived, according to Foy.
“It’s really important that students’ experiences are being told in their own voices,” Foy wrote. “That’s like culture shifting. So, it’s not a social media campaign, it’s a culture shift that we’re seeing.”
The ProudToBeGSP Art Share, the only event of the week open to the whole Georgetown community, included an open mic and opportunities for GSP members to share their experiences. This event provided a creative outlet for the Georgetown community to learn more about GSP students’ experiences, according to GSP Event Coordinator Kosi Ndukwe (COL ’19).
Roberto Cabrera (COL ’19), GSP Peer Mentor Program chair, said ProudToBeGSP week helps members embrace their identities as low-income or first-generation.
“ProudToBeGSP is for first-generation college students to have pride in their identities, sort of just take their name back, take the label and own it, and I think that’s extremely vital in creating solidarity among the Georgetown Scholarship Program” he said.
Tithi Patel (SFS ’18), GSP’s Outreach and Strategic Partnership chair, said ProudToBeGSP week provides a way for the Georgetown community to celebrate socioeconomic diversity on campus.
“Campaigns like this week allow people from all backgrounds, not just those from a lower income bracket, to explore what socioeconomic status means and celebrate the stories that color our student body,” Patel said.

The de la Cruz Gallery of Art will reopen January on the first floor of the Edmund A. Walsh Building after a semester-long delay, according to Assistant Vice President of University Facilities Gina Bleck.
Difficulties in acquiring covers for a glass display case for suspended sculptures, among other unspecified pieces of equipment, delayed completion of the project, originally planned to open this fall, according to Bleck.
The gallery space is currently undergoing a final round of inspections by architects, engineers and university staff, according to Bleck.
Construction of the 2,500-square-foot exhibit space began last February, more than a year after Maria (CAS ’87) and Alberto de la Cruz (CAS ’89) donated an unspecified amount for the project in Oct. 2015.
The gallery will feature travelling exhibitions and historical artwork from museums across Washington, D.C., as well as original pieces from Georgetown undergraduate and graduate students. The space will complement the Lucile M. and Richard F.X. Spagnuolo Art Gallery, which opened in 1958 and is also located on the first floor of Walsh.
Art History Department Chair Alfred Acres said in an interview with The Hoya Oct. 16, 2015 the de la Cruz Gallery of Art would include paintings, sculptures, and installation pieces, while Spagnuolo would host photography and works on paper.
Al Miner, Georgetown’s Director of Galleries, said the gallery will host events both open to the public and exclusive to students, adding that the space will allow visitors to not only admire the artwork, but also engage with its creators.
“The gallery won’t be a passive viewing space”, Miner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “An annual public program of performance art, visiting artist presentations, and innovative multidisciplinary dialogues will ensure that the gallery is a space to have memorable experiences, ones that will appeal to and resonate with students well beyond the art department.”
In addition to the de la Cruz gallery, the Walsh lobby’s paint, lighting, benches, and restrooms are also being renovated.
The gallery replaced the Walsh Black Box Theatre, the main auditorium used by student theatre and dance groups.
The theater was closed last year to prepare for construction, leading to the creation of the Village C Theatre in Village C West Residence Hall and additional space in Poulton Hall to compensate for the loss of space for the performing arts, according to Maya Roth, the director of Theater and Performance Studies.
The Village C Theatre, formerly occupied by a performing arts classroom and alumni lounge, now serves as a black box theatre with lighting and seating, despite no longer being able accommodate classes. The student theater groups displaced by the creation of the Village C Theatre now share the rehearsal space offered in Poulton Hall with Hoya Kids.
Roth highlighted that the music department remains the only group on campus lacking creative space at Georgetown.
“The biggest glaring gap that remains is a new or renovated space for Music: for concerts, for classes, for rehearsals, including ones specifically designed or renovated with choral music and, separately, instrumental music,” Roth wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Roth endorsed the repurposing of the Walsh Black Box Theatre, saying it would be an appropriate forum for the visual arts as it had been for theater before.
“WBB will make a great art gallery,” Roth wrote in the email. “It had made a versatile, great space for many groups.”

The Republican tax bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday could have a strong negative effect on Georgetown graduate students receiving financial aid.
The bill, proposed by House Republicans on Nov. 2, is aimed at reshaping the tax code, including reducing the number of income tax brackets from seven to four, lowering the corporate tax rate and repealing the estate tax by 2024. The bill passed in the House by a 227-205 vote.
This bill raises financial concerns for graduate students relying on federal benefits to finance their education.
According to Politico, the plan would remove nearly $65 billion in tax benefits, many of which finance programs that alleviate student loans and help students trying to finance their university education. The proposed bill would cut tax breaks that employers receive for programs that aid graduate students with their education. Additionally, the bill would remove the tax break colleges receive for giving tuition discounts to their employees.
According to Georgetown’s Office of Student Financial Services’ website, a first-year graduate degree can cost anywhere from roughly $64,000 to upwards of $113,000 per year.
Without significant financial aid, the cost of a graduate education at Georgetown can impose a heavy financial burden on many students. While the proposed tax bill would not completely remove graduate financial aid, it may significantly impact it.
For Ph.D. candidate Jewel Lipps (GRD ’22), the passage of the bill could mark a turning point in her education.
“I view this as having an apocalyptic impact on graduate student costs,” Lipps wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to The Washington Post, the House’s version of the tax reform bill would eliminate Code 117 of the current tax law, which ensures that tuition support for higher-level education is not counted in calculations for gross income taxes of students.
Without the deduction, Lipps said her tuition costs would inflate her taxes, and she would be forced to pay taxes that would amount to nearly one-third of her income.
“If what I described above became my reality, I would have to drop out immediately,” Lipps said.
Additionally, the bill could impact families without documentation.
University President John J. DeGioia has openly expressed the importance of students without documentation to the Georgetown community.
“As a university located in our nation’s capital and animated by our Catholic and Jesuit identity, we are called to support all of our students, including our undocumented students,” DeGioia wrote in a Facebook post Nov. 21, 2016.
According to Politico Pro, the bill’s passage could cause a new wave of difficulty as a clause in the bill would restrict the American Opportunity Tax Credit. This credit offers up to $2,500 in higher-education expense coverage for undocumented students.
Rachel Pugh, senior director of strategic communications at Georgetown, said the university is concerned about the effects of the bill.
“Georgetown is committed to improving the affordability and accessibility of higher education and is opposed to provisions that undermine these values,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have worked with other institutions of higher education to communicate our concerns—particularly with provisions in the tax reform bill that would make education more expensive for graduate students and provide less tax relief to families in affording tuition—with Members of Congress.”
The Office of Financial Aid, the Office of the President and the Office of the Dean for Georgetown’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences declined to comment.
The bill is now set to proceed to the Senate, where it faces strong opposition from Democrats. After a process of adjustments, the Senate may ratify it, although the Senate’s own version of the bill includes major differences like a proposed repeal of the Affordable Healthcare Act’s mandate for individuals to purchase health insurance. The Senate’s version faces an uncertain future. With at least two senators — Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) saying they cannot support the current plan, Republicans may fail to secure a simple majority to pass the plan.
[…] Republican tax bill that passed in the U.S. House of Representatives on Nov. 16 represents a threat to the livelihoods of graduate students. Right now, tuition for most Ph.D. students is waived — […]

All Georgetown students have benefited from rare good fortune that enables them to attend an elite institution, educational reform advocate, professor and author Cathy Davidson argued at a Riggs Library discussion Wednesday.
“Whether you were lucky enough to be born with affluent parents or parents that believed in education and fought for you, or a teacher who inspired you, every one of us had something in their life that was luckier than the majority of Americans,” Davidson said.
Davidson spoke about her new book, “The New Education: How to Revolutionize the University to Prepare Students for a World In Flux,” released Sept. 5.
Davidson said students at schools like Duke and Georgetown all share a privilege that is not enjoyed by the vast majority of college students.
As an English professor and vice provost of interdisciplinary studies at Duke for over 20 years combined, Davidson began taking up interest in public education. It was then that Davidson realized she had to make a career change. At first, Davidson said people often bristled when she spoke about problems in public education.
“I would get this look like, how dare you distinguished professor at Duke University talk about public education,” Davidson said. “I don’t think it’s possible to know what everyday life is like at a really stressed university until you’ve actually been in totally involved.”
Davidson moved to the City University of New York in July 2014, where she is now a distinguished professor in the English Ph.D. program at the CUNY Graduate Center.
“We cannot have a modern, responsible society without modern, responsible public education,” Davidson said.
The goal of a modern and responsible education takes many forms, according to Davidson, and requires a radical change in the state of higher education. She spoke highly of introducing new technology, diversifying student bodies and establishing programs of interdisciplinary studies.
She uses techniques called inventory methods to give all students a voice — even in a class of thousands of students. By having students write down a simple idea, for example, and sharing it with another classmate, everyone’s voice is heard in some way.
“Interactivity and becoming a responsible part of the world we are in is also about being able to hear from everybody,” Davidson said. “You want everyone to have a chance to hear and think for themselves and then think for themselves. Many students never speak in a class unless specifically called upon, that, to me, is a horrible failing.”
Davidson said a diverse student body contributes to a richer educational experience.
“The more diverse the people who are contributing, that’s every kind of diversity, the more likely to have a better solution for everybody at the end,” Davidson said.
Davidson also advocated for interdisciplinary studies programs, saying they offer a more comprehensive approach to learning that goes beyond the boundaries of discrete disciplines.
“The questions that these generation’s students are dealing with are so complicated and so vast and so intermingled that those old divisions between the humanities, the social sciences, the sciences, divisions between disciplines, the regulations between what a discipline is really don’t matter,” Davidson said.
Davidson said the traditional understanding of learning needs to be radically altered. Students attend classes in pursuit of a degree without truly engaging in the learning, she said, which she believes should change.
“Learning really should be about what you don’t know and getting to that place of unknowing so you can build on that,” Davidson said. “It takes a lot of confidence to admit, ‘I don’t have a clue, and I still want to learn.’”

Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) led a demonstration in Dupont Circle to address the concerns of Washington, D.C. residents surrounding the city’s growing rodent and vermin population Monday.
The walk, which attracted about 100 participants, was one in a series of “results walks,” in which Bowser, local leaders and agency officials walk through District neighborhoods to listen to complaints and comments from area residents. Bowser said her administration is taking a proactive approach toward combating infestations across the city.
“Rats are an issue I take very seriously and my team is being innovative, proactive, and strategic in our approach,” Bowser wrote in a news release on Monday. “Like many cities across the country, Washington DC has seen an increase in the number of rodent reports over the past several years, but through better analytics, smart technology, and broader community outreach, we are meeting the challenge.”
According to the District’s 311 city services helpline, rodent sighting complaints saw a 65 percent increase during the 2016 fiscal year, with 3,200 complaints filed across the District. The helpline attributed the city’s growing rodent population to a number of factors, including warmer winters, during which fewer rats freeze to death, in addition to the District’s growing population, which generates more garbage that pests feed on.
Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) also attended the walk, encouraging District community members to work together to address the rodent population.
“I’m walking in Dupont Circle with Mayor Bowser to focus on DC’s rat problem. I encourage residents to call @311DCgov & @DOHDC when they see rats around their homes and neighborhood,” Evans said in a tweet Monday. “We move toward a healthier DC when we work together to prevent the spread of the rat population.”
According to D.C.’s Department of Health, city residents can do their part to address the city’s rat problem by disposing of garbage in heavy metal or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids, storing pet food in secured containers and removing weeds and other debris from yards where rats can hide.
The walk also brought together a growing number of rodent-related services available to District residents. Bowser highlighted The Lab @ D.C.’s Rodent Abatement Predictive Analysis project, an initiative that will use 311 data to develop predictive models that recognize locations of rodent infestation to better inform exterminators.
Other initiatives include a $13,500 grant from the Department of Small and Local Business Development to help District businesses purchase commercial trash compacters to keep rodents out of city dumpsters. The DSLBD has identified 29 grantees to receive funding.
Additionally, the Department of Health has distributed 25 solar trash cans and 400 “smart litter bins” in all eight wards of the city. These solar powered bins compact trash and keep rodents out of garbage, while also helping D.C. businesses save electricity.
The rat walk was part of Bowser’s #BacktoBasicsDC initiative, which focuses on ensuring that District residents have access to city services and highlights the day-to-day work of city employees. This effort has included programming such as Form-a-Palooza, an event in which city residents were able to seek help and provide feedback on filling out forms for local and federal assistance; the Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program and UequalsU, a program that confirms HIV-positive District residents take their medication on a daily basis.

The United States government must evaluate the role of social media networks in facilitating Russia’s ongoing cyberwarfare campaigns in European elections and Eastern European government affairs, two cybersecurity experts argued during an event Wednesday.
Speaking on a panel organized by the Alexander Hamilton Society, an international relations club, James Carafano (GRD ’85, GRD ’00), vice president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy think tank, and Samuel Visner (SFS ’76), director of the National Cybersecurity Federally Funded Research and Development Center, debated the merits of increased government action against Russian cyberwarfare.
Robert Lieber, a government and international affairs professor, moderated the panel.
Both panelists acknowledged the United States’ intelligence community’s assessment of active and coordinated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, but they cautioned against conflating correlation and causation regarding Russian cyberattacks and U.S. election results.
A Jan. 6 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, CIA and NSA concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a sophisticated and extended campaign to manipulate public opinion, attack former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, bolster support for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and undermine confidence in the American electoral process.
 
“We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,” the report reads. “When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign then focused on undermining her expected presidency.”
The interference campaign included manipulation of social media networks including Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, as well as disinformation outlets disguised as legitimate news outlets like the RT network in the United States.
Visner said cybersecurity measures must be improved to strengthen electoral processes.
“It’s time for us to improve the cybersecurity of the electoral system, and I’ll go further, and I don’t just mean the system that counts votes,” Visner said. “I do think that means the system that is being used to transmit information so that people are no longer simply bombarded with information without any sense of provenance or without any hope of attribution.”
However, Carafano said that any given solution to dealing with social networking information must respect civil liberties.
“[A solution] has to not infringe on the basic liberty of American citizens, which means their free access to information and their freedom to be stupid,” Carafano said.
Carafano said the U.S. should first determine the consequences of the Russian cyberattacks before deciding to commit resources instead of responding with a knee-jerk reaction because Russia was involved.
“Where I think there is an honest place to have debate is the efficacy of these activities,” Carafano said.
Visner said Russian interference was not directly connected to Trump’s victory.
“It’s dangerous to argue that coincidence is a causality,” Visner said. “The fact that the Russians attempted to affect the U.S. election and the fact that the election resulted in, gave us a result that many people didn’t expect, does not necessarily connect the two.”
The U.S. has a tendency to emphasize capabilities and exclude intentions, Visner said.
“We didn’t see this coming because we focused on capabilities,” Visner said. “We talk a lot about the resources without asking what the resources are for.”
Visner said the Russians aim to provoke the global community through their political strategy.
“[The Russians,] as a declining power, are insurgents, and insurgents do not want to shake the international system. They want to shock the international system,” Visner said.
Carafano compared U.S. and Russian motives in conducting cyberwarfare. Unlike the U.S., which demands concrete objectives, the Russians consider cyberwarfare as a means of “creating opportunity, not creating effects or outcomes,” Carafano said.
Visner and Carafano also discussed Russia’s foreign policy objectives, including its desire to craft a sphere of influence in the Eastern Europe, a region formerly controlled by the Soviet Union in the 20th century.
The panelists placed cyberwarfare in the broader context of hybrid warfare a combination of physical, unconventional and symbolic attacks on a nation with the intent to undermine legitimacy, sovereignty and integrity.
Visner said hybrid warfare is a new technique, which employs cyberwarfare as a part of statecraft. Russia, Visner said, plans to reassert itself as a power in the “near abroad” region, which includes countries such as Ukraine, using this startegy.
Most recently, Ukraine continues to field military strikes and cyberattacks, which began in 2014 after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, a peninsula in the Black Sea that house part of Russia’s naval fleet, and Donbass, a region in eastern Ukraine that continues to witness heavy violence between the Ukrainian military and Russian armed militants led by Russian military officials.
Russian president Vladimir Putin aims to seize control of U.S. influence in Europe, Carafano said.
“He would like to see American power essentially retreat from Europe.”

Student-run startup Fiber Filter is promoting its new fiber-catching laundry bag prototype in a promotional video that aims to pressure washing machine companies to take social responsibility for microplastic pollution.
Fiber Filter startup founders Lola Bushnell (COL ’18), Carter Cortazzi (COL ’19), and Jaime Farrell (COL ’19) released the video Monday. Photographer Ben Von Wong traveled to Washington, D.C. at the end of the spring 2017 semester to film and edit the video with social media volunteers.
Von Wong used cloth laundry “monsters” to depict the growing problem of microfibers from synthetic clothing that are released into water systems each time someone does a load of laundry.
“His video is fantastic. It’s awesome. it really alerts people to the problem,” Cortazzi said.
Cortazzi and the other founders of Fiber Filter were first alerted to the problem in the Global Challenges, Climate and Sociology course they took in fall 2016. Students in the class were charged with identifying a global environmental problem and proposing a solution.
Bushnell, Cortazzi and Farrell shared a love for ocean and water conservation, so they chose to focus on microfiber and microplastic pollution. Microplastic pollution affects oceans worldwide, and makes up 85 percent of debris on shorelines across the world, according to The Guardian.
The problem does not just affect oceans, however; microfiber pollution has also affected local water sources. Microplastic pollution cannot be filtered out by wastewater treatment plants, such as D.C.’s Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant.
For Bushnell, Cortazzi and Farrell, the project was not just for a grade in the class.
“It’s a huge problem with no real solution,” Cortazzi said. “We saw that and we thought we had a solution that could make a real difference, and it’s something that we were super passionate about so we decided to put all of our energy into it and that’s sort of where the startup came from.”
After receiving grants from the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund and Startup Hoyas, the group, with the addition of new team member Anisha Vora (SFS ’19) spent the spring 2017 semester working on product testing and research. Bushnell and Farrell stayed in D.C. over the summer to continue refining the website and prototype.
“It was long and really difficult, as it’s hard to get the methodology for doing that,” Cortazzi said.
The prototype is a mesh bag comparable to a small laundry bag, except the mesh of the bag is significantly smaller.
“Our mesh is super super fine,” Cortazzi said. “We experimented with 100 to 250 microns, so less than a millimeter in size.”
The team has tested the prototype in performance tests for both cleanliness of clothing and the capture rate of the fiber. Their best result was an 87 percent capture rate of microfibers.
“Experiments show the water and detergent can move freely through the bag but the fibers can’t really escape,” Cortazzi said.
There are other similar products out on the market today, according to Cortazzi, like Patagonia’s Guppy Friend and the Cora Ball. The team is not worried about the competition because their end goal is to inspire change.
“What we really wanted to achieve with this new video was pressure for an institutional solution because we’re three students – if we can come up with a solution to this, there is no reason that a huge washing machine company can’t build something like a filter into a washing machine,” Cortazzi said.
Challenging washing machine manufacturers to take social responsibility and to stop ignoring the problem they are helping create was the main goal of releasing the video. Finding a solution to the problem is important, particularly now that synthetic clothing production is set to triple by 2025.
Progress has been made in the overarching battle against microplastics, however. Microbeads were banned in a legislative decision by the Microbead-Free Waters Act in 2015. But, Cortazzi said, “the solution here is not as simple as that because you can’t just stop making synthetic clothing.” Thus, the team decided to pinpoint washing machine companies as their main point of contact.
“Our solution is still something we feel to be really viable but it’s only going to be a small part of what’s necessary to change,” Cortazzi said.
