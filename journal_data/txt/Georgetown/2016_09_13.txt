A group of doctoral students is exploring the option of forming a union to negotiate better work contracts for graduate students serving as teaching assistants and research assistants after an Aug. 23 ruling by the National Labor Relations Board, which enabled student assistants to unionize and collectively bargain.
The NLRB ruled last month that teaching and research assistants at private universities are employees with the right to unionize. The NLRB ruling did not cover undergraduate TAs and research assistants.
The Georgetown Doctoral Student Coalition — a group advocating for better working and learning conditions for doctoral students — formed a working group earlier this year to investigate the implications of unionizing doctoral students. The working group was formed this summer in anticipation of the NLRB ruling.
Jake Earl (GRD ’17), a member of the working group, said the group has not made a decision on whether to support a move to unionize and is waiting for more student input. The working group also plans to hold a broader dialogue on the issue among both graduate and undergraduate students and other staff members at the university.
“The working group is not committed one way or another about unionization. We think it needs to be a democratic decision among the sort of people who would be represented in a union,” Earl said. “We’re just encouraging open conversation among Ph.D. students, undergraduates, administration and faculty.”
A forum will be held by the DSC in October where students will be able to voice questions and concerns about the possibility of unionization, according to Earl.
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the administration is currently examining the NLRB ruling, but that the university is committed to providing an optimal educational experience for the entire campus community
“Georgetown is reviewing the ruling. Student employment is an important component of our learning and living community,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We continue to seek opportunities to make the experience a positive one for all concerned.”
Compensation for Georgetown doctoral students varies considerably. Science doctoral students have free tuition, but their stipend is usually determined by research grants, their doctoral advisor spends — funding provided by faculty advisors — and time spent teaching classes, according to Evan Gardner (GRD ’20), a doctoral student in the chemistry department.
Gardner said unions could potentially allow doctoral students at Georgetown to obtain better job benefits and healthcare plans not currently covered by Georgetown.
“Unions in some sense — in terms of health care or services — would allow for collectivebargaining for you to maybe get more health care, maybe a dental plan, or maybe a vision plan, which aren’t covered,” Gardner said.
Earl said health insurance is a large issue doctoral students face and sudden health-related emergencies throw students into debt.
“Our health care plan is not very good; given the way that it’s structured, if they have some sort of unexpected medical expense [it could] put them pretty deeply into medical debt,” Earl said.
In addition, Earl said the stipends of many doctoral students cannot sufficiently match the cost of living in the city.
“Cost of living is high in D.C. and especially students in the biomedical programs, their wages just aren’t keeping up with the living wage,” Earl said.
According to Gardner, doctoral and other graduate students are in a limbo in choosing whether they would like to be treated as employees or students of the university.
“You are in purgatory. You are between being a student and a paid employee of a company where you get most of the benefits and all sorts of stuff,” Gardner said. “In some cases people like to define you in the way that benefits them the most.”
The working group examined pre-existing graduate student unions at other colleges and institutions and their contracts and agreements, according to Earl.
“We reached out to graduate students who were trying to unionize at other schools, those who had unionized, so at [New York University] and other places,” Earl said. “I looked pretty extensively at graduate student union contracts to see what’s in the contract, what kind of terms they have.”
Diedre Nelms (GRD ’19), a DSC member, said the unionization of doctoral students at NYU enabled students to make progress in gaining benefits for themselves, including better pay and health care.
“Unionization at NYU has achieved really comprehensive health care benefits,” Nelms said. “NYU’s union has achieved paid dental and comprehensive health care, better mental health care programs and also child care subsidies.”
Gardner said tactics such as strikes typically used by unions to gain benefits would most likely not work for some post-doctoral students.
“For my case if I decided something was unfair to me and I decided to go on strike, it would ultimately hurt me even more, because I still need to push my research forward and I still need to do stuff to benefit my academic career,” Gardner said.
Nelms added that unionization could result in conflicts between doctoral students and the union on respective goals of the collective bargaining.
“Sometimes there can be conflicts between the members of the bargaining unit, like the TAs and the union itself,” Nelms said.
Gardner said teaching and research assistants need to pursue a compromise among their opposing interests, as increasing wages may not always benefit the students when it comes to the sciences. Funding for the sciences is grant-based and increased wages may make it difficult to take on new doctoral students.
“If we demand that our salary doubles then your professors can no longer afford to have as many students,” Gardner said. “That’s not necessarily a great thing. There is always sort of a middle ground that people want to reach.”
Earl said he hopes unions can allow for more balanced standards across the university.
“One of the things that we think a union might be able to do is to create some sort of a consistency in terms of work expectations,” Earl said.

MedStar Georgetown University Hospital is set to move forward with constructing the proposed $567 million medical and surgical pavilion by the end of the year after it received concept approval from the Old Georgetown Board and other key community organizations last week.
The new facility will encompass a 477,000-square-foot medical and surgical pavilion that will house 156 private patient rooms, a new emergency department, larger operating rooms, a rooftop helipad with direct access to the emergency room and three levels of underground parking.
The approval came after MedStar Georgetown made alterations to the pavilion’s design at the request of the OGB, an advisory committee of architects who work on behalf of the Commission of Fine Arts to review pending projects in Georgetown. These alterations included adding more green space and walkability around the entrance.
The design initially called for two ramps leading from the underground parking lot to the entrance, which would bisect the greenspace. However, this was reduced to only one ramp in negotiations with the OGB after concerns of pedestrian safety were raised.
According to Medstar Georgetown, the hospital plans to break ground by December in order to complete construction by 2020.
The OGB is an advisory board to the Commission of Fine Arts, which is the federal design review agency. Design review by the OGB/CFA is required as part of the permit process of Washington, D.C. Final CFA action is required for the issuance of a building construction permit.
Despite these changes, the project must still undergo additional mandatory city approvals before construction begins. In a statement to The Hoya, MedStar Georgetown Director of Media Relations Marianne Worley expressed her excitement in receiving approval and moving forward with the project.
“MedStar Georgetown University Hospital is thrilled to receive Concept Approval of our proposed medical and surgical pavilion from the Old Georgetown Board,” Worley wrote in a statement. “On behalf of the patients who will benefit from this pavilion, which also includes emergency care, we appreciate the collaboration and support among our neighbors and the OGB to help us bring this much needed, state-of-the-art facility to fruition.”
MedStar’s expansion project has integrated collaboration between many local Georgetown and D.C. community groups, including the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E and Georgetown Community Partnership.
The ANC is a nonpartisan neighborhood body made up of locally elected representatives who voice the concerns of their neighborhoods to D.C. and the federal government. The Georgetown Community Partnership is a forum that was created as part of the university’s 2010 Campus Plan. It is meant to facilitate discussion and share decision-making responsibilities to maintain a relationship between the university and the Georgetown community.
ANC 2E Commissioner Reed Howard (SFS ’17) worked closely with former ANC 2E Commissioner Kendyl Clausen and MedStar Georgetown Hospital President Michael Sachtleben to advocate for the inclusion of green space in the new designs.
“I am pleased that the new plans contain a major expansion of green living space for undergraduates to enjoy,” Howard said.
In accordance with the university’s 2017-2036 Campus Plan, the expansion is necessary in order to renovate the aging existing building and modernize the facility to meet the needs of patients.
“Following extensive review and discussion, Medstar Georgetown and MedStar Health concluded that a new medical/surgical pavilion on the Georgetown University campus was necessary to address a confluence of factors, including the current aging facility; a need for modern operating rooms; a growing aging population within the District of Columbia; and the need for an upgraded patient experience, including an updated Emergency Department, modern surgical and ICU spaces, all private patient rooms, and right-sized patient areas,” the campus plan reads.
Last October, Medstar Georgetown submitted a Certificate of Need application – a document necessary for the establishment or expansion of healthcare facilities – to the District of Columbia State Health Planning and Development Agency. The city approved the application in March.
Georgetown University Student Association Master Planning and Student Engagement Committee member Mara Goldman (SFS ’19) said the committee is working to ensure that student and campus life is relatively undisturbed by MedStar renovations. Goldman also serves on ANC 2E, but did not work directly with the hospital.
“We’re working to make sure any imposition on student life is limited. We’re working on times of construction to make sure there are alternate routes to campus and just that there’s as little impact as possible,” Goldman said. “In my capacity in GUSA and not in my capacity as ANC commissioner, we have outlined what our priorities are — noise, making sure there is accessibility.”
According to Goldman, the next step is for the D.C. Zoning Committee to approve the plan.

With 55 days to go until the Nov. 8 general election, the university’s stance on political endorsements has come under the spotlight for its ambiguity; while the Student Activities Commission has stated that no student groups are able to publically endorse presidential candidates, official university policy allows such student group endorsements.
Student representatives with Georgetown University College Republicans said it has not endorsed in current and past election cycles because of the university’s nonprofit status. A representative from Georgetown University College Democrats said it is endorsing democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. As a tax-exempt nonprofit, Georgetown is unable to endorse political candidates.
However, official university policy indicates that student groups are able to endorse political candidates. Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the university expects student political organizations to endorse their party’s candidates and organize activities to support them, so long as the students or student organizations make it clear that they are not speaking on behalf of the university.
“Student political groups can endorse candidates, but it must be clear that it is them and not the university because of our tax-exempt status,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We recognize that student political groups are political and do not restrict the College Democrats and College Republicans (and other recognizedstudent political groups that have access to SAC funding) from using the funds that are available for political campaign activities.”
University policy states that individual students and student political groups can actively engage in campaign activity. Students and student political groups can also conduct nonpartisan and noncandidate-specific voter education or voter registration activities, invite candidates or surrogates to speak on campus — as long as roughly equivalent opportunities are provided for all legitimate candidates — distribute campaign materials in Red Square or other approved locations and use university funds for incidental expenses relating to group political campaign activities, including travel.
These rules apply only to organizations that receive funding from SAC, which does not include candidate-specific student political groups such as Hoyas for Hillary. Hoyas for Hillary’s campaigning trips to New Hampshire and Pennsylvania in the spring were organized through Hillary for America, while the participating members funded another trip to Iowa last January.
According to the student organization standards set by the Division of Student Affairs, student activity fees and other university resources cannot go directly to funding partisan political campaigns.
The interpretation presented to clubs, however, is unclear. SAC Chair Brian Philipps (SFS ’18) said clubs are unable to support political groups for the sake of preserving Georgetown’s status as a nonprofit. This is the second election cycle in which SAC has reinforced this interpretation of the CSE policy.
“So as not to put Georgetown’s tax-exempt status in jeopardy, official university student groups are prohibited from actively campaigning for political causes or using university money to do so,” Philipps wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This includes all SAC groups.”
According to Director of the Center for Student Engagement Erika Cohen-Derr, while university funds allocated for students cannot go directly as a donation toward any political entities, once student groups receive the funding, trips to campaign for candidates are one way in which they can choose to spend it.
“The university has the mission to support students’ political and civic engagement, and one of the ways it does that is by actively supporting student groups who engage in political activity through funding for their activities,” Cohen-Derr wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As these groups receive funding from their advisory board, they may seek to spend it on travel for campaign trips or flyers to recruit other students to join their group.”
“During an election year, student political organizations often use that money to show support for their party’s candidate,” Cohen-Derr wrote.
“My understanding, from talking to leaders in those groups is they have a practice, not a policy, that they don’t endorse in the primary season but that they fulfill their responsibility to generate discussion and raise awareness around that political viewpoint,” Cohen-Derr wrote. “It wouldn’t surprise anyone for the College Democrats to endorse Hillary Clinton or for the College Republicans to endorse Donald Trump. That’s what those groups do.”
The university’s stance on political endorsements has evolved over the past several years. Prior to the student activity fee program established for the 2011-12 school year that enabled increased funding for student groups, SAC was more restrictive about its funding processes and allocated less funding for student political groups, particularly during the 2008 election cycle. As a result of this, SAC restricted the ability for student groups to travel in an effort to be fair to all student groups.
Student political groups at other private universities have endorsed political candidates this election cycle. The Harvard Republican Club published a letter rebuking Trump’s candidacy, while the Yale College Republicans endorsed Trump. The Yale endorsement led to the creation of a new Republican political group on campus, the Yale New Republicans.
Former SAC Chair Patrick Musgrave declined to comment on SAC policy during previous election cycles.
Hoya Staff Writer Christian Paz contributed reporting.
Correction: This article previously misspelled Brian Philipps (SFS ’18) name as Brian Phillips in the article.
Clarification: Philipps wrote in an email to The Hoya that SAC’s policy is in line with current CSE guidelines and that SAC enforces university policy – and does not have its own policy – before the article was printed.

The Statehood Yes! Campaign, intended to convince District residents to vote for D.C.’s statehood in a November referendum and consequently convince Congress to vote on the issue, launched last Wednesday.
The campaign committee is chaired by D.C. philanthropist George Vradenburg and supported by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) and 12 D.C. councilmembers.
While the final language of the four-part ballot initiative is still being determined, residents will vote in a November referendum on whether or not to instigate a process of getting statehood for Washington, D.C. The final say about statehood for D.C. will come from Congress.
The ballot initiative will ask whether citizens support D.C. becoming a state, its proposed name of New Columbia, the borders of the state and the constitution of the new state.
If the ballot initiative passes, Statehood Yes! will then lobby Congress to vote on giving the District statehood.
D.C. Vote Director of Advocacy Bo Shuff, who serves as a member of the Statehood Yes! committee, said the campaign will use volunteers, rallies and fundraisers to mobilize voters in favor of the measure, which he expects to pass overwhelmingly.
“Every time we’ve had conversations across the District, residents in the District want to be a state, they want equal representation that comes with being a state, they want to end second-class citizenship that occurs,” Shuff said. “I anticipate that it’s going to pass and we hope that it will be passed with large margins.”
However, Shuff is slightly less optimistic about the measure’s prospects beyond the ballot. He cautioned that even if the measure passes, it will simply be the first step in a long process that will determine if D.C. receives statehood.
“That’s one of those questions that is always fun in a hypothetical realm,” Shuff said. “But until you actually press the question to the lawmakers who make the decision, the U.S. Congress, answers around hypotheticals are different than answers around legislation.”
D.C. statehood has faced obstacles in Congress before. Previously, a D.C. statehood amendment failed in 1985 when it attained support from only 1 of the 38 states necessary for ratification.
The proposed D.C. constitution was drafted by a five-person council, including Bowser and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D). The constitution stresses the importance of equal rights for citizens of D.C.
“We will enjoy the full rights of citizens of the United States of America: to democracy and a republican form of government, to enact our own laws governing state affairs, and to voting representation in the United States Congress,” the constitution draft reads.
The D.C. Council elected to include the question of statehood on the ballot in July and will hold two more hearings through October to determine the appropriate wording for the November ballot.
In a November 2015 poll by The Washington Post, 67 percent of surveyed residents said they supported D.C.’s ratification as the 51st state. However, at a national level, D.C. statehood has faced stark opposition from many.
The Republican Party’s national platform, announced this summer, included language advising against statehood for the District.
“Statehood for the District can be advanced only by a constitutional amendment. Any other approach would be invalid,” the platform reads. “A statehood amendment was soundly rejected by the states when last proposed in 1976 and should not be revived.”
However, the Democratic Party included support for D.C. statehood in its national platform.
“Restoring our democracy also means finally passing statehood for the District of Columbia, so that the American citizens who reside in the nation’s capital have full and equal congressional rights as well as the right to have the laws and budget of their local government respected without Congressional interference,” the Democratic Party platform reads.
Georgetown University Student Association Federal and D.C. Relations Committee Secretary of D.C. Statehood Cheryl Liu (SFS ’19), who is part of Students for D.C. Statehood, said she will help campaign for the ballot initiative this November. Students for D.C. Statehood’s main goal is to spread the word to residents to vote for D.C. statehood this November.
“We are doing everything we can to support the mayor’s referendum,” Liu said. “That’s doing things like participating in the Students for 51 Speakers Bureau, which basically trains students and community members to talk to organizations they are involved in to inform people about the ballot referendum.”
Liu noted the drive for statehood is inspired by two main grievances: D.C.’s lack of voting representation in Congress and the congressional meddling in D.C.’s local politics.
“People all over the country want D.C. to become a state so that they will get a representative and two senators,” Liu said. “Congress also has complete control over D.C. affairs, so they can come in and supersede any law passed in D.C.”
D.C.’s current nonvoting representative, Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), who has campaigned for D.C. statehood since she was first elected to Congress in 1990, said residents of the District need to put continuous pressure on Congress to support D.C. statehood in an interview with WAMU on Sept. 7. The last time Congress voted on the issue in 1993, it was defeated in the House of Representatives by a vote of 277 to 153.
“In the past, D.C. has often showed up for statehood, but our tendency is to show up when the Congress does something bad to D.C. and then there’s an outpouring. It’s been very episodic,” Norton said. “We need sustained work.”
Liu noted that support for D.C. statehood can extend across party lines, which may help its chances.
“I am very optimistic that D.C. will gain statehood because everyone is coming to realize that this is not a partisan issue,” Liu said. “It’s a civil rights issue, and it really should just be common sense.”

The Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force — a group of students, administrators, faculty and staff assembled to determine policy recommendations for the university following the release of the results of the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey in June — held its first weekly meeting of the academic year earlier this month.
The survey — released to students in January last year — found that 31 percent of female undergraduates have experienced non-consensual sexual contact, around eight percent higher than the average of more than two dozen peer institutions.
The task force’s first meeting, held on Sept. 2, involved all student and administrator members and focused primarily on setting up logistics and honing in on the goals and direction of each subcommittee. The group plans to meet once a week.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny serve as the project’s administrative co-chairs, while Georgetown University Student Association Deputy Chief of Staff Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) is the student chair.
To ensure a holistic process, the project leaders have divided the task force into five subcommittees — Policies, Resources and Reporting; Education and Bystander Intervention; Alcohol and Drugs; Vulnerable Populations; and Metrics, Evaluation and Assessment – each led by both a student and administrative chair.
According to Hinerfeld, a key focus of the task force is improving bystander education, after the climate survey found that three in four students do not feel that they have the tools to intervene in questionable situations.
“Something we want to be able to measure and see a difference in the next time we do the climate survey is we would love to see the number go way up in how many students feel confident to intervene because that’s something we have the power to change,” Hinerfeld said.
Beyond an emphasis on improving bystander intervention, the task force’s Vulnerable Populations subcommittee seeks to conduct in-depth research on vulnerable demographics, including the LGBTQ community and individuals with disabilities, and then apply its findings to sexual assault and misconduct prevention, according to Daisy Hoang (COL ’19), the subcommittee’s co-chair.
“Our main goal is to kind of dive into the reasons behind that there are high numbers of reports within these communities, especially within LGBTQ and within disability populations,” Hoang said. “We want to focus on comparing with peer institutions, national levels and then look at current ways Georgetown is trying to focus on these groups and try to see where we can help.”
Hinerfeld said the shared student and administrative leadership is valuable in giving students and faculty an equal say in the task force’s dialogue and future actions.
“It’s one of the first times I’ve seen on campus a really meaningful partnership between students and the university staff and administrators, because I think early on in my Georgetown career there weren’t as many forums where a student and an administrator shared a title,” Hinerfeld said. “But the fact that the steering committee is composed of subcommittees that are chaired by an administrator and chaired by a student — I think we’re seeing really creative and informed partnerships being put into place.”
Hinerfield said that she and the administrative co-chairs not only looked at natural partners including Sexual Assault Peer Educators, Take Back the Night, Health Education Services, GUSA and Counseling & Mental Health when selecting students for the task force, but also endeavored to find a wide range of student and faculty voices.
“It was also really important to us that we are bringing students into the conversation that haven’t been as involved before,” Hinerfeld said. “And so for that reason I think that the task force is a fantastic blend of students that are really well-versed in these topics and have been involved in activism for a long time and students that are new to the conversation, but that come with a really unique perspective that allows them to look at the data in a different way.”
GUSA Sexual Assault and Safety Chair Maddy Moore (SFS ’17) said the task force has high potential to enact change on campus.
“It’s definitely a great step forward because it’s the largest body that we’ve seen meeting around this issue and having a very clear timeline to meet those asks and demands that students have been wanting for a long time,” Moore said.

A group of around six students protested during and after a panel discussion on the politics and policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held by the Center for Jewish Civilization in Gaston Hall on Thursday evening.
During the question-and-answer section of the panel, the group of students got up and began chanting pro-Palestinian and anti-Netanyahu phrases before being escorted out of Gaston Hall by GUPD officers.
Outside of Healy Hall, the students held posters with messages such as “Netanyahu is a war criminal.”
The panel, entitled “The Netanyahu Premiership: A Retrospective,” was moderated by Georgetown CJC professor Elliott Abrams, who formerly served as White House adviser on U.S. Middle East policy. The event featured specialists of Middle East policy, including Natasha Mozgovaya, former Chief U.S. Correspondent for Israeli newspaper Haaretz, and Benny Morris, a Goldman Visiting Israeli Professor and Israeli historian.
In a statement to The Hoya, two of the student protestors, Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17) and MacKenzie Foy (COL ’19), said the panel was biased against Palestine and failed to include a diverse set of views.
“We want to bring visibility to the normalization of Netanyahu’s war crimes to campus and the oppression faced by Palestinian people at the hands of the Israeli state. We are concerned that a conversation about the Israeli state took place without talking about it as an occupation, as an apartheid,” Abdelfadeel said. “Georgetown as a Jesuit institution needs to be held accountable for its complicity in this and all state violence.”
One of the protestors held up a poster with a quote by Morris from a 2004 interview he conducted with the Haartez, in which he apparently refers to Palestinians as animals.
“Something like a cage has to be built for them. I know that sounds terrible. It is really cruel. But there is no choice,” Morris said in 2004. “There is a wild animal there that has to be locked up in one way or another.”
While the purpose of the event was to address Netanyahu’s strengths and weaknesses as prime minister of Israel, the audience drove the conversation toward Netanyahu’s actions concerning the Gaza Strip and the West Bank during the question-and-answer portion.
Alex Coopersmith (COL ’19), who attended the panel, said the panel and the questions asked showed the diversity of opinions in the Georgetown community.
“There were questions of ranging from, ‘Why are you not calling Israel a genocidal state?’ or ‘How come there were no Palestinians talking about this issue [at the event]?’ to questions that were very, very pro-Netanyahu,” Coopersmith said. “So I think it said the Georgetown community on the other hand values the role that question-and-answer plays instead of just one side.”
CJC Director Jacques Berlinerblau, CJC Associate Director Dennis McManus, CJC Center Manager Anna Dubinksy and CJC Events and Program Coordinator Michelyne Chavez did not respond to requests for comment as of 2:30 a.m. today.
Elodie Currier (SFS ’19), who attended the event, said the panelists tactfully tackled the complexity of Netanyahu’s actions.
“For the most part the panel did a really great job of keeping things civil and recognizing the nuance of things,” Currier wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Personally, I was really impressed with the panel’s ability to handle the protesters and to assuage questions that were at times just clear criticisms of Israel in general.”
According to Carol Hillman, a D.C. resident who attended the discussion, the protestors were unreasonable in their actions.
“It was a very interesting discussion about Netanyahu. Of course the Palestinian situation was brought into the conversation, but I don’t think it was a reason for a group of angry Palestinians to be in the conversation,” Hillman said. “It wasn’t about them, it was about Netanyahu and his behavior.”

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority increased reliability on trains, which entails train car availability and lack of track failures, but decreased on-time performance in its Vital Signs Quarterly Report, covering the months of April, May and June, which WAMTA released Thursday.
Train reliability improved 35 percent from the second quarter of 2015. WMATA attributed this improvement to increases in mechanic training, streamlined part scheduling and procurement. It also cited the introduction of new 7000-series railcars and the subsequent retirement of 26 1000-series railcars — the oldest model in the WMATA fleet.
WMATA board of directors member Malcolm Augustine attributed the increase in train reliability to the WMATA board of directors’ concentrated effort on the issue. According to Augustine, the board is optimistic about reliability increasing even further as more 7000-series trains are introduced.
“I think what we’re really working with in this fleet is reliability, and the team is constantly working on different initiatives to try to keep those cars in service,” Augustine said at the Sept. 8 WMATA board of directors meeting. “What we’re really looking forward to is the 7000-series, and I think when the 7000-series cars come on board we’re hoping to see that reliability and availability of the fleet increase.”
Despite increased reliability, the report called attention to a 10 percent decrease of WMATA trains arriving on time from the second quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2016. Around 74 percent of WMATA trains arrived on schedule in the second quarter of 2016.
Grady Willard (SFS ’18), who took the Metro to his internship over the summer, said he experienced long wait times for both the Red and Blue Lines due to SafeTrack work.
“When they’re doing track work anywhere on the line it impacts everything, so that’s not surprising to me to hear that statistic,” Willard said. “The train system seems to me to be old and in serious need of repair. My issue is that when I get into a station and I see a 15 minute wait before the next train, that to me is a big deal. Whether I get in at 9:00 or 9:05 doesn’t really matter, but a 15 minute wait is a big deal.”
The Vital Signs Report attributed some delays to the implementation of SafeTrack, Metro’s aggressive track maintenance plan, in June.
On-time performance was highest in April at 80 percent and lowest in May at 69 percent. The Silver and Orange Lines reported the latest arrival times, with only 56 percent and 71 percent of Silver and Orange Line trains arriving on time, respectively.
WMATA’s recent performance improvements also extend to its bus system, which saw an increase of approximately 500 miles between failures. WMATA cited the replacement of older buses during this period as a catalyst for the improvement.
However, WMATA bus systems also saw a 1.7 percent decrease in on-time performance between 2015 and 2016, which the report attributed to increased bus ridership during SafeTrack periods.
“Increased wait times were also experienced in instances were buses were re-routed to supplement additional SafeTrack demands,” the report reads.
Acting Chief of Assurance, Quality and Performance Andrea Burnside pointed to improved relations with bus manufacturers as a contributing factor to increased bus reliability.
“That’s really good news because over the last couple years we’ve been talking about some of the challenges we’ve had with bus manufacturers,” Burnside said at the WMATA board of directors meeting. “It’s an industry-wide problem and because of all of the focused work we’ve done, all of these proactive actions are starting to pay off.”
In addition to riding the metro, Willard regularly took the G2 bus to the Dupont Circle Station. He did not notice an increase in wait time for buses.
“It was good. Half of the time I was the only person on the bus. I’ve never really had a problem with Metro buses,” Willard said. “I know that sometimes they can be crowded, but the G2 was always fine.”

A week and half after the university finalized the 2017-2036 campus plan, the Georgetown University Student Association will launch an informational campaign to increase student awareness about the plan’s implications on student housing.
GUSA released a memorandum of understanding on its website signed with the university in May that prevents a four-year housing requirement and requires the university to abide by a series of other agreements around the usage of campus space. The MOU had not been previously announced.
According to GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17), GUSA will begin to publicize the achievements of the campus plan and MOU prior to Homecoming Weekend and the GUSA senate elections.
The MOU — signed by Khan and Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Christopher Augustini — requires the university to utilize the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center and other existing on-campus residential spaces to house students during renovations and establish a timeline for renovations of residential facilities based on the results of the university’s ongoing housing survey.
The document also prohibits future construction of residential space on Harbin Patio and clarifies its use for academics or student life.
The MOU followed uproar over the proposal to convert 3616 N St. NW — popularly known as Brown House — into an administrative building in April. The university withdrew the conversion plan after over 1,000 students signed a petition in protest of the move.
GUSA will also begin work on a possible second MOU with the university to limit townhouse conversions to preserve off-campus senior housing and prevent the sudden conversion of townhouses into administrative space, according to GUSA Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (COL ’18).
Goldstein said the MOU is the result of two years of GUSA’s advocacy on behalf of students.
“There was very little infrastructure within GUSA for engagement in the campus planning process,” Goldstein said. “Trevor Tezel [(SFS ’15)] was president and had a few students he called his working group on it, but there wasn’t that much. There was no formal process.”
During the March 2015 GUSA executive transition to former GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and former GUSA Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16), GUSA organized the “Let’s Not Get Screwed Again” campaign to pressure the university to include students in the master planning process.
The petition, which eventually amassed more than 3,000 signatures, specified three priorities: The university should not increase the number of students required to live on-campus, should prioritize renovations and maintenance of existing buildings before beginning new construction and should increase the number of student representatives on the Georgetown Community Partnership Steering Committee. The GCP is a forum for consensus-based decision-making among university administrators, students and members of the community who developed the framework for the 20-year plan.
Following the campaign’s success, GUSA created a student master planning consortium in April 2015 tasked with providing students and administrators a forum to discuss master-planning concerns.
“It started off with a vague mandate but the goal was to have a forum that meets regularly with all the right administrators in the room so that students can actually engage them and bring forward issues,” Goldstein said. “For the first several months, the work of the consortium was to focus on those three issues. Over the last few years, we’ve accomplished all those goals, so it proves that when we coordinate, we can be successful.”
The consortium then developed a list of objectives for GUSA leadership to use in future advocacy. The “Student Priorities for the 2018 Campus Plan” classified priorities based on housing, transportation, neighborhood and campus life and MedStar Georgetown University Hospital expansion. Those goals developed into the first draft of the MOU on housing and the campus plan which was submitted in August.
Khan said the MOU represents a huge victory for students.
“One of the big priorities in the MOU was to ensure that the fourth-year student right to live off campus remained. That was big. For the next 20 years there will not be a fourth-year requirement,” Khan said. “While the campus plan really addresses the commitment to improving housing, what we students want is to see the university work towards a renovation timeline. We got the university to agree to work with us in the master-planning consortium to establish a mutually-agreed-upon timeline.”
While the MOU was not made public prior to the completion of campus plan negotiations, Goldstein emphasized the secrecy was meant to not disrupt negotiations.
“This MOU is a great deal and it is a great part of a larger process which was generally a good deal,” Goldstein said. “Part of the reason it wasn’t public was that we weren’t sure how it would upset the campus planning process that was wrapping up outside the front gates, in the interest of making sure the campus planning process went smoothly.”
Former Advisory Neighborhood Council 2E Commissioner Kendyl Clausen (SFS ’16) said the consortium carried out the unique task of bringing students and administrators together to collaborate on the university’s master-planning vision.
“More than simply giving students a venue to voice concerns or goals, the consortium gives students and administrators a venue to talk about how to achieve those goals or alleviate those concerns about the university’s future,” Clausen wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Clausen said that the consortium showed students the inner workings of the campus plan and contributed to a final draft that benefitted students.
“In last semester’s meetings, we were able to discuss the moving pieces behind the campus plan to ensure the final picture was ideal for students. We worked through the complexities together, thereby giving students agency in the planning process,” Clausen wrote.
Goldstein said GUSA’s next steps include advocacy to protect townhouses from conversion into administrative space by the Provost’s Office.
“We learned that they have a long term goal of bringing several faculty to live in several more townhouses which presents a serious issue. We saved Brown House for a year, but we still don’t have any framework for figuring out which townhouses are going to be converted long-term,” Goldstein said. “We went ahead and invited a representative of the Provost’s Office to join the consortium permanently to erase some of the miscommunication.”
