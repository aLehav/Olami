A former George Washington University engineering student was convicted by a jury Monday for the first-degree murder of Georgetown University Law Center student Mark Waugh in October 2013.
Rahul Gupta (GRD ’13), who is 25 years old, was found guilty by a jury in Montgomery County, Md. Gupta had initially confessed to the murder, but the defense argued that he had done so only to protect his girlfriend, Taylor Gould, a GWU student, who they claimed had actually committed the murder. The jury was unconvinced by the argument.
Waugh, who was in his first year of law school at the time, and Gupta had been best of friends since high school, and Gupta was studying biomedical engineering at GWU at the time of the murder. According to the initial charging papers, Gupta walked in on Gould with Waugh on October 13, the night of the murder.
“My girl was cheating with my buddy,” Gupta said in the charging papers. “I walked in on them cheating, and I killed my buddy.”
Gupta potentially faces life in prison at his sentencing hearing on April 16.
