Former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao spoke about the importance of entrepreneurship in a free market society yesterday during her address to the Class of 2015 at the McDonough School of Business’ commencement ceremony yesterday evening.
After a short period of thunderstorms, the MSB’s ceremony was relocated from Healy Lawn to the McDonough Gymnasium.
Teaching professor of finance Lynn Doran introduced Chao, who served as Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009. Doran highlighted Chao’s career in both the private and public sectors, specifically noting her status as the first Asian-Pacific American to have been appointed to a deputy cabinet position as Deputy Secretary of Transportation under President George H.W. Bush in 1989. Doran then presented Chao to University President John J. DeGioia for the reception of an honorary degree, of which Chao has received 34.
Chao began her remarks noting her husband, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, and his attendance during the evening ceremony.
“His sole role today is that of the adoring spouse,” Chao said.
Chao stressed the role of American entrepreneurial culture in shaping business in her talk. Throughout the speech, she referred to the free market as the driver of positive social and economic change.
“[A] key advantage we enjoy as a country is a culture that encourages critical thinking, creativity and risk taking,” Chao said. “But to so many other people around the world, the American genius for taking abstract ideas and concepts and turning them into creative products or services is nothing short of miraculous.”
Having worked in the private sector for many years, including at Bank of America and Citicorp, Chao defended its role in the economy and in providing social benefits.
“Many believe that helping others is the sole purview of the nonprofit sector, but in reality, it is the ultimate goal of private, for-profit sector: creating jobs, opportunities and improving standards of livings for people and their families,” Chao said. “As future leaders in the free enterprise system, you will have a responsibility to defend and champion this sector by becoming a leader of integrity and principle, worthy of the public trust, who empowers others to transform their lives for the better.”
Chao related the experience of the free market system to her young life as an immigrant from Taiwan. She and her family moved to the United States when she was eight years old.
“We survived and thrived with the help of newly found friends and neighbors, through hard work, and the opportunity that America offers to realize your dreams,” Chao said.
She ended her address further stressing the necessity for entrepreneurship and urged the graduating class to elicit positive change.
“The journey you begin today will have its ups and down, its twists and turns, but if you cultivate a generous and grateful heart, and keep your eye on the true goal of entrepreneurship, which is creating value for others, you will never lose your way,” Chao said.
David Thomas, dean of the McDonough School of Business, then announced that 73 students—with a GPA of at least 3.5—would be graduating cum laude, 48 students—with a GPA of at least 3.7—would be graduating magna cum laude, and 12 students—with a GPA of at least 3.9—would be graduating summa cum laude.
“Very impressive. Almost 40 years ago, I graduated ‘thank the laudé,’” Thomas said.
Senior associate dean and director of the undergraduate program Norean Sharpe then named the class of 2015, starting with its valedictorian Evan Feirstein (MSB ’15) and salutatorian Diego Bacci (MSB ’15).
Thomas added concluding remarks, speaking to the Jesuit values of Georgetown and their effect on the business curriculum.
“At the McDonough School of Business, we tried to translate those values into our mission to develop principled leaders… who are rigorously educated and understand the perspectives that a business education can give you, the idea that market solutions to problems is likely to be the most sustainable solution to many of the major challenges that face our world today,” Thomas said.

Global mental health expert Vikram Patel spoke about mental health and health inequality in his address to the Class of 2015 at the commencement ceremony for the School of Nursing and Health Studies this afternoon.
University President John J. DeGioia presented Patel with a degree of Doctor of Science prior to his speech.
Patel began by highlighting his connection to Georgetown as a Jesuit institution, noting that he was trained at Jesuit schools for the first twelve years of his education.
“It just shows how connected we all are, even though it may not seem that way at first,” Patel said.
Patel then spoke about mental health issues, which he said include a range of problems including autism, intellectual disabilities, depression, drug and alcohol abuse and dementia, in developing countries.
While low and middle-income countries hold about 80 percent of the world’s population, they only posses about 10 to 15 percent of the world’s mental health resources.
Patel said that while these countries lack resources to deal with most health problems, mental health issues can be particularly damaging for individuals.
“For people with mental health problems, there is an additional challenge that they face, and of course that is the enormous stigma that is attached to mental problems, and that is unique to mental health problems,” Patel said.
According to Patel, about 90 percent of people who suffer from poor mental health do not receive proper care – a problem that he attributes to the failure of governments and donors to invest in resources to address these issues.
Patel, a professor of international mental health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Health and a psychiatrist based in Gao, India, said that his principle achievement has been empowering ordinary people to provide social and psychological interventions for mental disorders.
“I believe that we have affected a paradigm shift from thinking about places as being under resourced to being richly resourced,” Patel said. “Because the single most important resources that we need for mental health care, indeed for any kind of health care, is a human being with compassion. And I do not believe that there is any community anywhere in this world in which there aren’t people who care for other people.”
Patel said that in the challenge of figuring out how to best use these human resources, he puts ideology on par with science.
“In my view, ideology and science are inseparable bedfellows when it comes to global health or public health. To address the health issues that we talk about … in the unequal societies that we live in, we must adopt an ideology,” Patel said. “For me, the ideology that certainly is relevant for Asia and Africa, the two parts of the world that I know best, … is that health cannot be considered a private commodity.”
In order to deal with the issues of global mental health and health inequality, Patel left students with two guiding principles.
Patel encouraged students to adhere to the principle of the democratization of knowledge.
“I firmly believe that it is only when you give up that knowledge to those who don’t have it that you will actually finally achieve the goals you aspire to,” Patel said.
Secondly, Patel said that students should be mindful of both local and global needs.
“When you act, act thinking about local needs, but by guided by and always keep a mind on the world around you,” Patel said.
Patel closed by reiterating the interconnectedness of the global community.
“We are not only very interconnected as a world in terms of all the problems that vex our world, such as climate change and the massive migrations of people leaving economic and environment insecurity, but also in terms of the solutions that lie ahead of these challenges,” Patel said.
Following Patel’s speech, the graduates received their diplomas, beginning with Blake Meza (NHS ’15), the recipient of the NHS dean’s medal.
