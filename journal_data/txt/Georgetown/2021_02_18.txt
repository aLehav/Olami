Georgetown University has granted all students access to shared office spaces for the spring semester in an attempt to offer a variety of study spaces and resources as the university continues to operate on a modified virtual status during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Currently enrolled students can sign up for a free All-Access membership with WeWork, which provides shared offices and workspaces, through the university. The membership, which lasts from February through May of this year, allows students to book study spaces at any WeWork location. Students also have access to additional resources, including high-speed internet and complimentary snacks and beverages.   
With the All-Access membership, students can visit any of WeWork’s 800 locations spread across 32 U.S. cities and 88 international cities, including Shanghai, New York, Tokyo, London and Chicago.
Claire Cheng (SFS ’24), who is living in Palo Alto, Calif., this semester with her family, has taken advantage of access to WeWork to get schoolwork done in a distraction-free environment.
“I like a change of scenery and also it helps me focus. So what I’ll do is I’ll block out a day when I have no Zoom classes and I’ll just sit there for six hours and just try to bang out all my work,” Cheng said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Also I think it just keeps things interesting during quarantine. It’s somewhere to go even though I’m not seeing anyone. It’s exciting to get ready and leave the house.”
The university announced its partnership with WeWork in November 2020 as part of its spring plan. After operating fully virtually last semester, the university invited approximately 1,000 students back to campus for the spring semester, including about 500 seniors, and launched some hybrid courses available to graduate students and seniors living on campus and in the neighborhood.
The university hopes that access to WeWork’s benefits will enrich the virtual learning experience as the school continues to operate mostly virtually, according to a university spokesperson.
“We have seen a surge of students sign-up in the first few weeks and are glad that students have shown enthusiasm to access these workspaces,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Knowing these are difficult times, we hope this offer helps to ease the burden of the pandemic on our resilient Georgetown community.” 
Students using WeWork spaces are required to abide by the university’s COVID-19 restrictions, including mandatory mask wearing, social distancing and following local COVID-19 guidelines, in addition to any location-specific WeWork regulations, according to the WeWork website.
Without access to Lauinger Library this year, many students are taking advantage of WeWork to mimic the experience of going to a study space on campus, according to Zoe Corrigan (MSB ’23), who is currently living off-campus in Washington, D.C. 
“When I saw the opportunity to have a library space that I didn’t have access to otherwise, I was like, this is something that I need mentally,” Corrigan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It gets me out of my apartment building because I would realize that I hadn’t left my building all week because I’d been staying in my room and being productive.”
There are 13 WeWork locations in the D.C. region spread between Dupont Circle, downtown and NoMa, with two in Arlington, Va., and one in College Park, Md. 
WeWork has been a way to set a boundary between home life and school life and get outside, according to Corrigan.
“I was doing everything in the same space and it was hard to compartmentalize,” Corrigan said. “Even though it’s been quite cold in D.C. right now, it’s been cold and icy, just getting out and just walking and exploring different parts of the city, too. One of my goals is to check out each location, even if it takes a longer walk or an Uber ride to get to one closer to a friend.”

Georgetown University Student Association vice presidential hopefuls discussed plans to restructure GUSA at the vice presidential debate Wednesday night.
Candidates Leo Arnett (SFS ’22) and Nicole Sanchez (SFS ’22) answered questions about their plans to restructure GUSA, their past work as GUSA members and how they plan to advocate for marginalized groups on campus. The GUSA Election Commission moderated the debate and posed questions to the candidates. Some audience members were also allowed to ask questions. 
Arnett, who is running alongside presidential candidate Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22), is currently the director of campus affairs within the GUSA Executive and was formerly a GUSA Senator. Nicole Sanchez, who is running alongside presidential candidate Nile Blass (COL ’22), serves as a GUSA Senator for the at-large class, a member of the student activism team and the senior policy advisor for the GUSA Executive. 
A key component of the Sanchez-Arnett platform is using input from the student body to restructure GUSA to incorporate greater inclusivity, according to Arnett. 
“The way that we want students to engage with GUSA is to literally rebuild GUSA,” Arnett said during the debate. “What Daniella and I want to do, and what we’re campaigning on, is an entire restructure process to make sure that the student association actually represents the students.”
Daniella Sanchez and Arnett’s four-step restructuring process includes disbanding the GUSA Senate, which Arnett says is the main source of exclusivity and elitism in GUSA. Sanchez and Arnett plan to establish a new student representative organization, giving students a voice in the structure of the new organization.
Restructuring GUSA should involve eliminating hierarchies, titles and parliamentary procedure in the senate, according to Nicole Sanchez, who is one of the leaders on the current restructuring project in the GUSA Senate.
“I think restructuring and rebranding and reintroducing to students what advocacy is, you have to create a space for people to feel safe enough to engage with you,” Nicole Sanchez said during the debate. “You have to create a space where students who aren’t leaders and who aren’t activists and who are freshmen who want to engage and make change can feel comfortable enough.”
The GUSA Senate currently operates under Robert’s Rules of Order, a formal set of guidelines similar to parliamentary procedure, to run its meetings and vote on legislation. GUSA senators are divided by class year and work on different committees, which each have a number of different positions, including a committee chair.
The senate is currently reconsidering the role of these formalities in its current, ongoing restructuring process. While GUSA leadership has not yet revealed many of the restructuring process’s details, the senate is looking to eliminate Robert’s Rules and other specific titles and positions that senators feel create too much of a hierarchy.
The Sanchez-Arnett plan is distinct from the Blass-Sanchez plan because it will prioritize input from students outside of GUSA, according to Arnett.
“We believe that student voices should be the priority, not the secondary, when it comes to forming a new GUSA,” Arnett said. “So instead of forming the restructure plan within a committee within a committee in the senate in GUSA, we would like to dedicate the first step to student input solely, and then work throughout the whole year to process that information.” 
The Blass-Sanchez platform plans to engage student leaders within GUSA who are strong representatives of the student body, as well as garner additional feedback, according to Nicole Sanchez.
“These are students who are known on campus for being activists and organizers who are speaking out against GUSA,” Sanchez said, “And beyond that, there is student input. There are student representatives that are involved in this. There’s people from the executive that are involved in this, and these meetings are open to everyone.” 
Another pillar of the Sanchez-Arnett platform that is crucial to successfully restructuring GUSA is the platform’s proposed Student Bill of Rights, a document that would outline student autonomy and prevent any university overstep, according to Arnett.
“I think that the two fundamental policy platform ideas that Daniella and I have laid out and that I’ve talked about extensively right now truly empowers the student body to not only one reform, a student association and a student government, which actively and accurately represents the needs and the intentions of the student body, but also empowers the student body to fight back against the administration,” Arnett said. 
In addition to their plans to restructure GUSA, Nicole Sanchez and Arnett were also asked about their plans to include and advocate for BIPOC communities in the Georgetown community. Blass and Nicole Sanchez plan on using their experiences as students of color to inform their initiatives and work with on-campus student affinity groups, according to Nicole Sanchez.
“I think the major things that need to happen is supporting the efforts to create an AAPI house to create a safe space for the Asian students on campus, to then supporting the Asian American studies program, to making sure that students are held accountable for racist rhetoric in classes and making sure that we have diversity of thought in our professors and diversity of thought in readings that we’re having,” Sanchez said.
The Sanchez-Arnett administration will use the results from the university’s first cultural climate survey, which was launched last year, to better understand the experiences of Georgetown’s BIPOC communities and their needs, according to Arnett.  
“Our policies that we want to enact that address racism on campus have to use and acknowledge the personal experiences that students on campus do go through in order to better inform how we want to go about it, and to convince the administration that it’s something that is prevalent on campus, whether they know it or not,” Arnett said. 
Blass and Nicole Sanchez have the experience advocating for underrepresented and marginalized communities at Georgetown that is necessary for success as president and vice president, according to Nicole Sanchez. The pair recently worked with the university to successfully repeal mandatory meal plan requirements, according to Nicole Sanchez. 
“We sat in an hour and a half meeting and we pushed and we pushed and administration finally did it,” Sanchez said. “I think the reason why my team, and the people that I worked with, and that me and Nile have been so successful in our advocacy efforts with admin is that we don’t take no for an answer, is that we come in fully prepared. We come in stacked with information, stats, testimonies, and we know that there’s so much more on the line that I know is not acceptable to these students.”
Students living on campus this semester were initially required to purchase the university’s biggest and most expensive meal plan, causing students to raise concerns about safety and financial issues. 
Although GUSA has seen positive change in recent years, there are still significant changes that the Sanchez-Arnett campaign hopes to oversee, according to Arnett.
“I was in the senate my first year and sophomore year at Georgetown, and to see the change that’s happened in the senate, really, is something that’s remarkable,” Arnett said. “We’re not saying that we don’t want a representative body in GUSA; it’s saying that in order to change that, we need to start from the ground up.”

In the new year, neighborhood leaders are renewing calls to renovate the Jelleff Community Center after persistent complaints from residents over accessibility and dilapidated conditions. 
Originally constructed as a young recreation center in 1953, Jelleff has not undergone significant renovation since its opening. Recently, the center has faced increased criticism surrounding the quality of its facilities along with its lack of accessibility and wheelchair access. Now, as part of the D.C. Council’s fiscal budget for 2021, Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E is advocating for significantly more than already allocated $7 million be put towards renovations to the Jelleff Community Center. 
The center has become increasingly dilapidated and inaccessible over time, according to Elizabeth Miller, ANC commissioner for the Single Member District 2E07, where Jelleff is located. 
“Jelleff is used by children and families from all 8 wards and hasn’t had a renovation since it was built. It’s not ADA accessible and the HVAC systems are failing,” Miller wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s long past time to modernize it and make it a 21st century community center.”
The funding proposal to initiate these efforts was endorsed by Councilmember Brooke Pinto as her top budget request for Mayor Muriel Bowser in 2021. ANC 2E conducted a feasibility study with over 700 respondents in order to inform the budget request and plan for action.
This renovation has great potential benefits for the community, according to Miller.
“I’m hopeful that the children in the aftercare program at Jelleff will be the biggest winners of the Jelleff renovation.” Miller wrote. “I dream of them studying and recreating in a modern and beautiful building. They have spent far too many years in a dark, dank basement.”
Jelleff’s indoor facilities include a classroom, a computer lab, a music room, a gymnasium and a game room. The center also has a turf field and outdoor pool.
Many of these facilities could become increasingly valuable in the future, according to ANC Commissioner Kishan Putta.
“Give our community a public space they can use and will be of value to our neighborhood,” Putta said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “There is nothing nearby for an indoor space. With climate change, winters are only going to get worse and that is a large portion of the year where children, neighbors, are stuck in bad weather, wondering what to do, where to gather.”
Jelleff’s central location between Wisconsin Avenue and Rock Creek Park also adds to the center’s potential, according to Putta. 
“So I think being connected to Wisconsin a little bit better, there is interest in that, so then you could benefit the local business along Wisconsin as well,” Putta said. “Rock Creek Park is on the other side and there are connections to the hiking trails of Rock Creek Park. You know, if you have youth programs at Jelleff, they should be able to explore nature.”
The current timeline for the center’s feasibility study indicates the process of drafting and compiling the study will continue throughout February before launching a final community engagement study and delivering the final feasibility study in March. 
Given the timing of the project, the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic are an important consideration, according to Miller.
“COVID-19 impacts any impending construction project. Our lives will be lived very differently for years to come and I’m sure when the design process begins there will be thoughtful consideration of the new ways people work, play and recreate,” Miller wrote.
However, predictions made in 2020 overestimated the magnitude of losses the D.C. Council’s budget would face because of COVID-19, according to Putta. As a result, the D.C. Council will not only be tackling a smaller debt than expected in the upcoming fiscal year but also may see a window of opportunity increase the funds going towards the Jelleff renovations.
“We were worried about the timing, but actually this might not be bad — but might be good. There is a lot of support for it,” Putta said. “If we don’t do it in this project, we might not get the opportunity to do so for several decades.”
This article has been updated to clarify the amount of money the ANC is advocating to be allotted for the Jelleff Community Center renovations.

Joe Biden made his first visit to the Georgetown University campus as president Feb. 17. While past presidents have come to the Hilltop to receive honorary degrees or unveil new policy proposals, Biden’s unannounced stop was for a different — and more personal — reason: Lent. 
Biden, a lifelong Catholic, received his ashes for Ash Wednesday from Rev. Brian McDermott, S.J., at Wolfington Hall on the Southwest Quadrangle. Biden spent about 20 minutes on campus before returning to the Oval Office. Reporters remained in vans for the duration of the visit and did not see the president receive his ashes. 
McDermott declined The Hoya’s request for comment. 
In addition to stocking his administration with Georgetown graduates and professors, much of Biden’s religious life since taking office has involved Georgetown priests and institutions. Rev. Leo J. O’Donovan, S.J. (CAS ’56), a former Georgetown president, gave the invocation at Biden’s inauguration, and Rev. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (CAS ’88), a former Georgetown vice president for mission and ministry, celebrated the Mass Biden attended earlier that day.
On two of his first Sundays in office, Biden has attended Mass at Holy Trinity Catholic Church, which has historically served the campus community since being established in 1787 at the direction of the university’s founder, John Carroll. The church was the spiritual home of United States’ only other Catholic president, John F. Kennedy. 
Biden’s faith is a significant influence in multiple areas of his life, according to Rev. Kevin Gillespie, S.J., the pastor at Holy Trinity.
“He witnesses a wonderful and resilient faith,” Gillespie said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “And he relies on his faith to give him hope, to give him courage.”
Biden has frequently invoked the Bible, both in campaign trail speeches and in his inaugural address, according to Gillespie. 
“I looked at his inaugural speech as almost a homily,” Gillespie said. 
During his visits to Holy Trinity, Biden sits discreetly in the back, according to Gillespie. 
“He wants to be a man of faith, but not stand out conspicuously in the pews,” Gillespie said. “He wants to be there because it helps him support his own faith journey and prayer life. He doesn’t want to inconvenience people when he doesn’t need to.” 
Biden still stands out, however. He received applause when he arrived at the church one recent Sunday. Later in the day, his motorcade made a much-noticed pit stop at Call Your Mother, the popular local deli formerly co-owned by White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients.
Biden also visited Holy Trinity throughout his tenure as vice president, including to attend the first Holy Communions and confirmations of his grandchildren, the daughters of his son Hunter Biden (COL ’92). The church offers a sense of comfort and familiarity for Biden, according to Gillespie.
“In a certain way, he feels Holy Trinity is his home — his home away from home.” Gillespie said. “Wilmington and his parish there is really his first home.” 
When Biden comes now, the church receives a heads-up from the Secret Service about 90 minutes before services, according to Gillespie. For this Ash Wednesday, however, Gillespie said he emailed the Secret Service to urge Biden not to visit for morning services on Ash Wednesday since parents would be dropping off their kids at the church’s school at the same time. 
For all other occasions, Gillespie said he extended an open invitation for the commander in chief to continue stopping by. 
“I said, ‘Mr. President, you’re always welcome here at Holy Trinity,’ and he said, ‘Thank you very much, that means a lot.’”

Biden is not a faithful Catholic but then GU is hardly faithful to Catholicism anymore either.

Georgetown University’s baseball team players have organized student-run practices after the university did not clear them because of COVID-19 precautions. 
Georgetown is the only school in the Big East that has not cleared its baseball team to compete this season. The university has not yet decided whether the baseball team will be permitted to compete in the spring 2021 season, which is scheduled to start Feb. 19, according to a university spokesperson.
Although the team cannot hold official practices on campus, the baseball team has continued training on their own by ensuring adherence to strict social distancing guidelines, according to infielder Nolan Matsko (MSB ’22).
“Each player was given the opportunity to opt-out of these player-led workouts, but an overwhelming majority wanted to secure off-campus housing so we can safely practice together as a team,” Matsko wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Each practice has a specific plan that is strategically designed to allow players to maintain social distancing protocols.”
In order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the team is requiring that players participating in practices cannot dine indoors or carpool with people who are unmasked or live outside their households. Players are also prohibited from interacting with individuals who do not adhere to similar standards of social distancing, according to Matsko.
“Disregard for these protocols will result in a player not being able to participate in these practices,” Matsko wrote. “We want to create an environment that is safe for the whole Georgetown community.”
Team members have found the inability to hold official practices frustrating, especially given other schools’ successes in playing safely, according to Matsko.
“It’s difficult seeing every other team in the Big East conference and our neighbors, George Washington, able to practice, but we are extremely hopeful that we will soon get an opportunity to play together soon,” Matsko wrote.
George Washington University, a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference, which regionalized and shortened the baseball season’s schedule, is continuing with spring play.
Georgetown invited all other Big East teams, including both men’s and women’s basketball, soccer, lacrosse and track and field, to live, practice and compete on campus this spring. 
Many Georgetown baseball players are confused as to why their team was not included with those that were invited back this semester, according to outfielder AJ Lotsis (GRD ’22).
“The most difficult thing to grasp about the decision is not why we weren’t able to return instead of lacrosse and soccer, but why we could not return to playing along with those other sports,” Lotsis wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Final decisions about spring sports will be made only after more information about the pandemic is available, according to a university spokesperson.
“Until a number of important variables become more defined, Georgetown cannot state its final plan for the spring sports that are now on hold. The options will vary by sport and could range from no return to practice and workouts to return to full competition,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our decisions around athletics are, and will continue to be, driven by public health conditions and our responsibility to keep our community safe.”
Two hundred seventy-nine Georgetown community members have tested positive for COVID-19 since Jan. 3, and 33 tested positive the week of Feb. 7-13, a decrease from the previous two weeks. Cases in the greater Washington, D.C. region have declined in recent weeks from a peak the week of Jan. 12.
Edwin Thompson, who was appointed head coach of the baseball program this past September, supports the university’s decisions and handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It’s affected everybody. No matter how you want to look at it, our leadership and our university are making all the necessary decisions to make sure that we are safe,” Thompson said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Obviously, they have everything planned out. They want all the students back. They want everyone back. We all do.”
Despite facing COVID-19 restrictions, the baseball team plans to keep up their hard work, according to Thompson.
“We want to get back out and compete in everything that we do,” Thompson said. “We’re never going to let our circumstances dictate our goals. Our goals are always going to stay consistent. We want to make sure that our team is unbelievably competitive, every game.”
Players remain optimistic about the future of the team and the possibility of spring play and are working to prepare for the season, according to Lotsis.
“I believe that the sacrifices that each player has committed to practice on our own will hopefully show the University how committed we are to having a season,” Lotsis wrote. “We are willing to do whatever it takes to have a season.”

Let these young men play. Why is baseball being treated differently than basketball?

Baseball Fan says 
March 3, 2021 at 9:55 pm
The lack of a decision for the 2021 baseball season is absurd. Why is a less-contact sport being punished while all other sports, and mostly close contact sports, get to have a season?  Why can’t they give these baseball players a reason for their lack of decision making or why baseball is being singled out as the only team sport that cannot play. Give them a reason, give them a decision, give them a season. #LetThemPlay

Microsoft founder Bill Gates discussed the challenging problem of combating climate change in a Zoom webinar event promoting his new book that outlines his plan to avoid a climate catastrophe. 
In the Feb. 17 event entitled “A Conversation with Bill Gates: How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” Gates promoted his new book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.” The event was hosted by the Georgetown Environment Initiative and the Georgetown Climate Center and was available to community members at Georgetown University, The George Washington University, American University and Howard University. 
Joined in conversation by moderator Michelle Miller, a national correspondent and “CBS This Morning: Saturday” co-host, Gates elaborated on his book, which outlines a plan to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. In an hour-long discussion followed by a Q & A session with students, Gates said the climate problem could only be solved by a collective global commitment.
The younger generation can likely foster this commitment, according to Gates, who feels encouraged how quickly younger generations have become cognizant of the immediate dangers climate change imposes. 
“The young generation’s belief that they want to stand for more than their own individual success and climate policies are part of what they want to get behind,” Gates said during the event. “Ideally, no matter which party they associate themselves with, ideally the goal is not destroying these ecosystems and destroying human livelihood; hopefully that is something we can all share”
After becoming cognizant of the dangers of climate change, Gates said he has been actively involved in climate activism and hopes to use his profile to further raise attention to the global cause.
Gates began speaking publicly about the need to achieve a zero carbon emission future when he gave a TED Talk in 2010. Since then, Gates has actively funded projects toward achieving this goal. He named the climate crisis as one of the two prominent issues he will prioritize moving forward, according his 2020 annual letter.
Although combating climate change is at the forefront of more social and political agendas than ever before, more can be done to increase the efficiency of these efforts, Gates said at the event. 
“It’s only recently that I’ve seen the commitment of the younger generation to this cause and to this goal of getting to zero, but the lack of a plan — a plan that really admits that it’s going to be very difficult, that looks at all the source of emissions and taps into human ingenuity, taps into the private sector and government policy in order to take every one of these 30 years and drive that progress,” Gates said.
Although climate change is a global issue, the responsibilities and effects of climate change are not distributed equally across countries. Not only are the poor and those from developing countries experiencing the worst impacts of climate change because of their geographic location and restricted ability to respond to extreme weather, the countries most responsible for climate change are generally developed countries that benefited from unrestricted carbon emissions from the Industrial Revolution and beyond.
Future climate change efforts need to include the perspectives of developing countries, according to Gates, because a global effort is necessary to combat climate change.
“It’s so ironic because the developing countries did the least to create this problem. It wasn’t their emissions; it was our emissions, and yet when we go to them, we say you ought to take the constraint and we’re not willing to subsidize that,” Gates said. “Being intentional about the equity element of these efforts — we’ve got to design that in from the very start.”
To ensure international cooperation, policy needs to focus on the biggest issue hindering current climate change efforts: reducing financial burdens, according to Gates. 
“The gold standard offsets are quite expensive. Not everyone can afford to pay the $7 million a year I’m paying to get rid of that carbon footprint,” Gates said. “At the end of the day, affordability is the metric that we’ve got to win on. And sadly in some of these areas, we haven’t really put the energy into innovating as much as the others. We’ve almost put most of our effort into the easy stuff and kind of ignored the hard stuff.”
Despite the many challenges required in coming together to combat climate change, Gates said he hopes his book will encourage individuals to recognize the zero carbon goal is feasible. 
“The book raises people’s awareness about the breadth. I think that will help them not think that this is going to be easy to do,” Gates said. “My goal is also that people know that it’s doable. It’s not impossible but it requires a lot of innovation to bring these costs, these green premiums, down over 95%.”
This article has been updated to clarify details of Gates’ funding of environmental projects.

It’s great that Bill Gates has discussed climate change solutions. He has said many beautiful things.

When Brian Floyd, assistant dean of Georgetown University’s School of Nursing and Health Studies, read a book on the history of the NHS, he noticed something was missing: Georgetown’s first African American nurses.
The book, “Learning, Faith and Caring: History of the Georgetown School of Nursing, 1903-2000,” written by former dean of the NHS Alma Woolley and published in 2001, is a chronicle of the School of Nursing’s history, from its inception in 1903 until the the early 21st century, when it became the NHS. The chronicle made little mention of graduates of color throughout the school’s history, according to Floyd. 
Inspired to correct the record, Floyd launched an oral history project in 2017 to preserve the stories of the first African American women who graduated from the NHS. The project, which is expected to be completed by April, is meant to serve as an educational resource for students through taped audio and visual interviews and papers in academic journals. Pieces of the project will eventually be featured in events at the university, according to Floyd. 
One of the goals of the project is to use the power of oral history, research conducted through recorded interviews between a narrator and a first-person source, to correct the historical gap in the university’s past, according to Floyd. 
“Capturing this oral history embraces our schools commitment to education as a means to uncovering truth, discovering meaning, embracing diversity, and promoting social justice and intellectual awareness,” Floyd wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This information — in addition to being an educational tool for current and future nursing students — will also substantively enhance, from an academic standpoint, the historical record about the first African-American women who were nursing graduates of Georgetown.” 
Soon after beginning the project, Floyd asked Edilma Yearwood, chair of the department of Professional Nursing Practice, an academic department in the NHS, to join the initiative. 
In 2017, Floyd and Yearwood wrote a grant proposal to Fr. Mark Bosco, S.J., vice president for Mission & Ministry, and were awarded funding through a Jesuit Mission Grant in 2018, according to Yearwood. 
“This is supported by our Jesuit community, mission and ministry,” Yearwood said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “They’re the ones who wanted us to do the work of the research, the oral history, and they wanted us to get the information out.”
Once awarded the grant, Floyd and Yearwood tracked down the first African American graduates to arrange interviews. These graduates included Margaret Jordan (NUR ’64), Brenda Lockley (NUR ’65), Bernardine Lacey (NUR ’69) and Priscilla Rogers (NUR ’69). 
Jordan was the first African American student to graduate from the NHS. Today, the NHS awards a scholarship in Jordan’s name with a preference for African American students living in the Washington, D.C. area with demonstrated financial need. 
The interviews, conducted in 2018 and 2019, will eventually be stored in Lauinger Library.
During the interviews, Yearwood said she had difficulty reconciling how the stories of these four graduates had been left out of the school’s history for so long. 
“The hardest part of this was knowing that they are part of the history of Georgetown, but their voices weren’t recorded anywhere in the history that was written about Georgetown Nursing. Their voices were missing,” Yearwood said. “As a woman of color, it just reminds me how little people thought our voices were worth.” 
In addition to the recorded interviews, Yearwood and Floyd are supplementing the project with newspaper articles about D.C. and the campus from when the four women graduated, according to Floyd. 
All four women were trailblazers in their field and represent how their time at Georgetown led to careers in nursing, Floyd said in a phone interview with The Hoya.  
“There are common themes that we discovered that were definitely important to their development that kept them persevering along the way,” Floyd said. “It was definitely about their perseverance, the resilience factors that they used to navigate that space in a time period where there was still segregation occurring.”
Conducting interviews with the four nursing graduates emphasized the importance of community, Yearwood said. She hopes to use their stories to write a paper with recommendations for Georgetown students, especially students from minority communities, as they navigate their time at the university. 
“All of these women were able to identify a community where they got their support and helped them be successful at Georgetown,” Yearwood said. “I think the other thing that they talked about was really just being true to yourself and knowing yourself. When you come to college and you’re going through life, it’s about knowing who you are and what you want, because it helps to keep you leaning forward and keeps you with your eye on your goal.”
Yearwood and Floyd planned to bring the four graduates to campus to host a panel for students, but plans were derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the panel will be rescheduled, Yearwood and Floyd hope to make their interviews available to students in order to share their work this coming spring, according to Yearwood.
While Yearwood and Floyd’s project is thorough, they say it only scratches the surface of stories to be shared from Georgetown’s history.
“I think my biggest takeaway was that there are so many wonderful stories out there for people who were part of the Georgetown fabric,” Yearwood said, “And we don’t even know half the stories that we should know.”

The Georgetown University Law Center received two historic graduate gifts that total $34 million, including the largest single donation the Law Center has ever received. 
A record-breaking $24 million gift came from the estate of Agnes Williams (LAW ’54), who graduated in the first Georgetown Law class that included women. The donation supports the Agnes Williams Sesquicentennial Professorships, named in honor of their donor and the 150th anniversary of the Law Center. A $10 million gift from Timothy O’Neill (LAW ’77) and Linda O’Neill (NHS ’77) will establish the Center for Transformational Health Law at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, aiming to address the evolving policy conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The O’Neills are the largest non-estate donors in the history of the Law Center. 
All the donors have existing philanthropic ties to Georgetown Law. Williams was the lead donor in funding a new law library in 1989, named in memory of her husband Edward Bennet Williams (LAW ’44, H ’68). Prior to the establishment of the Williams Sesquicentennial Professorships. She also contributed to the endowment of a number of tenured professorships in 2016 to support research of recently appointed faculty. 
The Law Center distributed Williams’ endowment with her passions in consideration, according to Wiliam Treanor, dean and executive vice president of the Law Center. 
“Her core commitment was faculty. She said that faculty are really the key to the law school’s vitality,” Treanor said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Given her commitment to faculty, we thought that creating endowed professorships that bore the Williams name would really be the most powerful way to honor her legacy.”
Williams made history while at the Law Center, graduating at the top of the first class that included women at a time when the school did not even have a women’s restroom, according to Treanor. While studying, she won the first-year law student moot court competition and became the first woman to staff the Georgetown Law Journal.
The first two professors to receive Williams Sesquicentennial Professorships are Julie Rose O’Sullivan, who teaches courses on white-collar crime, and Hillary Sale, who teaches courses on corporate law and governance. 
“The fact that through the arc of her career that now the first two Williams professors are women who are on the faculty meant a tremendous amount to the Williams family,” Treanor said. 
With the gift from the O’Neill family, Georgetown Law’s Center for Transformational Health Law plans to take action on COVID-19 response, according to Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute, a program established in 2007 to address national and international health concerns in the context of the law. 
At its outset, the Center for Transformational Health Law will aim to help facilitate the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines by working with the Biden administration, the World Health Organization and the World Bank, among other organizations, Gostin wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The O’Neills’ gift will benefit communities far outside of the Law Center, according to Gostin. 
“The O’Neill family’s gift will be transformational for the Institute. But their gift will, more importantly, have a major impact in the United States and the world,” Gostin wrote. “I am very proud of the mission of the O’Neill Institute, which is to use world-class scholarship to make a difference in the world. Our aim is not just academic, but to advance the right to health in America and globally.”
In a post-COVID-19 world, the center will focus its work on establishing better structures to combat future pandemics and to tackle other global health hazards like cancer, diabetes and heart disease, according to Gostin. 
The launch of the Center for Transformational Health Law is an opportunity for new collaborations across university programs, according to Gostin. 
“We hope to seed many innovative ideas throughout the Georgetown University community, partnering with the Global Health Initiative,” Gostin wrote. “We also will use part of the gift as an endowment to enable us to support national and global health for generations to come.”

The Georgetown University community is pushing for the Biden administration to take action for the release of American hostages more than eight years after Austin Tice (SFS ’02) went missing while working as a freelance journalist in Syria.
Tice was kidnapped in Syria in 2012 while covering the civil war between the Syrian government and rebel forces during the summer after his second year as a student at the Georgetown University Law Center. Five weeks after he went missing at a checkpoint in Damascus, a video titled “Austin Tice is Alive” was posted on Youtube by an unknown user showing Tice surrounded by unidentified armed men. Tice is currently believed to be a captive of Syrian government affiliates.
The Biden administration will actively work for the return of American hostages, according to Joel Hellman, dean of the School of Foreign Service.
“Successive administrations of both parties have rightly made his return a high priority, and I am confident that this new administration will do likewise as a cornerstone of its commitment to the defense of human rights,” Hellman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Since the Biden administration has taken office, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has already spoken with the families of Americans who are wrongfully detained or held as hostages abroad. The Biden administration will continue to negotiate on behalf of all U.S. citizens who are being held as hostages, according to a U.S. Department of State spokesperson.
“Bringing home American citizens held hostage or wrongfully detained is a top priority for the Biden-Harris administration,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Biden administration has promised to work tirelessly to reunite families of hostages and detainees, according to CNN. 
By risking his life as a journalist in foreign affairs to cover the events of the Syrian civil war, Tice embodies Georgetown’s values, according to Hellman.
“If anyone has shown his commitment to the values of SFS and Georgetown, it’s Austin Tice,” Hellman wrote. “At great personal risk, he felt compelled to show the world the horrors that the Syrian conflict inflicted on its own people. And in the process, he sacrificed his own freedom.
The first 100 days of Biden’s term will be the most important for determining how the administration will facilitate negotiations for Tice’s return, according to Christopher Voss, an adjunct professor in the McDonough School of Business and a former FBI hostage negotiator.
“The leadership is going to be massively different. The Trump administration was desperate to get a win just before the election, and they were willing to make the worst deals,” Voss said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
In August 2020, two senior Trump White House officials traveled to Damascus to discuss Tice’s case with the head of the Syrian intelligence agency. After this visit, Tice’s mother, Debra Tice, pleaded for her son’s release by Thanksgiving in an October 2020 statement. In her statement, Debra Tice argued that former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had prevented Tice’s release by refusing to engage in direct diplomatic negotiations with the Syrian government while praising former President Donald Trump as an advocate and an ally, according to The Washington Post. 
The Biden administration has the necessary political experience to successfully set the terms and engage in diplomatic hostage negotiations and international relations with countries in the Middle East, according to Voss.
“It’s a breath of fresh air to have a change in government administration that’s experienced. One of the things I think that everyone in the Middle East is hopeful for is that even though it’s a Democratic administration, Biden has been around for so long and has served a term as vice president,” Voss said. 
The Obama administration also fell short in hostage negotiations, according to Voss.
“The Obama administration, on their hostage dealings overall, were very poor, and how much they capitulated, and how much they put on the table, they cut some embarrassingly bad deals. Biden is not likely to do that. This is a real opportunity for some stability in the region.” Voss said. 
During former President Barack Obama’s administration, then-President Obama signed a 2015 executive order that made it clear the safe and rapid recovery of American hostages would be a top priority. The Obama administration also formed a cross-governmental team dedicated to hostage recovery and committed to prioritizing families in decision-making processes.
In addition to politicians’ work, the Georgetown community and members of the press have also continued to advocate for Tice’s safe return, according to Doyle McManus, director of Georgetown’s journalism department.
“There has been a heartening amount of advocacy from Georgetown and from the journalism community, and it hasn’t really let up over the past eight years,” McManus wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Several advocacy campaigns have pressed for Tice’s return including the 2019 “Ask About Austin Tice” campaign from the National Press Club Journalism Institute, which aimed to raise awareness about Tice among members of Congress. A social media movement #FreeAustinTice gained traction on Georgetown’s campus in 2015.   
The Georgetown community must continue to work for Tice’s recovery, according to Hellman.
“All of us at Georgetown must continue to advocate with passion and conviction for the release of Austin Tice as he has done for those who suffered from hatred and violence,” Hellman wrote.

The first students to complete Georgetown University’s graduate certificate in gender, peace and security graduated in December 2020. 
The GPS certificate, which is issued by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, is a 15-credit program that focuses on gender-sensitive peace and security issues. The certificate launched in 2020 and currently supports an inaugural cohort of about 25 graduate students. Ndeye Radia Mbengue (GRD ’20) and Emma Dorshimer (GRD ’20), who both earned master’s degrees in conflict resolution, were the first two students to earn the GPS certificate. 
The certificate program is an opportunity for Georgetown students to specialize in gender dynamics while studying the role of conflict and peace building across the globe, according to Dorshimer. 
“It’s a gratifying feeling to graduate with a certificate in Gender, Peace and Security, especially in the middle of a pandemic that is affecting women and gender minorities very hard economically and personally,” Dorshimer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Being a member of the inaugural group feels really special, mostly because I know this is only the beginning for not only the certificate program, but also for this kind of work in general and the directions that recipients can take this knowledge and apply it.” 
Other programs and courses offer insight into the role of gender in security and policymaking, but the GPS certificate offers a substantive curriculum centering the role of gender in international issues, according to Mbengue. 
“Generally, the classes offered at Georgetown in different master’s programs, although they are very focused on development, international work and security issues, most of them miss how gender should be mainstreamed and integrated into all of the efforts,” Mbengue said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Most of the time, it is integrated as an added factor, but it should also be seen as the core of all these theories or development projects.”
Since the certificate was launched in March 2020, student awareness and interest in the certificate has only grown, according to GIWPS Executive Director Ambassador Melanne Verveer (SLL ’66, GRD ’69).
“It complements but doesn’t duplicate existing concentrations and certificates,” Verveer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It provides a special opportunity to students who seek to augment their understanding of the dynamic between gender and international peace and security.”
The GPS certificate curriculum highlights how gender issues are present in all aspects of foreign policy, such as military training and development assistance, especially in post-conflict countries, according to Verveer.
“This underscores how relevant issues of women, peace and security are to conflict-affected countries, as well as to foreign policy in these areas,” she wrote. “It’s also important for gender responsive policies and programs to address climate change, to counter violent extremism and to advance programs in fragile states.”
Issues of gender have long been ignored in the development of foreign policy, according to Jennifer Grosman Fernández (GRD ’21), a member of the certificate’s inaugural cohort. 
“Every Georgetown graduate student should understand how gender impacts foreign policy and the GPS program is a fantastic resource to expand the traditional foreign policy lenses studied in the classroom,” Fernández wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The GPS certificate program underscores the importance of curriculum that highlights intersectionality, according to George Shambaugh, director of the Master of Science in Foreign Service program, one of the degrees that offers students the ability to earn the GPS certificate.
“It certifies that those issues matter because the students that come out with that degree — with that certificate rather — have an identifier that says not only did they study these things, but that the university, that academia, that society should take these things seriously,” Shambaugh said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “I think that’s good across the board.”

Georgetown University will allow all graduate courses to resume hybrid status as of Feb. 15, following two weeks of virtual operations due to a spike in COVID-19 cases in the Georgetown community.
Last semester, all university courses operated fully online for at least the first four weeks of the semester. In October 2020, the university piloted a variety of hybrid programs, including 14 graduate courses, to explore in-person learning, according to an email sent to Georgetown students from the Office of the President. In November, the university announced it would offer approximately 200 hybrid courses for senior undergraduates and graduate students this spring semester.
Some graduate students and community members oppose the university’s decision to offer hybrid courses this semester, according to Ellen Jacobs (GRD ’24), a biology student and chair of the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees.
“I felt the spring plans were extremely ill-advised,” Jacobs wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The pandemic is worse than ever and vaccine rollout is so slow that very few of us will be vaccinated by the end of the semester, so I think that it was irresponsible to expand hybrid classes and encourage students to come back to DC.”
Returning to hybrid classes, however, is especially important for graduate students taking courses with hands-on components, such as lab sciences, according to Henry Watson (GRD ’23), president of the Graduate Student Government.
“We are glad that Georgetown’s graduate students will continue to have the opportunity to engage in hybrid instruction,” Watson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, it should be emphasized that the resumption of hybrid classes will only affect a small minority of students. Most graduate students are still 100% online.”
According to a university spokesperson, all decisions regarding the university’s operating status and hybrid course offerings have been guided by the university’s commitment to protecting the community.
“When making the decision to resume hybrid classes, University officials reviewed public health metrics within the University community as a whole and among specific University populations,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These metrics include positivity rate and transmission/contact tracing data. In this instance, the majority of positive cases were concentrated among undergraduates living in the neighborhoods. Metrics will continue to be monitored and assessed on an ongoing basis.”
Although all graduate hybrid courses are now allowed to resume in person, it is up to the professor’s discretion whether to meet, and students have the option to continue participating in their classes virtually, according to the spokesperson. 
While students are grateful to return to in-person learning this semester, it is difficult to keep up with constant changes to the university’s plans, according to Watson.
“Our student body is resilient, but the uncertainty is taking a toll on mental health, morale, and in some instances, academic and professional work. As we advance, we hope that students will receive more notice when plans change so they can adjust themselves accordingly,” Watson wrote.
