Georgetown received a $50 million gift — the fourth-largest donation in the university’s history — to bolster its athletics leadership program and fund renovations for Multi-Sport Facility, announced Tuesday.
The gift, which came more than a month after the university’s capital campaign passed its goal of $1.5 billion, was contributed by Peter and Susan Cooper of Newport Beach, Calif., the parents of five alumni.
University President John J. DeGioia announced the donation in a university-wide email Tuesday evening.
“The Coopers’ investment in our community will allow us to strengthen opportunities for students engaged in intercollegiate athletics and will help to prepare them for leadership throughout their lives,” DeGioia wrote.
It is the largest donation made in the history of the university’s athletics program, and the fourth-largest donation overall, behind Frank McCourt Jr.’s (CAS ’75) $100 million gift to endow the McCourt School of Public Policy in 2013, Virginia Toulmin’s $75 million donation to the Georgetown University Medical Center in 2010 and Robert McDevitt’s (CAS ’40) $75 million faculty endowment in 2008.
With this donation, the Hoyas Lead program will be renamed the Cooper Athletics Leadership Program, and Multi-Sport Facility, scheduled for renovation in 12 to 18 months, will be renamed Cooper Field.
The donation will expand the athletics leadership program, founded three years ago as an initiative to provide leadership training to Georgetown’s 750 student-athletes through an academic framework. The original program was also entirely funded by an earlier donation from the Coopers.
The university began discussing possible philanthropic projects with the Coopers five years ago. Peter Cooper was previously a member of the university’s board of directors from 2001 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2013, serving as the chairman of the investment subcommittee. Since then, the Coopers have contributed to the financial aid program in addition to Hoyas Lead, having previously donated a total $3 million.
Peter Cooper said that he and his wife were driven to develop the leadership program after witnessing their own children’s involvement in intercollegiate athletics. Three of their sons — Ryan (MSB ’02), Matthew (MSB ’07) and Kris (MSB ’10) — played football, while their daughter Kylie (COL ’02) was on the swim team.
“As a father … I know what [my children] went through — the rigor and the dedication that’s involved in being a student-athlete at Georgetown in terms of meeting the same qualifications as everyone else,” Cooper said. “I was very moved by that experience.”
Building on Hoyas Lead, CALP will provide a four-year curriculum for student-athletes, including classes on the elements of leadership, theories of influence, team dynamics and pre-professional skills.
The donation will also fund additional research for the program and professional development training for coaches. Assistant Athletics Director for Student-Athlete Leadership Mike Lorenzen, who has led Hoyas Lead since its founding in 2012, will continue his role as the director of CALP.
Vice President of Advancement Bart Moore (SFS ’87) said the Coopers and the university identified the program’s expansion as a potential project as they observed its increasing demand among student-athletes.
“A lot of juniors and seniors continue to participate, and that’s evidence that the program has continued to grow, as there is more demand for it,” Moore said.
While the specifics of the expanded program have yet to be determined, the Office of the Provost will work with the athletics department to develop a plan, which includes the possible integration of the courses into the general curriculum.
Vice Provost for Education Randy Bass said that the financial support for a curricular program on leadership is unprecedented.
“It is rare that these kinds of resources can support rigorous development of curriculum and assessment around the question of leadership and co-curricular activities,” Bass wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We look forward to approaching this opportunity … through careful design, thoughtful experimentation and the engagement of the whole community in charting a path.”
Administrators across multiple offices stressed the importance of developing leadership skills among student-athletes.
Athletic Director Lee Reed said that the program will help student-athletes achieve their full potential beyond the sports field.
“It’s a privilege to be a student-athlete at Georgetown University, and with that privilege comes responsibility,” Reed said. “This is a way that we can ensure that student-athletes have the tools and resources they need to be successful beyond the Hilltop.”
Office of the President Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara agreed that student-athletes can apply the leadership and team-building skills fostered by the athletics program to other aspects of their lives.
“CALP honors the idea at the heart of intercollegiate athletics. The leadership our students learn on the field impacts, in a profound way, their formation as women and men, and their ability to respond to the challenges they face throughout their lives,” Ferrara wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Part of the gift will be directed toward completing planned renovations for Multi-Sport Facility, which will include natural seating on the east and north sides and renovated locker rooms. The renovation will continue from the first phase of the facility’s reconstruction, which was funded by $10 million in donations from the previous campaign, ended in 2005.
Multi-Sport Facility renovation will occur alongside the construction of the Thompson Intercollegiate Athletics Center, which was supported through $62 million in donations. The center is expected to open in the summer of 2016.
According to Moore, the renovation project was stalled due to the lack of fundraising, which was brought to the Coopers’ attention as they discussed possible philanthropic projects.
“We had found ourselves in a difficult position with the [Multi-Sport Facility]. … It is very difficult to reinitiate funding for a project that’s been around for a while, but is only half done,” Moore said. “[The Coopers] said, ‘How can we most help you?’ The obvious answer was the completion of the [Multi-Sport Facility].”
Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said that the renovation plans will align with the existing master planning goals.
“The design of Cooper Field will integrate Georgetown University’s master planning principles to support a pedestrian-friendly campus, improve green space and campus sustainability,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Football Head Coach Rob Sgarlata (COL ’94), who coached the Coopers’ three sons on the football team, also said that the renovation will benefit the football program.
“Completing the field is just another piece of the puzzle for the program. It’s going to be a huge boost in recruiting and just another huge show of the commitment to the football program from the school,” Sgarlata said.
According to Moore, multiple projects are lined up after the renovation of Multi-Sports Facility, including an additional residential hall, a new academic building and a renovation or replacement of Yates Field House.
For the time being, Moore said that he hopes the Coopers’ donation will encourage more donations to Georgetown’s endowment.
“Success leads to success in fundraising. Donors like to know they’re giving to a winning team,” Moore wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think that Peter and Sue’s gift, on top of everything else it will do, also puts us closer to our next transformative gift.”
Hoya Staff Writer Katherine Richardson contributed to reporting.
 Correction: An earlier version of the article said that the Coopers’ donation was the second-largest in the university’s history.

This is the fourth largest donation in Georgetown’s history, not the second largest.

Four members of Georgetown Against Gun Violence participated in a rally and press conference co-sponsored by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and Generation Progress on the Capitol’s West Lawn on Oct. 6.
GAGV co-founder Sarah Clements (COL ’18) of Newtown, Conn., said the rally was a reaction to last week’s shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., that killed nine people Oct. 1.
“We’re fed up,” Clements said. “We’re tired of our communities being the targets and the reason why is seeing the impact of Congress’ inaction on this issue for decades and decades. They have hidden behind the gun lobby and I feel the tide’s changing. The media’s response is changing. Journalists are fed up with covering these incidents over and over again and the public is turning away from the gun lobby, turning away from their talking points, and we’re finally winning this thing.”
The rally drew a crowd of around 50 people, including students from The George Washington University and American University and culminated in a letter delivery to Speaker of the House John Boehner’s office.
GAGV, which has previously co-hosted events with the Brady Campaign, aims to promote gun-sense issue voting among youth through activism on campus. The organization held a candlelight vigil with Campus Ministry for the victims in Oregon in Dahlgren Quadrangle the evening of Oct. 1. Moving forward, GAGV members are using #StudentsRising on social media to draw attention to the issue.
Members were invited to participate in the rally by an American University student working on the Brady Campaign.
There is currently a legislative push for the expansion of
tion Act to include more extensive background checks, enacted in 1993, which mandates federal background checks on potential firearms buyers.
President and co-founder Emma Iannini (SFS ’16) spoke about her resolution to tackle issues surrounding gun control legislation over the past three years.
“We’re counting up to the 150th school shooting that’s taken place in the three years since Sandy Hook,” Iannini said. “That is a shame, a blight on this beautiful country, and we shouldn’t accept that. But we know that with each and every incident that it’s the beginning of the end and that each one, at least for me, strengthens my resolve, my recommitment to dedicate my life to changing things.”
Iannini also compared gun lobbyists’ positions to those of car and tobacco manufacturers against safety measures like seat belts and cancer warnings, respectively.
“I am fully confident that we will come back here by the time that my generation is running this country and we will say, ‘What were we thinking 50 years ago? How could we have let the unabated carnage continue shooting after shooting?’” Iannini said.
Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) joined the student speakers to introduce a resolution to make June National Gun Safety Awareness Month.
Norton encouraged continued student activism past this particular rally, also citing youth-populated locations like schools and movie theaters as common targets for mass shootings.
“If this is a one-day deal, expect that it will not have the effect you should have,” Norton said. “I would like to see young people on the case of gun safety in a continuous way, stressing that this is a city with an extraordinary number of gun people who are at particular risk. Then, I think you will get the attention of the Congress. It does not mind episodic attention. It wants constant attention if you want the Congress to do something.”
Clements echoed Norton’s sentiments, urging students to become more involved in gun control activism.
“As college students, as millennials, as the next generation, we have a responsibility to stand up and break that silence,” Clements said. “We must demand that Congress takes action and if they don’t, then we will vote them out.”
According to Iannini, the students present at the rally met a measured response at Boehner’s office.
“They only cracked the door open slightly and we spoke to one of the speaker’s staffers and then they politely told us that we needed to leave,” Iannini said.
GAGV member and rally participant Kate Sullivan (COL ’17) described speaking up in a “U.S. Political Systems” lecture last week after receiving news of the UCC shooting.
“I basically told the class, ‘Listen, there was just a shooting in Oregon at a community college, and I’m wondering when are people going to realize that protecting certain civil rights and liberties actually isn’t what’s best for society, that it’s not worth it,’” Sullivan said. “People need to realize what’s best for everyone as a whole instead of holding onto this idea, this amendment that was ratified in 1791.”
Annie Hill (SFS ’16), also a member of GAGV who attended, highlighted the momentum the gun reform movement is gaining and expressed hope that the process will continue.
“I think that you just kind of have to have hope in the American people that at a certain point you are going to have to start valuing human lives over liking guns,” Hill said. “This is a problem that’s not going to be going away unless we make a change, and it’s a problem that we’re seeing more and more frequently, and it’s breaking more and more hearts across the country. It’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon, but it’s starting to pick up the pace.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser launched the new “500 for 500: Mentoring Through Literacy” program in conjunction with D.C. Public Schools, the Metropolitan Police Department and Howard University on Sept. 28.
The project aims to bridge the achievement gap between uneducated young men of color and their academic counterparts by enlisting 500 adult mentors for 500 black and Latino boys from the Washington area over the next two years.
The program is an extension of the Empowering Males of Color Initiative, launched by D.C. Schools Chancellor Kayla Henderson in January 2014. EMOC, with a similar mission to President Obama’s My Brother’s Keeper initiative, is a $20 million investment, offering support services for historically disadvantaged minority youths enrolled in D.C. schools. Additionally, it resolves to construct an all-boys Urban Prep Academy east of the Anacostia River by 2018.
According to Bowser’s spokeswoman LaToya Foster, the volunteer mentors will promote literacy and a love of learning among struggling students, while also serving as role models for young men of color.
“One of the main things they’ll try to encourage is for these kids to read, read, read,” Foster said. “But for a lot of them, it’ll be more than that. Many of these kids are missing father figures, and mentors give them someone to look up to.”
She added that Bowser conceptualized the initiative after reading and discussing President Barack Obama’s novel “The Audacity of Hope” with a group of eight young men of color. The conversation addressed the issue of policy implementation in helping disadvantaged minority students.
Bowser herself has signed on as one of the program’s first mentors, providing guidance for 6-year-old Tyler Towles of Malcolm X Elementary School.
The program also signifies a partnership across different Washington institutions, as both the MPD and Howard University have pledged to provide mentorship opportunities on a weekly basis starting in October.
“It’s very significant that the MPD is involved,” Foster said. “We’re fortunate here in D.C. that we don’t have tensions at the scale of those found elsewhere in the country, such as Ferguson, but it’s still vitally important that kids feel empowered to trust the police through positive connections with them. We have these partnerships with MPD and Howard because it definitely takes a village for these children.”
Together, black and Hispanic males constitute 43 percent of all DCPS students. Both groups have consistently underperformed compared to girls and children of other backgrounds in areas such as reading and math benchmark exams, school attendance, enrollment in Advanced Placement classes and graduation rates, according to data released by the EMOC in January.
In the 2014 school year, only 32 and 43 percent of black and Hispanic males, respectively, demonstrated proficiency in reading through the District of Columbia Comprehensive Assessment System administered to students in the second to 10th grades. Math scores were similarly low, indicating proficiency achieved by 37 and 55 percent for each demographic respectively.
Black and Hispanic males also represent the two groups with the District’s lowest graduation rates at 48 and 57 percent, respectively, compared with 82-percent of white males graduating in 2014.
Associate professor of sociology Brian McCabe (SFS ’02), whose research specializes in urban structures and social inequality, said this disparity is a result of complex issues within the District. McCabe cited the near-segregation of schools in Wards 7 and 8, which are predominantly impoverished and black.
“In cities in general but in Washington specifically, you have neighborhood conditions that are not conducive for students learning and students achieving,” McCabe said. “You don’t see a very racially integrated class setting, so I think a lot of this goes back to the kinds of neighborhoods we have created: neighborhoods without a lot of resources, neighborhoods without great schools, without great role models that are segregated from the other parts of the city.”
According to McCabe, this lack of adequate education manifests itself later in students’ lives, from higher education to the workplace.
“Graduation from high school is a predictor of a lot of things,” McCabe said. “It predicts market outcomes, whether or not you get a job, also all sorts of health outcomes, teen pregnancy outcomes. Over the last few decades, there used to be a very steady working class or manufacturing job ready for you even if you didn’t have a high school degree, and you could still get a steady income from it. But there are not a lot of jobs that exist like that today.”
Though McCabe said these services could potentially bolster academic performance among struggling students, he maintained that true progress can only be achieved by directly addressing problems within the D.C. school system.
“Generally, I think tutoring programs are a good supplement to some of the work that should be done in school, but it also raises the question about why we need voluntary tutors,” McCabe said. “There’s no problem with voluntary tutors, and as long as you have schools that are underperforming they are a great resource, but the question remains why these schools are sometimes failing to provide for their students in the first place.”
Jake Robinson (SFS ’16), a former coordinator for the D.C. Reads program, which provides tutoring for inner-city elementary school students, said that tutoring programs play a pivotal role in fostering academic progress among disadvantaged students.
“I think mentorship programs have a huge part in helping kids realize their own potential and really realize their strengths as individuals,” Robinson said. “Ward 7 is a very resource-depleted community, and it’s definitely nothing to do with the nature of the people that live there. Having forged relationships with students in that community, I can tell you they are just as intelligent and creative and passionate and driven, but it’s just a matter of having the resources to see that intelligence and creativity allow to grow.”

Ahead of the expiration of Georgetown’s contract with its auxiliary services provider Aramark in 2017, the company has increased its efforts to improve the quality of on-campus dining and engage with students to receive feedback.
Since the beginning of this semester, Aramark has increased its offerings at both O’Donovan Hall and the Grab ’n’ Go locations after receiving student feedback from surveys and monthly meetings with the Georgetown University Student Association Dining Committee.
New additions include a wider range of dining options, such as whole grain foods, smoked salmon, eggs Benedict and chocolate fondue in Leo’s, as well as new salads, sandwiches and snack boxes in Grab ’n’ Go.
According to Associate Vice President of Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese, Aramark implemented the changes to keep up with evolving student tastes.
“One of the trends that we’ve seen is that students want more of a global palette and bolder flavors,” Wiese said. “We’re trying to tap into that, whether it’s in Grab ’n Go or in Leo’s overall.”
Aramark Marketing Manager Adam Solloway also said the company relies on the student community to suggest additions and improvements to dining.
“Our dining committee meetings have been a key factor in student engagement and the feedback has been valuable in guiding our menu planning to increase variety,” Solloway wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Meetings are instructive and we collaborate together to make enhancements.”
Besides the committee, other student working groups formed at the end of last year have held meetings with chefs and representatives from Aramark’s culinary team to help construct the current Leo’s menu.
GUSA Secretary for Auxiliary Services Nicolette Moore (SFS ’17) said that the committee has been instrumental in Leo’s improvements.
“It’s been a really good forum,” Moore said. “It’s making the administrators and the people who work in Leo’s more accountable. When they hear it directly from the students, it means more.”
The beginning of this academic year was also marked by a poor health inspection record for Leo’s given by the United Statse Department of Health. In early September, Leo’s received two critical violations and three noncritical violations on its health inspection report, which included observations of mice droppings in the bake shop storage cage and employees handling cooked broccoli with their bare hands.
GUSA Dining Committee Member Joshua Shinbrot (COL ’16) said the health inspections reflect poorly on Aramark’s management.
“I think it’s pathetic that the health inspection results have been so poor the past several times that they’ve been inspected,” Shinbrot said. “[Aramark] should know how to operate it. They should know how to deal with those contingencies by now.”
Wiese said that Aramark has begun to make improvements in response to the report.
Shinbrot also said that the timing of Aramark’s improvements is questionable given their prior negligence to student input.
“They’ve been nodding their head for years, and all of a sudden, they’re going out to bid early and you see major changes in a matter of weeks,” Shinbrot said. “My big concern is that these improvements are going to be short-lived. … They don’t want to lose that contract.”
Moore also said that the impending end of the contract, which began in 2007, could play into Aramark’s decision to make improvements to the dining services.
“It’s possible that maybe they’re trying to be really responsive just because they know that their contract is ending soon,” Moore said.
However, Wiese said the upcoming end of Aramark’s contract has no relation to the recent improvements, which she said are the result of discussions between student groups and Aramark.
“We’re always tweaking it [and] always fine-tuning it,” Wiese said. “Aramark, as well as all of us, really just want to provide the best that we can for the students. … It’s really just trying to meet the needs of what students want versus anything relative to a contract.”
In addition, Wiese said it is too early in the bidding process to identify prospective vendors or determine the possible renewal of Aramark’s contract with the university.
Despite her skepticism of the changes at Leo’s, Moore said that Aramark has generally become more receptive to student feedback this year.
“I think that they genuinely want to make it better,” Moore said. “Whether that’s something that they would continue to do if their contract was renewed, I don’t know.”

All food service contractors are the same. It’s not about them it’s about the money that the University sucks back out. Good contract equals good food….bad contract equals bad food. These contractors are businesses not charities. 
Plus Bryant sucked out half the $ for the renovations years ago for the murals on the wall. Aramark came in with best intentions as all contractors do. Then you get beat down by students, aux services and then employees. Then you go out to bid and a new company will come in with the same deal. Good first year then drops off until bid.

The United States Justice Department awarded Washington, D.C., $1 million to expand its Body Worn Cameras program for Metropolitan Police Department officers Sept. 21, which will require that the city establish an implementation plan and training policy for cameras, as a response to police violence nationwide.
The additional funding, combined with the money allocated to the program in the mayor’s budget, will be enough to provide for 2,800 cameras. Currently, officers who have daily interaction with community members in the fifth and seventh police districts use 400 body-worn cameras, which were purchased prior to this grant. There are more than 4,000 officers total in the department.
“Body-worn cameras increase accountability, improve police services and strengthen policy-community relations,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a press release announcing the grant Sept. 25. “This grant sends a strong message that we are on the right track.”
In total, the Justice Department awarded 73 grants worth $23 million to cities nationwide to expand the usage of body-worn cameras and explore their potential
impacts on these communities. D.C., along with Los Angeles, Detroit, Miami, Chicago and San Antonio, received the highest dollar amount among recipients.
“The impact of body-worn cameras touches on a range of outcomes,” U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a press release announcing the department’s awards. “[These] build upon efforts to mend the fabric of trust, respect and common purpose that all communities need to thrive.”
Bowser’s Senior Communications Officer LaToya Foster said that while the grant will not be able to fully fund the body-worn camera program in D.C., it is still a significant contribution.
Foster maintained that Bowser’s main goal for the program is to increase police accountability and strengthen relations between citizens and police within the D.C. community.
“As part of the mayor’s supplemental budget, she proposed to the Council to pass the additional funding to implement the body-worn camera program,” Foster said. “It’s increasing accountability, strengthening relations and improving services for our MPD officers, so it’s a win-win all around.”
Foster said that while there are other methods of accountability in the police force to prevent abuse of police power, body-worn cameras constitute a logical step in ensuring adherence to laws.
“There are other programs that are implemented within MPD that increase accountability,” Foster said. “But body -worn cameras are definitely something that the mayor believes are necessary at this point in time.”
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber said that a similar program would not be used by Georgetown’s police force in the near future. He said that the high cost of the program, as well as the complex procedures needed for accountability, have made the university hesitant to implement it for security personnel.
“All that planning has to take place ahead of time, has to be vetted through different groups on campus,” Gruber said. “It is not on our short term list of things we’re going to be doing here.”
In the context of MPD, Gruber also argued that cameras help increase accountability and protect the public from officers who are not using their powers properly. He added that cameras can be used as evidence to help find accused criminals innocent or guilty in a court of law.
“I think they’re an important tool that police officers use,” Gruber said. “[Cameras] become part of evidence that could be used in court and other administrative hearings to show what happened at the scene of [an] incident.”
Foster admitted that the mayor’s office has not yet finalized procedures for footage once it has been captured, which was one of Gruber’s concerns with the program. It is currently unknown how much video from each camera can be released to the public under the Freedom of Information Act, but the mayor’s office is formulating a plan.
“While [cameras are] holding people accountable, the mayor wants to be sure privacy for those captured in the video and be cognizant of that as well,” Foster said. “That’s the part that’s been a little tricky.”
Gruber added that MPD is addressing improving police relations with citizens through alternate programs, including having officers participate in community-based programs, provide support to neighborhoods and better integrate into the communities they serve.
“I think there’s a lot of things [officers can do],” Gruber said. “I think that a lot of what the MPD does is very community-based and has the community’s best interests at heart.”
MPD communications declined requests for comment.

The Georgetown University Student Association Committee on Mental Health hosted a panel discussion with administrators Monday in the Healey Family Student Center to address student concerns about mental health policy after an academic year marked by a spike in student visits to Counseling and Psychiatric Services.
Last year, CAPS received an unprecedented 11,472 visits from 1,772 students, including 39 cases of psychiatric hospitalization. The forum raised students’ concerns ranging from the cost of counseling services, CAPS’ limited hours of operation and the university’s responsibility in helping students returning from medical leave.
The forum featured administrators involved in mental health services on campus, such as Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, CAPS Director Philip Meilman, Student Health Services Associate Vice President James Welsh, Health Education Services Director Carol Day and Student Outreach and Support Director Katie Boin.
GUSA Undersecretary of Mental Health Ben Johnson (NHS ’17) began the event by discussing how mental health on college campuses has become a hot topic in recent years, resulting in the need for more dialogue.
“Mental health is something which has taken an increasing role in all of our minds as an increasing area of activism and concern and excitement on campus. I think that this is a great forum. I am so excited to have everyone here and get this conversation started,” Johnson said.
The panelists then reported on recent developments in their departments in regards to mental health.
“We have seen an escalating client caseload,” Meilman said.
In the question-and-answer session, students asked administrators about the cost of psychiatric counseling and the possibility of offering unlimited free counseling. Currently, CAPS covers group counseling and the cost of a first psychiatric visit.
Olson said that while there have been previous proposals for free psychiatric counseling, the administration does not have a plan to implement the proposal due to financial constraints.
However, Olson stressed that the administration understands the need and will continue to pursue a solution.
“We are taking seriously the request that we have heard, and we will actively explore that this year,” Olson said.
The panel then addressed concerns that the hours of operation for counseling services may make it difficult to schedule appointments around class schedules. Currently, CAPS is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
In response, both Meilman and Day said that they accommodate students who cannot meet during the day.
“Even though it is published as daytime, we often have evening appointments,” Day said.
Scott Dennis (COL ’17), an attendee of the forum, then asked the panel why the university does not publicize statistics from the 2012 American College Health Association National College health assessment survey on Georgetown to students. Results from the survey are partially available on the Student Health Services website.
Boin said that using statistics specifically about Georgetown could potentially have a negative impact on the mental health of students.
“One of the consequences … is that it really brings people to the place where they start to wonder, ‘Is everyone suffering? What is the meaning of this suffering? Why are we all having such a hard time?’” Boin said.
Following Boin’s response, Dennis argued that the university needs to collect concrete data on students’ mental health in order to take action.
“Georgetown very much needs a wakeup call and needs to understand that the stress culture is very real on this campus, and anxiety is a very real problem on this campus, that loneliness and depression are very big issues,” Dennis said.
To close the forum, students and administrators discussed the subject of helping students return from medical leave. Students cited concerns that the university may not be doing enough to work out how students can transition from medical leave to routine academic life most effectively.
Welsh said that the university is dedicated to communicating with students who have taken medical leave and is involved in the process of deciding whether they are fully ready to rejoin the university again.
“We have committed to two things. Number one, to engage with students that have been on a medical leave of absence and identifying those students and getting them to participate,” Welsh said.
Boin also said that there have been numerous improvements in outreach and assisting students with adjusting back to academic life over the past few years.
“I think that one of the things we have done in three years is create good relationships in the dean’s office with the most caring individuals in those units,” Boin said.
GUSA Chief of Staff Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) said that the event was a productive forum for students to share their concerns about mental health with administrators.
“It’s good to have a lot of the issues on the table and have students express their concerns and frustrations with the way that some of the policies are implemented,” McNaughton said.

The Georgetown University Police Department began sending fewer Public Safety Alerts in August after it reformed its guidelines to only notify students of major crime, such as murders, sex offenses and aggravated assaults.
After a review by university leadership, GUPD changed the Public Safety Alert methodology in accordance with the 1990 Clery Act, which requires that institutions of higher education record and disseminate crime data to the campus community and provide timely warnings of safety threats to students and employees.
“We looked closely at the Clery Act requirements as well as surveying our local and national peers,” GUPD Chief Jay Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We discovered that we were sending out too many alerts on issues that were not mandated by the Clery Act.”
Under the new system, GUPD will send campus-wide alerts exclusively for murders, sex offenses, robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries, motor vehicle thefts, manslaughters and arson.
According to Gruber, students have been seeing fewer Public Safety Alerts recently due to a decline in the number of crimes requiring notification of the community. In addition to official alerts, GUPD maintains a daily crime log, which can be found on the department’s website and includes detailed descriptions of less serious crime, like petty theft and simple assaults.
“We are now in line with the Clery Act as well as our local and national peers on the issue of Public Safety Alerts,” Gruber wrote.
Chris Gough (COL ’18) expressed gratitude that he is no longer being inundated with emails.
“I’m certainly happy that they haven’t been blowing up my phone quite as much, so it’s easier to do things without the constant emails,” Gough said. “I certainly think it’s a better idea than what they were doing in the past, but until it’s actually tested practically we have no way of knowing how effective it will be.”
Yu He (GRD ’18), however, said she appreciated being informed of all potential safety issues under the prior system.
“I don’t have a problem with it,” He said. “I would appreciate if they can keep us alert about what’s going on around this community.”
Lily Ryan (COL ’18) said she fears that students will be more careless with their belongings if they are not reminded of theft on campus.
“I guess I’m slightly less cognizant of thefts at least, or of like locking my room because I’m not hearing as much about things getting stolen out of dorm rooms,” Ryan said. “And I know that still is going on, so that could be a problem with not reporting.”
Abdulla Al Shirawi (MSB ’16) raised concerns about the campus alerts that will be omitted under the new methodology.
“It’s pretty bad, because before, we used to know what was happening on campus, we were more aware, and now it just seems like, you know, the campus is safe again, but it’s very subconscious,” Shirawi said. “We should know if anything is happening on campus because it’s important to us. … Some of the times it’s close to where I live, and I just want to know if something is happening there and if it’s happening to any of my neighbors.”
Marlena Konopka (SFS ’17) recommended a reformation of the current system to allow students to choose the alerts they receive.
“I don’t really look at emails from GUPD, even though I should and then the ones that I look at are always the worst ones,” Konopka said. “Maybe if they can make it like an opt-in or opt-out decision so that we don’t have to be bogged down if we don’t want to, but we should definitely get to decide.”

The 13th annual “Are You Ready?” event, a dialogue on sexual assault awareness and promotion of a survivor-orientated response culture, returned this year in Copley Formal Lounge on Thursday.
Health Education Services, Counseling and Psychiatric Services, and the Office of Residential Living sponsor the event each year in partnership with the LGBTQ Resource Center and the Division of Student Affairs.
The event kicked off Take Back the Night’s monthlong program for Domestic Violence Awareness Month, which includes further discussions with survivors of domestic violence and other commemorative events. Thursday’s event featured a talk by founders of sexual assault prevention initiative One Student Kelly Addington and Becca Tieder. The pair also created a sexual education card game, Sexversations, which encourages conversation about sex.
Addington, a rape survivor, encouraged the use of campus dialogue to confront issues of sexual assault. She highlighted the need to create safe spaces for survivors to come forward.
“Look … at the campus population as a whole and see what works with specific groups,” Addington said. “Help create a culture of consent and a space where survivors are comfortable coming forward.”
Addington described how she did not know she was raped until she started having nightmares and panic attacks, since the assault was drug-induced. She decided to take action after a particularly harrowing nightmare left her hysterical and led her to go to the gynecologist, where she learned she was pregnant.
“One morning I woke up screaming at the top of my lungs, crying uncontrollably,” Addington said. “I was sweating so badly that my pajamas were drenched. I was shaking.”
Addington said that she felt conflicting emotions after learning what had happened.
“I couldn’t help but think, ‘What did I say? What did I do?” Addington said. “‘What did I wear that night? How much did I drink? What did I say to him? How does this happen?’”
Addington added that she faced difficulty coping with recovery because she initially chose to be silent about the assault.
“‘This is my fault. This is my fault and I’ve got to fix this,’” Addington recalled thinking. “[But is] what happened to me … less of a rape because I had been drinking or because he was an invited guest in my home?”
Tieder, who was Addington’s good friend at the time of her rape, said that the day she learned Addington had been raped was a life-changing moment. As a result, the two have dedicated their lives to advocating survivor-friendly environments and healthy discussions of consensual sex.
“As her best friend, [I feared] that I failed her,” Tieder said. “Until we can create an environment where we can have healthy, honest conversations about consensual sex, we’re not going to create a survivor-friendly culture where they can come forward.”
Tieder also criticized what she called an “a.m./p.m.” mentality, in which friends of victims say or do one thing at night that they would never do during the day.
“Far too many people act differently or they’re not there for their friends, and that’s unacceptable,” Tieder said. “[People who leave] your friends behind, you’re the problem, not your friend who maybe had a couple of beers.”
After Addington and Tieder’s talk, more than 100 attendees broke off into smaller group discussions.
Carlo Izzo (COL ’17), a student facilitator of one of these discussions, said the discussions gave students a space to discuss difficult issues.
“There’s a lot of really enthusiastic students that want to have this conversation and they don’t find other places on campus to talk about it,” Izzo said. “Working to bring what these sessions are onto the rest of campus is what everyone’s really eager about.”

Associate professor of government Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., and former visiting assistant professor of the School of Foreign Service Rev. François Kabore, S.J., participated in the final meeting of the Jesuit Task Force on Global Justice in the Economy last week in Rome to examine the role of justice in the global economy and environment.
Carnes and Kabore were two of seven Jesuits worldwide, along with two non-Jesuit professors from Jesuit universities, selected by the Society of Jesus for the task force over a year ago to draft a document on economic and environmental justice from a Jesuit perspective.
Since then, the group has met twice — first in Paris last year and later in Pueblo, Mexico this March — before its final meeting from Oct. 1 to 3 in the Curia Generalizia, the international headquarters of the Society of Jesus in Rome. Other members include an economist from France, a professor from the Atenao University in Manila and a coordinator of the Jesuits’ social ministries in Spain.
Over the course of its meetings, the commission produced a document of around 45 pages under the working title “Building Sustainable and Inclusive Communities: Justice in the Global Economy.” The work will be published in four languages and distributed globally through the Jesuit Social Justice and Ecology Secretariat’s journal Promotio Iustitiae in January or February of next year.
Carnes said that Pope Francis’ statements about inequality and environmental concerns were a major inspiration for the creation of the task force.
“It was born out of the early statements of Pope Francis … his concerns about poverty and inequality and especially his concern about the environment,” Carnes said. “[The Society of Jesus] convoked a group of us social scientists to reflect on the ideas that the pope had been saying in a somewhat theological framework [and asked], ‘Could we think about them in a social science framework and have these two speak to each other?’”
Carnes, who was the only political scientist on the commission, said that he was selected to the commission because of his knowledge of economic inequality and policy. He has previously written several papers and taught courses on inequality at Georgetown.
“I think that they wanted someone who understood economics at a pretty deep level, and especially my work on inequality lately is something that attracted attention,” Carnes said.
In addition, Carnes said that he was able to offer his insights on Latin-American policy and culture in the group.
“I think that they wanted someone that had a perspective that was more than just the United States,” Carnes said. “My work in Latin America … is something that may have attracted the eye of the planners.”
According to Carnes, although there has been significant progress made in global human development over the past decades, this progress has not been totally inclusive.
“That level of improvement, everybody should know about that,” Carnes said. “But at the same time, I think everybody should be profoundly worried that it hasn’t been as inclusive as we would like across different countries, across different classes within countries, and this growing apart, this division, this social separation that I think is profoundly concerning.”
Kabore, who now serves as director of the Jesuit University Institute of West Africa in Côte d’Ivoire, said that he hopes that the commission’s document will encourage the Catholic Church to be hopeful in the face of environmental and economic injustice.
“I hope this document will shed light on the potential for the church and all the people of good will to be a beacon of hope in pretty troubled times,” Kabore wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Carnes also said that the paper challenges individual Jesuit institutions to address issues of economic and environmental justice on a small scale.
“I think that one of our hopes is that, much like Pope Francis has done, we will make ourselves a little bit uncomfortable …” Carnes said. “We need to be here at the microlevel on our own campuses dealing with this, and I think that’s going to be interesting for reflection on our campuses.”
Kabore said he believes Georgetown students are in a good position to address issues of global economic and environmental justice.
“I believe Georgetown students have more responsibility than others … to be global players that could make the difference not only in their own lives but also in the lives of others, in order to foster global economic justice,” Kabore wrote.
Elizabeth McCurdy (COL ’17), a Program on Justice and Peace coordinator and justice and peace studies major, said that the creation of the document is well timed.
“I think that a lot of our Jesuit values … go a little bit too micro in making sure that individuals can take care of themselves. When we’re on a planet that can no longer take care of [itself], it becomes hard for anyone to do that,” McCurdy said.
Elena Itameri (COL ’18), a JUPS major who is involved in the Georgetown Sustainable Oceans Alliance, said that this document provides a useful perspective in inspiring the current generation to act on economic and environmental issues.
“I think that the Jesuit perspective will actually have some sort of fresh idea in terms of what … our generation can do [and] in terms of going out and actually having an influence on these issues, rather than simply acknowledging the existence of them,” Itameri said.
Correction: An earlier version of the article said that the meeting took place two weeks ago.

Georgetown University Law Center professor Frances DeLaurentis was selected as a recipient of the Archdiocese of Washington John Carroll Society’s Pro Bono Legal Service Award for her work with the Catholic Charities Legal Network.
DeLaurentis will be recognized for her work in supervising the production of nine handbooks over the past year to be used by the Legal Network’s volunteer lawyers.
The award recognizes individuals and organizations that have done exemplary pro bono legal work for the Catholic organization. received, along with law firms Keller & Heckman LLP and Steptoe & Johnson LLP,, Oct. 4
The John Carroll Society serves the Archbishop of Washington through its Catholic Charities Legal Network, in which Professor DeLaurentis is heavily involved in. The network is a pro bono legal service that serves clients with a variety of issues, including debt, child custody and domestic violence.
DeLaurentis’ law students, with the help of law librarian Carla Wale, spent more than 500 hours creating the handbooks, which were used for reference by attorneys. Logistical information such as county-specific court names and fees were also included.
Caitlin Callahan (LAW ’17) was one of these students and spoke highly of her experience working on the project.
“It was not only rewarding to contribute to the meaningful work of Catholic Charities, but it was exciting to apply our newfound legal research skills to real, practical lawyering and to learn about new structures of local law,” Callahan said.
DeLaurentis spoke of her desire to become more involved, highlighting her goal of completing a project that would not only benefit the network but also involve her students and help them learn.
“I am actually having an impact on students, and it’s having an impact on me,” DeLaurentis said. “They did the real work. … I was just the vehicle.”
She said the most fulfilling aspect of the project was the relationship she developed with each of her students through the cause of serving others.
“Seeing the light bulb go off, I learned so much,” DeLaurentis said. “The service aspect and the teaching aspect of it … [was] a live education.”
DeLaurentis was a civil litigator and partner at a law firm before teaching at the Catholic University of America and coming to Georgetown in 1999. She served as chair of GULC’s legal writing and research program until 2013. DeLaurentis currently teaches legal practice, applied legal composition and advanced legal writing in practice, as well as upper-level writing seminars. DeLaurentis is also director of GULC’s writing center.
Associate Dean of the J.D. Program Naomi Mezey said DeLaurentis is a committed GULC professor, supported by both her colleagues and her students.
“I’m looking at her teaching evaluation, and it just gives you an idea of how much her students love her and care about her,” Mezey said. “For example, one person commented that ‘I loved Professor DeLaurentis and her class. I feel like I’ve really improved a lot from her teaching.’ Her values are internal and they’re part of her identity as a teacher.”
Julie Ross, current chair of the legal research and writing program, succeeded DeLaurentis two years ago and has worked with her at GULC for 16 years. Ross highlighted DeLaurentis’ relationships with her students and expressed excitement at the recognition of her work.
“I was thrilled to hear that she was being recognized for the work that she did with her students last spring,” Ross wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It recognizes both Prof. DeLaurentis and the work of her students; it underscores the obligations of members of the legal profession to engage in pro bono work; and it acknowledges that engaging students in work that serves others is consistent with the Jesuit tradition underlying a Georgetown education.”

Around 120 speechwriting and executive communications professionals shared their experiences working for international political and business leaders at the second Professional Speech Writers Association annual world conference in the Rafik B. Hariri Building from Oct. 6 to 8.
Speechwriters from nine countries attended the three-day conference, including former speechwriters for President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former President George W. Bush and former President Ronald Reagan, among others.
The conference was sponsored by both the McDonough School of Business and Gotham Ghostwriters, a New York City-based ghostwriting firm. Attendance at this year’s world conference was more than double that of its inaugural session at New York University in May 2014, including a range of professionals from government, corporate, nonprofit and independent sectors.
“It is morning in speechwriting … but it’s a dangerous morning in speechwriting,” PSA Director David Murray said as he opened the conference Wednesday morning, alluding to Ronald Reagan’s famous “Prouder, Better, Faster” campaign ad in 1984.
Murray, who is also the editor of monthly magazine publication Vital Speeches of the Day, established the PSA in 2013 as a way to connect leaders in a profession that he said is often overshadowed by the speakers or organizations for which they write.
“Here is your first best chance … to open your hearts about the rigorous, dangerous and sometimes absurd moments of your profession,” Murray said, “To decide: Is speechwriting a lonely profession by nature or can speechwriters nurture each other?”
Participants at the 2015 world conference engaged in a series of panel discussions, question-and-answer sessions, roundtable dialogues and networking events that revolved around the growth of leadership communication.
Speechwriter for Clinton Lissa Muscatine began Wednesday’s question-and-answer session with a candid discussion on her own evolution as a speechwriter and the future of rhetorical craftsmanship.
“I came into the profession when speechwriting was not what it is today,” Muscatine said. “I had never written a speech before [applying to the position] … and had no connection with the Clinton administration.”
However, Muscatine said that she connected with Clinton on both her political actions and messages, finding value in speechwriting through end results.
“Speeches are some part of the historical record of what people of the time are thinking,” Muscatine said. “The speaker needs to be forced to make their case and go through the process of writing a speech. What beguiles me today is that I go into speechwriting courses … and textbooks are used as guides for students. … As soon as it becomes formulaic, you lose the potential for great speeches.”
Other presenters, including MSB marketing and international business professor Charles Scuba, discussed the creativity and strategy behind storytelling for a public audience.
Wednesday’s conference session ended with a panel of seven former presidential speechwriters from the Nixon, Reagan, Bush ’41, Clinton, Bush ’43 and Obama administrations, who shared their personal experiences with creating an appropriate narrative in times of crisis.
John McConnell, former senior speechwriter for George W. Bush, spoke about the high-tension situation in the aftermath of the space shuttle Columbia disaster.
“Pressure doesn’t just concentrate your mind. … It clears away the clutter,” McConnell said.
Adam Frankel, former senior presidential speechwriter for President Barack Obama, added that he thought of the victims when writing speeches addressing tragedy.
“You try to make speeches as unique and distinct as possible and to make them about the individuals affected,” Frankel said. “You imagine if the people who were suffering were in the room, and think about what they would want to hear.”
Because political speeches following tragedies garner high public attention, the panel emphasized the significance of writing a speech that resonates with the greater public.
“If [television networks] didn’t cover us, or The Washington Post or The New York Times, it may as well not have been said,” Clark S. Judge, former senior speechwriter for Ronald Reagan, said.
Former Bill Clinton speechwriter Jeff Shesol echoed Judge, noting that the evolution in media coverage from lengthier stories to fragmented clips places nuanced demands on political speakers.
“Presidents [today] are made to be seen and heard all the time,” Shesol said. “If you didn’t comment on everything then there’s a vacuum that people will exploit. … It’s harder than any day before to control the conversation.”
In light of the changes in media and other methods of communication, conference participants also engaged their peers and co-workers in roundtable and sector-based dialogue, fostering an exchange of strategies, pitfalls and experiences working in executive communications today.
These more intimate discussions concluded Thursday, with a mentoring session for members of the Georgetown University Speechwriting Advising Group — a student-run pro bono speechwriting organization on campus — who initially proposed holding the second annual PSA world conference at Georgetown last year.
GSWAG Co-President Will Simons (COL ’16) commented on the unique opportunity to speak with and learn from top-industry professionals as undergraduates interested in political communication careers.
“Hearing Lissa Muscatine speak was incredibly valuable because she focused on the relationship between speechwriter and client, and that’s something that is so hard to teach, and only with experience you can get better at,” Simons said. “This is just an unbelievable opportunity for all those involved in GSWAG to talk candidly with professionals in the field.”

Hudson Institute senior fellow and former Georgetown professor Arthur Herman discussed shifting values in the Western world at an event in the Intercultural Center on Tuesday evening.
The event, which was titled “The Western Experiment,” was sponsored by the Tocqueville Forum for Political Understanding and focused on ideas from Herman’s latest book on the history of Western civilization, “The Cave and the Light.”
Best known for his New York Times bestselling book, “How the Scots Invented the Modern World,” Herman previously taught at Sewanee: The University of the South, George Mason University, Catholic University and Georgetown before beginning work at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think-tank in Washington, D.C. Herman is also a contributor to The Wall Street Journal.
In his speech, Herman praised Western civilization as a successful experiment, in which proper governance has led to wealth accumulation throughout all social classes.
“To think of Western civilization in some ways as an experiment … Western civilization has evolved as the most materially rich of all civilizations,” Herman said. “Rich not just at the top but permeating down through society even to the lowest rungs of society.”
Herman discussed the historical importance of democracy in the foundations of Western countries such as the United States.
“[American democracy] is an experiment. It is an unusual turn in the course of human history and societies that you and I and everyone can have a role in the making of major political decisions. But also that the role of government itself … remains highly limited,” Herman said.
Herman also said that diversity is a key element in Western societies.
“In the Western tradition, we end up with a host of different books and a range of different religions … even the rejection of religion and the humanistic strain that emerges from that,” Herman said.
Herman then identified the key difference between the West and the rest of the world as rooted in the ideas of Plato and Aristotle.
“What I want to suggest to you is that if you look at the course of Western history, from ancient Greeks on, what you see is these two great figures having enormous influence,” Herman said.
The talk concluded with a question-and-answer session.
Annee Lyons (COL ’18) attended the event because she is interested in ancient philosophical thought.
“As a classics major, I love discussions of the modern relevance of ancient thought,” Lyons said.
Ellen Singer (COL ’18) applauded how Herman linked Western culture to Platonic and Aristotelian thought.
“I thought he offered a compelling narrative, that progress comes from a dynamic exchange between Platonic truth-seeking and Aristotelian practicality,” Singer said.
However, Singer disagreed with Herman’s focus on Western tradition and questioned his assumptions of Western dynamism.
“I think his claim that this is a Western phenomenon is unfounded,” Singer said. “He failed to prove that similar philosophical tension did not drive progress in any other civilization, and his argument was laced with ethnocentric patronization of non-Western tradition.”
