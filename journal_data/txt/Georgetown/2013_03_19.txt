In response to the Sandy Hook shooting last December, the Georgetown University College Democrats have launched a week of programming centered on discussing gun violence as one of its biennial “issue weeks” designed to highlight salient political issues.
GUCD President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said the group originally considered topics including the environment and alternative energy sources for this semester’s issue week but decided to discuss gun control in light of the Dec. 16 tragedy.
“If there was ever a semester to have an issue week focused on gun violence, this would be the semester,” Tezel said.
The first event of the week featured a presentation by Stop Handgun Violence Chairman John Rosenthal about the government’s role in handgun proliferation in a talk Monday co-sponsored by Georgetown’s Amnesty International.
“This is a public health crisis that is resulting in, today, 87 Americans that wake up will be buried,” Rosenthal said. “Eight kids under [age] 19 … that’s a classroom every three days.”
Rosenthal expressed his disillusionment with the federal government’s ability to regulate firearm sales.
“Having been to the White House today, I can tell you a universal background check for all gun sales will not pass Congress,” Rosenthal said. “Every once in a while, there’s a high-profile massacre … and that seems to get attention.”
Rosenthal disparaged Congress for its inaction in the wake of Sandy Hook and other high-profile shootings.
“Nothing has been done since Newtown,” Rosenthal said. “Six- and seven-year-olds, 20 of them … those are little coffins.”
Rosenthal also discussed the financial influence of companies on U.S. handgun policy.
“Somewhere along the way, we became completely financially co-opted as a country,” Rosenthal said.
Rosenthal rallied students to get involved in the fight for gun control, adding that other movements, such as divestment, also began on college campuses.
“You guys will have to take responsibility for the democracy,” Rosenthal said. “You guys are in a unique position here in D.C. to maybe organize and put heat on Congress.”
National Gun Victims Action Council President and CEO Elliot Fineman will speak Tuesday evening, and GUCD will conclude the week with a screening of “Living for 32,” a documentary submitted to the 2011 Sundance Festival by Colin Goddard, a victim of the 2007 shooting at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and an advocate for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.
GUCD and the Georgetown University College Republicans have previously debated gun control. According to GUCR Vice-Chair Mallory Carr (COL ’15), the two organizations agreed upon the necessity of banning high-capacity magazines and instituting increased background checks, including mental health examinations.
“This really isn’t a political issue,” Carr said. “There [are] lives at stake, and Congress needs to look at what works and what doesn’t to reduce the incidences of gun violence. We believe in smart and responsible gun ownership and … so do the Democrats.”
Throughout this issue week, GUCD aims to further focus the spotlight on firearms issues.
“Our main goal is to have the issue at hand become a topic of discussion among the Georgetown regular political discourse, in the same way that recent issues like the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act … or maintaining the Pell Grant program did,” Tezel said.
Students have been inspired by Gun Issue Week’s events so far.
“After hearing [Rosenthal] speak, I wanted to march to the Capitol, get arrested for practicing civil disobedience and break my phone dialing my representatives in Congress,” Zoe Dobkin (SFS ’16) said.

Despite the planned opening of five new restaurants in Georgetown this year, local blog The Georgetown Metropolitan reported that 13 closed in 2012.
According to the Metropolitan, that number compares to 11 closures in 2011 and only five in 2010.
Nancy Miyahira, marketing director of the Georgetown Business Improvement District, wrote in an email that one specific cause for the large number of closures could not be pinpointed. She indicated that retirement, a change in business strategy or the end of a lease term were among the reasons for the closings.
Uno Chicago Grill, an independently owned franchise which was located at 3211 M St. NW, closed in September 2012. Uno’s Senior Vice President of Marketing Dick Hendrie told The Hoya that, to his knowledge, the business owners were no longer interested in continuing operations when the time came to renew the lease.
“Looking at all [of] the options, it didn’t make sense for them to continue,” he said.
George Deheshdi, owner of Fino Italian Restaurant at 3011 M St. NW, which closed last September, said that he had been located in Georgetown for 22 years and plans to relocate to Foggy Bottom.Deheshdi opened a new location at 1230 9th Street NW.
Sri Suku, owner of the now-closed Crepe Amour and Georgetown Wing Co., formerly located at 3291 M St. NW, said that the costs of doing business in the prestigious neighborhood made it difficult to turn a profit.
“Georgetown is a great place to build a brand,” Suku said. “Everybody likes to have a Georgetown address … but those Georgetown addresses are probably the least profitable ones in their portfolio. From a business owner’s perspective, when it comes down to economics, it really doesn’t make sense at the moment.”
Among the reasons Suku cited for closing his restaurants was what he called a “greedy” landlord, who raised his monthly rent from $6,000 to $15,000.
Suku predicted that the high costs of doing business will force even more restaurants to close.
Not all business owners, however, share Suku’s concerns.
Good Stuff Eatery, which specializes in burgers, fries and milkshakes, looks to open shop this spring in the location Suku’s restaurants used to occupy.
“We are really excited about it,” Jordyn Lazar, a spokesperson for the restaurant said. “Georgetown is a really vibrant community. You have a great mix of people.”
Farmers Fishers Bakers, which opened last November in Washington Harbour, has been able to meet forecasted sales expectations, according to Jennifer Motruk Loy, vice president of marketing and public relations.
Motruk Loy credited the Georgetown location for the sales figures.
“Georgetown is perhaps one of the top destinations in the country,” Loy said. “It is a wonderful combination of historic interests, shopping, dining and entertaining.”
In response to Suku’s comments about business in Georgetown, Loy theorized that marketing may have played a factor in Crepe Amour’s closure.
“There are a number of factors, of course, that are going to make a business succeed or fail,” she said. “Marketing is definitely one of them. It sounds to me like he didn’t understand his market area. He didn’t understand the demographics of what he was dealing with or the way that traffic worked.”
The other closures include Homemade Pizza Co., Papa Razzi, Mie N Yu, La Madeleine, The Guards,Leonidas, Georgetown Candy Bar and two eateries in the Georgetown Mall — Cafe Europe and K’s Deli.
Despite the series of closures, at least five new restaurants have announced that they will be opening in Georgetown this year. Miyahira added that the neighborhood will continue to attract different businesses because of the name recognition.
“People love to come to Georgetown — it’s a destination,” Miyahira wrote. “For a business to open here means they’ll benefit from the abundant mix of customers — including locals, college students, office employees who work in Georgetown, residents and tourists. Georgetown has international name-brand recognition; people ‘know Georgetown,’ and it’ll always be a popular destination in the D.C. metro area.”

Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state and Mortara distinguished professor in the study of diplomacy discussed the tumult of discovering her unknown heritage, as discussed in her memoir “Prague Winter,” to a sold-out crowd Feb. 25.
Albright began by describing her upbringing in Belgrade, London, Prague and Colorado.
“My mother used to say there are only two great cities in the world: Prague and Denver,” Albright said.
Albright’s parents, however, never spoke about her Jewish heritage or family history. After entering the public eye as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Albright began to receive letters from Czech citizens who knew her ancestors.
“The first time I became a public figure … I started getting letters from people from the Czech Republic,” Albright said. “I got a letter from somebody that had all of the names right and the dates right and the villages right and saying my family knew your family to be a fine Jewish family.”
Albright said that fate had played a significant role in her life, especially when her father led her family out of Czechoslovakia to America before World War II in order to escape communist rule.
“All my life, I’ve thought about what would have happened if my father hadn’t left in 1948. How would we have behaved; how would I have behaved? I’m such a joiner, and I believe in political parties. … Who knows how people would behave?” Albright said. “I try to give a little bit more space in the book in terms of not being quite as judgmental.”
Explaining that decisions could appear morally obvious in hindsight, Albright spoke about the complexities of morality, a key theme in “Prague Winter.”
“There are kind of three layers to [“Prague Winter”],” Albright said. “The inner layer is my family’s story. The second layer is about the war itself and what went on during World War II, and the third layer is about the difficulty of making moral decisions.”
Albright said that she initially felt hesitant about “Prague Winter” because of the pain it could cause her and others.
“You grow up with one version of your life, and you begin to examine all the different parts,” Albright said. “I felt it was really important to [write the book], but having already found out things I had no idea about, I didn’t know what else I would find out — and also, just generally, about reopening wounds. It was a really tough period for not just my family but for a lot of people.”
Albright concluded her speech by emphasizing the guidance history and experience can provide to ensuing generations.
“You can’t live in the past, but there are lessons from the past,” Albright said.
After the discussion, Albright opened the floor to questions and hosted a book signing.
Audience members said they appreciated Albright’s points about evaluating the past and learning from heritage.
“I thought [Albright] was very knowledgeable — she clearly has a lot of wisdom from her experiences in foreign policy and public service,” Kristina Ravensbergen (SFS ’16) said. “I think it’s important to consider all sides of the equation as she was saying. It’s not fair to judge people in retrospect based on the knowledge that we have now but to really consider the perspectives of everybody and the situation. It was very interesting to hear her speak, and I appreciate her open-mindedness.”

University of North Carolina Greensboro professor Susanna Rinner (GRD ’03) spoke about how various German films helped foment the 1968 German radical movement Friday afternoon.
Rinner, who studied German literature at Georgetown, is the author of “The German Student Movement and the Literary Imagination: Transnational Memories of Protest and Dissent.”
In her lecture, Rinner spoke about how the film industry influenced the German youth rebellion.
“A plethora of publications, representations and anniversary commemorations have dealt with the 1968 student movement in Germany,” Rinner said. “I attribute this to the ongoing culture wars on both sides of the Atlantic in order to determine the importance of this social movement.”
Rinner’s presentation featured excerpts from “Easy Rider” and “Viva Maria” as well as the German film “Die Stille Nach Dem Schuss” — literally translated to “the silence after the shot” — which was later released in English as “The Legend of Rita.”
According to Rinner, “Viva Maria,” a film released in both French and English about a travelling circus that uses guerilla warfare against a wealthy landlord in order to support the peasants, played a significant role in shaping the early German youth movement.
“The reason I think this is significant for the 1968 radical is that everyone loved the movie when it came out in 1966,” Rinner said.
Rinner then discussed the American film “Easy Rider,” which depicted prejudice against defiant youth. Rinner compared this prejudice to racism against African Americans.
“There is something about the identity of the rebellious figure that is sexualized and racialized,” Rinner said.
In addition to studying race and gender relations, Rinner expressed interest in studying the economics of the 1968 rebellion.
“I think the reason this keeps me engaged is that it is an interdisciplinary discourse with multiple research angles,” Rinner said.
Attendees found Rinner’s work interesting.
“She did an excellent job, especially with reference to pop culture,” Noelle Rettig, a doctoral candidate in the German department, said.
Claudia Winkler, also a doctoral candidate in the German department, agreed, adding that she enjoyed seeing the planning process behind an academic’s finished work.
“There is this idea of the academic as an isolated genius,” Winkler said. “Seeing things like this really breaks down that stereotype.”

History professor Michael Kazin’s audience for his course “United States History Since 1865” grew from 69 to thousands Feb. 24 when C-SPAN recorded his lecture for a national audience.
The lecture will air May 4 as part of the network’s “American History TV” series, which broadcasts 48 hours of history programming each weekend. In addition to lectures, the program includes interviews with historians and book discussions.
“The goal is to have someone who is interested in history learn something and find the class interesting,” C-SPAN producer Russell Logan said. “The idea is that we can get these snapshots from around the country of what it’s like to sit a day in a college classroom. We’re hoping that it comes across as having something of an authentic feel and that it’s different [from] a public event.”
According to Arts and Sciences Communications Officer Maggie Moore, it is not uncommon for C-SPAN to film history classes at Georgetown; the network asks several times a semester to cover lectures on the Hilltop.
Once a professor has given permission, the Office of Communications coordinates with C-SPAN to arrange the logistics for filming. Students are informed prior to the filming and are accommodated if they do not want to be on camera.
As part of the same series, C-SPAN broadcasted a lecture about emancipation and the enlistment of black soldiers from associate history professor Chandra Manning’s course “Civil War and Reconstruction History” last spring.
“There are big cameras looking at you, but after a while you stop noticing them because the students are still there, and I talk to them the way I normally would,” Manning said. “That is what [C-SPAN] is going for. They want to try to capture, so far as they can, how a classroom usually runs. That’s the idea behind the program.”
According to Logan, C-SPAN chooses Georgetown professors because of their familiarity with the network.
“We know that they are interesting to listen to and are good speakers,” Logan said. “We are looking for people who are considered good classroom lecturers.”
Kazin, who said he has appeared on C-SPAN two dozen times throughout his career to deliver lectures and discuss his books, chose his lecture on cultural conflict in the United States in the 1920s for last month’s filming.
Besides having to hold class in a different location and remain still while lecturing, Kazin said that the film crew did not disturb the class.
“I think it’s a great service, especially for people who want to learn about American history, so I’m happy to help them,” he said.
Matt Dever (COL ’16), a student in Kazin’s course, said that class proceeded as usual.
“The most difficult part was simply remembering to go to the [Intercultural Center] auditorium instead of the usual classroom,” he said. “The camera crew simply made sure we were all front and center, and I was not bothered by their presence. … It felt like little more than a regular lecture, just in a different location.”
But Manning said that some aspects of classroom lectures can get lost on television.
“I don’t believe the interactive-style lecture … that I use translates all that well to a taped format,” she said.
Nonetheless, Dan Stewart (COL ’13), a former student in Manning’s course, agreed that filming these classroom lectures is worthwhile.
“I think that the topic of my class is of strong interest to many people not attending classes here at Georgetown,” Stewart said. “Making it accessible on a grand scale is something that we should be doing.”
Because C-SPAN aims to air a variety of lectures, it will not film anything else at Georgetown for the “American History TV” series this semester.

While plans are underway for the Healey Family Student Center, some student groups are struggling with the consequences of its construction.
Construction of the student center, which will be formed partly of the existing Riverside Lounge in New South, will obstruct practice space for dance groups and storage space for other student organizations, including the Advisory Board for Service Organizations. Groups that currently use the space must vacate by June 1 and will not be able to return until the 2014-2015 academic year, when the student center opens.
With the June deadline fast approaching, however, most groups are still unsure of where they will practice and move materials throughout the upcoming year.
“They really haven’t given us alternatives at all,” Flip Dis Funk That member Mary Lim (SFS ’13) said. “Construction is going to take a while, and for groups to have to compete with other meetings and other groups … it’s going to be really hard.”
According to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, the university is in the process of developing plans for alternative space. These plans have not yet been made available to student groups.
“We take the issue seriously, and [Center for Student Programs Director] Erika Cohen Derr been working on it actively,” Olson said. “Clear plans are coming soon.”
In the meantime, groups are turning to options like studios in Yates Field House for dance rehearsals. Studios in Yates are also used for exercise classes, cutting into time for use by student groups.
“It’s definitely going to be a tougher year, especially because we’re not 100 percent sure if we have the weekend time, which is important to us,” Cae Maitner (COL ’15), Performing Arts Advisory Council dance representative and Georgetown University Dance Company secretary, said. “We might have to change time slots.”
Lim said that while dance groups had been consulted about HFSC, they had not been consulted about alternatives during the construction period.
According to GUSA Chief of Staff and member of the student center committee Zach Singer (SFS ’15), the committee has discussed student space.
“Dr. Olson is obviously aware of needs going on with student groups,” Singer said. “It’s not going to get lost. I wouldn’t worry about it.”
Nevertheless, Singer acknowledged that the committee has mostly focused on HFSC as a final product.
“We don’t spend most of our time talking about the intermediary steps,” Singer said. “We’re supposed to focus on making sure the building is built on time, making sure it looks good and making sure student voices are heard.”
ABSO Chair Morgan McDaniel (SFS ’13) said that moving from the New South facilities would be a difficult for social justice groups.
“Many of our groups rely heavily on the storage space in Riverside Lounge to conduct their service on a weekly or even daily basis, and some groups even use it for office space or staging areas for events,” McDaniel said. “ABSO is working with CSP and other university departments to identify unused space on campus and find an optimal solution.”
Singer said that GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) stressed the importance of finding alternative space for the upcoming year.
“It’s really a priority of the administration, of GUSA and pretty much everyone involved to find the space for the year,” Singer said. “I’m sure we will make a solution, make it work.”
Despite the difficulties for student organizations, Singer said he was hopeful for a successful resolution to the issue.
“We understand that there will be growing pains while the project is going on, but once [it’s] done, it will be better for all,” Singer said. “For the year and a bit that it’s getting built, we’re going to make the best of it, and I’m sure we’ll find a way to make sure groups won’t lose their stuff. I’m not too concerned — I’m sure we’ll find a way to do it.”

After months of advocating for an athletic training program for club sports, the Advisory Board for Club Sports requested $41,000 from GUSA, but was denied any funding at GUSA’s Feb. 24 budget summit for the 2014 fiscal year.
The Georgetown University Student Association sent out a survey over winter break gauging interest in a trainer program. Two-thirds of the 100 respondents said that they would be very likely to use a club sports trainer if one were made available to them.
Despite this demonstrated interest, the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee hesitated to fully fund an athletic training program without first seeing a pilot program.
“Everyone pretty much agreed that it’s a worthwhile idea, but we want to see some sort of pilot program even with one trainer. We want to see what the impacts are and how well it is received,” Fin/App Committee Chair Sheila Walsh (COL ’14) said.
Walsh recommended that ABCS use money already allocated to the board by GUSA for their initial test program.
“We can’t really dictate how they actually go about spending it, so they can make a conscious decision to direct more of that money to a pilot training program,” Walsh said.
ABCS does not plan to appeal the decision, but remains committed to making the program a reality.
Now that GUSA has denied the program funding for the 2013-2014 academic year, ABCS plans to present to Center for Student Programs Director Erika Cohen Derr, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and other representatives of the campus administration, risk management and legal departments.
“Currently we are working on finalizing our proposal,” GUSA Undersecretary for Athletic Affairs Luke Carter (COL ’14) said.
ABCS envisions that the program would include two professional, part-time trainers: one for injury follow-ups and related care and another to be available from Monday through Thursday from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. when most club sports teams practice.
ABCS consulted with club sports athletes at universities with comparable programs to develop their budget proposal. According to ABCS Chair Meredith Kolff (SFS ’13), the advisory board’s findings estimate that payroll costs for two part-time trainers would be $25,000. The remaining $16,000 would cover travel, overtime pay and startup equipment.
“This program would improve the club sports experience immensely, as it would allow our athletes to train more safely and effectively, thus improving their overall health and peak performance potential,” Carter said.
According to Kolff, students would not work with trainers beyond receiving injury care, but if the program were to become successful, students could possibly be employed as trainers.
Club sports athletes said that there is currently no comparable alternative to trainers.
“It seems to me that players are responsible for their own care,” Club Field Hockey Captain Jenn Pollock (COL ’14) said. “There really is no system in place for long-term sports-injury care readily available for club players.”
 
Robert Rosa (COL ’14), captain of the Georgetown University Rugby Football Club, has been advocating for the institution of an athletic training program since his freshman year  because of the inherently violent nature of his sport.
“We need to have access to trainer support on the field when we come out with injuries,” Rosa said. “We do our best to treat our own injuries, but some of them are serious and we do not know how to do so.”
During the past two seasons, approximately 25 players on club rugby have suffered concussions. Players on the team have also torn knee ligaments and broken bones. Unfortunately, professional medical service is not readily available.
“Athletic trainers for rugby should not be a luxury. It is a necessity,” Rosa said.
The potential athletic training program would ideally designate a trainer for away games for contact sports as well as for games and practices at Georgetown for all sports.
Advocates for the program said that an athletic training office would have many benefits for dealing with both serious injuries and day-to-day care.
“Even just a universal resource center where personnel [is] not always on hand, but there [are] at least resources available to tend to injuries, provide ice and bandages and request consultation later on would be very helpful,” Club Soccer Captain Dereck Hough (COL ’13) said.

Those in attendance at last Saturday’s season-closer against Syracuse know first-hand the energy and excitement that filled Verizon Center from tip-off to the storming of the court. Hoya fans created a palpable and rousing sixth man for our boys in gray and made a major contribution to this memorable end to the storied Georgetown-Syracuse rivalry.
As a die-hard fan who has attended nearly every home game over the last two years, this level of attendance and enthusiasm was a welcome change from the norm. Despite healthy attendance at a few other big games this season, more games than not have featured a dismally small student section.
Though our attention now turns to the NCAA tournament, we cannot miss this opportunity to reflect upon the season and evaluate our performance as fans.
What follows is a series of constructive suggestions for a variety of groups, which, if implemented, would lead to a significantly stronger student presence during next year’s important inaugural season of the newly reconstructed Big East.
Direct Busing
Buses that currently whisk Hoya fans to the Rosslyn metro station used to — as recently as several years ago — shuttle students directly to Verizon Center. This service needs to be reinstated, even if it means reducing the number and frequency of the buses.
Too many students are dissuaded from attending games or purchasing season tickets because of the time commitment of attending a game. In order to secure a good seat and successfully navigate the bus and metro ride, both to and from the game, the entire trek can last four or five hours, sometimes more.
So to make it simple, spend some of the money we spend now on Rosslyn buses on direct busing to Verizon Center and start them a minimum of two hours early for the more enthusiastic fans.
Loyalty Program
We have no problem getting high turnout for big games like Syracuse, but we often come up short during December games against no-name schools. To remedy this, I propose that the Athletics Department institute a loyalty program that rewards attendance at less-popular games with reserved seats at big match-ups. Imagine if you got a guaranteed first-, second- or third-row seat to the Syracuse game for attending 90 percent of all other home contests. I would definitely be at every game. This idea is simple, cost-free and geared directly toward the problem.
Hoya Blue
Hoya Blue needs to step its game up, big time. Though I don’t for a minute question the intentions and deep school spirit of Hoya Blue’s leaders, I know I am not alone in questioning their practices.
First off, it was ridiculous to see several members of Hoya Blue’s executive leadership participate in pregame and halftime promotional contests. Having been selected to compete in a half-court shot myself, I know that participants are picked from the first few rows of the student section. The problem is that the Hoya Blue staff for each game reserve themselves seats in the front row. Those who waited for upwards of eight hours outside Verizon to get a decent seat not only had to watch a pack of Hoya Blue staffers roll up a few hours before game time and sit in the front row but then had the pleasure of seeing them have the chance to win substantial prizes during the game. This delegitimizes Hoya Blue and irks fans. Why have the Stonewalls — the young alumni fan section — received so much positive attention and press? Because unlike Hoya Blue, they are true fans trying to improve the game-day experience for everyone.
More Cheers
This next observation might sound silly, but hear me out. We have no cheers. Well, we have three: “Let’s Go Hoyas,” “Defense, Defense” and “Hoya Saxa.” But after being prompted to yell “Let’s Go Hoyas” for the 127th time in one game, it starts to get old. While I don’t propose turning the entire student section into a coordinated cheerleading squad, small games with small attendance benefit from coordinated cheers — especially creative cheers unique to Georgetown. Easy solution: Hoya Blue needs to put their thinking caps on during the off-season and come up with five good cheers that are easy to remember. Make big cards with the cheers on them, have some of the staffers hold them up, and just like that — problem solved.
While this list is by no means complete, I believe it represents several easy and affordable solutions for increasing student turnout during the entire men’s basketball schedule. As a top-five team, we as students have a responsibility to support our classmates throughout the entire season, not just during the big rivalry games.

University Information Services is in the final stages of overhauling Wi-Fi infrastructure for Georgetown’s 11,000 continuous Wi-Fi users while also evaluating an overhaul to printing on all three campuses in the D.C. area.
The Wi-Fi upgrades will be completed after Internet access in Healy Hall and White-Gravenor are updated this semester.
UIS upgraded or installed Wi-Fi in 24 buildings on the main campus, affecting the Wi-Fi access of approximately one-sixth of undergraduate Georgetown students.
Before the overhaul, 33 percent of all network equipment on campus was at the end of their lives, according to Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis.
“The Georgetown network was nearing capacity,” Davis said. “I made it a priority to bring ubiquitous Wi-Fi to Georgetown, as part of that goal, last year promised students we would have Wi-Fi in 100 percent of residence halls.”
Georgetown used a network built in 1987 to support all Internet and telephone traffic. Before the overhaul, there had been few improvements to Georgetown’s network in the 26 years since then.
Davis said that UIS focused its improvements on libraries and residence halls. The New South upgrade quadrupled its Internet capability from 20 to 89 access points. UIS more than doubled the Southwest Quad’s access points from 74 to 192.
“Creating a strong Wi-Fi network is part of an emphasis on building a solid, modern technology foundation on which Georgetown can continue to grow,” Davis said. “We’re trying to transform the way people think about technology at Georgetown. We’re excited about the changes we’re bringing to campus.”
UIS is also partnering with Xerox to overhaul the university’s printing system and allow for more web printing, mobile printing and greater sustainability. Davis said the project, which was started three months ago, is scheduled to be completed before the end of the semester.
Davis cited the McDonough School of Business’ printing program, which includes printing in tuition, as a potential model for other schools due to its popularity among students. UIS is also looking at ways to reduce printing and copying costs.
“We are working with the provost and housing to figure out how we begin to implement Xerox and bring capabilities to students and faculty,” she said.
Davis said that Xerox is helping determine how to phase in the printing overhaul.

For the sixth consecutive year, H*yas for Choice is holding Choice Week to promote dialogue about sexual choice on campus. However, this year the event has stronger significance — it is also the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade.
“Even though Roe v. Wade helped to secure the right to a safe and legal abortion, 40 years later there are still those out there who are working extremely hard to restrict this right, especially for the most marginalized women in the U.S.,” HFC Vice President Haylie Jacobson (SFS ’15) said. “Choice Week is a reminder that there is always work to be done in protecting a woman’s right to choose.”
In years past, Choice Week was HFC’s only visible time of year, but the organization has increased its year-round campus visibility in recent years, growing from six members in 2010 to a listserv of 400 this semester.
“[Choice Week] doesn’t hold as much weight as in years past, when it was kind of our coming-out event every year, but it’s just kind of to remind people of how important choice is,” HFC president Kelsey Warrick (COL ’14) said.
According to Jacobson, Choice Week still has a role to play in educating the student body about the complexity of the pro-choice movement.
“We’re trying to show that there’s a diversity of opinions and beliefs within the choice movement,” Jacobson said.
The week began with a screening of “The Secret History of Sex, Choice and Catholics” Monday.
The film encouraged Catholics to follow their beliefs even if they contradict with the Vatican’s official teachings. In addition, the film warned viewers against imposing their own views regarding abortion and contraception on others.
“I’m not Catholic myself, so I didn’t know too much about the Catholic reasoning behind their views,”HFC Events Co-Coordinator Zoey Krulick (SFS ’15) said. “It opened my eyes to a lot of Catholic ideas, and it really made me happy to see that there is a place in the Catholic community for people who are pro-choice.”
Other events scheduled for this week include “Bro-Choice,” a discussion about men’s role in the fight for reproductive justice Tuesday, a speech by Planned Parenthood Metropolitan Washington CEO Laura Meyers on Wednesday and a “Celebration of Choice” event Friday.
HFC Events Co-Coordinator Laura Narefsky (COL ’14) highlighted “Bro-Choice” as an important event, adding that male support for the issue is often overlooked.
“It’s an aspect of choice that people kind of skim over a lot,” Narefsky said. “Everyone associates choice with a women’s issue, and that women should get involved, but [‘Bro-Choice’] has been one of our most popular events.”
Bringing diverse issues of sexual choice out into the open can help facilitate discussion on a subject that is sometimes considered taboo, HFC events co-coordinator Laura Narefsky (COL ’14) said.
“I would love it if people of all opinions could come to the events and learn from it because I think a lot of the problem with what we’ve talked about is that people don’t know what pro-choice is,” Narefsky said. “Pro-choice is not just pro-abortion, and so coming to these events [and] learning about these things is one of the best ways that you can engage in dialogue.”
HFC is not recognized by the university, which can make logistical coordination for the weeklong event challenging because the group does not have access to official funding and cannot table or advertise in spaces on campus beyond Red Square, which is designated a free-speech zone. However, board members say they have grown used to these roadblocks.
“We actually love not being a [Student Activities Commission]-recognized group because if we were we would be so limited in the things that we could do,” Warrick said. “While it’s hard to navigate the red tape, we don’t really feel like it’s detracting from our mission at all.”
Reflecting on its unofficial status on campus, Narefsky said that the student body is generally accepting of the group.
“People respect you if you’re passionate,” Narefsky said. “With the occasional controversy or tension, I think it’s maybe not a welcoming environment, but people understand that we’re here.”
In the discussion about reproductive justice, students on both sides of the issue have been active on campus. In January, Georgetown students organized the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life. Conference co-director and Right to Life Treasurer Kevin Sullivan (SFS ’14) said that he respected HFC members’ right to express their opinions.
“We honestly disagree on a lot of issues, but we’re happy to engage in dialogue at all times,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan said that he believes that the manner of expression of pro-choice views has begun to alienate some students from engaging in dialogue.
“On the pro-choice side, it’s becoming more and more radicalized in the sense of what kind of language is used,” Sullivan said. “There’s less of a tolerance for students who try to voice their pro-life opinions, especially women who are pro-life.”
Regardless of her individual perspective, Chandini Jha (COL ’16) said that she valued the events as a way to be part of an open dialogue about sexual choice.
“I feel like the whole idea of choice is something that we don’t really talk about on campus in a way that’s really open,” Jha said. “Even if you don’t agree with what people say during Choice Week, it’s good to hear other people’s perspectives.”

The District’s first medical marijuana dispensary, Capital City Care, is slated to open next month at 1334 North Capitol Street NW, two years after the D.C. Council legalized medical use of the drug.
“This will be the first time qualified patients in D.C. have legal access to this medicine. Patients interested in pursuing this treatment option will finally have a safe and reliable way to do so,” the dispensary’s Communications Director, Scott Morgan, wrote in an email.
The dispensary’s services will be offered exclusively to patients suffering from verifiable chronic illnesses, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, severe muscle spasm conditions such as multiple sclerosis, or those undergoing medical treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or the use of protease inhibitors, according to Morgan.
These limited access policies will make Capital City Care among the most stringent distributors in the nation, according to local ABC affiliate WJLA. The dispensary will have security cameras and biometric locks to deter theft, and customers will be asked to present IDs issued by the Department of Health upon entering the store. Patients will also be limited to purchasing two ounces per visit.
The business model envisioned by Capital City Care contrasts sharply with those of dispensaries in states such as Colorado that have garnered a reputation of providing a legal channel for recreational users to have access to the drug.
“We want to build a program in D.C. that can serve a national example and that requires taking great care throughout every step of the process,” Morgan said.
City officials also contend that the District’s regulations are stricter compared to those in other states.
“This will not be the kind of setup like they have in California where doctors will just see you and write medical marijuana prescriptions,” Department of Health attorney Carla Williams said at a town hall meeting last year.
This stringency could potentially lessen the stigma associated with medical marijuana and allow further research into the medical and social effects of legalization.
“I think it’s a social experiment,” James Giordano, professor of biochemistry and chief of the NeuroethicsStudies Program at the Georgetown University Medical Center said. “It will be very important to use this dispensary as a ‘living laboratory’ to determine what works, what doesn’t and why. We can then adapt in such a way as to more effectively meet the demands of patients and also to operate ethically within the scope of the law.”
Marijuana Policy Project, a lobbying organization working towards the legalization of marijuana, was supportive of the launch of Capital City Care.
“Medical marijuana dispensaries will provide seriously ill patients with legal, safe and consistent access to their medicine,” MPP Communications Director Mason Tvert said. “They will no longer be forced to seek out marijuana in the underground market, and they will actually know what they are getting.”
The drug has gained popularity in recent years for its ability to alleviate symptoms associated with serious illnesses and is seen by many in the medical community as a viable treatment option, particularly for patients who have not responded to other forms of treatment.
“Marijuana is a politically charged issue, but if you take away the politics, it is just a pharmacologically active botanical medicine,” Adriane Fugh-Berman, professor of pharmacology at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, wrote in an email. “Marijuana can be helpful for cancer patients by increasing appetite and curbing nausea and has other therapeutic effects, including helping reduce spasm in multiple sclerosis and helping to treat glaucoma.”
Some medical professionals, however, remain skeptical about the benefits of the drug.
“I fear the hype surpasses any real benefit,” Thomas Sherman, professor of pharmacology at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, wrote in an email. “In terms of hard science, there is little evidence to support marijuana as a medicine, especially when smoked.”
Nevertheless, Sherman supported the dispensary’s opening, saying that he thinks it will do more good than harm until further clinical trials can be conducted.
Capital City Care’s opening comes two years after the D.C. Council legalized medical marijuana. According to MPP Communications Manager Morgan Fox, the council’s desire to reconcile District regulations with federal ones accounted for the delay in the dispensary’s opening.
Marijuana, whether medical or recreational, remains illegal under federal law. Although an early Obama Administration memo indicated that the president would not take action to shut down medical marijuana dispensaries if they complied with state law, the president began cracking down on dispensaries in 2011.
The Obama Administration has not indicated how it will react to a dispensary opening in its backyard.

GUSA members, administrators, students and representatives of architecture firm ikon.5 met Monday evening for an interactive planning for the Healey Family Student Center, slated to open in New South Hall in fall 2014.
Design principal for ikon.5 Joseph Tattoni and the university architect team presented the proposed layout of the student center, which will involve internal and external reconstruction of the ground floors of New South.
Externally, construction will create new entrances at the building’s northwest corner and the north courtyard and will necessitate revamped landscaping outside of the south entrance. In addition, the renovation will replace the existing brick with glass panels at the building’s east entrance to increase transparency.
“We want to reconnect the campus back to the river,” Tattoni said.
The new student center will also be completely accessible to disabled individuals, thanks to the addition of an elevator to the building’s west side and a promenade to the south side.
The lower level of the student center will serve the building’s administrative needs. Truck deliveries, security guard and traffic control will move to a service drive under the outdoor terrace.
“This is where trash dumping and storage will occur,” Tattoni said. “The lower level is not a very sexy plan.”
On the interior, the student center’s ground level will be organized around a central space resembling a living room that will include seating areas, a raised stage with a piano and projector and a central hearth fireplace. Other areas on the ground floor include a TV lounge, open workspaces with TV displays and glass wall paneling and a multipurpose room for events.
The first floor will hold practice rooms, dance studios and possibly an interactive media wall featuring content from student organizations. Center for Student Programs Director Erika Cohen Derr said that university officials were still debating whether to allow student organizations to personalize the wall.
“The east lobby is an opportunity to be more creative because it is a more intimate space,” Cohen Derrsaid. “We are working through this decision because it takes commitment to see if it will succeed or not.”
Student feedback centered on the architectural design and the pub-style restaurant’s seating and decor.
“Everything that the students have been saying has been constructive,” Tattoni said. “The comments today were more informative about how to enhance the space and make it more useful.”
Tattoni encouraged further community involvement in the next stages of planning, adding that the planning committee would hold one or two more events regarding furniture and other details.
GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Chandini Jha (COL ’16) agreed on the practicality of the interactive setting.
“I just appreciate that we’re having a forum to discuss this because it is really important to have student opinion involved,” Jha said. “The architects did a really good job of designing a space that we need on campus, which is for students to socialize and hang out … and I also really appreciate the environmental initiatives they presented.”
Though the plans remain in the developmental document stage, Tattoni said that he was hopeful that construction will begin this summer.
“We have another four months or so of development of the documents,” Tattoni said. “That’s all very good. That means a lot of exciting things will be happening this summer.”

Although a recent survey conducted by the Campus Life Working Group stated that the Department of Public Safety is now the Georgetown University Police Department, the name has not officially been changed, according to Chief of Police Jay Gruber.
“My interest is not to abruptly change the name of the department. … It takes a while to acclimate people to change,” said Gruber, who assumed his current post last July. “So many people are used to calling us the Department of Public Safety.”
But Gruber said that the references to DPS as “police” represent efforts to shape the department’s public image.
“We do university policing, so we want to focus the public’s attention to the fact that we are the university’s police department,” Gruber said. “I’m trying to focus attention on what our core responsibility is, which is policing the campus.”
Gruber, former assistant chief of police at the University of Maryland, said that the unofficial shift to the new name is partly an effort to distinguish Georgetown’s force from public safety departments at other universities, which also oversee such mandates as emergency management and environmental health and safety.
“We don’t do that here,” Gruber said. “We really just do university policing and all aspects of it from crime prevention to patrol work to working with students, staff and residence life halls.”
Even though Gruber says the department has not officially change its name, DPS is now being referred to as The Department of Public Safety/The Georgetown University Police Department in various forms of correspondence, like mass email notifications and public service announcements.
Ed Gilhool, associate director of the Office of Residential Life, said he did not know why the student life survey specifically mentioned that GUPD was previously known as DPS.
Some changes have been less subtle. In December, DPS purchased new squad cars that featured a “Police” logo as opposed to vehicles from the older fleet that say “Department of Public Safety.”
Despite the re-imaging campaign, Gruber indicated that the department’s core mission and responsibilities will not change.
“[The new name] doesn’t change how we do things, it doesn’t change why we do things, it doesn’t affect how we interact with the community,” Gruber said.

GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) were sworn into office Saturday afternoon by outgoing GUSA executives Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13).
Tisa, who is the university’s first openly gay student body president, was sworn in with the book “Taking a Chance on God” by John McNeill, a gay Jesuit priest. He said he chose the book because it redefines Catholicism in a way that affirms LGBTQ Catholics and other groups.
“I thought it had special significance at Georgetown, where our Catholic and Jesuit identity is a strong and crucial part of our heritage that can promote, rather than conflict with, our values of diversity, inclusion and the dignity of all members of our community,” Tisa said.
Tisa also acknowledged the challenges he expects to face as the second openly gay student body president of a Jesuit university.
“We’re going to face a lot of voices from on campus that haven’t been faced before,” Tisa said. “I have absolutely no fear and complete confidence in my team that we can rise to the occasion.”
Tisa outlined his administration’s major initiatives, which include the expansion of free-speech zones, measures to heighten awareness of sexual assault, improvements to workers’ rights, increased access to student space and a push for gender-neutral housing.
One of the first steps Tisa’s administration has taken is to add the position of secretary of D.C. relations to the Georgetown University Student Association to supplement the secretary of neighborhood relations.
“The D.C. relations person will take a wider scope and go out into the city government, keep an eye on what’s going legislatively and advocate for not just Georgetown students, but all college students in the D.C. area,” Tisa said.
Tisa identified the implementation of the final tenets of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, which mandates that the university house 90 percent of undergraduates on campus by fall 2025, as the largest challenge facing current students in the upcoming year.
“The new campus plan will bring changes for many students,” Tisa said. “I won’t sugarcoat it; especially off-campus life is going to get a lot harder, and we will be right there with you.”
He said the secretary of D.C. relations will help students address the challenge of the campus plan agreement.
“Things like the campus plan, we could have seen it coming from another way if we had someone at that level thinking in those terms,” Tisa said.
Tisa also explained his reasoning behind recruiting former rivals for the GUSA presidency, including Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), Shavonnia Corbin Johnson (SFS ’14) and Spencer Walsh (MSB ’14), to his executive staff.
“To me, the most remarkable thing about this campaign was not the differences between each of our platforms — though there were some significant ones — but the astoundingly large number of issues on which we all agreed,” Tisa said.
Both Tisa and Ramadan underscored the importance of uniting the students to accomplish their initiatives. Specifically, the duo distinguished two staff positions — director for GUSA outreach, a position included in Gustafson’s cabinet, and director for group outreach, a new position — that will facilitate greater engagement with the student body.
“Clara and Vail did a good job of GUSA outreach, but probably not enough to really touch all of campus,” Tisa said. “GUSA outreach is going to focus more on strategic objectives of top issues at a given time. Group outreach is more of maintaining permanent connection with groups to hear what they want from us.”
Ramadan spoke of his commitment to connect with the student body in alignment with Georgetown’s values.
“We are at a crossroad of our Jesuit identity and who we are as a school,” Ramadan said. “As a campus, we can drift away from tradition and just kind of wander off, or we can really reunite the fire, the passion, the community and service that have defined Georgetown for so long. I am extremely humbled and excited to get started to show how much I love this place in a way I haven’t been able to.”
Tisa commended Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount’s accomplishments over the past year, highlighting reforms to the Code of Student Conduct that raised the evidentiary standard from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing,” a push for on-campus sustainability, sexual assault risk reduction and increased discussion of diversity.
“We intend to move many of these initiatives forward during our administration and are humbled to accept the torch of executive leadership from their capable hands,” Tisa said.
Gustafson said she was optimistic about her successors’ agenda.
“I’m excited,” Gustafson said. “I think they’ve got a lot of momentum moving forward, and I think they’ll be able to keep it up and carry on a good fight.”

KIPP D.C., a network of charter schools in the District of Columbia, proposed plans last week for a new high school on the Randall Recreation Center site in Ward 6 that may include a clinic operated byMedStar Georgetown.
According to Knowledge Is Power Program D.C. Director of Real Estate Alex Shawe, KIPP andMedStar Georgetown University Hospital have been in preliminary discussions to collaborate on the development of a medical clinic at the new school. The university and KIPP formed a partnership in November to provide resources to students from the organization’s charter schools who matriculate at Georgetown. Shawe said that KIPP D.C. approached Assistant Professor Matthew Biel, the director of child and adolescent psychiatry at MedStar Georgetown Hospital, about a potential clinical partnership.
“We’d heard great things about him and so we reached out to see what’s possible,” Shawe said. “If we do consider a partnership, we only want to do it with people who have demonstrated that they are a best in class provider.”
Shawe said that MedStar Georgetown, which runs the Georgetown hospital but is not directly affiliated with the university, is the only non-KIPP entity considering the possibility of joining forces with the new campus.
KIPP currently operates some of the highest-achieving charter schools in the District and is looking to relocate its Douglass Campus high school in Ward 8, which shares the site with three other schools that serve children from pre-kindergarten to grade eight.
“As the program matures and enrollment has reached capacity, it’s become clear that that high school needs additional and space and its own campus,” Shawe said. “And because the high school serves children that come from all over the city, it’s important that that high school is located in a central location that is accessible from areas both east and west of the river.”
The proposed school, which would be located by South Capitol Street SE and I Street SW, is in close proximity to several Metro stations and accessible from both sides of the Anacostia River.
Shawe said that KIPP had been exploring potential locations for a new school for over a year and that the organization wanted an operational high school campus by summer 2014. However, Shawe noted that others may also be looking at the Ward 6 property.
“We think there’s going to be a competition for the site, that the city will lead a [request for proposal] process and that we’ll compete for it,” Shawe said. “If we’re fortunate to win the rights to build at the site, then we would go ahead and start construction.”
KIPP aims to open the school within a year of breaking ground if it wins the RFP. The project would cost approximately $40 million and be financed by tax-exempt bond issuances.
The proposed clinic would only take up about three percent of the total building, which will rest on the 8.5 total acres that make up the Randall site. KIPP plans to include a community center, pool and fields at the site.
Facing backlash from neighbors who see the school as potentially keeping out their children, KIPPemphasized the community aspect of its education program.
“We’re interested in establishing partnerships with neighboring elementary and middle schools, and we hope that those partnerships would result in a relationship that will make it known to those students that our high school is open enrollment,” Shawe said.
Although current KIPP eighth graders would have priority at the new high school, Shawe said that any child living in the District could apply to the new campus.
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 6D Commissioners David Garber and Ed Kaminski have expressed support for KIPP’s proposal, as have four D.C. Councilmembers, including Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) and Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3).
