The Georgetown Law Journal has named the first recipient of the Breonna Taylor Prize, a new award aimed at acknowledging student writing related to social justice issues.
Alden Fletcher (LAW ’20) was named the inaugural recipient of the prize for his student note publication, a style of submission written by first-year members of the law journal typically in their second year of law school. Fletcher’s piece discussed racial discrimination present in historic preservation laws, which stipulate that officially preserved spaces must retain aspects that convey historical significance.
The Breonna Taylor Prize was initially created by Orion de Nevers (LAW ’21), the journal’s 2020 senior notes editor, to highlight one student’s written publication on a particular area of social justice. The prize is just one section of the Georgetown Law Journal’s 2021 Diversity Amendment, which intends to promote greater diversity and inclusion practices at the journal, according to de Nevers.
“I wanted to do what I could to make the Georgetown Law Journal more focused on advancing social justice issues, and I also wanted to increase the diversity of our student authorship,” de Nevers said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Before creating the award, the journal previously evaluated student submissions using criteria such as the strength of the legal argument, effectiveness of the writing and value of the piece to the field. However, following the deaths of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd last year, the journal felt it was necessary to ensure that social justice was better reflected in its publication, according to de Nevers. 
“By creating the Breonna Taylor Prize, we are committing to at least once a year factoring the content of the piece into the way that we score it,” de Nevers said. “We are actively prioritizing work that advances social justice issues.” 
In addition to being published in an issue of the Georgetown Law Journal, the prize’s winner also has the opportunity to choose a social justice organization of their choice for a $500 donation from the journal for every volume. This year, Fletcher chose Empower D.C., a nonprofit organization that invests in community organizing for the District’s lowest income residents. On top of the journal’s $500 contribution, both Fletcher and Sam Aguilar, an attorney for Taylor’s family, matched the donation, totaling $1,500 donated to the organization, according to de Nevers.
The creation of the award prompts all members of the journal’s community to reflect on issues of representation in the legal field, according to Fletcher.
“It’s not only for Black students at Georgetown Law to be thinking critically about these areas,” Fletcher said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “The law school has historically catered to white male students, and I think folks who fit that description really should think critically about the systems that are in place that have contributed to that predominance.”
Fletcher’s awarded note focuses on the case study of Barry Farm, a historic neighborhood located in the Anacostia region of southeast Washington, D.C., that dates back to the Reconstruction era. The Freedmen’s Bureau, a government agency founded in 1865 after the Civil War to provide support for former Black slaves, established Barry Farm as a place where newly freed residents could receive public housing and buy homes. The neighborhood was later converted to a public housing development in 1941 by the D.C. government.
A predominantly Black community, Barry Farm faced systemic obstacles when residents attempted to invoke historic preservation law before the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board to protect their neighborhood in Jan. 2020. Current city regulations hold that to qualify for historic preservation, a place must include physical aspects that highlight the location’s historical significance, according to Fletcher’s note. 
These restrictions on historical preservation law should be removed to provide legal protection to a broader range of areas, including Barry Farm, according to Fletcher.
“This puts places that have suffered institutional and systemic neglect at a disadvantage compared to places that are much better resourced both in terms of money and societal capital and things like that,” Fletcher said. “In a society that is very entrenched in systemic racism, you can see how that will disadvantage places associated with non-white history instead of places associated with wealthy history.”
If the D.C. government were to expand development into the neighborhood, it would be ignoring the history and value that Barry Farm intrinsically holds, according to Fletcher.
“There is a tremendous amount of history and a tremendous amount of continuity there,” Fletcher said. “The D.C. government was essentially going to raze and redevelop it and put in a new mixed-income housing community.”
The journal’s emphasis on racial justice comes in the context of systemic racism at the Law Center. This month, a video clip of Georgetown Law adjunct professors Sandra Seller and David Batson showed Sellers complaining about the academic performance of the Black students in her joint negotiations class with Batson. The university community condemned Sellers’ and Batson’s actions and called on the university to initiate broader structural change to combat racism at the Law Center. 
Members of the Law Center community are excited about the journal’s steps to spotlight scholarship focused on social justice, according to Professor Cliff Sloan, a distinguished visitor from practice at the Law Center who filed a federal lawsuit alongside several other law firms for Kenneth Walker, Taylor’s boyfriend at the time of her death, one day before the anniversary of Taylor’s death.
“I think it’s really a terrific development that the Law Journal is doing,” Sloan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It’s part of what we hope is a national movement, that the tragedy of Breonna Taylor will spark concrete steps for racial justice and social justice and that by saying her name and honoring her life and memory, we will also be taking very important steps on the road to racial justice and social justice.”
Ultimately, the prize represents the start of the journal’s commitment to use its platform to advance social justice, according to de Nevers.
“The law is not neutral, and the positions that we take have real world consequences,” de Nevers said. “I hope the impact of this prize is that we will accept that responsibility and use it to advance the law in a more just way.”

Despite a recent surge in the elections of female politicians nationwide, social barriers that prevent women from becoming involved with politics remain pervasive, panelists said at a March 22 event featuring prominent women in government.
The Zoom event, titled “First, But Not The Last,” was co-hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and the Women’s and Gender Studies Program in honor of Women’s History Month. The event celebrated the historical milestones recently achieved by women in politics, including the inauguration of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the first female, Black and South-Asian individual to hold the office. The event was moderated by Donna Brazile, the first Black woman to run a major presidential campaign and an adjunct assistant professor in the WGST Program.
The event featured women who each had achieved historic firsts in their careers: Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), the first LGBTQ Native American elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, former Gov. Susana Martinez (R-N.M.), the first Latinx female governor in the United States, former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun (D-Ill.), the first Black woman elected to the senate, Del. Kathy Tran (D-Va.), the first Vietnamese American elected to office in Virginia, and former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman (R-N.J.), the first female governor of New Jersey. The panelists spoke about their advice for future female leaders and their experiences shattering glass ceilings, a metaphor for the idea that a woman can see an elite position but is unable to reach it because of societal barriers. 
The historical significance of these elections continues to be resonant and powerful, according to Davids.
“I feel like expectations about who runs for office and who gets elected and who gets appointed now have been getting reset time and time again,” Davids said at the event. “I feel very fortunate to have been part of that in the 2018 cycle and to watch it continue to happen over and over.”
While women comprise 51% of the U.S. population, they continue to be underrepresented at all levels of government, especially women of color, Republican women, young women and low-income women. At the federal level, women make up only 24% of the Senate and 27% of the House of Representatives in 2021, and there has yet to be a female president.
Despite the numerous obstacles women entering the political field face, a record number of women ran for office during the 2018 midterm elections and won, from Congress to governorships to state legislatures alike, following former President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election victory over Hillary Clinton, the first female major-party presidential nominee. 
It is important for women to seize any opportunity that comes their way, according to Tran, who was spurred to run for office after the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election left her worried for her children’s future. 
“Don’t wait for anyone to ask you, because you might not get asked,” Tran said. “I wasn’t asked to run, many of us weren’t asked to run, so if you’re even just thinking about it a little bit, the answer is yes.”
Progress towards increased female representation in politics comes from a long legacy of women who have challenged the status quo and run for office, according to Whitman.
“I wasn’t going to change who I was, so the woman part for me it just was what it was,” Whitman said. “It was challenging because there were lots of people who said, ‘I’ll never vote for a woman because she’s a woman.’”
The panelists also stressed the importance of having women’s voices represented in policy and politics. Decision-making has been left solely to men for far too long, and electing more women to government and leadership positions is the only way to make real change, according to Davids. 
“Unfortunately, we’ve had kind of a default set of experiences creating policy for a really long time,” Davids said. “Now we have this opportunity with so many new voices and diverse lived experiences in these decision-making positions.” 
Braun shared an anecdote about a time when a security guard did not want to let her into the U.S. Capitol, not expecting a Black woman to enter the building as a senator. While such incidents can be humiliating, they only reinforce the importance of representation to refute stereotypes about women in leadership, according to Braun. 
“You just have to show up and do your job, that’s number one,” Braun said. “It will make space for others, whether you think so or not.” 
While women have made huge strides in terms of representation in politics, there is still progress to be made until societal barriers are torn down enough the term glass ceiling will no longer be needed, according to Braun. 
“Culture leads and politics follows,” Braun said. “When you think about it, the fact is that the culture has evolved, so we should really celebrate how far we’ve come.”

The Georgetown Law Journal has elected its first openly undocumented editor in chief and appointed what is believed to be its most diverse class of editors to this year’s masthead.
The journal’s Volume 110 editorial team, led by Agnes Lee (SFS ’17, LAW ’22), consists of 59 law students appointed by Lee. As part of her responsibilities, Lee selected fellow staff members to fill the journal’s senior board, which includes managing editors, executive editors and other senior positions.
The makeup of this year’s editorial board demonstrates a marked difference in representation compared to previous years’ membership, according to Lee. 
“This year, just by seeing the faces in the Zoom room, we have significantly more people of color and Black and indigenous students in the room than we did in previous years,” Lee said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I will say that is not an incredibly high bar to jump over. Law reviews are historically male and very white spaces, but the membership is looking quite diversified relative to the years prior.”
Lee’s selections for this year’s senior board prioritized representation, according to Toni Deane (LAW ’21), last year’s editor in chief and the journal’s first Black editor in chief. During her tenure, Deane said her top priority was to ensure diversity among the authors, topics of scholarship and the members of the journal itself. These efforts for greater representation were reflected in this year’s class of editors, the most diverse class the journal has ever seen, according to Deane.
“It has already been a joy to see how much Agnes and her senior board have done in their short time leading the Journal and I cannot wait to see the strides that the Journal continues to make under her lead,” Deane wrote in an email to The Hoya. “She is a true gem, not only to the Journal, but to the legal field, and it would be a disservice if we did not listen to what she has to say.” 
Lee, as the fifth woman in a row to lead the journal, is carving a path for future leaders, according to Law Center Dean William Treanor.
“Her commitment to intellectual excellence that furthers the pursuit of justice is not just commendable, it is bound to be consequential,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As the first openly undocumented editor of our flagship journal, she is a trailblazer who I fully expect will open not only new avenues of legal discourse, but will open new pathways for other incredibly talented students to follow in her footsteps.”
In previous years, applicants to the journal were evaluated on their first-year grades and a written submission that provided analysis on a case. However, in recent years, the application process has been expanded to include a diversity statement, an essay in which applicants identify how their identity and personal experiences would contribute to the diversity of the journal, which can be submitted by students who meet a certain score threshold from their grades and case comment, according to Lee.
In addition to changing the application process, Lee said the journal has recently instituted a membership demographic survey to determine how to best serve its members. 
The journal’s changes attempt to respond to the historic lack of representation of students of color in its membership and grapple with the impacts of systemic racism in the United States. Last year, following the police murder of George Floyd, Georgetown Law Journal engaged in conversations with the editors in chief of eleven other journals at the Law Center, including The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics and The Georgetown Journal of International Law, to discuss the journals’ roles in perpetuating inequalities in the community, according to a September 2020 joint statement released by the journals.
Having a diverse board means the journal has the opportunity to portray the state of legal discourse and the legal system in a representative way, according to Jesus Rodriguez (SFS ’19, LAW ’22), the journal’s senior articles editor, who works with the EIC to oversee the article selection process. (Full disclosure: Rodriguez is a former managing editor for The Hoya and member of The Hoya’s Board of Directors). 
“I think what makes this board and this volume so special is the overwhelming diversity that we have been able to achieve since implementing some important tools and mechanisms to essentially reflect not just the diversity of the legal field itself but also the diversity of communities that are impacted or affected by the legal system,” Rodriguez said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
This volume’s senior editorial team shows how legal scholarship and critical discussion can include all voices, according to Eun Hee Han, an associate professor of law who taught Lee during her first year at the Law Center. 
“I think it sends a message that seems to be particularly needed at this point in time — that those of all backgrounds belong and can belong in the discourse of law,” Han said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
The new senior board will promote open-minded points of view in the journal’s publication, according to Han.
“The fact that they have diverse experiences might also mean as a practical matter that they are more open to scholarship that also discusses diverse experiences.” Han said. “I think that is an important step forward for the masthead of the premier journal for Georgetown to make or show.”
Since becoming editor in chief, Lee has felt pressure to serve as a representative for undocumented people in addition to fulfilling her responsibilities to the journal. While national coverage has focused on her identity as undocumented, Lee hopes to emphasize that she is only one person who is focused on highlighting the strengths and support of her new board, she said.
“I have tried to center myself so far by remembering what my job is, and my job is not to talk to media often or to present ourselves to the public consistently and prove my worth to the public,” Lee said. “But it is to support the members of GLJ, to support the authors and the scholarship that gets submitted to us and to be a safe and supportive house for all of the resources that get siphoned through us.”
This article has been updated to clarify Jesus Rodriguez’s involvement with The Hoya. An earlier version of the story said that Rodriguez was an executive editor for The Hoya. Rodriguez served as managing editor and a member of the Board of Directors.

Every Thursday night, Karran Royal sits down at her computer, logs onto Zoom and meets with fellow descendants of people enslaved by Jesuits in Maryland almost 200 years ago. In her free time, she films YouTube videos and writes social media posts to share with the descendant community.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, members of the GU272 Descendants Association and other descendants of the 272 enslaved people sold by Georgetown University in 1838 have been connecting through Zoom and have launched various social media platforms to build a community and foster support for each other.
The COVID-19 outbreak last March created an opportunity for descendants to connect virtually, according to Royal, who previously served as the executive director of the GU272 Descendants Association. 
“During the pandemic, I wanted to still be able to connect with descendants,” Royal said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I decided to create an online presence so that descendants can connect up with each other. Our main focus is connecting to this history and figuring out how we connect to each other. So we do a lot of reviewing of DNA connections and family tree connections, just to find out how we are connected to each other.”
The GU272 Descendants Association, a non-profit organization that works to support the descendants, has organized events for descendants to interact in the past, including a 2018 reunion that brought about 500 descendants together. While Royal is no longer employed by the association, she has continued to organize similar events in a virtual environment. 
Royal, who got involved with GU272 Descendants Association because of her and her husband’s connections to people enslaved by Jesuits in Maryland, wanted to use the relationships she built to help maintain and grow a sense of community. In July, after she had stopped working for the GU272 Descendants Association, Royal created social media accounts across various platforms, including Instagram, Twitter and Facebook to share resources with descendants, facilitate meetings and spread awareness to others. 
The social media accounts share news articles, information about Zoom calls and historical records and documents detailing the history of people enslaved by Jesuits.
“There are many twists and turns to the story of our . @JesuitEnslaved ancestors. The separation of families is vast. We know from where our DNA connections are leading us,” a March 21 tweet reads.
The group of descendants has uncovered several previously unknown facts about Jesuit enslavement in the United States, according to Royal.
“One of the things we found out about that we didn’t know prior to this is that the Jesuits had enslaved people in Kaskaskia, Illinois,” Royal said. “We knew about the Maryland ones, we knew about Missouri and Kentucky, but we didn’t know about Illinois.”
Jesuits from the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus sold 272 enslaved individuals, referred to as the GU272, to plantations in Louisiana in order to financially support the university in 1838. In the past several years, Georgetown students and community members have advocated for the university to provide reparations for the GU272 descendants to reconcile with the institution’s history of slavery. 
In a 2019 student referendum, students voted for the implementation of a $27.20 semesterly fee in student bills to be allocated to descendants. Despite the vote, university administrators announced later that year the university would instead establish a fund for GU272 descendants as opposed to implementing the $27.20 fee. Last week, the university announced the creation of The Descendants Truth & Reconciliation Foundation, which will distribute grants to fund descendants’ academic aspirations, support racial reconciliation programs across the United States and provide direct relief to impoverished, elderly and infirm descendants, according to the foundation’s website.
The university is working to foster further interaction between descendants of people enslaved by Jesuits and the Georgetown community through campus visits, events and research, according to a university spokesperson.
“Georgetown is committed to an ongoing process of dialogue and engagement with Descendants of the people enslaved by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This engagement has included meeting with Descendants in their hometowns and welcoming them to campus, group visits to historical sites, archival and genealogical research, and hosting and attending cultural events.”
Connecting with other descendants and gaining access to resources has allowed descendants to trace their family trees, which has been incredibly valuable, according to Kenneth Royal, Karran’s husband and a descendant of Isaac Hawkins, Biby Mahoney and Nace Butler, all of whom were among the slaves Georgetown sold.
“It’s been very interesting,” Kenneth Royal said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I never thought that I would be able to trace my dad’s family back as far as I have now with this new information we got.”
While Kenneth Royal has been able to identify his family tree, Karran Royal has not, she said.
“We have not identified my connection to the descendants of Jesuit slave ancestors,” Karran Royal said. “But my husband and I share some of the same Maryland cousins, some of whom are descendants, so this is probably just a matter of time before I figure my connection out.” Beyond the family history and the broader historical findings, the group has been able to connect in a very meaningful way, according to Karran Royal.
“It’s been really a sense of building community,” Royal said. “We’ve met these cousins a few times now, and now we get to continue to interact and talk to them, see them on a weekly basis. Some people are not even seeing their close family members that often. It’s just really a sense of community.”

Georgetown University has contributed funding to a new foundation that will fund racial healing programs and award scholarships to descendants of the 272 enslaved people sold to keep Georgetown open in 1838.
The foundation, titled the Descendants Truth & Reconciliation Foundation, was a collaborative effort created by descendant leaders and leaders from the Jesuit community. The university has already provided $1 million to the foundation, according to a March 16 community wide email from University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95). 
In 1838, Jesuits from the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus sold 272 enslaved people, referred to as the GU272, to plantations in Louisiana in order to financially support the university. In the past several years, Georgetown students and community members have advocated for the university to provide reparations for the GU272 descendants to reconcile with the institution’s history of slavery. 
The university began meeting with three members of the descendant community to discuss a reconciliation process in 2016, a year after DeGioia created a new working group on slavery. The meetings also followed student protests after the reopening of a building named after a former Georgetown president involved in the sale of enslaved people. 
Ultimately, the vision for the foundation came from the three descendant leaders involved in creating the foundation, including Joseph Stewart, Cheryllyn Branche and Earl Williams Sr., DeGioia wrote. 
“It became clear through the Dialogue process that the establishment of a shared vision for a Foundation was a first priority for Descendant leaders in the steps toward reconciliation,” DeGioia wrote in his email. “We sought to honor this commitment to dialogue between the Descendants and Jesuits and to provide support as we engaged in the work of confronting historical and present-day aspects of the history of enslavement and the lived experiences of members of the Descendant community.”
While the foundation will not provide direct reparations to descendants, it will distribute grants to fund descendants’ academic aspirations, support racial reconciliation programs across the United States and provide direct relief to impoverished, elderly and disabled descendants, according to the foundation’s website.
Of those funds, the foundation’s leaders have decided to distribute about half its annual budget to organizations engaging in racial reconciliation initiatives, with a quarter of the budget allocated to supporting educational opportunities for descendants through scholarships and grants, and a smaller portion to addressing the emergency needs of older and impoverished descendants, according to The New York Times. 
In recent years, students have pushed Georgetown to provide more support for GU272 descendants to reconcile with the university’s history. In a 2019 student referendum, two-thirds of students voted for the implementation of a $27.20 semesterly fee in students’ bills as a reparations fee to be allocated to descendants. University administrators announced later that year, however, that it would instead establish a fund for GU272 descendants instead of implementing the $27.20 fee. Georgetown will provide roughly $400,000 annually to this fund, which is separate from the Descendants Truth & Reconciliation Foundation, to help support community-based projects to benefit the descendant community, according to DeGioia’s March 16 statement.
The GU272 advocacy team could not be reached for comment by the time of publication.
Georgetown is set to begin distributing grants from its separate $400,000 fund by the end of this year, according to a university spokesperson.
“Our aim, working with members of our community and the Descendant community, is to provide our first grants this year,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will work with students, faculty, staff, alumni, and Descendants on nexts steps.”
Despite the foundation’s goals for reconciliation, some descendants are disappointed only 50% of funds will be distributed directly to the descendant community in the form of scholarships and direct aid. At least 50 to 75% of funds should instead be allocated to descendant education scholarships and grants, according to Karran Royal, one of the 10,000 descendants of the GU272 and the former executive director of the GU272 Descendants Association. 
The GU272 Descendants Association is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting the goals, objectives and aspirations of the GU272. The association was established and is operated by GU272 descendants.
Not only should more funding be allocated to descendants, but Jesuit leaders should not be involved with the board, according to Kenneth Royal, who is Karran’s husband, a descendant and a member of the GU272 Descendants Association.
“I don’t think it’s fair for the Jesuits to sit on a board and then say that half of the money we’re going to give to you, you’re going to have to use it to take care of a problem that you cause,” Kenneth Royal said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It makes no sense. All of this money should go for the descendant people. It’s just the way that everything was done, it just, this is not good. Not at all.”
However, by supporting racial reconciliation initiatives, the foundation will hold the Jesuit order accountable, according to Stewart, who was recently appointed as the president of the Descendants Truth & Reconciliation Foundation.
“We now have a pathway forward that has not been traveled before,” Stewart told The New York Times. 
In the long term, both descendant and Jesuit leaders aim for the foundation to raise $1 billion for descendants, according to Joseph Ferrara, Georgetown’s vice president and chief of staff. Ferrara represents the university on the foundation’s board.
“It was the Descendants’ powerful and transformative vision that drove the creation of the foundation,” Ferrara wrote in a March 15 news release from the university. “This is the beginning of a new and meaningful phase of work as we continue the journey, and we hope and believe that other institutions will join us in supporting the new foundation.”
Hoya Staff Writer Breandan Gibbons contributed reporting for this article.
Update: This article was updated March 26 to fix an incorrect statement that said that Georgetown would begin distributing grants from the Descendants Truth & Reconciliation Foundation by the end of this year. Georgetown will be distributing grants from its own separate $400,000 fund dedicated to support community-based projects that benefit the descendant community. 
Update: This article was updated April 16 to reflect the foundation is receiving funding from the university but was not created by the university.

This article directly references racist content that is potentially upsetting. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Many Georgetown University students and organizations are advocating for greater support of the Asian American Pacific Islander community at Georgetown University following last week’s shootings in Atlanta.
The March 16 shootings left eight dead, including six women of Asian descent, after a gunman entered three spas in the Atlanta area. To counter the rise in anti-Asian racism, several campus organizations have held discussions about anti-racism work, launched advocacy efforts and increased programming focused on Asian and Asian American students’ mental health and violence. 
The recent Atlanta killings exemplify the anti-Asian racism and xenophobia that is prevalent throughout the United States, especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a statement issued by the Georgetown University Asian American Student Association.
“These attacks occurred in a cultural and social environment that has fostered anti-Asian hostility,” the statement reads. “However, we must understand that anti-Asian racism is neither a new phenomenon nor is it exclusive to America, but rather it is mired in long standing, global imperial histories and the orientalist notion that Asians are perpetual foreigners in the West.”
Last week’s shootings in Atlanta coincide with a nationwide rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, which have increased by 149% between 2019 and 2020 in 16 of the largest U.S. cities. Anti-Asian rhetoric has also risen following the COVID-19 outbreak. 
The Georgetown Chinese Student Alliance has raised awareness and encouraged conversation through virtual discussions and shared testimonials to counter anti-Asian racism over the past year, according to Sonya Hu (COL ’22), co-president of the CSA. For instance, the CSA hosted a discussion about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine on mental health and the Chinese American community earlier this month. CSA is now creating a video highlighting student experiences with anti-Asian hate crimes and is working with other clubs to create a resource guide for API and AAPI students at Georgetown, Hu said. 
“Many of our partners are organizations that I would love to see supported, including AASA, which has been doing a lot of great work in supporting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in general and has also been increasing its discussions about issues surrounding violence towards these communities,” Hu said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Additionally, several Georgetown University Student Association senators released a statement March 14 expressing solidarity with the AAPI community following the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. GUSA prepared the statement before the Atlanta attacks and addressed anti-Asian racism as a systemic problem, not as a singular event, according to GUSA Senator Leo Rassieur (COL ’23), who drafted and signed the statement.
“This was already a deep-rooted problem that had happened to gain a lot of national news attention in the past couple weeks,” Rassieur said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I think it’s important to situate what we are doing right now in the context of the past year, of the past several decades, centuries, because it would be a disservice to the Asian American community to say that we are just responding to a certain day, when, in fact, we are not. There are years that we have to respond to and process and unpack.”
GUSA’s statement also supported the development of an Asian American studies program at Georgetown, which students have advocated for in recent years.
“The creation of Asian American studies program not only solidifies support for the AAPI community, but allows for there to be acknowledgement and celebration of their multifaceted community,” the statement reads. “Asian American studies program can be used to educate the student body, to set the stage for discourse on anti-racist rhetrioc and combat an over generalization of an extermmly diverse community.”
This semester, GUSA President Nile Blass (COL ’22) and Vice President Nicole Sanchez (SFS ’22) campaigned for the establishment of an Asian American studies program to support API and AAPI students and advocated for the permanent creation of an Asian American affinity space.
The efforts of Georgetown activists to create an Asian American studies program represent a yearslong student-led effort to develop more programs that expand cultural awareness, according to Onrei Josh Ladao (COL ’21), a member of the Georgetown University Asian-Pacific Islander Leadership Forum.
“Their call for Asian American Studies served as part of a broader call for Georgetown to begin valuing the rich cultural history and telling the stories of our Black, Latine, and Indigenous peers,” Ladao wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our work remains indebted to the groundwork established by Black student organizers and faculty who fought for the African American Studies major and department—now, the call remains to be attended to for its Asian, Indigenous, and Latine students.”
In 2016, the university announced the African American studies department and major. Georgetown has yet to establish an Asian American studies program or Latino studies program, which students have called for in a recent petition that has amassed over 150 signatures from students, graduates and clubs. 
The university is supportive of creating courses that reflect diversity and equity, and the engaging diversity core requirement encourages these values, according to a university spokesperson. 
“The Engaging Diversity Requirement prepares students to be responsible, reflective, self-aware and respectful global citizens through recognizing the plurality of human experience and engaging with different cultures, beliefs, and ideas,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We hope that by fulfilling the requirement, students will become better able to appreciate and reflect upon how human diversity and human identities shape our experience and understanding of the world.”
In solidarity with Georgetown’s AAPI community, the university plans to support all faculty, students and staff and will work to create an equitable campus environment, according to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
“In recent months, we have seen growing violence and hatred against our Asian American 
community in the United States,” DeGioia wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is deeply concerning to all of us. We are called to be in solidarity with our Asian American students, faculty, and staff–to affirm our care and support for one another and to continue our work, here at Georgetown, to sustain a community that is inclusive, welcoming, and respectful of people of all backgrounds.”
In their efforts to create an equitable environment, activists confronting anti-Asian racism must keep in mind intersectionality within the community, according to Nirvana Khan (SFS ’24), a GUSA senator who contributed to the released statement. 
“I know that South Asian women are definitely still fetishized and exotified, but personally I’ve faced a lot more dehumanization and being told I’m worthless and kind of masculinized. But East Asian women kind of experience the reversal of that. They’re seen as submissive. They don’t have the autonomy that they should be afforded,” Khan said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
The shootings have sparked a nationwide discussion about the misogyny Asian and Asian American women uniquely face. The shooter, police and many media outlets have attributed the killings to the killer’s “sex addiction” and mental health, which has come under criticism from activists and political leaders. 
This reasoning exemplifies fetishization of Asian and Asian American women and fails to address the racist and misogynistic structures that contributed to the shooting, according to Khan.
“When it comes to fetishization, it strips Asian women of their autonomy and of their humanity, and it makes them sex objects,” Khan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “You can’t see someone as a temptation unless you already don’t see somebody as human.”
Although AAPI student organizations are leading the efforts to spread awareness and improve representation in academia, combating anti-Asian sentiment requires the participation of allies, according to Khan. 
“I want to encourage people to keep listening, keep going to events that people host on campus, keep going to Zooms, keep signing petitions and joining advocacy groups even after the pandemic because racism against AAPI isn’t going to go away,” Khan said.

“You can’t see someone as a temptation unless you already don’t see somebody as human.”
This sentence exemplifies the inanity of the discussion surrounding the entire issue of “hate crime” and identity ideology generally. Not only is it wrong, it’s illustrative of anti-intellectual non-think. A person’s humanity is central to his or her appeal in cases of “temptation”. This killer had sexual problems compounded by mental instability, and his previous experiences at Asian massage businesses led him to lash out against them. The crime is brutal and horrible enough without it being used for political gain, which trivializes the act and detracts from it’s importance.

When Georgetown University students left campus March 6 for spring break, they could have never anticipated the next year would be dominated by virtual courses, club meetings and social interactions. 
Georgetown ordered all classes to be conducted virtually starting March 16, 2020, shortly after the World Health Organization officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.
The beginning of virtual learning last spring was particularly difficult for many professors and students, as the virtual environment felt unnatural and very different from in-person instruction, according to Laurie King, associate teaching professor in the department of anthropology.  
“Maybe the first month of doing Zoom classes, after every class I would be so incredibly exhausted,” King said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “I think it’s partly Zoom fatigue, but also I think just the anxiety of having to teach in this new format, in this new modality, and worrying about whether it was going to work.”
Over the summer, Georgetown’s Center for New Designs in Learning & Scholarship offered courses designed to prepare professors for virtual teaching in which 1,900 faculty members participated.
The CNDLS programming was helpful for professors to better understand specific Zoom features and develop alternative virtual teaching methods, according to King. 
While students and professors have gotten more comfortable using Zoom, spending so much time online over the past year has been challenging, according to Genevieve Domenico (SFS-MSB ’23), who has lived at home since the transition to online learning last year.
“Human beings are not meant to sit in front of a screen all day looking at people’s faces,” Domenico said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Zoom fatigue is real.”
While students have tried to maintain a sense of community through online club meetings and campus organizations, these events can contribute to Zoom fatigue, according to Domenico.
“I joined one to two clubs this semester, but I feel like the ones I did join were community oriented because I was looking to stay in touch with the Georgetown community and potentially meet new people,” Domenico said. “It is just another Zoom to go to at the end of the day.”
In addition to Zoom fatigue and social disconnect, the pandemic has brought additional stresses to many international students who faced uncertainty about visa applications and were forced to take virtual classes with large time zone differences. 
For international students, varying time zones mean classes might be held anytime throughout the night, according to Theodore Chia (SFS ’23), who was living at home in Singapore until this semester. 
“I think I kind of burned out once fall hit because of the difference in time zone, the amount of club activities that were happening and things that were happening in Singapore as well,” Chia said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I think it was quite unsustainable, so I think midway through the semester I just burned out. I just didn’t do very well for the rest of my academics.”
This semester, Chia moved back to Georgetown’s campus, where he is able to complete his schoolwork without concerns about a time difference. Life at Georgetown is not the same as it was before the transition to virtual learning, however, according to Chia. 
“The biggest challenge has been interaction in my studies. I think it’s kind of sad that a lot of my friends are going to be graduating a year or a semester early, and it’s also making me wonder whether I want to stay in Georgetown for the full four years,” Chia said. “I’m not really sure whether four years is still worth it at Georgetown anymore.”
For other students, however, living on campus has provided access to different study locations and allowed for a more normal routine, according to Jennifer Linares (COL ’23), who has been living on campus since the fall.
“It’s definitely been beneficial, being able to have space where I know is my school space and having access to the library,” Linares said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Being able to have a normal routine that I didn’t really have at home has allowed me to focus a lot more than I was able to at home.” 
When the university closed last March, Linares moved back home to Miami, Fla., where she found it very difficult to focus on her schoolwork. When Linares applied for on-campus housing for the fall, she was originally denied before later being accepted and said she was concerned about living at home until the university brought all students back.
“It was really, really hard. At that time my mom was working at home, so it was just a lot of noise, and I could not really concentrate,” Linares said. “I do feel that, to a certain extent, professors were a little bit more lenient than they would have been if we had continued normally, but I do think that’s changed.” 
For first-generation and low-income students, the experience of virtual learning during a pandemic differs from other students’ experiences with additional resources, according to Linares. 
“It’s tough, and I feel like someone who doesn’t come from that kind of background can just say, ‘Ok, I will just take a gap semester, and we will see what happens,’” Linares said. “Whereas that’s not really an option for low-income students.”
For seniors, continuing in a virtual learning environment this academic year has been especially challenging, according to Lily McGrail (COL ’21), who studied abroad during the fall semester of her junior year, leaving her with limited time on campus before the university shifted to a remote setting.
“I was only on campus for less than two month before we went virtual,” McGrail wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I can’t believe my last two years at Georgetown were just two months of being on campus.”
In addition to missing their final year on campus, seniors will also miss out on in-person commencement ceremonies. The university plans to hold all commencement ceremonies virtually this year, though campuses are currently working to develop small, in-person events for graduating students if public health conditions allow, according to a March 23 email from University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
To retain some normalcy, many Georgetown students have moved into the neighborhoods surrounding campus. Some have also moved into Washington, D.C. hotels, which have become dorm-like buildings for some first-year students. McGrail and her roommate rented an apartment to be close to campus for their final year at Georgetown, which has helped them feel less isolated, she said.
“It makes a world of difference to see friends in person, albeit socially distanced,” McGrail wrote. 
While students are facing unique difficulties, many have one thing in common: a shared desire to safely return to normalcy in the fall and a burnout from virtual learning, according to Linares.
“It’s really, really harsh. I feel like you never even get a break or a day off because if you’re not in class, you’re doing work on your computer, or if you’re not doing anything school related, you’re in a club meeting,” Linares said. “I think it’s really problematic to kind of hold all students to a high standard when a lot of them just are at home and just need a break.”

Growing up, Amanda Yen (COL ’23) spent the ride to school hunched over her notebook in the back seat of the car, scribbling down stories that filled the pages. Her passion for writing endured, and now one of her pieces is included in an anthology of fiction for young adults. 
Last fall, Yen received an email from the Canyon Crest Academy Writers’ Conference, an annual gathering of high school students from across San Diego County, Calif., founded in 2012 to help students write, publish and produce written work, calling for short story submissions. Yen sent in a sample of a 250-word piece of flash fiction she started working on when she was 17. The piece was accepted and published in “The Sky’s The Limit,” an anthology of stories for young adults.
The piece, titled “We’re Not Like Those People,” is set in the suburbs of California in the 1970s and is told from the perspective of a suburban housewife who is confronted with questions about her own cultural assimilation as a child after a family of Chinese immigrants moves next door, according to Yen.
“It sort of captures threads of ‘What is the American dream, what is the American melting pot?’” Yen said. “Those are the kinds of key themes and cultural messages that I was really interested in.”
After three years away from the piece, Yen was first reminded of her story when she was assigned to write a cultural text for a final project at Georgetown University in her “Origins and Identities” course, a part of her American studies major. As she was growing up, writing was a side hobby, but Yen saw the project as an opportunity to do something more with her passion. 
“All my creative writing has sort of happened on the side,” Yen said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It would be one night: I would just start writing a piece, and then I would put it away for a while.” 
For Yen, long-form creative writing serves as a way to explore her own experiences and her family’s history, half of which has lived in the United States for generations and the other half for much less time in her stories. Writing is also an opportunity to incorporate learning in the classroom with life experiences, according to Yen. 
In the years since she was 17, Yen’s new experiences and perspectives helped her reshape the piece to draw on her Asian American family members’ experiences as immigrants to the United States. Revisiting the story two and a half years after its initial conception was exciting and revealing, according to Yen.
“I’m almost 20, and I have sort of a different perspective on the time period that I’m writing about and a different perspective on what it is to be Asian American, because that is one of the major themes of racial identity that I tried to capture in this piece,” Yen said. 
The collection of short stories that features Yen’s piece includes both original work and reprints from bestselling authors, including science fiction and fantasy writer Greg van Eekhout and young adult sci-fi and fantasy author and editor Stephanie Diaz. The anthology, published Feb. 21, commemorates the 10th anniversary of the CCA Writers’ Conference. 
All proceeds from the anthology’s sales will go to Village of Promise, a San Diego County nonprofit that supports middle and high school students who have at least one incarcerated parent, according to a Facebook post by CCA Writers’ Conference. 
Reading Yen’s work in a publication was exciting for her peers, because it was a chance to see something that had once been classwork published for a broader audience, according to Olivia Duff (COL ’23), a student in Yen’s American Studies cohort at Georgetown. 
“The interdisciplinary and individualized nature of our major encourages thinking outside the box and taking risks wherever possible, so it is no surprise that Amanda’s piece is brilliant,” Duff wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Now that Yen has seen her work published, she hopes to continue to write creatively and encourages other young writers to submit their own work. 
“Just keep writing, and don’t be afraid to put your writing out there,” Yen said. “It’s easier to not submit a call for applications than it is to actually get your act together, put something together and put it out there. So, I would say, believe that your writing is worth it.”
