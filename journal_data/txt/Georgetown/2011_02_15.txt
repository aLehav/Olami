The number of handguns owned in the District’s affluent communities, including Georgetown, has jumped in the last two and a half years.
Since the Supreme Court repealed the ban on handguns in D.C. in 2008, more than 1,400 handguns have been registered in the city. More than half of these registrations have been in western D.C. — 300 of the guns were registered in Georgetown and other wealthy communities such as Palisades and Chevy Chase.
Sam Brothers (COL ’14), lobbying director for the College Democrats was not surprised by rising number of handgun owners in affluent areas, particularly in Georgetown. He said that he is not personally opposed to gun ownership and has even been hunting.
“Responsible gun ownership should not be forbidden,” he said. “It’s really about the best way to implement gun ownership”.
Brothers said that although all members of the College Democrats identify themselves as members of the national Democratic Party, which supports gun control laws, members have differing opinions and sometimes disagree over policy.
Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), president of the College Democrats, said that with the lift of the ban, new legislation should be put in place.
“For most people, their opinions have a lot to do with where they’re from or their experiences,” she said. “Obviously Democrats are for common sense gun control policy, regardless of the laws. Since [the law] was lifted and guns are now allowed, some kind of gun control policy needs to be in place”.
Joseph Knowles (COL ’12), chairman of the College Republicans, also said that there is a variety of opinions among and within the political groups at Georgetown. But he strongly emphasized the importance of the Second Amendment and the failure of gun control. Knowles said that the leniency of the gun control laws increases the safety of D.C. neighborhoods.
“It just keeps the community more protected,” he said.

This spring some Georgetown students might reach Internet fame and explore the full scope of the Web’s capabilities before they even graduate.
The Georgetown University Lecture Fund will be hosting a TEDx conference on campus on March 23. “Netcetera, Internet and Everything Else” will focus on the relationship between the Internet and some unexplored aspects of its impact on society.
TED — a nonprofit organization that holds annual conferences at which innovators give brief talks about their ideas — inspired the TEDx branch, which attempts to recreate that creative, technologically-minded environment around the world.
Several Georgetown professors have already agreed to speak at the event, including Mike Nelson, a visiting professor of communication, culture and technology; Paula Newberg, the director of Georgetown’s institute for the study of diplomacy; and Pablo Molina, the chief information officer for Georgetown’s Law Center.
Molina, an associate vice president of Georgetown and a graduate professor in the technology management program, got involved with the conference at the suggestion of Nelson, who is the designated ‘TEDxpert’ and faculty adviser.
“When Michael Nelson calls or emails, you know that something interesting is about to happen,” he said in an email. “In this case, it is TEDx Georgetown.”
Molina will be giving a talk entitled “The Internet and Virtual Aliens” about the relationship between the Internet and immigration.
“[Nelson] challenged me to come up with something creative, something that I liked to do with the Internet,” he said. “My talk, on the Internet and virtual aliens, will combine two of my favorite pastimes: using Internet technology and being an immigrant.”
Professors and students said that they are very excited about the conference. Frank Miller (COL ’14) first learned of TED events when researching for a high school history class. As a linguistics major, he is hoping to hear talks about the symbiotic effects between the Internet and modern language.
“I just can’t wait for them to come here,” he said. “I have wanted to go to a TED event ever since I heard about it in 2008.”
The Lecture Fund is also holding a student speaker contest to determine which Georgetown students will have the opportunity to address the attendees and then have their talks published on the greater TED website, where they will virtually reside alongside talks by Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) and Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The resulting videos could receive over a million views, according to Ceyda Erten (SFS ’13), the conference’s committee chair.
“We are looking for vibrant students whose lecture offers a new, fun, weird, exciting or innovative perspective to the subject matter,” Erten said.
The application closes Feb. 16

An upcoming study will allow university researchers to examine Lauinger Library through a new lens.
The library’s administration has commissioned a group of staff members to document the activity on the building’s second and third floors through still pictures. Photographs will be taken hourly on two randomly chosen days of the month. The images will be taken from specifically marked areas so that researchers can track the use of those areas for a span of time over the next few months.
The examination will allow the staff to suggest improvements to the library, which will then likely be implemented fairly soon according to Stephanie Clark, director of Planning and Assessment,
“[Administrators are] trying to determine the best use of the space we have currently and for the foreseeable future,” Clark said. “The current photo study research will help us determine what incremental improvements we can make now.”
The changes could range from rearranging books or periodicals to adding significant amounts of seating she said.
Clark added that researchers will use the photographs to observe how much time people spend in certain parts of the library, as well as the ways in which they utilize library resources. She said that the data collected from the photo study will eventually be examined alongside the results from past surveys.
“The purpose of this project is to document how specific spaces in Lauinger are being used at different times of the day as well as different times during the semester,” Clark said.
Clark said that leaders of the study specifically intended that images be taken on the second and third floors of the library. The building’s main entrance, off of Healy Lawn, opens onto the third floor, which also houses the reference stacks and the circulation and reserves desk. On the second floor, patrons can find bound periodicals, theses and newspapers. Both levels feature quiet areas, group meeting rooms and technological resources to assist students.
By examining the variety of space available on these two floors, researchers can begin to reconfigure the layout of the library at-large, she stated. The study is not officially connected with the structural renovations proposed in the recently released 2010 Campus Plan. In 2008, the library employed a group of professional advisers and architects to study the possibility of adding physical space to the building.
Yet, the goal of the new study is not only to determine how students study inside the walls of Lauinger, but how they socialize inside it as well.
Clark said that the photographs from the second floor, where the Corp’s student-run coffee shop, The Midnight Mug, is located, will be used to see how students interact. Though photographs will not be taken inside The Midnight Mug itself, the sitting area outside its doors will be documented on film.

Not just the tech-savvy take to the blogs at Georgetown.
Required blogging has made its way into a number of classes in recent years, as professors find greater value in establishing a discussion forum outside of the classroom.
There are approximately 50 course blogs in operation this semester, according to the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship. That number has remained fairly stable for the past few years.
According to English professor Eddie Maloney, managing director and director of research and learning technologies at CNDLS, a course blog can provide the same intellectual opportunities for students that reading journals used to offer — the medium can give them time to mull over material.
“Depending on how you use it, it actually gets students to write about their experience with the material in class, and in that writing, they start to reflect and formulate thoughts that they may not have any other opportunity to do,” he said.
Much of Georgetown’s blogging is done through Digital Commons, a blogging program that allows professors to set up password-protected forums that can be accessed only by students in the class. At the professor’s discretion, the blog can be made public as well, though Maloney says that professors should inform their students if they plan to do so.
“If [the blogs] are private, and they are set up to be private, and the students know that, then the expectation is that they will remain private,” Maloney said. “But this is something to ask. If you are going to be asked to put something online, you should know whether or not it is going to be public or private.”
For students concerned about potential employers accessing the site, Maloney said that outside readers would have a hard time getting past the login page on a protected blog.
“Within reasonable precautions, no one is going to gain access to this. Your employer is not going to gain access. They would have to do something illegal to do so,” he said. “You may not want to work for them if that’s what’s going on.”
So far, the university has never encountered a case where a private blog was made public without student consent. But last year, due to a computer glitch, the blog entry of Caitlin Gilbert (COL ’13), now a columnist for The Hoya, was broadcasted to everyone in the system after a developer activated an email setting without fully testing the program first.
Gilbert said that though the content was not private, her inbox was flooded with complaints.
“The worst part was that my inbox started getting full of a bunch of people who thought they were on some sort of Listserv,” she said.
Maloney said that the glitch was resolved and that setting was disabled.
“It was a serious mistake,” he said. “Fortunately, the student’s post was entirely pleasant.”
Since then, the system has not experienced a similar mishap.
Professors, for the most part, have been pleased with the blogs, which many say provide a good way to go over any surface level discussions before the group meets. That way, students can plunge into deeper material during classtime. According to assistant professor Benjamin Bogin of the theology department, students often churn out in-depth writing online, then delve even deeper in class.
“In general, the quality of the writing is quite high,” he said.
Associate professor and co-director of undergraduate stories Mark Rom of the government department has also been a major proponent of classroom blogging, and he highlighted its benefits in a presentation at University Provost James O’Donnell’s Seminar for Teaching and Learning last year. He argues that the blog not only fosters discussion, but also gives a voice to otherwise quiet students.
“Some of my most active bloggers are those who don’t speak up in class,” Rom said in his presentation.
Rom said that he hopes that his blog will allow students, especially those who may be shy, to speak up freely in a relatively safe environment. For Haley Cottrell (COL ’14), however, that approach may create more problems than it solves.
“It’s like word vomit on the Internet,” she said of the blogs.
Cottrell, who blogs for Rom’s U.S. Political Systems course, believes that blogs actually combat good, analytical work rather than foster it.
“Journals are for feelings, and legitimate publications are for scholastic and political writing,” she said in an email. “Combining the two, although it does encourage people to be politically active, results in an awkward combination of both.”
Initially, students tend to push back against the requirement, but Maloney says that this original response is usually a reaction to the workload rather than the requirement itself.
“We’re all like this — when you get into a class and you see that you are going to have regular, required writing, it feels onerous,” Maloney said. “It’s not something you want to do, and initially you are going to act negatively to it.”
By and large, though, students seem to react fairly well to the academic aspect of the blogs, with many saying that the requirement forces them to think through material in a way that they might not have otherwise.
“I do believe that [blogging] makes us analyze information more critically and apply our class learning to real current events,” Mariana Santos (COL ’12) said.
Maloney explained that, with time, he has found that most students come around to the idea that the blog is helpful, and many even find it to be a key aspect of their coursework. The blogs, he explained, make students feel more connected with professors as well, a claim that he can vouch for personally. Since he began incorporating blogging into his classes, Maloney has been asked to write a much greater number of recommendation letters than before.
“It takes, I think, an entire semester for many people to think that this is a valuable part of your learning experience,” he said.

A new faculty pay plan that aims to make professors’ salaries more competitive was launched this fall, capping off a 10-year development process.
Crafted by Faculty Senate President and philosophy professor Wayne Davis, the framework calls for a 4 percent annual increase in the faculty salary pool. The higher annual salary raises will reward faculty based on teaching quality, research and service to the university. The merit-based structure is set to take effect on July 1, University President John J. DeGioia said at a faculty townhall on Feb.3.
“The goals of this plan are to provide adequate funds to advance continuing faculty as they do their teaching and research and make our salaries more competitive with our peer schools,” Davis said.
To develop a plan, Davis analyzed university economic data for over a decade. In his research, he found that Georgetown faculty salaries tended to be 17 percent lower than those at peer institutions. Salary compression was also a problem — while starting salaries are usually competitive, veteran faculty members’ salary hikes are not high enough.
“You get a situation where starting faculty might make almost the same salary as full professors,” Davis said.
University Provost James O’Donnell added that compensation can attract faculty who might otherwise opt to teach at other colleges or universities.
“The key thing is that we are committed to doing our best to pay our faculty competitively so that we can recruit and retain faculty of the highest quality in an increasingly competitive market,” O’Donnell said in an email. “Bringing together the best faculty with the best students is the core of our life as a university, so faculty salaries and student financial aid are two of our very highest strategic priorities.”
The funds for the salary increases will come from tuition — which will climb by 2.9 percent next year — and from salary “recycling,” through which the higher salaries no longer paid to retired professors are used both for the lower salaries of associate professors and for the faculty salary pool.
“It’s … an improvement over the previous plan because it calls for raises in compensation for faculty when they are promoted to associate or full professor and also puts aside additional funds for truly exceptional faculty merit,” Terrence Reynolds, theology department chair, said in an email.
Davis presented his data to the Main Campus Planning Committee, a group consisting of all the deans, some student representatives and faculty members. The committee drafted the plan in the spring of 2010.
While Davis led the project, other participating faculty members involved audited the plan, according to economics professor Robert Cumby, lead faculty member on the MCPC.
“[Davis] really did the bulk of the research, and we provided input, provided questions and reviewed the practices proposed in the plan,” he said. “We asked the question of whether these are the kinds of disciplines around hiring we want to adopt.”
The pay scheme was approved by the MCPC on Oct. 5 and unanimously approved by the Main Campus Executive Faculty on Oct. 22.
“There were initially some reservations, but the overwhelming sentiment was: ‘This is better than we expected given the economic situation,'” Cumby said. “The plan respects the university’s financial situation. … It is a very clearheaded and responsible plan.”
In addition to providing more funds for salary increases, the new policy accounts for necessary salary increases because of inflation over the next five years.
“In the previous plan, the annual merit increase rate was set based on the previous year’s inflation rate, … which made it difficult for the university to plan for salary increases,” Davis said.
The inclusion of expected inflation rates in the plan allows the university to better outline its budget allotment for faculty pay, according to Cumby.
“It’s good planning and budgetary practice to have a sense of where we’re going and what the implications of that are, so that management and budgeting are more closely aligned,” he said. “Overall, I think it reflects really well on the really thorough analytics that [Davis] brought to the table and the administration’s commitment to paying competitive salaries.”

Metropolitan Police Department officers identified 14 underaged drinkers, mostly Georgetown students, in the popular bar Third Edition shortly after midnight on Friday.
According to Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner and Representative to the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Bill Starrels, those identified had used false identification, but he was unsure whether or not any arrests were made.
While the university’s Department of Public Safety was not involved in the operation, the names of students charged with underage drinking and use of false identification were reported to the university, according to Associate Director of DPS Joseph Smith.
Starrels said that D.C. area university students in general were the focus of the MPD bust, even if the majority were from nearby Georgetown.
“Thirds is an easy target for many college students, not just from Georgetown,” he said. “Georgetown students weren’t the only ones in the establishment at the time, but most of them were.”
According to an affected student who wished to remain anonymous due to the legal implications of her case, police officers were inside Third Edition asking patrons for their IDs.
She said she was approached by an officer asking for the identification she had presented when requesting entry into the establishment. The officer told the student that if she did not want to be arrested, then she needed to provide information about where she had obtained the identification. The officer then asked the student for her campus address and cell phone number when she could not provide the source of her fake ID.
A second student in Third Edition Thursday who also wished to remain anonymous had a similar experience. A male police officer in plain clothes approached her and asked to see her ID. He threatened to arrest her if she did not cooperate. He did not ask where she had obtained her false identification, but did ask her where she was a student.
Neither student has heard from MPD or the university about the incident.
One Third Edition patron admitted to obtaining false identification from a China-based website, Id Chief, according to the DCist.
According to Starrels, Third Edition may face penalties after a hearing before the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration.
Starrels said that Third Edition will most likely be punished with a suspension of its liquor license, as has occurred in the past. He added that while previous suspensions of the license have occurred on weekdays, Third Edition would most likely have its license suspended on a weekend this time around, significantly impacting business.
Starrels indicated that the establishment was at fault and any punishment will be justified.
“Obviously students were wrong to be going in there to drink, but there is a responsibility by the establishment to do what it takes to keep a young person out of there,” Starrels said. “It’s been suggested multiple times by the ANC that they ask for two IDs automatically.”
The Office of Student Conduct, MPD, the ABRA and Third Edition could not be reached for comment.

Still rolling after 10 years, GUTV’s annual film festival is seeking to boost its presence on campus this year with free admission and more submissions.
When the film festival premiered in 2001, there was not much of a film presence on the Hilltop. The founders hoped it would provide a forum and outlet for students to express themselves through creative filmmaking, according to Minjoon Kim (MSB ’12), who is chairing GUTV’s upcoming 2011 Film Festival.
In the first few years following its creation, student films flowed in at the rate of 30 to 40 submissions per year. However, interest has begun to dwindle, and the festival only received seven or eight submissions in 2010.
“I suspect that it probably had to do with the ticket prices, which I’m committed to taking away this year,” Kim said. “We’re not going to be charging for tickets anymore.”
In the past, ticket prices ranged from $5 to $7 for both nights of screenings. Students who submitted films in the past were not excluded from the ticket prices and had to pay to see their own work screened at the festival.
“If you want to attend these events but you can’t, you lose that initial interest, and it’s that much more difficult for us to capture that again in future years,” Kim said.
“The film festival is supposed to be a forum where people with different strengths can meet people with interest in film,” Kim said.
In previous years, the festival served as an arena for student filmmakers to collaborate, including Brit Marling (COL ’05), Mike Cahill (COL ’01) and Zal Batmanglij (COL ’02). Collectively, the trio was featured at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival for two films: “Another Earth” and “Sound of My Voice.”
The festival is being revamped to revive the Hilltop’s film tradition. The number of submissions for the 2011 festival has already surpassed last year’s number. Kim mentioned that there is a wealth of resources available for aspiring filmmakers, including production equipment rentals and tutorials offered through the Gelardin New Media Center at Lauinger Library.
“There’s really just no better time to help make film a more prominent presence here at Georgetown” said Kim.
This year’s festival will run from Friday, April 8 to Saturday, April 9. Categories include short films, feature-length films and documentaries. The 2011 festival will also boast the categories of animation, audio documentaries and music videos.
There is no fee to enter, and submissions are due by March 25.

Fr. John F. Martin, S.J., a beloved member of the Georgetown Jesuit community, died Sunday at a hospice care center at the age of 68.
A Jesuit for the last 50 years, Martin originally taught theology at Georgetown from 1974 to 1976. After serving on the Archdiocesan Tribune in Washington, D.C. and then as a canon law professor at Regis College in Toronto, Canada, he returned to Georgetown in 1997. He then became an integral member of the campus community as a canon law consultant, campus minister and ardent fan and chaplain for the women’s basketball team and the men’s football team.
“Fr. Martin was a huge supporter of the team as well as many teams here on campus,” women’s basketball Head Coach Terri Williams-Flournoy said. “He was a fan that stood by us through the tough times and the good ones. We will remember him for always believing in what we are trying to do here at Georgetown, both in the classroom and on the court.”
Martin was going to be named the women’s basketball team’s honorary coach for the University of Connecticut game, a crucial matchup for Georgetown against one of the best teams in the country.
“We appreciated Fr. Martin’s constant support,” senior guard Monica McNutt said. “He was supportive when things were not so good and was one of our biggest fans before we began to get national recognition. Our prayers are with his family, those close to him and the Georgetown community.”
She added that his presence would be missed by more than just the players.
“The coaches, players and staff will miss having him at the end of our bench,” she said.
Fr. Thomas Buckley, S.J., a Jesuit classmate and close friend of Martin’s, noted Martin’s ever-present spirit.
“Fr. Martin, along with being an enormously bright person, was very patient. He had suffered a lot through his life, but he always presented an interested face to people,” Buckley said. “Georgetown really lit the fire in John.”
Buckley also mentioned his frequent strolls around campus with Martin, who had been wheelchair-bound for the past five years but still enjoyed observing on-campus happenings.
“He loved life and he was a true believer. He was a faithful son of Ignatius,” Buckley said.
Martin’s wake will be held in Wolfington Hall, the Jesuit Residence, on Wednesday from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. His funeral will be at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday in Dahlgren Chapel.

A new museum focusing on national diversity may be added to the Smithsonian Institution in the District. A coalition of 131 organizations, representing over 50 ethnic, racial and minority groups, is gathering support to build the National Museum of the American People.
The exhibits would tell the story of the American “melting pot,” focusing on immigration and migration, from the development of Native American culture to immigration in the 21st century, according to the website of the Coalition for the National Museum of the American People. The museum would focus on the identities of immigrants, why they came to the U.S., what happened to them when they arrived and how their cultures and existing U.S. culture have changed as a result.
Boston College professor of history Kevin Kenny, one of over 50 professors and scholars worldwide who have voiced support for the project, believes that the National Museum of the American People would provide college students with a sense of American diversity and commonality.
“The museum has the potential to explore inclusion and exclusion, acceptance and discrimination, racism and assimilation, in a way that reveals the limitations but also the radical potential of American democracy,” he said in an email.
Glenn Ojeda (SFS ’14), said he was in favor of the museum because he believes that a nation of immigrants should seek its common humanity.
“If we come a bit closer, we can see that those alleged differences are not as big,” Ojeda said.
Similar to the style and presentation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Coalition for the National Museum of the American People envisions an approach that follows a timeline, combining artifacts with a variety of media, according to the organization’s website. The website states that the coalition also wants the museum to include the National Genealogical Center, a database of genealogical information that would utilize a DNA contribution program, available to visitors and internet browsers. Another planned project is the Center for Advanced Studies of the American People, which would publish and sponsor scholarly work, according to the website.
The proposed project is similar to museums that already exist in other North American countries; Mexico’s National Museum of Anthropology and the Canadian Museum of Civilization also tell the stories of individuals that settled their lands.
“Americans do not have a comprehensive and accurate picture of the peoples who created and continue to build this country,” reads the introduction of House bill 6883, which would create a commission charged with creating an organized plan for the museum’s development.
The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in September 2008 by Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-N.Y.) and eight co-sponsors.
Once the commission’s report is complete, it would recommend a second piece of legislation, calling for the establishment of the museum. According to the coalition’s projected timeline, such an act would be submitted to President Obama’s desk in 2012. The projected opening day would be in 2018.
Although planning is in the preliminary stages, five possible sites have been identified as possible museum locations, all of which lie directly on or near the National Mall, according to the website. The coalition proposes on its website that construction be financed privately, without federal tax dollars.

Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano will visit Georgetown on March 1 for a roundtable discussion to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the creation of the Department of Homeland Security.
Sponsored by the School of Foreign Service and the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit organization that organizes seminars and discussions revolving around critical issues, the talk will also feature Napolitano’s two predecessors, Michael Chertoff and Tom Ridge.
“We are honored to feature Secretary Napolitano and her two predecessors, Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Ridge, to mark this important moment in DHS history and that of the nation,” director of the Homeland Security Program at the Aspen Institute Clark Kent Ervin said in a press release.
Students said that they are pleased by the impending arrival of another big name speaker.
“I think that [it]will be a great opportunity,” said Eitan Paul (SFS ’12), president of the International Relations Club. “Whenever a policy maker, especially someone who’s currently in office, comes to campus, it’s exciting that students are able to engage with them.”
University Spokesperson Julie Bataille also touted the list of speakers Georgetown brings to campus annually. Other recent speakers include President Obama, famed biologist Jane Goodall and investigative journalist Bob Woodward.
“This upcoming event is another example of the kinds of people who are able to share their stories directly with our students to bring meaning to important current events and issues,” Bataille said in an email.
According to Bataille, the event exemplifies Georgetown’s role in providing a forum for discussing global issues.
“Georgetown in many ways is a global stage for leaders to share their perspectives and allow students and members of our community to ask questions and hear first hand about some of the most critical issues of our time,” she said.
