Students filled Dahlgren Quad tonight for a memorial service for Andrea Jaime (NHS ’17), who died today from apparent meningitis at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, according to an email sent by university officials.
A human science major who also took the training class for Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service, Jaime planned to attend medical school after graduation. According to her Facebook page, Jaime was originally from Bogota, Colombia. She graduated from Coral Gables Senior High School in Miami, Fla. and was designated a Gates Millennium Scholar.
Late this morning, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Assistant Vice President for Student Health Services James Welsh sent a joint email alerting the Georgetown community that an undergraduate had been diagnosed with meningitis. According to the email, the cause of the meningitis is currently unknown.
The email stated that while there is no health risk to the Georgetown community, students are still encouraged to contact the Student Health Center if they experience any symptoms, including sudden fever, headache and stiff neck.
In another email sent about three hours later, Olson and Welsh confirmed Jaime’s death.
“This is difficult news for the many members of the Georgetown community who know Andrea. Georgetown officials have been in touch with Andrea’s family and will continue to provide support and assistance to them. Please join us in remembering Andrea’s family and friends in your thoughts and prayers during this time,” the email read.
Meningitis is caused by an inflammation of the membranes, called the meninges, near the brain and spiral cord. The disease is most often caused by bacterial or viral infection.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, bacterial meningitis is a serious illness that requires immediate treatment, and it can cause brain damage, loss of hearing or learning disabilities, Between 2003 and 2007, the United States saw 4,100 cases of bacterial meningitis, 500 of which led to death.
Typically less severe than bacterial meningitis, viral meningitis lasts seven to 10 days, and most people who contract it make a full recovery. Fungal meningitis, a more rare disease caused by the spread of a fungus through the blood to the spinal cord, is not contagious.
The university did not specify which type of meningitis Jaime contracted.
Friends and peers filled Dahlgren Quad today at 7:30 p.m. to mourn.
Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., University President John J. DeGioia, Rabbi Rachel Gartner and CMEA Assistant Director for Academic and Student Support Services Cinthya Salazar spoke at tonight’s prayer service.
A full obituary will follow in The Hoya’s print edition Friday.

Thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of this wonderful young lady, as well as to the entire GU community. As a GU alum and dad of a college student attending school elsewhere, this particularly hits close to home.

The National Cancer Institute renewed the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center’s status as Washington, D.C.’s only comprehensive cancer center — a title the center has held for 20 years — and awarded the center with a five-year $11.25 million Cancer Center Support Grant on Wednesday.
“This grant and prestigious designation validates what we’ve long known — that Georgetown Lombardi conducts excellent and high-impact work,” Executive Vice President for Health Sciences Howard Federoff said via a communications representative.
Georgetown is one of 41 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers in the United States.
In order to earn the designation of comprehensive cancer center, the hospital must both conduct research and treat patients. The center is also required to use a laboratory for basic science research, a clinic for clinical trials and a focus on the center’s surrounding population.
Additionally, the center must provide patient treatment that offers a variety of clinical trials for unapproved and innovative medicines, as well as training programs for future health care providers and scientists interested in pursuing a specialization in cancer treatment. Finally, a comprehensive cancer center must engage in community outreach to promote education and spread awareness. Lombardi Center Director Louis Weiner said that community outreach is especially important to the Lombardi Center, in light of the District’s high cancer rates.
Between 2001 and 2005, D.C. ranked first in the nation for deaths caused by prostate, cervical and breast cancers, third-highest for deaths caused by colorectal cancer, and sixth-highest for deaths caused by cancer in general.
“This is a tremendous focus for centers like Georgetown Lombardi because the city we call home is disproportionately impacted by cancer,” Weiner wrote in an email.
Weiner said that the grant is meant to fund clinical management and data collection for clinical trials, the early stages during which the treatment is first tested on humans, expensive equipment and personnel expertise that can become necessary during research and infrastructure maintenance.
“While this grant is awarded after demonstrating strength and breadth of research capacity, patient treatment, training and community outreach, the grant is intended to support the behind-the-scenes activities that make these programs successful,” he wrote. “This is one of the only grants available to support these critical needs.”
According to Weiner, although Lombardi has received larger grants, this grant is unique because it is not directly intended for research alone.
“This grant funds what other grants don’t,” Weiner wrote.
The NCI also acknowledged the collaborative effort between Lombardi and MedStar Health in the creation of the MedStar Georgetown Cancer Network, a network of four Washington-region hospitals.
“We’re pleased the grant reviewers recognized our work with MedStar Health and its hospitals throughout the region to export our treatment expertise so that we can reduce the burden of cancer,” Federoff said.
Sarah Waye (COL ’15), who won the Goldwater Scholarship last summer for her research at Lombardi on medulloblastoma and for her proposed future research on stem cell treatments for spinal injuries, lauded Lombardi as a high-quality cancer research institution.
“I think that being called a comprehensive cancer center is actually entirely deserved by Lombardi because the amount of research and the quality of research that’s coming out of there is astounding,” Waye said.

Although Saturday night’s Senior Dis-Orientation event at the Mason Inn was advertised as an 18 and up event, a communication error prevented the entry of under-21 members of the Class of 2015 for much of the event.
According to Senior Class Committee Events Chair Helen Li (MSB ’15), the SCC coordinated the event with the Mason Inn’s management, who agreed that underage students could attend the event as long as they wore wristbands indicating that they were not able to drink.
“I think [Mason Inn’s] main concern was that they would have to make sure that under-21 kids don’t get drinks from other students, which we completely understood. There’s a huge liability issue with that. But at the same time, they agreed and they ultimately fulfilled their promise. It was just frustrating,” Li said.
Li said that on Saturday night, it did not seem that the management had informed bouncers of this agreement.
“The most frustrating part for us as a board is that it seems like we didn’t adequately communicate with management, which is not true. There was just a lack of communication between management and the bouncers,” Li said.
After the bouncers refused entrance to underage students, Li called the Mason Inn’s owner, Fritz Brogan (COL ’07, LAW ’10), who came to the bar and made sure that the remaining 25 to 30 underage students associated with the Dis-Orientation event were allowed to enter. The underage students got into the bar between 11:30 p.m. and midnight, according to Li.
Brogan, however, said there was not a problem for underage students on Saturday night.
“There was a line to get in because a lot of people were there. Saturday is a busy night and we had a lot of people coming for the Georgetown party, so I think that people had to wait in line for five to 10 minutes, but there was no problem with people getting in that I know of,” Brogan said.
This is the first year that underage students have been invited to attend Dis-Orientation events at bars.
“In the past, there have been tons of bar events and the under-21 students have not been included. We thought that was unfair,” Li said. “A lot of students just want to go to bars to be with their friends, not necessarily to get a drink at the bar.”
Events at Bandelero and Rí Rá this week will also be open to students under the age of 21, but Li said that the SCC will take measures to ensure that the students are permitted to enter the bars.
“We’ve learned a lot, so we are making sure that the owners give us in writing exactly what their plan is and that they will let under-21 students in and that there will be no problems,” Li said. “They might have to stay in a certain area away from the bar … but they will be let in and they’ll be able to be with their friends at the event.”
Approximately 20 percent of the students who are registered for Dis-Orientation are under the age of 21.
Victoria Moroney (SFS ’15), 20, arrived at Mason Inn around 10:30 p.m. on Saturday evening, and was told by bouncers that they were only allowing three people under the age of 21 in the bar at a time.
“It was made pretty clear by one of the managers who came to speak with us that it was too much of a liability for them to accept anyone else even though they had agreed prior to this to let people under 21 in,” Moroney said.
Moroney said that she was disappointed that she was not able to participate in this event, which was widely advertised as accessible to underage students.
“There were a lot of people who had very clear expectations for what the event was … and that everyone would be able to participate at a really cool thing for people who are still under 21,” Moroney said. “I think it was a huge disappointment for all of us and I think we really felt like it was incredibly unfair and very manipulative of the Mason Inn to portray it as an event that was 18 and up when that clearly was not the case.”

The Georgetown University Student Association and the American Association of University Women hosted Georgetown’s third annual Elect Her Women’s Leadership Conference on Saturday morning in the Healey Family Student Center.
Elect Her is a program that encourages young women to run for student government and other leadership positions on college campuses.
“Women in leadership is a win-win, and that is something that has been proven time and time again. When more women are in politics or any other leadership position, there are so many benefits that have been proven,” Jessica Kelly, the program manager for AAUW’s campus leadership program, said.“Women tend to be able to reach across the aisle to each other better, and they compromise.”
Research shows that women who run for elected positions earlier in their careers are more likely to run years later. Today, 54 percent of women in Congress once held leadership roles in their own colleges’ student governments.
Since only 18 percent of United States Congressional representatives are women, the U.S. ranks 77th internationally in women’s representation in the federal government.
“It’s kind of a vicious cycle when women don’t see female representatives, so [women] don’t think they can run for office either,” attendee Jordan Hughes (NHS ’18) said.
The conference invited female leaders on Georgetown’s campus to participate in a panel. The panel included GUSA Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15), GUSA Undersecretary of Sustainability Mandy Lee (SFS ’17), Georgetown College Academic Council President Parnia Zahedi (COL ’15) and GUSA Senior Adviser Chandini Jha (COL ’16), who is also the chairwoman of GU College Democrats. The panelists explained why they decided to run for office and how they focused on specific issues during their campaigns.
“I noticed a lot of things that made me feel surprised about Georgetown. … I really wanted to do something about the lack of sustainability efforts on campus,” Lee said. “I worked with the Office of Sustainability, which is a university office, but then I realized I wanted to help mobilize students behind important issues. Change would not just come from the administration, but from pressure of students as well.”
The panel also addressed how they handled criticism as female leaders while running for elected positions.
“I realized that it’s not like you’re doing it for your own self-aggrandizement. You have ideas and things you want to change around campus,” Jha said. “Something that helped me while I was running [for GUSA] was not letting myself talk me down. Taking the time to keep telling yourself that you are a capable person who has ideas and wants to help people. You shouldn’t devalue yourself because the world will perceive you in the way that you see yourself.”
Following the panel, the conference leaders asked attendees to brainstorm an issue about which they were passionate and write a brief elevator pitch, or a short speech to give while introducing oneself to voters. After creating their elevator pitches, participants delivered them in a campaign simulation, meant to help them practice presenting to potential voters.
“It focused on empowerment as opposed to the issues in society with women not holding leadership positions. We were focused on solving the problems and getting down to business,” Hughes said.
After two rounds of the campaign simulation, three attendees were selected to participate in a final round. Each candidate delivered her brief elevator speech, and then all of the attendees voted on a winner.
The conference also included keynote speaker Penelope A. Gross. Gross represents the Mason District on the Fairfax County, Va. Board of Supervisors. Her speech outlined her path to office, the support and mentorship she had along the way and suggestions for how to successfully run for office.
“Campaigning is fun. It’s government that’s hard,” Gross said. “You must balance opinions, and if that decision is up to you, then make it.”
After several experiences working on campaigns and for elected officials, Gross successfully ran for office.
“You must have confidence in yourself since girls are often being told you can’t do something. Fortunately, I think that’s happening less for today’s women, but I still think it’s one of the biggest hurdles for female candidates,” Gross said. “Most importantly, you have to like people, listen, have confidence, find mentors, build trust, understand the time commitment and have fun.”
Elect Her member Sarah Rabon (COL ’16) said that this year’s conference evolved to include a broader leadership focus.
“I think there was less of a focus on GUSA this year and more of a focus on general leadership skills,” Rabon said. “We had a different set of panelists and a different keynote speaker who brought in a different point of view, which is good. This year we had males participate in the training, which we haven’t in past years.”
 
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Christine Hernandez was the facilitator at the Elect Her Conference, while it was Jessica Kelly who facilitated the conference. All quotes originally attributed to Hernandez belong to Kelly.

After receiving 13 professors’ signatures, Georgetown has become the most-represented university involved in the American Studies Association’s boycott of Israeli academic institutions since the petition’s creation last month.
Georgetown professors who signed the boycott petition include Center for Contemporary Arab Studies Director Osama Abi-Mershed, Founding Director of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding John Esposito, Yvonne Haddad and Judith Tucker, among other signatories.
The boycott is a part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, which aims to aid Palestinian civil society by increasing economic and political pressure on Israel. The academic petition came as a response to recent turmoil regarding the Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
Columbia University, New York University and the University of California at Berkeley follow Georgetown in representation, with 11, nine and nine signatures, respectively.
“Israeli academic institutions function as a central part of a system that has denied Palestinians their basic rights. Palestinian students face ongoing discrimination, including the suppression of Palestinian cultural events, and there is sanctioning and ongoing surveillance of Palestinian students and faculty who protest Israeli policies,” ASA’s website states.
The petition’s signatories pledge that they will not publish in Israeli academic journals, teach at Israeli institutions, attend conferences at Israeli universities or work on any projects with Israeli academic institutions.
Haddad said she signed the petition in order to expand universal academic freedom and push for peace in the region.
“I signed it because the war was promoted as Israel defending itself when in fact it was defending the longest occupation and degradation of the Palestinian population. I signed it in the hope that it would bring pressure on Israeli institutions in order to provide space for academic freedom for Israeli and Palestinian academics who are not allowed to deviate from the hasbara [public diplomacy] of the state,” Haddad wrote in an email. “[The petition]  aimed to endorse the few Israelis and the growing number of Jewish American voices that have called for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and the respect for the human rights of Palestinians whose academic institutions are raided by the Israeli military and whose classes are suspended at the whim of the occupation authorities.”
Esposito said he believed the boycott could help prevent violations of Palestinian rights.
“[I hope] to put pressure on and to boycott institutions that violate international law and as a result violate the rights of Palestinians,” Esposito wrote in an email. “There can be no excuse for the cycle of violence that has taken so many lives in Palestine/Israel over the years, and terrorized both Palestinians and Israelis, and most recently in Gaza, the slaughter of so many innocent civilians, especially women and children must be stopped.”
Tucker, who has visited the area many times since the 1980s, said she has seen the problems that Palestinian students and professors face firsthand.
“I’ve seen the situation on the ground, particularly from the vantage point of colleagues, Palestinian academics, who really have suffered enormously over the years,” Tucker said. “They can’t get books, their students can’t get to campus. These have been ongoing endemic conditions under which they live. Of course, it sometimes becomes much more critical than that when there is an active period of bombing or attacks.”
Tucker, a history professor who specializes in the Middle East, said that she believes that pledging her signature is one of the best ways she can contribute to a cause in which she believes.
“The idea is that after this long period of time, there’s been virtually no movement on getting any closer to a resolution of this conflict. How can people abroad like myself make some kind of contribution to the cause of getting a just resolution? It’s not going to come about, it would seem, through negotiations on the ground, which have stalled for many, many years,” Tucker said.
Tucker, Haddad and Esposito said that their involvement in the boycott will in no way affect their roles as professors at the university.
“Signing the petition was a personal choice and has nothing to do with my professional activity at the university,” wrote Haddad, who teaches the history of Islam and Christian-Muslim relations. “I did not speak for the university, its faculty or its administration. I will continue to teach both the Palestinian and Israeli positions. Being censored and forced to teach exclusively the Israeli position as the only truth would shortchange our students, who are being trained to be the future leaders of America.”
“They’re very separate,” Tucker said about her personal views and her professional life. “I’ve been teaching Middle East history at Georgetown for many years, and my personal views have absolutely no purchase in the classroom. For me, it’s a non-issue. I would never feel that my students should think like I do or take positions like I do on any issue.”
Georgetown professors signed similar boycott petitions in December 2013 and in 2007. University President John J. DeGioia commented on both previous boycotts, but has yet to comment on this boycott. In 2013, DeGioia expressed opposition to the boycott, but support for academic freedom of speech.
“The recent resolution of the American Studies Association endorsing a boycott of Israeli universities undermines the academic freedom that is essential to the mission of the Academy. … I recognize these are matters on which colleagues can disagree,” DeGioia wrote in a statement last year. “While the position of our university remains opposed to any boycott, we will certainly defend the rights of those who disagree.”
Nitzan Gabai (SFS ’16), Israeli student and former Georgetown Israel Alliance president, said that he agreed with DeGioia’s statement and now worries about a lack of academic freedom and discussion between opposing sides.
“I am very concerned by what would happen with the void that would be left after pushing out Israeli scholars and universities from the conversation,” Gabai said. “Without someone on the other side to ever give counterarguments or to ever check and balance the accusations that are made on one side or the other, there’s just so much room to go with extreme opinions and go with actions that lose every proportion possible.”

It is unfair journalism to only provide the student perspective from a clearly pro-Israeli student.  That undermines an equal presentation of both perspectives from our student body.

Shame on these professors. Shame on DeGioia if he does not condemn their actions.

Rocky Lore says

Fascists like Yvonne Haddad are silent on ISIS and Boko Haram.

Arafat says

The enemy is now within the gate. The jihadists are beheading Americans in their places of work. Apologists for evil cannot discern what is happening. Their moral vision is based on prejudice and a priori thought rather than an understanding of foundational Islam and Islamic history.

Former Georgetown student Daniel Milzman, 19, pled guilty to one count of possession of an unregistered toxin in federal court Monday.
Appearing before Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the defense issued a plea agreement, which, pending the court’s approval, would entail one year and a day to two years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, in addition to financial penalties. The sentencing hearing has been set for Nov. 10.
Milzman has been held in D.C. Jail since he was arrested and charged with possession of a biological toxin March 18, after police discovered ricin in his dorm room on the sixth floor of McCarthy Hall earlier that week. He was found to possess 123 milligrams of ricin, with a toxic concentration of 7.7 micrograms per milligram.
After hearing Milzman’s defense attorney Danny Onorato’s claim that Milzman made the ricin with suicidal intentions, Magistrate Judge John Facciola ruled on March 25 that Milzman would be sent to a two-week in-patient psychiatric program at Sibley Memorial Hospital and then sent to remain at his parents’ house in Bethesda, Md., where he would be required to be under constant supervision in the house. In a hearing March 31, a U.S. District Court judge overturned Facciola’s ruling, ordering that he be detained and placed under “rigorous suicide watch.”
The possession charge could bring with it up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Milzman’s plea deal, however, would include time already spent in jail, which is approaching six months this week. If the court approves the deal and sentences him to the shorter end of the sentence’s time range, with good behavior he could be released in November or December, according to The Washington Post.
Milzman’s attorneys have said that he planned to use the ricin to commit suicide, rather than to harm anyone else, and Milzman has been under suicide watch in D.C. Jail.
“Daniel Milzman put himself and others in danger by cooking up deadly poison in his Georgetown dorm room,” U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen Jr. said in a press statement. “Today Mr. Milzman owned up to his reckless behavior and acknowledged his crime before a federal judge. He is very lucky that none of his fellow students were hurt when he decided to manufacture this lethal substance.”
“The FBI, along with D.C. Fire and EMS, acted swiftly to respond to this dangerous situation, to investigate the origin of the ricin, which Mr. Milzman has admitted to possessing, and to access any remaining potential risks to students on campus,” Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office Andrew McCabe said in a press release. “Possessing lethal biological toxins such as ricin is illegal, and those who choose to engage in this risky activity will be prosecuted by our partners at the U.S. Attorney’s Office with the full resources of the FBI.”
Abbe Smith, the director of the criminal defense and prisoner advocacy clinic at the Georgetown University Law Center, brought up that the defense could have originally sought sentencing under the Youth Rehabilitation Act, which gives youths under the age of 22 the opportunity to have their records sealed after serving the sentence. That is no longer an option as Milzman was sentenced in federal court, where the law does not apply.
“In my opinion, the best resolution of the case for Mr. Milzman would have been the case being transferred to the D.C. Superior Court from the federal court that whatever he pled to, or was prosecuted if it went to trial, could be resolved through something called the Youth Rehabilitation Act,” Smith said. “I’m sure that was the goal of the defense lawyers. It seems obvious that the government wasn’t willing to do that, that the government insisted on prosecuting him in federal court, where there is no such act for young people.”
According to Georgetown Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, Milzman is not currently enrolled at Georgetown, but she declined to comment on the procedure behind or time of his disenrollment because all procedures are confidential. Milzman, a Bethesda, Md. native whose father works as research director of the Department of Emergency Medicine at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, was a member of the Class of 2016 and studied physics and mathematics on a pre-med track in the College.
Milzman’s lawyer, Danny Onorato, could not be reached for comment.

In a bias-related incident involving sexual orientation, an unknown attacker assaulted an unidentified Georgetown University student on the 3300 block of M Street at 1:31 a.m. on Saturday, Sept. 13. The student was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.
“The GU student along with two other students were walking in the area when an unidentified male subject approached from the opposite direction, made a derogatory comment regarding sexual orientation, and subsequently assaulted the GU student before fleeing in an unknown direction,” a public safety alert sent to students from the Georgetown University Police Department read.
The email described the Metropolitan Police Department as arriving first on the scene and responding to the victim, after which GUPD officers were contacted. According to the student, whose status was described as “receiving medical treatment,” the suspect was Middle Eastern, male and approximately 30 years old.
The incident is currently under investigation by GUPD and MPD. Georgetown Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh directed questions on the investigation to MPD, who could not be reached for comment.
The public safety alert labeled the incident as a “bias-related assault.” GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber explained the term as a subcategory of hate crimes.
“It is just a more specific way of describing the assault rather than just using the term ‘hate crime,’ which is a broader category encompassing a number of bias-related crimes, while ‘bias-related assault’ is more defining of the particular incident,” Gruber wrote in an email. “The purpose of a public safety alert is to alert the campus community to a potential threat, not to legally categorize the incident.”
GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) expressed shock and dismay at the assault.
“As someone who works to make any person feel safe regardless of their identity or expression or anyone’s possible interpretation of that identity, it’s disappointing, and it’s scary,” Lloyd said.
GU Pride will hold an event, titled “Creating a Safer Space,” in response to the assault. During the event, participants will examine documents recently brought to light by the LGBTQ Histories Project and will share and reflect on their own experiences.
Lloyd pointed to Georgetown’s history with hate crimes, which includes assaults on the basis of sexual orientation in the fall of 2007, prompting a wide campus response and the establishment of Georgetown’s LGBTQ Resource Center, and in the fall of 2009. He noted the progress he has seen in campus culture since then.
“The sort of trigger an LGBTQ person has with hate crimes on this campus is to think about what happened five or six years ago, where they were closer to campus, and one or two incidents were done by other students. I found a lot of solace in the reaction of campus, which was really unified outrage,” Lloyd said. “This is a question of perceived identity, so [campus] is full of allies and supporters for anyone who expressed and presents any which way.”
Despite this progress, Lloyd said there was significant opportunity for improvement on campus to ensure a safe space where students feel more comfortable reporting these types of incidents.
“Last spring, there was an incident where a few students were verbally assaulted at The Tombs after GenderFunk [Georgetown’s annual drag ball held during Pride Week], so on one hand, while I say it’s constantly improving, on the other, there are a lot of experiences that don’t get reported,” Lloyd said. “So the event is to look at the history, see how we’ve gotten better, and also to share stories on where we still have to go.”
Lloyd urged anyone who needed counseling help to reach out to the LGBTQ Resource Center in Leavey 325. Anyone with further knowledge of the incident should contact MPD’s Second District Station at (202) 715-7300, or the Department of Public Safety at (202) 687-4343.

A renewed push for statehood for the District of Columbia culminated with a U.S. Senate committee hearing Monday. Although a symbolic gesture, this hearing was the first on D.C. Statehood since 1993, offering prominent government officials the opportunity to argue for full representation and control for D.C. citizens.
The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee deliberated the New Columbia Admission Act involving two all-Democrat panels, including Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes-Norton (D-D.C.), who serves as the non-voting delegate from the District to the House of Representatives, Mayor Vincent Gray, and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson. It has received 104 co-sponsors in the House and 17 in the Senate, the highest level of support this bill has ever seen.
The act proposes limiting the federal district to the small areas around the White House and the Capitol, while admitting the rest of the District of Columbia, as the 51st state, giving the state a voting representative in the House and two members in the Senate.
Holmes-Norton opened the testimony by calling for equal representation for the citizens of the District.
“As the District’s elected representative to Congress … I feel it when the bell rings for votes on bills, and I cannot cast a vote for the 650,000 American citizens who live in the District, despite the $12,000 per resident they pay in federal taxes, more per capita than any other Americans,” she said at the hearing.
Mendelson also testified in support of D.C. statehood at the hearing, focusing on the thriving economy and government of the District.
“For 17 consecutive years, the District has ended its fiscal year with a budgetary surplus,” Mendelson said in his testimony. “Our city is growing, our tax base is growing, our financial reserves are healthy.”
While Holmes-Norton focused on the lack of representation for District citizens in Congress, Mendelson decried the District’s current inability to control its own affairs.
“We cannot spend without congressional appropriation, and we cannot enact local laws without congressional review,” he said. “The District government is fully capable of managing our affairs just like any state.”
Holmes-Norton noted in her testimony that she did not expect the bill to pass but with the record number of co-sponsorships, including from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), and support from President Barack Obama, saw the hearing as an opportunity to draw even more attention to her cause.
“My hope is that I will be able to stir up even more activism in Congress for equal rights for D.C. residents,” she said in a Sept. 11 press release on September.
Obama voiced his support for D.C. statehood at a town hall-style event at a public school in northwest Washington in July.
“I’m in D.C., so I’m for it,” he said.
However, Obama did not send a representative to the hearing.
Mark Rom, director of Georgetown’s masters program in American government, said that statehood was, for all intents and purposes, impossible.
“In the current political environment and for the foreseeable future, although none of us can really foresee the future, there’s no way Congress would approve it. It’s so Democratic. It’s two Democratic votes in the Senate,” Rom said. “Control is so closely divided. It’s important for [Republicans] not to give up additional seats, and the Democrats would do the same thing if the positions were reversed.”
However, Rom pointed out that as the statehood movement aims for control for citizens in the District, total home rule could allow D.C. to achieve those goals equally well.
“If Congress gave them complete authority over their jurisdiction in all ways that other states have authority over their jurisdiction, they could set their own budget, they could establish their own policies, they could do whatever programs they want,” Rom said.
On the representation side, he pointed to the 2007 District of Columbia Voting Rights Act, which proposed to expand the House of Representatives by one seat in the District and one seat in Utah, which would grant representation without unbalancing the political parties in Congress or giving the city too much power.
Political commentator Mark Plotkin, a supporter for statehood, was not optimistic about D.C.’s chances at statehood in the near future.
“If we want to be honest with ourselves, nothing has changed, not in my lifetime, not in 50 years,” Plotkin told The Washington Post.
Only two senators attended the hearing, Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del.), who introduced the bill and Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.).
Nineteen Senate Democrats have signed Carper’s bill, not nearly enough to pass a bill through the Senate.
“I’m not sure [statehood] should ever happen. D.C.’s weird. It’s not a state; it’s a large city, but there are plenty of other cities that are larger that don’t have representation in Congress, not the kind D.C. would have,” Rom said.
Independent mayoral candidate David Catania states in his platform that he will bolster support for D.C. statehood and congressional representation. Mayoral candidate Democrat Muriel Bowser has also expressed her strong support for D.C. statehood, budget autonomy, and complete voting rights.

This weekend, the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative will hold Georgetown Startup Weekend, Entrepreneurship Day and TechBuzz, a series of events in the Rafik B. Hariri building that reflect the growing commitment to encouraging startups on campus and in the Washington, D.C. area.
The events will feature a keynote address from Washington Capitals and Wizards majority owner Ted Leonsis (CAS ’77), various breakout sessions and competitions judged by Priceline co-founder Scott Case, and a number of resources designed to facilitate building businesses.
Sweetgreen co-founder Nicolas Jammet (MSB ’07) said that he has been amazed by the recent success and growth of the startup culture at Georgetown.
“The only word I can use to describe it is growing, and what I’ve seen grow over the past seven years since I graduated, it’s really incredible to see the campus and the university and everyone invest in this idea,” Jammet said. “I think there’s always a kind of underground movement, or some excitement about it, but now it seems like that whole entrepreneurship movement at Georgetown is gaining incredible momentum.”
The weekend’s main event, Startup Weekend, aims to engage participants in a competition to create a startup. At the beginning of the 54-hour event, students, alumni and faculty members can pitch ideas and develop entrepreneurial pitches.
“Startup Weekend is a global movement, in that on any given weekend there are about 14 events going on. It’s in over 700 cities across the globe,” Victoria Schramm (COL ’12), director of events of UP Global, a nonprofit organization that supports entrepreneurship, said. “It’s our job as the organizers to bring in top-notch mentors, really great judges and all the resources that you need to really give it a go.”
Schramm, who majored in art history at Georgetown and also serves as a board member of the alumni group Georgetown Entrepreneurship Alliance, saw the inherent value in entrepreneurship upon leaving Georgetown and decided to commit herself to promoting it.
“Entrepreneurship is a way to build community, and for me entrepreneurship is a lot about economics,” Schramm said. “People who start companies are not only building things that the world needs and solving problems, but they’re also creating jobs. … I also think it’s important for people to do what they love. One of the things I saw as a Georgetown graduate was that many of my classmates were leaving and graduating and going to jobs that they weren’t super excited about.”
Georgetown Entrepreneurship Day will feature mini-keynotes from alumni, students and entrepreneurs followed by breakout sessions and the closing keynote from Leonsis.
Jeff Reid, who founded the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative in 2009, said that the program of events grow every year and that students have begun to take more action each year.
“Every year we have some students that take the leap and start a company,” Reid said. “Companies like Encore, Ride and Lulu’s are pretty cool recent examples. One of the keynote speakers at TechBuzz, on Sept. 19, is an MBA grad named Dan Berger. And his company, Social Tables, is one of the fastest-growing startups in D.C. Those are just a few examples; every year we have more.”
Reid also made sure to welcome students and faculty from every corner of Georgetown to all entrepreneurship events, including TechBuzz, which will take place from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. Friday before Startup Weekend begins.
“One of our biggest challenges is helping people that are not business majors realize that they’re 100 percent welcome for these kind of events,” Reid said. “So many times at Georgetown people assume because an event is in the Hariri building that if you’re not a business student, you’re not welcome. For the entrepreneurship program, everyone is welcome.”
Computer science professor Mahendran Velauthapillai has seen the practical benefits of working for a startup instead of a larger corporation.
“When you’re starting off, when you’re young, it’s good to go to a place where you get your hands dirty in everything,” Velauthapillai said. “So if you go to Google, what happens is you’ll be put in one specific thing. And you’ll be only specializing in that specific thing. And some people like that. … But when you go to these small startups, then you have to do everything.”
He did note, however, that because of the small size of the computer science department, encouraging risky startups has not historically been one of its priorities.
“It’s been kind of at the periphery,” Velauthapillai said. “But as a faculty member, I always tell you to think, think, think, and don’t be afraid to try something new.”
Georgetown students have encountered varying degrees of success with their startups, since a very large percentage of startups fail.
Jammet, along with classmates Nathaniel Ru (MSB ’07) and Jonathan Neman (MSB ’07), are an obvious success story, with the local D.C. salad restaurant startup now spanning over 25 locations across the Northeast. Jammet said that students interested in creating a startup should take the risk.
“Do it. I think that at certain times you just have to take that leap, and when you’re in school, surrounded with resources and professors and people who care about you, that’s the best time to take that leap,” Jammet said. “I see a lot of my friends that always wanted to do it, but then ended up going down the more traditional investment banking or consulting route. And once you go a year or two down that road, it’s really hard to leave. You end up staying for a while. … So take that leap early on.”
