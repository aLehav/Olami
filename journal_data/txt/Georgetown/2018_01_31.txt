Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) emphasized the importance of bipartisan cooperation and his concern for the “vanishing middle” in an event hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and moderated by GU Politics Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) in Lohrfink Auditorium on Monday evening.
Describing himself as a traditional conservative, Flake explained his fear regarding the loss of moderate centrists in Congress because he believes that as the number of moderates declines, the power in the executive branch of the government increases.
“I am very concerned about the vanishing middle in politics,” Flake said. “You always had a time when there were a lot of conservative Democrats — more conservative than the most liberal Republicans — and now you just don’t have many cross over, and that is dangerous.”
Flake, who announced in October that he will not be seeking re-election in 2018, did not confirm or deny whether he would consider running as a third-party nominee in the 2020 presidential election, but he did say he could foresee a successful independent run — whoever the candidate might be — in the near future.
“If President [Donald] Trump decides to run for a second term, and all the energy in the Democratic Party right now is on the left, the far left — either [Sens.] Bernie Sanders [I-Vt.], Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.], Kamala Harris [D-Calif.] — if the Democrats nominate somebody from their left, and if we nominate somebody who is on our far right, there’s got to be a huge swath of voters in the middle looking for something else,” Flake said. “I’ve always said that the time for an independent is in the future; it may not be so far.”
The senator has distanced himself from much of Trump’s rhetoric, especially from that on immigrants in the United States. Having grown up on a ranch in Arizona, Flake said many of the workers his family hired had migrated to the United States illegally, and his exposure to them from a young age formed his vision that immigrants are not to be feared or hated.
“I got to know these migrants,” Flake said. “I knew why they were coming, what their motivation was and I’ve never been able to look at them and see a criminal class.”
Flake also spoke out opposing the president’s stance against news organizations, especially regarding Trump’s tweet last February referring to the media as the “enemy of the people.” Still, Flake agreed a liberal media bias exists.
“As a conservative, there is generally a bias, but you accept that and you move on,” Flake said. “I think it’s awful to have the president of the United States not understand history well enough to know that you don’t use, you shouldn’t use a term like ‘enemy of the people’ that was most famously used by some people we don’t want to emulate.”
Flake’s denouncement of Trump’s rhetoric toward the media echoes his Jan. 17 speech on the Senate floor, in which he called it “shameful” for the president to use these words spoken by Josef Stalin.
Flake also expressed his concerns about the nature of the populism that helped Trump’s election in 2016, claiming the kind of anti-government cynicism that helped Trump win cannot produce a stable government.
“You can’t govern with the politics of resentment,” Flake said. “And a lot of what we’ve seen with this populism is the politics of resentment.”
Rather, Flake believes politics do not have to be as bitter and divisive as they are,
Flake has been known for his efforts at promoting bipartisan cooperation, famously stranding himself on a deserted island for a week in 2014 with Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) for the Discovery Channel program “Rival Survival.” Last month, Flake donated $100 to the campaign of upset-winner Senator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) after allegations of sexual misconduct circulated about Republican rival Roy Moore, tweeting the message “Country over Party” with a photo of the check.
“We have massive problems here in the country,” Flake said. “But when you look at our history, with the Civil War and women’s suffrage and other things that we’ve gotten through and we’ve found a way to be on the right side of, the challenges we face today are small by comparison. And it just takes good will on both sides.”

Firefighters responded to a laundry fire in the Henle Village apartment complex Tuesday evening caused by plastic left in a dryer.
Henle residents were evacuated around 7:03 p.m., while at least four fire units arrived on the scene. Residents were allowed to return to their apartments by 7:30 p.m. after the fire was extinguished.
There were no injuries, and no major structural damage occurred to the building as a result of the fire, according to Washington, D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services. One dryer was left out of commission and a window was shattered by firefighters for ventilation and access to the ground-floor laundry room.
Students were asked not to use the laundry room for the remainder of the evening while Facilities Management workers cleaned up the broken glass and repaired the broken window.
The laundry room, located in the J tower of the Henle complex, serves all Henle residents and shares a space with the Henle community room. No student spaces were damaged in the fire, according to an email sent to Henle residents by the Office of Residential Living on Tuesday night.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) joined mayors and CEOs from across the country Jan. 25 to launch Mayors and CEOs for U.S. Housing Investment, a coalition working to address issues of affordable housing and homelessness.
Eleven mayors, including Bowser, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, are members of the coalition, representing nearly 13 million constituents across the United States. The group aims to build public-private partnerships to work for housing solutions and to oppose any federal funding cuts that affect affordable housing.
Mayors and CEOs for U.S. Housing Investment identified four primary policy actions it will initially be advocating for: maximizing funding for existing federal programs it considers successful, issuing new Department of Housing and Urban Development grants, pairing certain HUD programs with Department of Health and Human Services programs and creating a fund for one-time emergency housing assistance.
“We recognize that by investing in affordable housing, we are investing in safer, stronger communities and building new pathways to the middle class for our most vulnerable residents,” Bowser said in a Jan. 25 news release.
Airbnb, Sutter Health and GHC Housing Partners are the coalition’s three private-sector partners. As businesses in the housing and healthcare sectors, the coalition is relevant to their work.
“Our experience has shown the best solutions are often the result of the public and private sectors working together,” Airbnb co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Nathan Blecharczyk said in a Jan. 25 news release. “We are particularly proud to be working with this coalition to identify and fund innovative ideas that work.”
Mayors and CEOs for U.S. Housing Investment was initially conceived a year ago by the late San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee (D). His concept then developed into the coalition, which currently represents mayors from both major and medium-sized cities in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Pennsylvania and D.C.
California has the most cities represented, with the mayors of Los Angeles, Oakland, San Diego, Sacramento and San Francisco — although a new mayor has yet to be elected since Lee’s death in December — in the coalition.
“An affordable place to live should be within reach for everyone in America who dreams of making a better life for themselves their family,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) said in a news release by the group.
In 2017, HUD estimated that on any given night, 553,742 people are experiencing homelessness in the United States. Nearly one-third of these people were in an unsheltered location while experiencing homelessness — a 9 percent increase from 2016.
Bowser has made affordable housing a key issue in her administration.  Bowser has pushed policies such as the Housing Production Trust Fund, which provides financial assistance to projects that preserve or build affordable housing, and announced an effort to invest $500 million in affordable housing in Dec. 2017.
The District is estimated to have one of the highest rates of homelessness in the country. A 2016 survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found there are 124.2 homeless people for every 10,000 residents in D.C. — the highest number in a survey of 32 cities.
However, homelessness in D.C. declined 11 percent from 2016 to 2017, according to a 2017 report by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments.
Bowser hopes to continue this momentum with Mayors and CEOs for U.S. Housing Investment. Fittingly, the launch event for the coalition was held at the John and Jill Ker Conway Residence in D.C., a permanent residence for formerly homeless veterans and low and moderate-income individuals — a public-private partnership.
“In Washington, D.C., we are committed to ending homelessness and expanding access to safe and affordable housing,” Bowser said in the group’s news release.
