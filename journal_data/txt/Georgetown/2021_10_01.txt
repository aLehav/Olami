CW: This article references violence in Afghanistan. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Georgetown University graduate students have coordinated plane charters and facilitated communication between refugees and groups assisting with evacuation efforts in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover of Kabul. 
Graduate students worked to secure charter flights for the evacuation of Afghans at risk of being targeted by the Taliban, special immigrant visa holders and former U.S. government employees. The students organized fundraisers, coordinated with nonprofits to raise money for evacuation efforts and facilitated communication with people on the ground directly assisting Afghans with evacuation, according to Kristie Cole (GRD ’21), who serves as the School of Foreign Service’s chief development officer and raised money and awareness for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) helping Afghans escape. 
Students involved played different roles throughout the process, with some communicating directly with evacuees and others facilitating fundraising efforts, according to Cole.
“I just started calling my network. I just started to put feelers out,” Cole said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “I was really touched by the response. These were donors that I had worked with in years past, and they came forward. What was really crazy is how many donors kept coming forward.”
Students collaborated with a wide variety of organizations to coordinate evacuations, according to Cole, including organizations like No One Left Behind, a nonprofit committed to helping interpreters and their families evacuate Afghanistan and start new lives in the United States.
Undergraduate students at Georgetown have also assisted refugees in Afghanistan; the university’s chapter of No Lost Generation, an organization that fundraises for refugees, hosted an on-campus donation drive for those who escaped Afghanistan and arrived in the Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area. Further, Zahra Wakilzada (SFS ’23) launched a fundraising campaign to help evacuate her own family members still in Afghanistan. 
“You had private citizens, volunteer groups, nonprofits, NGOs coming in and partnering with the government, trying to navigate government entities with trying to get charter planes landed,” Cole said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.
To further organize the effort, students created and maintained an aggregated database of information about thousands of Afghan evacuees, according to Kurt Sikkema (GRAD ’21).
“We worked directly with on-the-ground contacts in Kabul as the liaisons of the list to help create the flight manifests,” Sikkema wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
With a diverse range of experience and expertise, the students collaborated with each other and other organizations to help mobilize the evacuation effort almost immediately, according to Lauren Burt (GRD ’21).
“The group’s determination and dedication during the evacuation effort was truly astonishing to
witness as was their ability to make things happen in the most crucial times, with limited resources, and a ticking clock,” Burt wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Lives were at stake and every moment mattered.” 
In addition to fundraising for NGOs and nonprofits, communication was a central focus as students attempted to garner public support, according to Burt. 
“The cohort group was working within a very short timeframe in a crisis situation, and everything had to happen fast,” Burt wrote. “The correct messaging strategy was crucial, as was the ability to remain nimble and accessible for media relations as we wanted to inform the public about what was happening on the ground in Kabul so we could get more people involved to help.”
Grad students also worked with other nonprofits, such as Ark Salus, a group of U.S. veterans who have helped Afghan refugees evacuate.
From the United States, students and others helping the initiative spoke directly with those evacuating to help them board charter flights, according to Cole. 
“I had to hear conversations where it was like, ‘You can’t bring your brother, you can’t bring your mom, you can’t bring your dad. You are the one that is high risk. You are on our list. We can’t bring anybody else,’” Cole said. “That was really heartbreaking.” 
Resources: On-campus resources include Health Education Services (202-687-8949) and Counseling and Psychiatric Service (202-687-6985); additional off-campus resources include the District of Columbia Office of Refugee Resettlement (202-698-4316).

When Lauren Young (COL ’24) began feeling weak and seeing double last week, she rushed to the Georgetown University Student Health Center, where officials suggested she go to the emergency room.
“They gave me an IV because I literally couldn’t even keep my own head up off the chair. My whole body was tingling,” Young said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “I felt like I was on the verge of passing out for two hours.”
While Young was in the emergency room, university health officials texted Young asking where she had eaten in the previous 48 hours. On Sept. 22, she submitted a sample for testing. Young received a positive norovirus test Sept. 28, six days after submitting a sample. 
Dr. Ranit Mishori (MED ’02), Georgetown’s chief public health officer, first announced an outbreak of an unknown gastrointestinal illness in a Sept. 21 email. Mishori’s message also included information about a nationwide salmonella outbreak. Three days later, Mishori sent another universitywide email confirming two individual samples tested positive for norovirus, a highly contagious gastrointestinal virus. 
As of Sept. 30, over 145 students, faculty and staff have reported symptoms to university health officials that are consistent with norovirus. Furthermore, university health officials have confirmed the absence of salmonella poisoning on campus. Students like Young say they are now experiencing delays in receiving test results when presenting symptoms consistent with norovirus.
Norovirus, which typically spreads between November and April, is a highly contagious virus that causes vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea. The virus, which is common on college campuses, can be transmitted between people or through contact with contaminated surfaces, food or water. 
When contacted for comment, a university spokesperson directed The Hoya to a public health incident page.
Thomas Leonard (COL ’22) found himself in the George Washington University Hospital emergency room Sept. 21 after collapsing because of excessive vomiting and dehydration. 
“I’ve never been that sick before, and I would say — a conservative estimate to say that I threw up at least 10 times,” Leonard said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “And it got to the point where there was nothing left in my body to throw up and I was throwing up just bile and just dry heaving, and I passed out just because there was literally nothing in my body and I collapsed.”
Although the hospital suspected he had food poisoning, Leonard said he thinks he may have caught norovirus instead. Leonard said he submitted a stool sample Sept. 24 at the request of the Georgetown Public Health team; as of Sept. 30, Leonard has not received an update on his sample from public health officials. 
The university encourages students to take extra precautions to prevent the spread of norovirus, according to the incident page. 
“We continue to encourage members of our community to stay hydrated and practice good hand hygiene, washing frequently with soap and water. If you are unwell, please stay home, avoid social gatherings and events, and do not attend class or arrive for work,” a Sept. 26 update to the public incident page reads. 
After identifying at least two individuals with norovirus, university officials took steps to mitigate the spread of the virus on campus, including contacting officials from the Washington, D.C. Department of Health and increasing sanitization of high-contact areas in residence halls and dining halls on campus, according to the incident page. As of Sept. 30, the university confirmed that an undisclosed number of samples tested at the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital confirmed the presence of norovirus, according to the incident page.
While Leonard appreciates the university working to address the outbreak on campus, he said he is still anxious over the spread of the illness, as well as the delay in test results. 
“It’s concerning that there’s no immediate answers available to the student body, but again, I do appreciate that the administration is working hard to get those answers as soon as possible,” Leonard said.
Students with norovirus-like symptoms are also being asked to quarantine. Students can request food and water delivery by attesting to their symptoms on GU360, an app used by the university to administer daily COVID-19 symptom screenings. 
Leronard said he is anxious for the outbreak to die down soon. 
“I would prefer never to go through anything like that again, but as far as sort of a timeline of when it’s safe to eat on campus, it’s very nerve-racking,” Leonard said.
This article was updated on Oct. 5 to accurately reflect the nature of student claims regarding delays in norovirus testing.

Georgetown University student Victor Liu (COL ’22) and his sister arrived in the United States after being barred from leaving China for three years.
While visiting their dying grandfather in June 2018, Sandra Han, the siblings’ mother, was detained by Chinese authorities. Government officials subsequently banned Liu, a classics and economics student, and his sister, Cynthia, from leaving China in an effort to force their father, Liu Changming, to surrender to criminal charges for his alleged financial crimes. Changming, a former executive at a state-owned bank, is one of China’s most-wanted fugitives for his involvement in a $1.4 billion fraud case. He fled China and has been in hiding since 2007.
After news of the Lius’ situation spread, Georgetown student advocacy groups like the Asian American Student Association Political Awareness Committee and faculty urged government officials and the university administration to advocate for the Liu siblings’ release. The case also gained national attention in January 2020 when Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called on former President Donald Trump to urge the Chinese government to release Victor and Cynthia. 
The Asian American Student Association Political Awareness Committee declined to comment when contacted by The Hoya. 
According to former United States Ambassador to the United Nations David Pressman, a U.S. based lawyer who has helped lead the Liu’s legal efforts, Victor and Cynthia’s release is a long-awaited outcome.
“At long last, two young Americans are back home in America, once again able to enjoy the daily blessings of freedom we all too often take for granted in this country,” Pressman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “After years of painstaking and difficult work by many people, it was a privilege to be able to finally embrace Victor and Cynthia and welcome them home.” 
Former Ambassador Marc Ginsberg, who is serving pro bono as the siblings’ main legal representation, declined to comment on the case when contacted by The Hoya.
Foreign policy experts and scholars of international law like Diana Fu, associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto, have raised questions about the timing of the Liu siblings’ release, however, alleging that the release was linked to a Sept. 24 Justice Department deal that allowed Meng Wanzhou, a Huawei executive who was involved in a fraud case related to the company’s sale of communications equipment to Iran, to return to China. The Department of Justice denied any link between the two cases, according to The New York Times.
The Chinese government barred the Liu siblings from leaving China under an “exit ban,” which prohibits citizens from leaving the country. The Chinese government has increased its use of the policy over the past three years. Though there is no consensus, some international law scholars consider exit bans to be a form of hostage holding.
The international community must learn from the Lius’ situation and develop specific strategies and rules around the use of exit bans, according to Thomas Kellogg, executive director of the Center for Asian Law, a teaching and research center at the Georgetown University Law Center.
“There needs to be a way to send a clear and unified signal from the international community that exit bans against foreign citizens — and against China’s own citizens! — are not an acceptable way to deal with diplomatic spats or economic disputes,” Kellogg wrote in an email to The Hoya. “China needs to change its approach, and the U.S. and other key allies need to continue to press China to abide by its obligations under international law.”
The siblings are currently residing in the New York area, according to The New York Times. Their mother remains in jail, however, Ginsberg told The New York Times.
Throughout the last three years, Georgetown has been in regular contact with Victor and has continually advocated for his release by meeting with both U.S. and Chinese government officials several times, according to a university spokesperson. 
University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95), who visited with Victor in Beijing during a November trip to Asia, welcomed the news of the Liu siblings’ release.
“We have awaited this moment with great anticipation, for Victor and our entire Georgetown community,” DeGioia wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We look forward to welcoming Victor back to campus.”

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) recently discussed key fare changes that may take effect in 2022, including eliminating peak traffic fare increases. 
Potential fare policies for discussion include discounted fares for low-income riders, a $1 bus fare and eliminating the difference between peak and off-peak fares. The WMATA Finance and Capital Committee discussed the potential changes in a Sept. 23 meeting as part of a Fare Policy Principles and Strategy Work Session. Before a vote on the fare policy changes can occur, the Metro Board of Directors needs to decide which proposal to pursue. Fare changes would not be implemented until July 2022 and remain contingent on a passing vote. 
The potential fare changes would increase ridership while making the Metro system more customer-oriented, equitable and convenient, according to the summary of the WMATA Finance and Capital Committee’s Sept. 23 meeting. 
“Fare policy and initiatives have the potential to increase ridership, advance equity and improve the customer experience,” the summary reads. “While future ridership and revenue remain uncertain as Metro and the region recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, Metro has the opportunity to update its fare policy principles and to consider additional concepts for fare changes.” 
The Metro Board is working to serve customers in the best possible way and improve accessibility with potential fee changes as COVID-19 restrictions ease and the Metro system returns to pre-pandemic operations, according to Paul C. Smedberg, Metro Board Chair. 
“We continue to assess how fares meet riders’ changing needs as the region emerges from pandemic,” Smedberg wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The goal of the Board’s fare policy work is to formulate a range of options for our customers to consider in the upcoming budget process and in the context of making the most of our federal dollars that are covering the cost of service.”
The Sept. 23 meeting outlined potential discounts for low-income individuals. Riders would qualify for the discount if they are registered for entitlement programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicaid. 
Providing a fare discount for low-income riders would help individuals commute for work and leisurely purposes, according to Ben Fried, Communications Director at TransitCenter, an organization that aims to make transit more accessible for people of color, low-income communities and people with disabilities. 
“That reduces the barrier to access to transit for people who have trouble affording the standard fare, and that’s going to result in people being able to access more employment opportunities,” Fried said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “They’ll be able to just make trips and get around the city with greater freedom thanks for those fare discounts.”
The discussion comes after WMATA introduced new incentives beginning Sept. 5 aimed at increasing ridership in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Changes in discounts and services included free bus transfers, decreased weekend fares and extended Metrorail hours. 
The current fare system is not accessible for riders, as the varying trip rates create confusion for patrons, decreasing ridership, according to Fried.
“The distance-based fare that WMATA uses creates a zillion different price points for Metro trips, and that can be really confusing for riders, especially people who are new to the system, and that can be a barrier to entry for people,” Fried said. “So any step toward simplifying that is a step in the right direction.”
Currently, WMATA fares for the Metrorail differ based on traffic rates; peak fares range from $2.25 to $6, whereas off-peak fares range from $2.00 to $3.85. For Metrobuses, fares are more expensive for express and airport express routes. With these discussed changes, all Metrobus fares would instead become a flat $1 fee. 
According to Fried, these discussions may be an important step toward crafting equitable transportation systems in the Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area. 
“If they really scale that up and extend it to everyone in the region who is living below the poverty line, that would have a tremendous effect for people’s mobility and the basic fairness of the transit system,” Fried said.

The Georgetown University Prison Scholars program gathered in the D.C. Central Detention Facility for their first in-person classes since 2020.
The program has been virtual since March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, scholars, teachers and student volunteers alike have returned to the D.C. Jail library for in-person courses. Georgetown’s Prisons and Justice Initiative (PJI) founded the Prison Scholars Program in January 2018, and the program offers a series of liberal arts classes for incarcerated individuals. 
One of the first classes to convene in-person was the “Prisons and Punishment” course, according to Marc Howard, government professor and director of PJI, which meets weekly and was previously taught during the 2019-20 academic year. Other credit-bearing courses being taught this semester include Personal Finance and a writing seminar focused on literature of the apartheid in South Africa. 
Scholars are required to be fully vaccinated and abide by masking requirements, and the students are completing a smooth transition back to in-person learning, according to Marc Howard, government professor and director of PJI.
“The Scholars are so excited to be interacting and engaging again,” Howard wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Although for the previous 18 months we had been able to continue offering courses through prison-issued tablets, the interface was quite limited and the tablets don’t have cameras, so being in person again makes a huge difference.”
Howard says that every week the “Prisons and Punishment” course meets at the D.C. Jail library, where a group of students in the Capitol Applied Learning Labs (CALL) program, Georgetown’s experiential learning center at the Capitol Campus, come inside the library to mix with a group of incarcerated students.
“Incarcerated people have suffered so much throughout the pandemic, and our Scholars are overjoyed to be returning to a more healthy and engaging living and learning environment within the DC Jail,” Howard wrote.
During the summer, the virtual courses consisted of uploaded lectures, course materials and assignments from Georgetown faculty. However, student-instructor interactions were limited by the virtual format, according to Joshua Miller, PJI Director of Education.
“Our return was much anticipated and it was truly joyful to be reunited with my students! Some of them were admitted during the pandemic, so this was the first time I’d seen them at all, while they watched videos of me and other faculty,” Miller wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The PJI also offers a variety of other course programs, including the Pivot Program, a non-credit bearing certificate in business and entrepreneurship for formerly incarcerated individuals. The PJI also organizes the Mayor’s Office on Returning Citizen Affairs (MORCA) and Georgetown Paralegal Program, which trains experienced previously incarcerated individuals for successful careers in the legal field. 
Though some PJI programs were revised and reduced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the initiative still offered many programs that operated in a virtual format over the past year. The PJI was also able to grow its team following a $1 million grant for the program from the Andrew W. Mellon foundation.
Over the summer, students residing in the D.C. Jail engaged with an entirely asynchronous 12-week-long Justice and Peace Studies course monitored by prison authorities, according to Tarek Maassarani, adjunct lecturer at the Georgetown University Law Center and for the Justice and Peace Studies program.
“These were extremely challenging instructional conditions, compounded by a pandemic and lock-downs,” Maassarani wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Nevertheless, most students overcame the 6 or more hours a week reading articles and watching recordings on tablets they could access only at certain times.”
As they return to in-person operations, the Prison Scholars Program will also welcome the first cohort of students to a five-year Bachelor of Liberal Arts Program in Jan. 2022 at the Patuxent Institution, a correctional facility, in Jessup, MD. 
Returning to in-person instruction increases personal connections for students and instructors alike, according to Maassarani.
“They will be able to hear each other’s perspectives, work in teams, and engage their instructors in real time — things we often take for granted on main campus,” Maassarani Wrote.

CW: This article references sexual assault. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
George Washington University (GWU) students have organized petitions and protests demanding the university improve policies to protect survivors of sexual assault on campus. 
George Washington Students Against Sexual Assault (GWSASA), a student-run survivor support and advocacy organization, revived the 2017 #GWProtectsRapists campaign after students voiced concerns about the inaction of the university’s Title IX office and the George Washington Police Department (GWPD) in protecting survivors. Survivors, students and community supporters plan to stage a demonstration outside GWU’s commencement ceremony for the classes of 2020 and 2021 on the National Mall on Oct. 2. Afterward, the group will send a set of demands to the university regarding increased protections for survivors.
GWSASA demands that the university establish a clear process for survivors to enact campus bans — which can range from preventing perpetrators from living in university-owned housing to barring them from on-campus classes — against their perpetrators after several occasions when survivors felt inadequately protected by the university, according to the GWSASA statement and petition released Sept. 26. 
“Survivors have experienced stalling, innaction, and a blatant lack of communication, particularly when the perpetrator comes from a background of wealth and status,” the statement reads. “The process for initiating campus bans is unclear and the Title IX office has continually proven not only to be ineffective, but actually an obstructive force for accessing bans for many survivors.”
Students first launched the #GWProtectsRapists campaign in 2017 after the university allowed an individual to walk at his graduation ceremony after sexually assaulting another student and violating the GWU Student Code of Conduct. While the perpetrator was barred from residing in on-campus or university-owned housing, administrators permitted him to graduate as long as he did not commit additional offenses.
Stephanie Lee, a senior at GWU, started an Instagram account Sept. 25 to revive the #GWProtectsRapists campaign, attempted to request that the university bar her assailant from walking at graduation.
However, Lee said the university closed her case because her assailant no longer attends GWU, motivating her to take action and revive the #GWProtectsRapists campaign. 
“I decided that we need to do something, and the thing that we need to do needs to be immediate because there’s people that are literally in classes right now with their rapists at GW,” Lee said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “That needs to stop effective immediately.”
According to Lee, when survivors attempt to work with the Title IX office or GWPD seeking protections from their perpetrators, their requests are often left unresolved due to inconsistent policy application regarding barring students from participating in activities like graduation.
“I don’t know how the barring process actually takes place because they don’t have it in formal writing anywhere,” Lee said. “The process can change on the whim.”
In light of these issues, the Oct. 2 protest will take place outside the commencement ceremony. Student activists want to bring awareness to the university’s unjust policies without disrupting the ceremony itself, according to Shira Strongin, GWU student and co-president of GWSASA. 
“GW SASA e-board members will be in attendance as trained confidential resources to provide support for survivors who may feel triggered during this work,” Strongin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will hold our signs near the entrance of commencement in silence.” 
The petition and protest advocate for change within the university’s Title IX office, which currently has no clear system for assisting survivors and often does not adequately penalize perpetrators of privileged backgrounds, according to Strongin.
“GW’s Title IX office has constructed artificial barriers in processes for protection and justice which have harmed survivors,” Strongin wrote. 
According to a Sept. 27 letter sent to the GWU community by Asha Reynolds, Title IX investigator, and Caroline Laguerre-Brown, vice provost for Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement, the GWU Title IX office is working to increase resources for survivors on campus. 
“The university is working to address concerns about the timely handling of Title IX complaints, including implementing new case management software and hiring more staff,” the letter reads. 
According to Lee, the protest has the potential to benefit survivors by enacting change in university policies regarding sexual assault and other crimes. 
“I’m hoping based off of that, that some of us get the justice and protection we deserve as survivors on campus,” Lee said. Resources: On-campus resources include Health Education Services (202-687-8949) and Counseling and Psychiatric Service (202-687-7080); additional off-campus resources include the D.C. Rape Crisis Center (202-333-7273) and the D.C. Forensic Nurse Examiner Washington Hospital Center (844-443-5732). If you or anyone you know would like to receive a sexual assault forensic examination or other medical care — including emergency contraception — call the Network for Victim Recovery of D.C. at 202-742-1727. To report sexual misconduct, you can contact Georgetown’s Title IX coordinator at 202-687-9183 or file an online report here. Emergency contraception is available at the CVS located at 1403 Wisconsin Ave NW and through H*yas for Choice. For more information, visit sexualassault.georgetown.edu.

The Washington National Cathedral has commissioned several art installations centered around racial justice. 
The Washington National Cathedral will install new stained-glass windows by 2023, depicting the fight for racial equality in America. The installation will be accompanied by a poem inscribed in stone, according to a Sept. 23 announcement. The new art will occupy the space once held by windows honoring confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, which were removed in 2017. 
The Washington National Cathedral formed a task force to decide the future of the Confederate stained glass following a 2015 shooting at a historically Black church in Charleston, S.C. After the 2017 “Unite the Right” white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., the task force ultimately decided that the windows should be replaced with art that did not exclusively center on white historical perspectives, according to Kevin Eckstrom, chief communications officer at the Washington National Cathedral. 
“The task force felt very strongly that they wanted to use that as an opportunity to make a statement and not just put up windows for windows’ sake but to tell a story, and to tell a richer, more vibrant story, about America,” Eckstrom said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
The confederate-themed windows told a version of American history that needed to be reevaluated, according to the Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, dean of the Washington National Cathedral, in the cathedral’s press statement.
“For nearly 70 years, these windows and their Confederate imagery told an incomplete story; they celebrated two generals, but they did nothing to address the reality and painful legacy of America’s original sin of slavery and racism,” Hollerith said in the press statement. “They represented a false narrative of what America once was and left out the painful truth of our history.” 
The task force asked Kerry James Marshall, a leading contemporary artist known for work that centers on Black Americans, to participate in the project, who agreed to design new stained glass windows that will tell a story that celebrates the history of Black America, according to Eckstrom. 
“One of his animating themes is to finally represent Black Americans who have been left out of a lot of art over the centuries,” Eckstrom said. “He celebrates the average, ordinary, everyday dignity of Black America, and he does it in a really unique way.”
Marshall said his goal is to make a meaningful addition to the Washington National Cathedral through his art. 
“The themes that the Cathedral committee articulated set a great challenge for me as an artist and as a Black American man,” Marshall said in the press statement. “The goal is to make truly meaningful additions to an already rich and magnificent institution, to make the changes they have embraced truly worth the effort.”
Elizabeth Alexander, who recited her poem “Praise Song for the Day” at President Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration, agreed to write a poem that will be engraved in stone in conjunction with the new stained glass window display, according to Eckstrom.
“She has been a voice of moral clarity on this issue, and we wanted her to be involved in this project any way we could,” Eckstrom said. “Then when it became clear she was interested in also doing some poetry, it all kind of came together.” 
Alexander, in addition to being a renowned poet, is the president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, an organization that provides grants to individuals and organizations promoting the humanities. 
Replacing the confederate windows with art centered around Black American history is only the beginning of a larger project to create a more inclusive space within the Washington National Cathedral, Eckstrom said. 
“This is really the start of a much larger project to reimagine what stories are told in this sacred place where America gathers at pivotal moments,” Eckstrom said. “Ultimately, we want everyone to see themselves in the building and to see their stories told in the building so that it feels like home for them.”

Visitors to the Tidal Basin on Sept. 22 might have spotted an unexpected sight: a seemingly half-submerged house could be spotted floating in the water.
Extinction Rebellion D.C. (XRDC), an environmental activism organization, launched the floating house into the Tidal Basin as a demonstration of what would happen if immediate action is not taken to address climate change. The protest aimed to push politicians to approve legislation that would protect the environment, including the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill stalled in Congress. 
The floating house was constructed to look similar to housing in Washington, D.C., because low-income people would be impacted most rapidly and most significantly by the effects of climate change, according to Andy Miller, a member of XRDC.
“That house was made to look as close as possible to a D.C. row house, and especially to a low-income D.C. row house,” Miller said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “The government and institutions of power need to tell the truth about the urgency. It relates definitely to our ‘act now’ demand, which is to do everything within each of those institutions’ powers to reduce emissions, increase resilience and protect the most vulnerable communities.”
Sea levels in the District are rising twice as fast as the national average, according to a 2018 Nature Briefing report, putting predominantly low-income neighborhoods in Wards 7 and 8 at increased risk of flooding caused by climate change because of their location along the Anacostia River. By the year 2100, rising sea levels due to climate change could raise rivers in the District by up to 11 feet, putting neighborhoods and infrastructure underwater, according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report that assesses climate risks to the United States.
XRDC chose to place the floating house in the Tidal Basin because it is a man-made structure that is being impacted by rising water levels, just as the natural sea levels are also rising, according to Miller. 
“The Tidal Basin is a man-made thing, and it symbolizes to me that nature is so powerful, and we have to respect it. This man-made creation is settling, so it’s sinking down, and the water’s rising, and it’s actually going to be unusable within a couple decades and within our lifetime,” Miller said. “One really important message is that it’s never too late, because our actions will always be affecting the now and the future.”
Recent estimates have shown that areas around the Tidal Basin could be submerged in as much as three feet of water by 2040, according to NPR. In response to the issue, the Tidal Basin Ideas Lab, a partnership between the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Trust for the National Mall and National Park Services, solicited plans from five landscape architecture firms to address the sinking.
One member of XRDC swam in the Tidal Basin with the floating house and was charged after being arrested for operating a vessel in an area operated by the National Park Service without a permit. 
This is not the first time XRDC has staged an unconventional climate protest. The group placed wheelbarrows full of cow manure in front of the White House in April as a protest against President Biden’s climate plan, which they claimed did not achieve net-zero emissions fast enough. 
Unconventional demonstrations will force more people to take notice and choose to do something about the future of the planet, Miller said.
“We do actions that disrupt business as usual in some way because that makes people have to decide are they for a just, livable future or are they against it,” Miller said. “Basically almost everyone will be for it, so the disruptive nature of our actions gets people to have to say one way or another.”
The floating house protest is a jarring demonstration of what will happen to the District and the world if climate change continues to go unchecked, according to Miller. 
“We want this to hit home for D.C. residents and the nation at large,” Miller said. “This is going to be us, this already is us in some parts of the U.S.”

Georgetown student activists took to the streets of D.C. last weekend to demand that President Joe Biden’s administration take immediate action to combat the climate crisis. 
Activists organized the strike outside the U.S. Capitol Building on Sept. 24 to demand Congress pass a $3.5 trillion climate change bill to establish a Civilian Climate Corps, a plan President Biden proposed that would employ 20,000 people annually to complete sustainability work in the green energy sector. Protesters also called on the Biden administration to use an executive order to stop the construction of the Line 3 pipeline, which would carry toxic tar sand from Canada to Wisconsin. 
The strike was organized by Fridays for Future (FFF), an international movement started by climate youth activist Greta Thunberg in 2018 and American University’s chapter of the Sunrise Movement. FFF aims to end climate change while simultaneously creating sustainable jobs. Last Friday’s event was part of a global strike in which over 700,000 people participated. 
Attendee Elizabeth Packard (COL ’25) said that the seriousness of the climate crisis and the excitement of an in-person protest inspired her to join the demonstration.
“I just think climate change is just such an urgent topic so I think the faster people get involved, the faster change will happen,” Packard said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
At the demonstration, Packard was particularly moved by a “die-in” during the protest, in which participants lay down on the ground to represent those who have died as a result of climate change.  
“It’s just a fact and a number that so many people don’t recognize because it’s so hard to visualize, so I found that really powerful,” Packard said.  
In the United States, people of color, including Black, Latinx, and Asian Americans are more likely than their white counterparts to be exposed to pollution from all sources including emissions from vehicles, construction, agriculture and restaurants. The crisis also disproportionately affects low-income communities that tend to inhabit natural disaster-prone regions, particularly those exacerbated by climate change.
The protest reminded Willow Volkert (COL ’25) — who also attended the protest — said she believes the university is greenwashing their sustainability policies. 
“Georgetown is not at all doing enough. They have no comprehensive sustainability plan even though they claim to have an environmental initiative. It’s complete greenwashing — nothing’s getting done,” Volkert said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It’s especially upsetting, considering the school does have the money to enact these changes.”  
According to Meghan Chapple, Georgetown University vice president of sustainability, the university is working towards creating a sustainable campus, including divesting fossil fuel companies and working to decrease energy usage rates.
“The university has already begun to address this with a recent agreement with ENGIE North America to manage utilities and reduce energy consumption on campus,” Chapple wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
On Feb. 6, 2020, administrators announced their plan to divest the university’s endowment from fossil fuel investments within 10 years. The announcement came after an eight-year campaign from Georgetown University Fossil Free, a student-led activist organization dedicated to fossil fuel divestment. 
Climate change is a global crisis that requires immediate attention across the world, according to Volkert.
“They really spoke at the strike about how the rest of the politicians who weren’t addressing this were acting like children by refusing to talk about this,” Volkert said. “People don’t really see this as big of an issue as it is, so we need to change the narrative and address not this problem, but this crisis.”

CW: This article references sexual assault. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Sexual assault can be the result of campus policies, and education must improve to combat the issue, panelists said at a Sept. 27 event. 
At the event, titled “Sexual Citizens: A Landmark Study of Sex, Power, and Assault on Campus,” panelists discussed sexual assault on college campuses and the ways education can improve to combat the issue. The event was co-hosted by the Georgetown University Gender+ Justice Initiative, Women’s Center, Georgetown College, Women’s and Gender Studies Program, Title IX Office and Student Health Services. 
University policies related to student safety that are unequally applied across identity groups can create environments that facilitate sexual assault, according to Jennifer Hirsch, a professor and deputy chair for doctoral studies in socio-medical sciences at Columbia University and co-author of the 2020 book “Sexual Citizens: A Landmark Study of Sex, Power, and Assault on Campus.”
“There’s so many ways in which the environment that we’ve built on campus amplifies power inequalities instead of mitigating them,” Hirsch said at the event. “Policy decisions like the fact that fraternities but not sororities serve alcohol or that it’s very hard for first-year students to host parties because most of them are under the drinking age and so their social spaces tend to be more heavily policed.”
One of the root causes of sexual assault on college campuses is a lack of adequate sexual education, according to Hirsch. 
“We erase young people’s sexual citizenship by forcing them to come of age in a climate of silence and fear, which doesn’t enable them to do what they want to do without hurting other people,” Hirsch said. “So really, we shouldn’t be so surprised that there’s so much sexual violence because we as a society are choosing not to do better there.” 
Sexual assault is pervasive on college campuses. Among undergraduate students, 26.4% of females and 6.8% of males experience either rape or sexual assault, according to a 2020 Association of American Universities report. 
Sexual education at all education levels should be more comprehensive, and especially should cover important concepts such as consent, according to Hirsch. 
“Our goal really should be teaching people not to assault other people, not helping women fend off unwanted advances,” Hirsch said. “And so sex education could really do that if it started in an age-appropriate way in kindergarten, which is basically telling little kids not to put their hands in other people’s bodies when when they’re not wanted.”
Currently, 24 states and the District of Columbia mandate sex education. Decisions about sex education, however, are made at the state and local level, which may result in a great discrepancy in sex education among individual school districts. 
Sexual education should also center around LGBTQ individuals and address power imbalances between different identity groups, according to Shamus Khan, professor of sociology and American studies at Princeton University and co-author of “Sexual Citizens.”
“Sex ed needs to center the experiences of queer people not abstractly, but particularistically — that is, to highlight what those experiences are,” Khan said at the event. “Just as it needs to highlight racial differences, class differences, age differences, as part of its overall education in power.”
LGBTQ students in the United States have reported negative experience with sexual education; in 2013, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network published a report stating that fewer than 5% of LGBTQ students had positive experiences with LGBTQ representation in their health classes. Furthermore, there are seven states that prohibit sex educators from discussing LGBTQ-related topics in health classes. 
Community groups of all kinds have a responsibility to take a stand against sexual assault, according to Hirsch. 
“Part of the reason that higher education has failed for decades to reduce rates of sexual assault is that it’s been regarded as a campus problem, and in ‘Sexual Citizens’ we redefine it and show how it’s an everyone problem,” Hirsch said. “Schools and families and religious organizations, every institution that touches young people on their way to adulthood needs to get on board and be part of the solution.”
Progress on sex education is occuring at the state level, and individuals should pressure their elected officials to improve sex education in schools, Hirsch said. 
“All of you who care about this, turn your eyes away from Washington and call your state legislatures,” Hirsch said.

The U.S.-China trade war was unsuccessful in its goal of pressuring American and allied multinational corporations to exit China and instead passed down increased business costs to consumers, a panelist said at a Sept. 24 virtual event. 
The event, titled “Political Risk and Firm Exit: Evidence from the U.S.-China Trade War,” featured experts shedding light on the impacts of the U.S.-China trade war based on the results of their latest research study of the same title. The event was hosted by the department of government and the Georgetown Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues, as a part of its Chinese Politics and Economy Research Seminar series, which convenes scholars to share the latest research on China. 
The U.S.-China trade war is an ongoing economic conflict between China and the United States that began in January 2018 after former President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on China with the goal of changing “unfair trade practices.” The Chinese government responded by levying its own tariffs on American goods. 
Beyond Trump’s stated goals, the intent of the trade war was to pressure American and allied multinational companies to cease operations in China, according to Samantha Vortherms, assistant professor of political science at the University of California Irvine and co-author of “Political Risk and Firm Exit: Evidence from the U.S.-China Trade War.”
“Policymakers hoped that the trade war would encourage decoupling with China, that these policy measures would encourage both U.S. firms and firms of U.S. allies to walk away from China,” Vortherms said at the event. 
In January 2020, both the United States and China signed an initial agreement to de-escalate tensions. The agreement addressed intellectual property concerns, agricultural trade and financial services, among other topics, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Despite the agreement, tensions have persisted into the administration of President Joe Biden, as the Chinese government reportedly failed to meet purchasing benchmarks in January 2021, according to CNBC.
The U.S.-China trade war elevated political risks for multinational corporations operating in China, increasing the number of companies who left the country, according to Vortherms. 
“The largest effect of the trade war: All firms, regardless of tariff or country of origin, are more likely to exit during the trade war,” Vortherms said.
By July 2019, more than 50 major companies announced their intent to pull production from China as a result of the trade war. But rather than move their operations to the United States as Trump urged, many rebuilt supply chains in Southeast Asia. 
The U.S.-China trade war was not successful in its goal of pressuring United States and allied companies out of China as firms could adapt to the increased business costs that the tariffs created, according to Vortherms.
“Multinational corporations that did not experience tariffs saw the largest blunt effects of the trade war. And U.S. firms were less likely to exit than other firms overall,” Vortherms said.
Since the Biden administration took office in January, talks between trade representatives for the two countries have reportedly stalled, leaving tariffs in place, including a 25% import tax. In response, groups representing various U.S. business interests sent a letter to the Biden administration in August, urging the two countries to resume negotiations, according to The New York Times.
Despite the continuing tensions, many businesses have reason to remain optimistic about the future of U.S.-China trade relations, according to Vortherms.
“For supporters of trade, there’s reason to be optimistic because the overarching trend is continuing business as usual. It’s also important to remember that tariffs still affect outcomes: Instead of firms exiting the markets, firms are absorbing the cost of these tariffs,” said Vortherms. 
Still, the impacts of the trade war will continue to be felt by consumers until the trade dispute is resolved, according to Vortherms.
“It is still increasing the cost of business — just not to the degree that it’s pushing firms out. And instead, that means that the effect of the trade war is getting rolled down to customers,” Vortherms said.

Trump’s trade war was successful in getting America’s politicians united in confronting China on trade. Also, Trump was successful in curling China’s tech ambitions and making a more secure US supply chain. The trade war was never really about deficits, which most economists miss. Also, as an American, I will and would gladly pay more money for non-Chinese goods or heavily taxed Chinese-made junk that is necessary.

Washington, D.C.’s first publicly funded elections in 2020 saw more candidates and increased campaign donations, according to a report recently published by the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy. 
The report, titled “Expanding Donor Participation in the District: An Analysis of the Fair Elections Program in Washington, DC,” found that the public funding model under the Fair Elections Program led to a wider field of candidates as well as more candidate funding directly from D.C. residents.
The program, which was passed by the D.C. Council in 2018, seeks to change municipal government campaign funding by creating a public-funding program where the D.C. government can help finance municipal candidates.
Under the initiative, the Fair Elections Program provides candidates with a base payment of $40,000 as seed money for their campaigns. The D.C. government then matches donations from residents to participating candidates at a five-to-one ratio, meaning that for every dollar donated to a candidate the government will give five additional dollars, according to the report. 
The Fair Elections Program offers many benefits to D.C. residents by encouraging increased political involvement, according to Brian McCabe (SFS ’02), an associate professor in the department of sociology and the faculty and research director in the Center for Social Justice who co-authored the report.
“Policymakers wanted to increase the participation of small-dollar donors, make sure that people have more of a voice in local democracy and amplify the voices of local residents,” McCabe said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
The Fair Elections initiative was also successful in increasing the number of first-time and small-dollar donors, according to Kenan Dogan (SFS ’23), a junior majoring in business and global affairs who co-authored the report.
The report found that the number of D.C. residents who contributed to a D.C. Council campaign more than doubled in 2020 compared to the 2018 elections. In the 2020 elections, the report found that 13,373 D.C. residents contributed to a D.C. Council campaign, compared to only 6,455 during the 2018 election cycle.
However, despite these successes, the D.C. Council should still make further improvements to D.C. campaign financing, according to the report.
The report urges the D.C. Council to evaluate the candidate qualifying threshold, a base amount of contributions necessary in order to qualify as a candidate in the Fair Elections Program, as well as implement a voucher system that will give funding to candidates even if some voters are unable to contribute personally.
“The qualifying thresholds for the Fair Elections program are generally higher than those in other cities, including Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco,” the report reads. “Overly burdensome thresholds may restrict the entrance of a diverse, inclusive slate of candidates.”
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland use similar public funding models, matching resident donations with a six-to-one ratio. Seattle, Wash., also using a public funding program, offers vouchers to residents to contribute to their choice candidate.
The report also calls for the D.C. government to implement an alternative voting system, such as ranked-choice voting, which would allow individual voters to better navigate a larger field of candidates by ranking multiple instead of only picking one, according to Dogan.
“Ranked-choice voting is going to become a pretty big topic in D.C. over the next four years,” Dogan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Ranked-choice voting will help District residents better represent their preferences in a candidate field that is becoming increasingly saturated as a result of the public campaign finance program.”
In July, D.C. legislators introduced a bill to implement ranked-choice voting in D.C. by 2024, which has support from a majority of councilmembers but still faces some pushback from others. While some councilmembers argue ranked-choice voting will allow more participation in the electoral process, others say it will further marginalize independent candidates.
To address the concerns of some of the D.C. councilmembers, McCabe and Dogan plan to host a Zoom event Oct. 14 with D.C. councilmember Christina Henderson to advocate for ranked-choice voting and election reform in the District.
Implementing election reform in addition to reforming and continuing the Fair Elections Program will ultimately help encourage voter participation in democratic processes, according to McCabe.
“The most important thing is to ensure that the voices of all D.C. residents are heard, especially those who have historically been marginalized from the political process,” McCabe said.

Georgetown University professors collaborated with a committee of the United Nations to produce the first-ever long-term study on internally displaced persons in Iraq. 
The study analyzed 3,500 households of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq, individuals forced to leave their homes but who still remain within the borders of their country, over the last six years. Analysts from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), an intergovernmental group of the United Nations specializing in the field of migration studies, collaborated with the Georgetown University Law Center Institute for the Study of International Migration (ISIM) and the Georgetown University Center for Contemporary Arab Studies (CCAS) to conduct the study. The report is the first of its kind to study IDPs over a multi-year period, according to Rochelle Davis, director of CCAS. 
Davis said the consistency that came with studying the same families over a six-year period was key to allowing the team to understand the long term effects of displacement on families. 
“The idea of ‘durable solutions’ for IDPs is something developed at the international level to think about when displacement ends,” Davis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This study is the first ever to follow IDPs over time as they return to their destroyed homes, move elsewhere, or settle in the places they took refuge in and rebuild their lives there.”
While the full results of the study will be presented in a report set to be published in late 2021, a September fact sheet that showed some initial data from the study focused on the effects of COVID-19 on IDPs. 
A member of one in five households studied either got sick or died from the virus, and the majority of families studied had difficulties managing the pandemic, according to the fact sheet.
“While the vast majority (72%) of these households report that getting tested for COVID-19 was somewhat or very easy, equally large shares (74%) report it was somewhat or very difficult to afford medications to alleviate symptoms,” the fact sheet reads.
As of 2019, there were 45.7 million people experiencing internal displacement across the world, whether because of violence, conflict or natural disasters. Meanwhile, during the same year, there were 26 million individuals identified as refugees, or those who flee their homes and exit the country.
Despite this disparity, most studies of migration focus on refugees and neglect IDPs, according to Elizabeth Ferris, an ISIM research professor at Georgetown University. 
“Although IDPs are twice as numerous and often more at risk — because they’re closer to the violence that displaced them — they get much less attention than refugees,” Ferris wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Both IDPs and refugees are staying displaced for longer periods of time particularly because conflicts are dragging on, making it difficult or impossible for them to return home.”
ISIM was eager to participate in a study that elevated the stories of IDPs, according to Ferris.
“Georgetown worked with IOM to develop the survey instrument and trained the Iraqi staff to carry out the interviews,” Ferris wrote. “IOM field staff carried out the surveys — repeatedly — and then we at Georgetown took the lead in analyzing the results and writing them up. It was a wonderful collaborative effort, using our respective strengths.”
Ferris said working on this study was important because it presents tangible solutions for policy work on IDPs. 
“We also found that for Iraqi IDPs, destruction of housing was a key impediment to return, so we were able to emphasize reconstruction of housing as a key factor in supporting solutions,” Ferris wrote. 
According to Davis, the next step for policy makers is to advocate for funding from the Iraqi government to support the displaced families in the study. “The Iraqi government has offered compensation to those who lost homes, businesses, and farms,” Davis wrote. “And yet, as of May 2021, almost no one in our study had received compensation yet, despite many of them submitting the applications. The Iraqi government needs to make this happen as quickly as possible because people don’t have the money to rebuild without it.”

Amid an early flu season, Georgetown University nursing students volunteered to help vaccinate over 1,000 students.
The free flu vaccination clinics, held in the Leavey Center on Sept. 19 and Sept. 23 for students living on campus, were hosted by the School of Nursing & Health Studies (NHS) and the Student Health Center (SHC). They launched the clinics amid the unusually early flu season on campus, which resulted in 46 confirmed cases of influenza A on the main and medical center campuses as of Sept. 10. The clinic vaccinated 1,184 students, according to a university spokesperson. 
To aid in the flu vaccination effort, a group of 16 seniors in the NHS Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BNS) program volunteered to prepare the flu shots and administer the vaccines, an annual tradition for seniors in this program.
Rosalyn Wang (NHS ’22), who volunteered for eight hours and vaccinated approximately 100 people, said the experience provided an essential hands-on learning experience that helped prepare her for a nursing career. 
“I became involved in the flu vaccine clinic because I believe in supporting the health of my classmates and the Hoya community,” Wang said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “For me, nursing involves not only meeting an individual’s physical, emotional, social and mental needs, but also meeting the needs of the community.”
Prior to the vaccine clinics, the university had advised that students get vaccinated as early as possible to combat the spread of the flu with an unusually early high volume of flu cases occurring on campus, according to a Sept. 16 message to students from Dr. Ranit Mishori (MED ’02), university vice president and chief public health officer. 
Students with appointments lined up well before the clinic officially opened at 9 a.m., and the clinic continued to operate well into the afternoon. The clinics lasted for over 12 hours across both dates. 
Since Georgetown experienced a rise in flu cases earlier than expected, the SHC needed to quickly mobilize the vaccination effort, and the efficiency and success of this last-minute clinic relied on the senior nursing students, according to Wang.
“This is just part of my job as a nurse to always be providing primary prevention to viruses and public health issues that arise in our society or community,” Wang said. 
The university has provided nursing students opportunities to gain experience through vaccine clinics in the past. In March 2021, third- and fourth-year students from the Georgetown School of Medicine and clinical graduate students from the NHS had volunteered at four D.C. MedStar Health facilities and other public health locations to aid in distributing COVID-19 vaccinations. The SHC also typically hosts clinics where students can receive free immunization against the flu by appointment or walk-in during mid-October.
Geraldine Sackey (NHS ’22), another nursing student who helped administer flu vaccines at the clinics, said she felt happy to be able to get direct practice as a nurse. 
“We had a lot of our nursing experience taken away because of COVID,” Sackey said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I feel like a lot of us were very excited to just be in the field again and get more experience.”
Many nursing students were eager to volunteer at the clinic after receiving a message from the NHS with a sign-up sheet to participate, according to Sackey.
“They sent out a sign-up sheet, and a lot of nursing students signed up,” Sackey said. 
The university plans to partner with Labcorp to hold more flu vaccine clinics for students, faculty and staff throughout October and November, according to a university spokesperson. The clinics will take place at various locations on- and off-campus, and the Oct. 14 clinic co-sponsored by NHS and SHS will accommodate up to 800 people, according to a university spokesperson.
According to Wang, the student volunteers were a key factor in the success of the clinics. 
“I am grateful for all the students who joined the community health effort, because without the people that showed up to the clinic and gave time out of their lives to go get the vaccines, the clinic would not have done so well,” Wang said.
