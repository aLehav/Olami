Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced the launch of the Anacostia Public Safety Academy, an institution aimed at helping District of Columbia Public Schools high school students pursue a career in criminal justice, on Sept. 15.
In a joint press conference with DCPS, the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department and the D.C. Police Foundation, Bowser explained that the academy will allow current Anacostia High School students to enroll at the University of the District of Columbia Community College’s MPD Cadet Program with six credits toward their high school degree. It will also guarantee students employment at the MPD while enrolled in the Cadet Program.
Bowser said the academy is a result of a citywide effort to connect the MPD and other District agencies with communities across the city. In this case, Bowser said she hopes to reach out to young adults in order to further connect them with their communities,
“Our city thrives when our public servants live in neighborhoods they serve and know the residents in those neighborhoods, and that’s especially true of the police department,” Bowser said during the press conference. “So that’s why I’m excited about the opportunity that this program brings.”
UDC-CC spokesperson John Gordon said being an active participant in the program was important to UDC-CC ever since the program was in its planning stages. Gordon said this support stemmed from UDC-CC’s goal of giving back to D.C. by providing education and workforce opportunities to residents across the District.
“We try to offer to the residents of the District a seamless pipeline to academics, starting with our non-degree certificate programs for workforce development on through associate degrees to bachelor’s degrees to graduate degrees,” Gordon said. “If there are those who are interested in a criminal justice kind of track, we want to help them get that here. We are a partner with the Mayor and the City Council, particularly in efforts to provide pathways to the middle class.”
DCPS Spokesperson Janae Hinson said the program is to help students gain professional opportunities both during and after high school as they pursue higher education and enter the workforce. Hinson emphasized the fact that this program will provide a stronger workforce in D.C.
“Our goal is for students to have better access to great career paths right here in Washington, DC,” Hinson wrote in an email to the Hoya. “Together, DCPS, MPD, and UDC put together a program that will ensure our students get real-world experience while in high school and a clear path to college and a high-wage career.”
Sixty-one Anacostia High School students will participate in the academy during the 2016-2017 school year. Students will be able to take specialized courses in law and criminal justice, as well as pursue internships and shadowing opportunities within the MPD.
MPD Interim Chief of Police Peter Newsham said these internships and shadowing opportunities are also coming at a critical time for the MPD, which needs to add new officers to its ranks. Newsham said the MPD is facing a so-called “retirement bubble,” during which officers who enlisted in the early 1990s are beginning to retire with no one to replace them.
“We are grateful that Anacostia High School has embraced this partnership that will undoubtedly be a tremendous success,” Newsham wrote in a Sept. 15 press release. “These students are taking the first step toward becoming the next generation of leaders at the Metropolitan Police Department.”
Meredith Barber (NHS ’19), who was raised in the D.C. suburb of Potomac, Md., said while this program sounds productive, local efforts could be better channeled to assist programs addressing community issues earlier than high school.
Barber cited the program Head Start, which is a United States Department of Health and Human Services program that provides early childhood education, health, nutrition and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families.
“The wards are really segregated based on race and the achievement gap really starts around birth, basically,” Barber said. “So I think that’s a good program idea but they should also focus more on earlier programs like Head Start. Head Start is a good program but it doesn’t reach enough people.”

Georgetown University Police Department officers removed condom envelopes from the doors of two condom representatives for H*yas for Choice early Wednesday morning in response to a report of vandalism.
According to GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber, the condom envelopes were removed after a resident assistant on the fifth floor of Village C West reported an incident of vandalism to GUPD.
“Upon their arrival they observed that the common space and two rooms on that floor appeared to be vandalized. This included envelopes on the doors of two rooms that had explicit images and comments written on them,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The envelopes and other items were removed from the doors and the incident was documented in a police report.”
Nam Sivakumar (SFS ’20), who was one of the condom representatives to have a condom envelope removed from her door, said GUPD appeared to misunderstand the condom envelopes as an act of vandalism.
Condom envelopes are envelopes posted on condom representatives’ doors – students who volunteer with H*yas for Choice to post the envelopes – that contain free condoms for any student to take.
Sivakumar said GUPD was responding to a case of vandalism on the door of another room on her floor, which was vandalized as part of a prank.
“They looked at the condom bags on my door and the door across from me, neither of which were involved in the prank, and I think they thought that they were some kind of harassment, that someone had put it up on our door without our consent or we had put it up to make fun of somebody,” Sivakumar said.
H*yas for Choice first reported the removal of the condom envelopes on the group’s Facebook page Wednesday evening.
H*yas for Choice Co-President Brinna Ludwig (NHS ’17) said that GUPD’s removal of the condom envelopes was inappropriate without prior consultation of condom representatives.
“As much as it is [our] role to support our condom rep in any way we can, you know it’s their door, it’s their property, so they should be the ones who want to initiate who should be talked to and then the ones who also want to initiate with GUPD, they should be the ones initiating it,” Ludwig said.
Georgetown University Student Association free speech policy team chair DJ Angelini (MSB ’17) said GUSA views GUPD’s response as inappropriate.
“GUPD took down the condom envelope erroneously, and it’s something that GUSA finds is a very serious issue and it’s something that will be brought up at the next speech and expression committee by myself because I think it’s something that’s important to make sure that all actors are on the same page to protect the rights of free speech for students,” Angelini said.
Condom envelopes are covered under the university’s Free Speech and Expression Policy for students to place posters of their choice on their doors, according to Angelini.
“Doors to residential rooms or apartments are considered the responsibility of the resident; students may use this space to post flyers or materials intended to express personal views,” the policy states.
Angelini said that students have the right to decorate their door with content from both recognized and unrecognized student groups.
“It doesn’t even tie into recognized versus unrecognized, that door is an extension of their right to freely express themselves, and it’s their responsibility under the speech and expression policy,” Angelini said.
Violations of the free speech and expression policy – particularly around condom envelopes – has been a problem for H*yas for Choice in the past, according to Ludwig and H*yas for Choice Co-President Emily Stephens (SFS ’17).
“Condom vandalism is something that’s definitely happened a lot, and we’ve had in the past former people have said that their envelopes have been torn off,” Stephens said. “Sometimes it’s an accident where people are super drunk and they rip it off. It’s hard to tell whether it’s malicious or accidental.”
H*yas for Choice was also prevented from tabling outside the front gates in Sept. 2014 by GUPD officers. Gruber later admitted that preventing the group from tabling was a mistake.
Ludwig said the condom envelopes’ coverage under the free speech policy has been set for years.
“This issue, in terms of free speech, has been pretty well settled for a number of years, so it’s always jarring,” Ludwig said.
 
 
[…] This is not the first time that Georgetown played politics with speech on campus. The university has for years repeatedly violated its own policies on free speech and expression to the detriment of the student organization H*yas for Choice, the most recent example occurring in September. […]

As one of the ten IMPACT partner universities with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women’s gender equality initiative, HeForShe, Georgetown launched the first phase of a campaign for gender equality on campus this week.
HeForShe is an international movement that aims to engage people of all genders to advocate for gender equality. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.N. Women Global Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson launched the campaign in 2014, and identified partner universities, heads of state and corporations to encourage activism at an institutional level. Georgetown announced its partnership with the campaign in February.
The launch this week followed the Tuesday release of a study conducted on the partner universities goals and progress on achieving gender parity.
The HeForShe 10x10x10 IMPACT University Parity Report outlines three areas in which universities can work on to empower women. These include highlighting the ratio of men to women represented in faculty and administration, the fields of study chosen by female students compared to males as well as the number of female students at universities and their access to academic and professional tracks.
University President John J. DeGioia and other administrative and student representatives joined U.N. Women in announcing the results of the study at the 71st U.N. General Assembly in New York on Tuesday.
Student ambassadors for HeForShe, partnered with the Georgetown University Student Association communications team, raised awareness of the campaign this week by tabling and setting up a photo booth in Red Square.
The university chose student ambassadors based upon previous experience in United Nations advocacy or leadership on campus in an effort to include student leaders in the university’s progress with the project. Georgetown is one of two American universities, along with Stony Brook University, invited to serve as an IMPACT partner in addition to eight other international schools.
When DeGioia announced the partnership in February, he outlined three specific goals for the university.
First, the university is committed to using its Institute for Women, Peace and Security to conduct research and analyze data about the role of women in peace-building, political activism and prevention and protection of women from sexual violence in conflict. The institute also consolidates key articles and studies as well as facilitates the work of academics studying female participation in politics.
According to Georgetown Associate Vice President for Strategic Communications Stacy Kerr, administration from the 10 IMPACT universities will convene during the next five years to evaluate the work all schools are doing on their respective campuses to address issues of sexual violence on campuses, closing the gender gap in pay at universities and improving the ability for women to attain leadership positions. These independent projects have not been previously announced.
“In addition to what each of us are doing on our individual campuses, we want to tackle [those] three areas together where we think that if we do some collective work together, we could have an impact,” Kerr said.
Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny said the commitments provide clear steps for the university to take.
“We are working to make our campus a safe and healthy environment where students, faculty and staff can do their very best work,” Kilkenny wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are working to create new knowledge and research that advance women and contribute towards gender parity worldwide.”
Kilkenny also underscored the role of student participation.
“Our students have a significant role to play in this movement and we want to empower them to be aware of their power to bring gender parity not only to our campus, but to their lives beyond Georgetown,” Kilkenny wrote.
Georgetown pledged to build a campus that is safe for women by strengthening its response to sexual assault and sexual violence issues using information from last year’s campus climate survey, and to update its “RESPECT: Preventing Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct” training for faculty members, which is a university program focused on providing information to faculty and staff about their legal responsibilities and rights.
The university has also been using the
, which was founded in 2015 by university administration, to consolidate the work done by the Women’s Center, Georgetown Women in Medicine and the Women’s Leadership Initiative.
Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security Communications Manager Sarah Rutherford said student partners have already planned future campaigns, including a video campaign and extending invitations to HeForShe advocates Emma Watson and Trevor Noah to speak on campus.
“As a follow-on to this week’s call for personal commitments to gender equality, we plan to invite student clubs to make commitments to gender equality — such as a pledge to reach gender equity in club leadership or an agreement to offer programming that supports women’s voices, rights or opportunities,” Rutherford wrote in an email to The Hoya. “GIWPS and other university staff will continue to support the #HoyasForShe student movement.”
DeGioia said HeForShe’s goals overlap with the priorities of the university as an institution.
“As universities, we are animated by a shared mission: the formation of our students, the creation of new knowledge, and to act on behalf of the common good,” DeGioia wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “These roles shape the ways in which we can impact gender parity efforts — providing us with tools, resources, and opportunities to make a positive difference.”
Georgetown University Student Association Director of Communications Natalia Peña (COL ’17) said although HeForShe’s commitments to gender parity are being organized and measured solely by university administrators since the partnership was announced in February, student partners have taken the lead in raising awareness about gender equality on campus beginning this week through tabling and a photo booth campaign in Red Square.
“Starting with that visibility — we are working from that point,” Peña said. “This is the start of the student initiative. It is really led by the administration, but it’s not a club.”
DeGioia also said this student activism is a crucial part of ensuring gender equality at a grassroots level.
“We are especially grateful to our students, who are also deeply engaged in this work, just this week actively inviting their peers to make their own personal commitments to ending gender discrimination and advocating on behalf of women across our campus,” DeGioia wrote.
According to Peña, from Monday to Wednesday, more than 100 students signed a pledge to empower female peers and took photos with their promises written on cards. While U.N. Women’s international movement is formally known as #HeForShe, student partners have decided to rebrand it “#HoyasForShe” on campus.
“We want HoyasForShe to encapsulate all genders, which doesn’t necessarily limit it to women,” Peña said.
HeForShe student ambassador Axel Khayat (SFS ’19) said the student-led initiative was launched to inform the university community about how students can become a part of the HeForShe movement by raising awareness and taking a pledge for gender equality.
“Last year we decided to launch a student campaign to spread the word because we thought not enough students knew about the campaign,” Khayat said. “I think in that case of gender equality, which is especially aimed at targeting men to get them involved, it’s especially important to have noise around the campaign and to make sure people know about it.”
Khayat said the HeForShe initiative is unique since it calls on males in positions of power to take part in achieving gender equality by raising awareness.
“Usually there’s a lot of women’s rights initiatives on campus, but most of them are almost completely led by women, which I think is normal but sad as men don’t want to get involved in that fight, which I think is their role too,” Khayat said.
GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) said he appreciated the HeForShe cause because it petitions men to join the cause for gender parity.
“It’s so valuable to talk about gender equality in a way that includes and calls on all men to be involved,” Fisk wrote in an email to The Hoya. “After all, feminism isn’t an attack on men, it’s just the promotion of the not-so-radical idea that men and women are equal.”

La Casa Latina opened its doors to the Georgetown community Saturday, marking a historic milestone a multi-year long effort to create a space for Latinx students to build and empower their community.
Led by the Latino Leadership Forum, Casa Latina was approved last year to be created as a safe and inclusive space on campus for Latinx students. The space is located on 36th Street, N.W., next to the Black House and will house five residents on an annual basis.
Georgetown’s Latinx community worked for several years to acquire Casa Latina. The Latino Leadership Forum and the Last Campaign for Academic Reform initiated a sit-in outside President John J. DeGioia’s office in April 2015 to push for the house’s establishment. The sit-in resulted in a working group tasked with organizing the logistics of house’s development.
The Latino Leadership Forum and the Last Campaign for Academic Reform also pushed for the implementation of a diversity requirement in the same sit-in.
This year’s inaugural residents are Ximena Cespedes (SFS ’19), Josué Coronado (COL ’18), Zeke Gutierrez (SFS ’19), Citlalli Velazquez (COL ’17) and Bria Wade (COL ’19).
Casa Latina hosted a welcome barbecue to ring in the academic year on Saturday, with several members of the Georgetown community in attendance.
Coronado, the dialogue coordinator for Casa Latina, said the house’s establishment was significant not only for Georgetown, but also for other Latinx college students across the nation.
“For me, it’s like history in the making,” Coronado said. “There aren’t many ‘Casa Latinas’ around the nation and for Georgetown to finally have one after over 200 years is pretty empowering for many different people in the community.”
Casa Latina is currently planning what direction its programming will take. According to Coronado, it is important that the house serve as a safe space for Latinx identity and self-care.
“There aren’t too many spaces where we can be ready to enjoy being Latino because it’s such a white space on campus,” Coronado said. “It’s great just to have this center where we can come together and succeed in it. It’s Georgetown – it’s such a hard school to get into and even harder to stay in and it’s really important that we’re able to balance our happiness with academics.”
Much of Casa Latina’s mission and foundation was based off the principles of the Black House, which has served as the center for communities of color on campus since 1972.
Gutierrez, the Student of Color Alliance Liaison for Casa Latina, said the Casa is committed to continuing to build a relationship with the Black House community.
“I think that there’s been a lot of collaboration going on between Casa Latina and the Black House that’s been more logistical and behind the scenes, but I really like the fact that we’re always talking to each other and whenever I need advice or need help with anything, I can just ask and they help me,” Gutierrez said.
According to Wade, the marketing outreach chair for Casa Latina, the group is looking to build solidarity with other groups for students of color to discuss issues that surround their communities on predominantly white campuses.
 
“For me, a personal goal is to in some way address or work to fix the tension that exists between the black and brown communities,” Wade said. “I want to in some way work on solidarity and making sure that people realize that allyship goes both ways and how we can work on realizing that our communities go through similar struggles and how we can be there for each other.”
According to Cespedes, Casa Latina intends to collaborate with the Black House to host events highlighting the similarities and celebrating the differences between the two communities.
“I think that there are so many different things within our communities, but there are so many more similar things,” Cespedes said. “We go through similar struggles and similar issues and we both get through that in different ways, but I think that at the end of the day, we’re more connected and we’re rooted in the same cause.”
The Georgetown Center for Multicultural Equity and Access Assistant Director of Diversity Programs Daviree Velázquez, who serves as advisor of both Black House and Casa Latina, said that although it has only been open for less than a month, Casa Latina has already begun to fulfill its purpose as a place of community building for everyone, not just students.
“One of the main desires of having the house was to be a space where a collective consciousness is built along with community, and it’s definitely already attracting that,” Velázquez said. “I’ve received several calls from alums who are anxiously looking for ways to give back to the house and help support the house so that it’s thriving. I’ve also had a lot of opportunities to meet with faculty, staff and administrators who are on campus and want to be a part of building up this community.”
Wade said the residents ultimately want the space to reflect the views of the broader Georgetown Latinx community.
“We want to make sure that we’re not dictating what we think people want to see from us,” Wade said. “We want to hear from those who will be using and taking advantage of this space, but it’s definitely been a little bit overwhelming.”

Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency Chuck Rosenberg and Director of the FBI James Comey promoted a unified response to the nation’s opioid epidemic on Wednesday, during the official Prescription Opioid and Heroine Epidemic Awareness Week.
Held in Gaston Hall, the discussion also featured a screening of “Chasing the Dragon: The Life of an Opiate Addict,” a documentary co-produced by the FBI and DEA, illustrating the impacts of drug abuse.
The event was co-hosted by the McCourt School of Public Policy and the School of Nursing and Health Studies. Individuals featured in the documentary were also in attendance.
University President John J. DeGioia said Lynch’s work has made significant contributions in addressing the opioid epidemic.
“She has worked tirelessly to address the epidemic levels of opioid and heroine abuse and overdose deaths in our country,” DeGioia said, “Successfully engaging with this complex challenge facing our society is about, in her own words, quote, ‘making real and lasting progress on behalf of those with desperate need.’”
The Department of Health and Human Services reported 3.8 million people ages 12 and up are currently misusing prescription pain relievers in the United States. 47,000 people are dying each year from drug overdoses, according to Rosenberg.
“Georgetown undergrads number about 1,800, give or take, that would be like 25 years worth of graduates of this institution vanishing from the planet,” Rosenberg said.
Lynch said the epidemic transcends all facets of society.
“This number reflects the fact that this opioid epidemic is indifferent to race, to class, to age, or towards geography,” Lynch said. “It cuts across our entire society young, old, poor, rich, rural communities are some of the hardest hit, as well as our major cities.”
Lynch said it is important to set up a network of support for families dealing with the problem of drug addiction.
“Despite the devastation that these families experienced, they have all chosen to act because they knew that one of the problems that they faced when they were fighting the fight, trying to save their loved ones was the thought that they were alone in the fight, not knowing that other families were also in the same situation,” Lynch said.
Lynch said it was necessary for all aspects of society to work together in order to address the opioid epidemic.
“The only way that we can end this epidemic is by adopting the all hands approach that bring everyone together: law enforcement, community leaders, medical professionals and ordinary citizens in a truly united front against this destructive epidemic,” Lynch said.
Rosenberg said the DEA’s work goes far beyond simply the criminal prosecution of those responsible for drug accessibility, but also seeks to reduce demand through education.
“Part of this has to be: demand reduction, and part of that involves all of you, so take this, show it to someone you love, have that conversation, don’t just leave here tonight and do nothing. This is an epidemic and we are losing way too many people to it,” Rosenberg said.
Comey said this mission is universal and has ramifications for a series of areas of concern for the FBI.
“It also aligns with our professional responsibilities because we see echoes of this in all the rest of our world: we see its echoes in our sex trafficking work, we see its echoes in our cyber extortion and sextortion work, we see its echoes in our fraud work, our money laundering work, our gangs work,” Comey said.
Comey emphasized there is a duty to those who have suffered from this disease, as well as their families, to make a unified effort to combat it.
“I believe to my core that no matter why that bad thing happened to a good family, to a good child, to a good spouse, our obligation is to not let evil hold the field, to make sure something good comes from that loss, not to make it worth it, it will never be worth it, but simply because that’s our obligation to go on and to ensure that evil is fought,” Comey said.
The event also included a panel after the movie with the Assistant Administrator of the DEA Louis Milione, Executive Director of the Steve Rummler Foundation, Lexi Reed Holtum, Interim Chair of the School of Nursing and Health Studies Peggy Compton and Gina Woodward, whose son was a heroin addict and is now an advocate against opioid abuse. Dean Edward Montgomery of the McCourt School of public policy moderated the panel.
Emily Spann (MSB ’20) said she found the event to be an innovative way of fighting against the opioid epidemic.
“I found the event to be extremely enticing and a real eye opener. The discussion was very informative as well as welcoming to students and the questions they had,” Spann said.

Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin advocated for an American interventionist policy abroad at a Sept. 20 speech hosted by the McCourt School of Public Policy’s Institute of Politics and Public Service, which was followed by a question-and-answer session.
Hosted in the Healey Family Student Center, McMullin’s remarks, entitled “A New Era of American Leadership,” focused on human rights, the armed forces and America’s relationships with other countries.
McMullin, a former Central Intelligence Agency operations officer from 2001 to 2011 and chief policy director for the House Republican Conference, announced his candidacy for President last month. He also worked for Goldman Sachs, as a deckhand on a commercial fishing boat in Alaska and as a United Nations volunteer refugee resettlement officer.
In his speech at Georgetown, McMullin stressed that the repercussions of foreign conflicts can manifest themselves domestically. He attributed the rise of forces such as the Islamic State Group to the withdrawal of American leadership in the Middle East, allowing terrorism to reign in the resulting power vacuum.
“We may wish that we could simply ignore the world, but we can be sure that the rest of the world will not ignore us,” McMullin said.
McMullin maintained that health crises such as Ebola in West Africa and Zika in Latin America, as well as cyberattacks originating in China, Russia and North Korea, are deeply emblematic of a globalized world order where foreign problems cause domestic concerns.
However, McMullin also acknowledged not all American national security problems originate overseas, citing the United States’ debt crisis as a threat to its ability to uphold its armed forces.
According to the United States Treasury, the current national debt stands around $19.5 trillion.
McMullin cautioned that without reforms, the United States will spend $100 million more annually on interest payments than on defense.
“This will confront us with an untenable choice between massive tax increases or drastic spending cuts that could dangerously weaken our armed forces,” McMullin said. “If we do nothing, our debt will spiral out of control, bringing us ever closer to economic calamity.”
The presidential candidate offered his solution, insisting the government must make responsible reforms to entitlement programs, which are estimated to consume well over 75 percent of the U.S. budget.
He strictly maintained that no further cuts should be imposed on the budget of U.S. Armed Forces, calling the $900 billion budget cut by the Pentagon’s ten-year spending plan under the Obama administration a costly mistake. According to McMullin, this mistake resulted in the armed forces shouldering half the burden of deficit reduction cutting measures, despite the military only accounting for every one in every six federal dollars.
“Our fiscal challenges are choking off the resources that our troops need to remain the best in the world,” McMullin said.
McMullin also criticized the subpar equipment of the military, some of which dates back to the 1980s and 90s. Furthermore, he argued the military has insufficient funds for training. As a believer in achieving peace through strength, he advocated for the improvement of military equipment and training in order to maintain an unquestionable advantage over the rapidly rising armies of countries such as China and Russia.
At the same time, McMullin emphasized how the American commitment to the principle of freedom, both economic and personal, enables it to build a global network of allies and partners who value its leadership instead of fearing its domination.
“We seek not to build an empire, but rather to lead by example, to be a strong friend, a trusted ally, and to the adversaries of liberty, a feared enemy,” McMullin said.
As a former CIA operative, he stressed his firsthand experience as an advantage if he were to become president.
“I’ve experienced multiple wars firsthand. They’re more horrible than people who haven’t experienced them can imagine,” McMullin said. “I learned the precious value of peace and, as President, it would drive me to take the necessary steps to ensure our security.”
McMullin finished his speech by highlighting key principles that he says will inform his leadership and help make America safer, including the importance of the President’s personal conduct, the promotion of democracy and fundamental human rights, and the U.S. duty to intervene when human rights violations occur abroad.
The speech was followed by a question-and-answer session and concluded with an opportunity for attendees to engage with the candidate personally.
During the question-and-answer session, the conversation broached on topics ranging from women’s rights in Saudi Arabia to the current refugee crisis.
Grant Olson (COL ’19), who attended the event, said he appreciated the aspect of the event that gave students the opportunity to ask McMullin questions about his foreign policy.
 
 
“I had read a lot about McMullin and his candidacy in the news over the summer, and I was incredibly excited to see him talk,” Olson said. “Even though I am not a supporter of his candidacy, he is an ideas-focused candidate who adds to the debate that we are having about the direction that we want to head in as a nation.”
Lizzie Porterfield (COL ’19), who met McMullin after the event, also said she believed McMullin heightens the level of national political discourse.
“He was a really nice, down-to-earth guy,” Porterfield said. “And his policies were precise and well thought-out.”

Georgetown Solidarity Committee members led a demonstration by around 25 students outside McShain Lounge in McCarthy Hall where contract negotiations between facilities workers and the university took place Thursday to advocate for improved wages and working conditions for facilities workers.
Facilities workers and administrators have been negotiating terms for a labor contract extension with the university since June. GSC, which has sought to observe the negotiations, has not been able to participate in the conversation between members of the union and the university because a mutually agreed federal mediator for the negotiations has excluded third party observation.
In a handout, GSC members specified goals of ending understaffing and alleged racism and discrimination in the workplace, tying yearly raises in pay to inflation in Washington, D.C., and a minimum wage starting at $15 per hour.
Union members were pushing for a six percent wage increase. The District’s minimum wage is currently $11.50.
GSC Member Lily Ryan (COL ’18) said she is frustrated with the working conditions utilities workers face at Georgetown, citing understaffing, racism in the workplace and low wages.
“Our goal here is to make sure the workers are being treated with dignity and respect by the administration and our hope is that students can help build power with workers to accomplish that,” Ryan said. “The plan is to make sure that the administration and the people negotiating and the workers know that students are consistently supporting them. Students are going to be out here to make sure they’re aware that we’re behind the workers all the way.”
The rally was scheduled in three stages throughout today’s day of negotiations. The first phase began at 9:30 a.m. outside of McShain Lounge and lasted until 10:30 a.m.; the second phase of action began at 1 p.m. and the third phase of action began at 3 p.m.
By the day’s lunchtime break, the union had conceded a percentage point increase in negotiations but had reached an agreement on a healthcare plan. Wage negotiations will continue next Tuesday and Wednesday and are expected to last from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on both days.
The demonstrators shouted chants of “Six percent, won’t settle for less,” and “Hey hey, ho ho, discrimination has got to go,” among others, in both English and Spanish. Chants after the lunchtime concession were altered to “Five percent, won’t settle for less!”
Half a dozen protestors marched with a megaphone aimed at the room where administrators and facilities workers were meeting for negotiations. In the afternoon sessions, around 25 protestors were present outside McShain Lounge.
A maintenance worker attending the negotiations, who asked to remain anonymous out of concern for administrative retaliation, said he was frustrated with inconsistent wage increase offers.
“They keep trying to give us two percent pay raise and we keep shoving it back to them,” he said. “The hospital got the same union and they make more than we make and they got the same job as some of us. … All of the skilled employees like plumbers, electricians, and maintenance mechanics, they make like $34, $35 an hour. Over here is like, make maybe $20, $23 an hour.”
GSC Member Esmeralda Huerta (SFS ’17) said university administrators have denied most of the workers’ requests.
“The university has been denying them for the past few months any request that they make. One of the things that the workers are asking for right now is a six percent wage increase every year over the next three years as well as better benefits, dignity and respect in the workplace. The university hasn’t really budged,” Huerta said.
Huerta said she hoped the student presence would encourage workers and show their support.
“What I see happening here is students and workers coming together to ask for more from this university for things that they righteously deserve,” Huerta said. “We’ll see what the result is, but given the fact that the university hasn’t given anything over the past couple of months, I’m furious and I wonder whether the university is going to negotiate.”

Although violent crime in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area has declined by more than 27 percent since 2006, there has been a recent surge in homicides, according to a Sept. 14 Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments report.
The report showed violent crimes had decreased from 21,483 reported incidents in 2006 to 15,543 in 2015, while property crime decreased 21 percent during the same period.
In the 2014 to 2015 period alone, violent crimes fells from 16,617 in 2014 to 15,543 in 2015.
However, last year saw a 55 percent increase in homicides, from 197 incidents in 2014 to 307 in 2015, and the incidence of sexual assaults increased by 3.7 percent. All other offenses were down year to year.
Maryland’s Takoma Park Police Department Chief Alan Goldberg noted the crime rate declined in the area despite an 80,000-person population increase in D.C. alone since 2000. The Takoma Park Department is one of the 21 departments covered in the report.
“It’s almost counterintuitive, since the population density has gone up and the crime rate continues to drop,” Goldberg said. “That’s a good thing, and we really don’t want to complain about it too much.”
Despite the decline, Goldberg said he found the increase in homicides over the past year troubling, particularly because they primarily occurred among subjects who knew each other — a factor Goldberg said makes them difficult to prevent.
“The vast majority of homicides are still known subjects,” Goldberg said. “They’re not stranger homicides, [so] there’s very little we can do to prevent that kind of crime.”
Goldberg noted the difficulty of pinpointing one factor contributing to the lower crime rate. He suggested addressing gang violence and fostering better communication between different police jurisdictions as a way to allow officers to use technology to stop criminals.
“The criminals go from one jurisdiction to another without concern, and we are limited by our jurisdictions,” Goldberg said. “We actually do a much better job now of communicating and cooperating. We have been targeting some of the more violent criminals and groups.”
The MPD also noted the importance of community policing in lessening violent crime. In a statement to The Hoya, the MPD said the department would continue to assess its crime stopping capabilities in order to make D.C. safer.
“The Metropolitan Police Department is pleased to have seen a decrease in violent crimes in the District of Columbia the past ten years,” the statement read. “It is our philosophy to reduce violent crimes and we do this by building trust among all segments of the community, and by building relationships.”
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber said crime rates tend to fluctuate due to the large number of outside factors involved, including legislation and the state of the economy. He said another reason crime rates have decreased is due to better community policing in neighborhoods around the District.
“[Community policing] is being part of the community,” Gruber said. “Getting out of your cars and meeting the community, getting to know the people in the community, doing joint community events, going to community meetings, helping with problem solving in the community.”
Gruber noted despite the decrease, places like Georgetown are not immune to crime, citing the four recent sexual assaults in the Georgetown neighborhood as an example. He said students should continue to help GUPD keep the community safe by reporting suspicious activity to officers.
“Georgetown’s insulated in some ways because we’re in a contiguous campus and we’re in a nice neighborhood, but we still have crime here,” Gruber said. “We had the sexual assaults, the unlawful touching and we still see property taken from campus because of unlocked and open doors.”
Georgetown Law’s Institute of Criminal Law Co-Director and Professor William McDonald attributed some of the decreased crime in the city to the increase of immigrants, who he said statistically have lower rates of crime in their communities.
“Migrants, such as in New York City, are moving into old areas of the city where nobody else would want to live and they’re fixing them up,” McDonald said. “They’re not involved in crime, and they have lower crime rates than natives.”

The university’s most profitable fundraising campaign in history, “For Generations to Come: The Campaign for Georgetown,” ended this June, raising $1.67 billion and surpassing its initial goal by more than $170 million.
Since its inception in 2006, the campaign has generated donations used to fund the launch of the McCourt School of Public Policy, academic centers such as the Steers Center for Global Real Estate at the McDonough School, construction projects such as the John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletic Center, faculty endowments and increased scholarship funding.
In a university-wide email to students sent on Sept. 16, Olson announced that during October, the university will host a series of events to commemorate the campaign. The first of these, a “Campaign Cookout” in Red Square, will take place on Friday, Oct. 7 and be followed by “Hoya Gateway Live,” a student-alumni networking event in the Healy Family Student Center.
“As a university community, we will be celebrating For Generations To Come: The Campaign For Georgetown, the most successful fundraising endeavor in the university’s history,” Olson wrote. “We set out ten years ago in pursuit of an ambitious set of goals to advance Georgetown—and with the support of our generous community of donors, including record-breaking participation from our student body, we were able to achieve extraordinary things.”
Vice President of Advancement Bart Moore (SFS ’87) said that philanthropic efforts are essential to preserving the mission of Georgetown.
“Great universities are built on great philanthropy. The university sector has learned that excellence in high education is not a readily profit generating business,” Moore said. “So we think it is a truth that to be an outstanding university dedicated to research and teaching, that the ever high level that defines excellence in higher education globally, that requires philanthropy.”
In Sept. 2015, after meeting its initial goal of $1.5 billion, the campaign allocated 42 percent of its funds to academics and 26 percent to recruiting students. The remaining funds were divided between student life and other new initiatives.
Forty-eight percent of donations came from alumni, in addition to 9 percent from parents and 7.5 percent from unaffiliated individuals. The remaining balance came from corporations and foundations, such as the Coca-Cola Foundation and family foundations of university alumni.
Though ultimately the most successful campaign in university history, it faced roadblocks during the mid-2000s as a result of the global financial crisis. Having a particularly difficult time achieving fundraising goals in fiscal year 2010, during which the campaign was only able to raise $96 million, Moore said the university made the decision to delay the initiation of the campaign’s public period by 18 months, beginning public fundraising efforts in October 2011.
Despite this period of slow fundraising, the campaign rebounded with a series of significant donations, including $100 million from Frank McCourt in fiscal year 2014 — the most successful year of the campaign.
Over the course of the 10-year campaign, fundraising methods transitioned from traditional mailing systems to social media and online advertising efforts. By 2014, 50 percent of all donations were made online, compared to less than 10 percent of those in 2010.
Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson said that the fundraising campaign has enhanced the university’s ability to provide opportunities for its students.
“For my part, I will note that this campaign, ‘For Generations to Come,’ has been a huge benefit to students — through strengthening our faculty, through the ambitious support for financial aid and access to Georgetown, and through new facilities like the Healey Family Student Center,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
More recently, the fundraising campaign engaged in an effort entitled “The Power of Many: Participation Matters” to increase undergraduate alumni participation, with a 35.3 percent participation rate as of June 2016.
Moore said that he is proud of the fact that the campaign was able to achieve an undergraduate alumni participation rate that he estimates is among the top 20 in the country.
“What everyone in higher education fundraising looks at is not the total number of donors but what percentage of your [donors are alumni]. It’s something that we all track, we report proudly and we’re very competitive about,” Moore said.
As part of the campaign, The Georgetown Fund recently began directing all of its donations to the 1789 Scholarship Fund, for the Georgetown Scholarship Program. After raising $428,576,224, the 1789 Scholarship Fund aims to support 1,789 undergraduate scholarships annually, with scholarships being provided in increments of $25,000.
In a university press release, Dean of Admissions Charles A. Deacon (C ’64, MA ’69) said that providing better financial aid to international students has become a priority.
“It is important for Georgetown to continue developing support for scholarships,” Deacon said. “One of our goals is to create a larger pool of funds for international students, where the need is significant. Increasing our scholarship support for these students builds the opportunity for the university to play a greater role in the global community.”

Professors have been transitioning to Canvas – an alternative to learning management system Blackboard – after the university made the system available to all professors for this Fall.
Current students and faculty who use Canvas have reported that while there have been challenges transitioning to the new system’s interface, the system is more flexible than Blackboard.
The university piloted Canvas last spring in several main campus courses, before making the learning management system available to all professors to use for their courses. This fall’s transition to Canvas – which included moving Blackboard courses to Canvas, training teachers and an annual subscription fee – has cost the university $250,000.
Georgetown joins a series schools including the University of Maryland and the University of California, Davis in transitioning to Canvas.
According to Interim Vice President of University Information Services and Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson, faculty members have been pushing for a more modern, intuitive, and efficient course management system for years. UIS found Canvas to be a suitable alternative for Blackboard.
“Canvas provides a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface,” Nicholson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It was designed from the start to address user expectations for mobile access, improved notification, collaboration, and multimedia support with easy integration to a variety of tools using the latest standards.  As a cloud-based system that is continually updated, it provides an open, stable and scalable platform.”
According to Nicholson UIS plans to survey faculty later this fall to learn more about their experience with the system
“Faculty and student reception and adoption of the new platform will determine how we move forward with the implementation of Canvas and Blackboard,” Nicholson wrote.
Canvas has been well-received by faculty and students alike since its introduction in some classes this fall, according to Nicholson. However, some students and faculty have reported some difficulties in the transition.
“Both faculty and students expressed that Canvas has a learning curve and that faculty need support to be able to effectively and strategically integrate it into their courses,” Nicholson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Faculty noted specifically that Canvas was responsive, flexible and easy to use.”
Performing arts professor Robynn Stilwell, who was a part of the spring pilot program, has switched all of her courses to Canvas. Stilwell said she has appreciated Canvas’ flexibility over Blackboard.
“I’m actually really excited about Canvas, as much as you can be with something like that,” Stilwell said. “I’ve felt that Blackboard for a while has been okay, it’s been useful, but it hasn’t been as flexible as I would’ve liked whereas Canvas allows me to do a lot more a lot quicker than I could do with Blackboard.”
Leigh Ann Fairley (COL ’19), whose history professor uses Canvas, said that the transition to Canvas has been challenging because of a lack of training for students.
“My history teacher puts all course materials on Canvas but has not explained to us how to use Canvas,” Fairley said. “So I have no idea how to access any of the materials for class and it’s very frustrating.
Stilwell said Canvas is more intuitive than Blackboard and will become the preferred learning management system for Professors once the Georgetown community as a whole gets more comfortable with how it works.
“What I find is that [Canvas] is a lot more instinctive than Blackboard, you still have to look up how to do things but it’s not as old fashioned as Blackboard,” Stilwell said.

During this year’s unconventional election season, the media is subject to a barrage of public distrust, according to a panel event organized by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and the School of Continuing Studies on Monday.
Moderated by independent journalist and Professor Linda Kramer Jenning, the panel featured GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), The Washington Post’s Deputy National Political Editor Rebecca Sinderbrand (COL ’99), former Senior Policy and Political Adviser to the Jeb Bush presidential campaign Michael Steel and The Daily Beast’s Washington Bureau Chief Jackie Kucinich. Sinderbrand and Steel are GU Politics 2016 Fall Fellows, and Kucinich is a 2016 Spring Fellow.
The event began with the four panelists giving a grade to media coverage of the current election. Elleithee gave the media a C, while Sinderbrand gave a B, Steel a C and Kucinich a B+.
According to Elleithee, it is difficult for the media to operate amid a shifting political landscape.
“I’m going to start by saying I am not one of those political hacks who just throws bombs at reporters all the time. I actually like the press,” Elleithee said. “The age of communications that we live in right now is so rapidly transforming, and I think the press as an industry itself is also so rapidly transforming that it’s struggling to keep up. I don’t think you need much greater evidence of that than public opinion polls that tell you people trust the media just a hair more than they trust politicians.”
Sinderbrand praised the efforts of The Washington Post, which has been subject to a revocation of press credentials by Republican candidate Donald Trump’s campaign.
“I feel The Washington Post is doing a pretty good job this election,” Sinderbrand said. “We have a very good team, very dedicated journalists. I think we’ve done a good job of balancing different areas of coverage.”
Steel claimed the media was ill-equipped to cover the unique candidacies of Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
“What my grade reflects is a bifurcated opinion. There are individual reporters and institutions doing an incredible job covering this campaign,” Steel said. “The media as an institution has failed to successfully grapple with the challenges posed by the candidacies of Donald Trump and Secretary Clinton. Donald Trump is covered as an entertainer. Secretary Clinton has used the sideshow that is Donald Trump and the coverage around him to insulate herself from the press to a remarkable degree.”
Kucinich said her publication, The Daily Beast, managed balanced coverage but stressed it was difficult to assess the media as a whole.
“I write for a small publication, and when I see big publications publishing stories that we wrote a year ago, I think that we did a pretty good job,” Kucinich said. “It is hard to judge us as a monolith. These are very hard people to cover. Every election feels important, but for some reason this election feels more important.”
When Jenning asked whether there are certain strategies journalists should be implementing given the obstacles in this current election, Steel called for equal air time between the candidates.
“I would make one modest proposal particularly to cable news: some modicum of equal time,” Steel said. “Donald Trump’s every carnival show is broadcast in full. I don’t think Secretary Clinton has gotten anything like that wall-to-wall coverage.”
Elleithee reflected on how social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are increasingly impacting voter outlooks.
“What the press used to be able to do in presenting the world with at least a set of facts. Now we don’t even agree on that,” Elleithee said. “People are consuming information differently, and the way they’re consuming information is putting them in information silos.”
Steel also addressed the importance of fact-checking in an era when candidates repeatedly go back on their statements.
“Usually, if you get the fact checked enough on the same lie, you stop saying the lie,” Steel said. “Donald Trump’s just impervious to it this year.”
Elleithee anticipated a confrontational relationship between the White House and the press regardless of who assumes office in January.
“I don’t see a time in the immediate future where you’re going to have a comfortable, open relationship between whomever occupies the Oval Office and the press,” Elleithee said. “I want more access. I don’t see it happening any time soon, no matter whom is elected president.”
Steel further emphasized the vital role of the press in maintaining government transparency.
“I worry about honesty and truth,” Steel said. “Both for practical and idealistic reasons, if you are a presidential candidate, except on matters of actual security where perhaps there are many reasons not to, you tell the truth.”
The floor was then opened to questions from the audience, which ranged from the safety of reporters to objectivity in journalism. Sinderbrand described how The Washington Post attempts to stifle displays of partisanship in reporting.
“In my own news organization, you can get fired for a Facebook post, or a t-shirt, for going to an event that has a political tinge and you didn’t even realize,” Sinderbrand said. “People think about this constantly, and I work and have worked with some journalists in this town for years and could not tell you what their own personal political views are. To a certain extent, it’s a formula; you’re looking to break the news, you’re not rooting for anyone, you’re rooting for ‘I want to get this story right.’”

As part of the university’s selection process for a new dean, the Georgetown College Dean Search Committee hosted four town halls Tuesday to gather student and faculty opinion on selection criteria for a replacement for Dean of the College Chester Gillis.
Held in the Arrupe Hall multipurpose room, the town halls were held in four different timeslots during the day, each for different groups on campus – one session for undergraduate students, one session for graduate students and two sessions for staff and faculty. Led by Terry Pinkard the 24 members of the search committee – which include senior leadership in various departments, staff members and students – attended the town halls.
Gillis announced last spring he would step down as dean by the end of the 2016-2017 academic year, and will return as a faculty member in the theology department. Before beginning his tenure as dean in 2009, Gillis was the Amaturo chair in the theology department.
According to the leadership profile posted by the university on Georgetown’s website – which is used to guide the selection process – the new dean needs to demonstrate excellence in both academics and administration and be able to lead the college in a changing academic landscape.
“The ideal candidate for this position will be an accomplished scholar, a talented administrator, and a strategic thinker with the intellectual and personal qualities essential to guiding the College through a challenging and changing academic environment,” the profile read.
The new dean will also assist the university in several large projects, including expansions to academic programs and further support for the Working Group on Racial Injustice.
“The College will contribute to several transformational initiatives currently underway, including a major expansion of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Working Group on Racial Injustice, the establishment of a Humanities Center,” the profile read.
The Dean of the College is responsible for managing and supporting the 26 academic departments and 12 interdisciplinary programs in the school. The dean also oversees the development of academic policy and curriculum for the college.
