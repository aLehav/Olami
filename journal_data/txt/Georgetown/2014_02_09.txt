Georgetown Campus Ministry hosted an interfaith dialogue jointly sponsored by the Muslim and Hindu Student Associations on Wednesday night in Makom.
Now in its third year, the event has helped students open up to the discussion of differing religious views, according to former President of the Interfaith Student Association Aamir Hussain (COL ’14).
“People didn’t know how to [talk about religion] without offending anybody … but I think that through the interfaith dialogues, students have been able to really talk on a personal level for the first time,” he said.
Throughout the evening, members of both religions chatted and intermixed seamlessly. The only moment that segregated the students was when the room broke into prayer. However, this provided an opportunity for students to witness the practices of the other faith.
The event began with presentations by the presidents of both the Hindu and Muslim student groups, which gave the audience a background of the fundamental elements of each faith.
Despite the fundamental differences in the foundations of these religions, such as the monotheistic Islam versus the polytheistic Hinduism, the faiths have similarities.
“Small actions, that’s a great similarity [between Hinduism and Islam]. … Small actions can be worshipped,” MSA President Erva Khan (NHS ’15) said.
Leaders of both the MSA and the HSA found similarities within their respective religious practices, including traditions such as fasting and washing or showering before praying.
Overall, the event took place without a hitch, and members of both faiths learned about the other’s belief system and culture.
“It was definitely a learning experience. Certain topics caused more conversation than others, but we didn’t have any controversy,” Khan said.
Hussain acknowledged that there could have been testy moments of discussion, but that the students were ready to talk about all subjects. One such controversial topic is the ongoing hostilities between India and Pakistan in the Kashmir region. Recently the site of increased violence, Kashmir has always been an obstacle to peaceful relations between the predominantly Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan.
“Hindu-Muslim conversations can have many obstacles, [but] students are prepared to reflect on difficult topics,” Hussain said.
However, this interfaith dialogue event was designed to avoid controversial topics, intended instead to promote the aspects of either religion that bond the students as people.
When the students were divided into small groups of both Muslims and Hindus, they drew upon commonalities between the faiths in order to find common ground. Within the discussion sections, students had the opportunity to discuss an array of topics, including how their religion has impacted their beliefs on various subjects, from science and religion to morals and family.
The Muslim-Hindu interfaith event has grown in size since the first event two years ago, and involved participation from students in multiple campus organizations, in addition to members of the respective religious groups’ boards.
Hussain was pleasantly surprised with the discovered shared ideals of the two faiths and emphasized the need for more interfaith dialogue at Georgetown in the near future.
“How we grew up, how we got our morals, how our families influenced us, a lot of that is really similar. I was impressed by how close we actually were,” Hussain said. “This event [was] the next in a series of steps designed to make interfaith work more central to student programming.”

In a lecture focused on the political changes in Europe following World War I, Andrew Sobanet, chair of the French department, examined the rise of Stalinist thought in France during the early 20th century Thursday.
The lecture, held in the Intercultural Center, was part of the “War to End All Wars” series organized by professors Anna von der Goltz and Peter Pfeiffer.
In his hour-long lecture sponsored by the BMW Center for German and European Studies, Sobanetargued that pacifists in the post-World War I era created fertile ground for the rise of Stalinism in countries such as France. This sentiment is epitomized in the works of arguably the two most prominent active intellectuals in France at the time, Romain Rolland and Henri Barbusse.
“It is through these two figures that we can get a sense of how the First World War factored in the rise of what I call ‘Generation Stalin,’ that is, a large number of French intellectuals and writers who either as members of the French Communist Party or as fellow travelers worked in concert with Soviet-mandated policy to promote – in the West – Stalin, the USSR and international communism in the late1920s through the mid-1950s,” Sobanet said.
Sobanet argued that although writers like Barbusse espoused pacifist ideas in their works, they contributed to political unrest in that they were not necessarily advocating for non-violence.
“Barbusse’s mode of pacifism – and this is one of the paradoxes of certain types of pacifism – might be anti-war and specifically anti-imperialist war, but it is not necessarily anti-violence,” Sobanet said. “This brand of pacifism came to symbolize the rallying cry for various communist groups that emphasized the ends over the means.”
Sobanet also touched on how writers such as Rolland remained ardent supporters of the USSR as fascist regimes began to take shape in countries like Italy and Germany in the early 1930s, even as the Soviet regime became more and more brutal in its political repression.
“[Rolland] wrote, ‘Whatever the errors, the stupidities and often even the crimes of the Russian Revolution, it represents the greatest, most powerful and most important social movement in modern Europe.’ It was not an entirely new stance for Rolland, who even in the early years of the French Revolution was unable to justify its violence, and the Bolsheviks’ lack of respect for human life,”Sobanet said.
Ultimately, Sobanet centered in on the question of why Rolland and Barbusse, despite the blatant political repression, poor living conditions and authoritarian nature of the Soviet regime, continued to support it as a path for world peace.
“Beyond their published work, it’s very difficult to guess whether there were ulterior motives as to why they remained supportive of the Soviets, other than their stated reasons,” Sobanet said.
Audience members engaged in a wide-ranging question-and-answer session with Sobanet following the lecture, in which audience members shared their opinions on why leaders like Stalin were able to gain popular and ideological support among educated Westerners.
Von der Goltz explained that the “War to End All Wars” lecture series is meant to explore World War I from literary and historical perspectives that give a more comprehensive view.
“Professor Sobonet’s main focus is on France in the context of the First World War, but all these events throughout the semester will look at many different angles of the war’s impact on the world,” von der Goltz said.
Phoebe Wood, events coordinator at the BMW Center, believes that lectures like Sobanet’s provide a gateway to discussions about even bigger historical trends.
“The idea for this event was to highlight professor Sobanet’s work as part of this broader dialogue on how World War I affected the political development of Europe in the 20th century,” Wood said.

Israeli author and journalist Ari Shavit discussed his new book, “My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel,” on Tuesday in Copley Formal Lounge as part of the Georgetown University Program for Jewish Civilization’s spring lecture series.
Shavit is a senior correspondent and member of the editorial board at Haaretz, a leading Israeli newspaper. He has served as a paratrooper in the Israeli Defense Force and is a commentator on Israeli public television.
Shavit spoke about why he wrote “My Promised Land” and about modern Israel’s perceived challenges. Some of Shavit’s ancestors were early Zionists, a fact which led him to admit he initially wrote the book for personal reasons.
“Almost since I remember myself, definitely since I turned into a young adult, I had the feeling that I was born into a unique nation, that I was born into a unique historical event, and I felt that there is a need for me … to ask myself what is it all about, what is happening that I am taking part of,” Shavit said.
Shavit saw this work, based on his personal experience living in Israel, as filling a niche in the literary world.
“I did not see a book that tries to capture the overall Israel narrative in a personal way, definitely not in the last decades. And as I looked at the shelf again with so many great books there, I came to the conclusion that this is no accident that the reason there is no such book is that we have lost our narrative,” Shavit said. “This is especially troubling in the case of Israel because we were a narrative before we were a nation.”
After discussing his inspiration for the book, Shavit then discussed some contentious issues facing modern Israel. He defended the Zionists but recognized the gravity of Israel’s tensions with its neighbors.
“What you have there in the very beginning are the two elements in my mind that define Israel and the Israeli condition to this day. On the one hand you have the triumph, the most daring, impressive and just project one can imagine, and on the other hand you have the tragic flaw,” Shavit said. “There was nothing evil about it, there was no racism there but there was a tragic flaw built into this project. We went into a country that had other people and we went into a region that is probably the most brutal region on the face of the earth.”
Shavit’s speech was followed by a response from Daniel Schueftan, an Israeli and the director of the National Security Studies Center at the University of Haifa. Shueftan spoke in support of Shavit’s chapter, in which he defends some of Israel’s actions in during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.
In particular, Shavit defended the expulsion of 50,000-70,000 Palestinians from the cities of Lydda and Ramle by Israeli troops.
“Lydda was a tragedy for the Palestinians, [but] Lydda could not have happened had the Arabs taken other choices, and I don’t see this as the dark side of Israel,” Schueftan said. “I see it as something that I would have been delighted had it not happened. I would have been delighted if we could have come into existence without creating a tragedy for the other people, but here I agree that it is historically inevitable if you bring into your historical analysis the attitude of the Arabs.”
After Schueftan’s comments, the event transitioned to a question-and-answer session. Shavit answered queries concerning the trend of falling support for Israel among American college students.
“I take Iran very seriously and I take the occupation [in the West Bank] seriously, [but] I think this issue of building back Israel’s legitimacy [is vital]. … We really have to open peoples’ hearts. This is a world of soft power and it is as if our leaders have not heard about it and we must take action quickly and dramatically to reposition ourselves,” Shavit said.
Many members of the audience had brought their copies of “My Promised Land” to be signed.
“What he was saying was all the stuff that I believed already but not in as clear a way and not in a way that I could have presented nearly as well,” said Tom Goldring, a mathematician for the Department of Defense. He found out about the speaker through Washington Jewish Week.
Throughout the lecture, Shavit emphasized the importance of understanding Israel’s past in context of the region and Jewish history.
“The secret aim was actually to enable people to love Israel again, but in a critical way, in a realistic way, while being aware of Israel’s flaws, Israel’s wrinkles and Israel’s dark sides,” Shavit said.

Gary Bass, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton, presented his most recent book, “The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide,” on Thursday at the Mortara Center.
The book provides the first full account of the role that former President Richard Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger played in the 1971 genocide that resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of people and over 10 million refugees fleeing from Pakistan to India.
“In this case, the [United States] is intervening from the beginning, on the side of the military dictatorship engaged in crimes against humanity, against its own population,” Bass said.
On March 25, 1971, the West Pakistani army – Bangladesh was then part of Pakistan and known as “East Pakistan” – participated in one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the century. They launched a strict crackdown, Operation Searchlight, on ethnic Bengali civilians in East Pakistan after demands that the West Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 Pakistani democratic elections.
“No country, not even the United States, can prevent mass genocide wherever it happens,” Bass said. “But this is a case where the atrocity is being carried out by a close U.S. ally that prizes its relationship with the Untied States.”
Kissinger and Nixon were allegedly aware of the situation as the United States Foreign Service informed them and numerous cables were sent back to the United States with documentation.
Archer Blood, an American diplomat in Bangladesh, sent a strongly worded telegram, written by himself and other Foreign Service officers, which came to be known as the Blood Telegram.
“Our government has failed to denounce atrocities. … We, as professional civil servants, express our dissent with current policy and fervently hope that our true and lasting interests here can be defined and our policies redirected,” the telegram read.
According to Bass, the ambassador to India, Kenneth Keating, even confronted Nixon and Kissinger about the genocide against Hindus in the area.
“Kissinger makes it clear that he knows about, not just killings, but the targeting of Hindus,” Bass said.
The United States also supplied weapons to West Pakistan. Furthermore, when war broke out, the United States did not press West Pakistan not to use weapons supplied by the United States, did not impose conditions for using the weapons and did not publicly condemn them.
“There are U.S. tanks rolling through the streets of Dhaka. There are U.S. jeeps with U.S. machine guns mounted on them shooting at civilians in Dhaka,” Bass said. “You might think this is foreign policy on auto-pilot. But, in fact, Nixon and Kissinger are very engaged in South Asia.”
Nixon and Kissinger, against a strict Congressional arms embargo, sent weapons to assist the West Pakistani army, which killed countless Bengali civilians. Against persistent advice from advisors in the White House, Nixon and Kissinger proceeded with the shipment of weapons through Jordan and Iran.
“They don’t make appeals to theories of executive power,” Bass said. “They don’t ask for a memo explaining why this is part of commander-in-chief authority.”
According to Bass, White House tapes reveal that, in a meeting before they decided to send the weapons, Nixon asks Kissinger, “Henry, is it so much against our law?” After Kissinger explains that it is, Nixon responds, “Hell, we’ve done worse.”
Attendees found Bass’ discussion both informational and entertaining.
“I just find it fascinating, especially with the White House tapes,” Jonathan Kennedy (GRD ’14) said. “Never before has there been such an accurate portrayal of what the most powerful leaders in the [United States] were talking about and it really adds some unique insight.”
Bass pointed out that it was also strategically unwise to supply weapons to West Pakistan. Once India’s military got involved in December of 1971, it was clear that India would prevail.
Bass also attempts to understand why Nixon and Kissinger would support West Pakistan.
“To be fair, the opening to China is a huge and important achievement,” Bass said. “It helps to win the Cold War and end the Vietnam War, and I want to give full credit to Nixon and Kissinger for that.”
Bass also pointed out that the main reason Nixon supported West Pakistan was because he feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would lead to Soviet domination in that area. This would undermine the power of the United States in the world as well as the power of America’s new ally, China.
Bass debated both sides of the war, highlighting the complexity of the issue. He pointed out that Nixon and Kissinger’s goals came at a price for Indians and Bangladeshis.
When asked whether Kissinger commented on the book, Bass said that although Bass did not receive a response from Kissinger on his book, Bass did attempt to get his opinion.
“I work very hard to present all perspectives but Kissinger ignored me three times, and turned me down once,” Bass said. “But he’d be stupid to respond because then it would create a news story.”
According to Bass, the book gives a deeper insight on the issue of why Nixon and Kissinger took risks to equip West Pakistan with weapons. Although it was perceived as statistically and morally unwise, he explained Nixon and Kissinger’s behavior from a different angle.
“Nixon and Kissinger were often propelled by emotion, instead of calculations,” Bass said.

New York Times columnist Suleika Jaouad shared her experience as a young adult battling cancer at the 2014 American Cancer Society Relay for Life Kickoff on Wednesday evening.
Jaouad was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia in 2011, less than a year after graduating from Princeton University.
“I didn’t know what was wrong. My head was pounding and I felt really tired and I didn’t recognize myself in the mirror,” Jaouad said.
Jaouad had to undergo chemotherapy treatments as well as a bone marrow transplant.
Jaouad’s column in The New York Times, “Life, Interrupted,” chronicles her experience of battling cancer during her 20s.
“As most of my friends were starting their careers, travelling the world and going to parties, I felt stuck. It was impossible for me to look into the future. The future suddenly became this very scary, unpredictable place,” Jaouad said.
An aspiring journalist, Jaouad saw her column as an opportunity to report on an issue not commonly discussed in the media.
“I wanted to be a war correspondent. I started to realize that there’s a lot of different kind of war reporting that you can do that doesn’t necessarily take place on a battlefield,” Jaouad said. “I found it incredibly liberating to report from the front lines of my hospital room.”
The American Cancer Society allowed Jaouad and her mother to stay at the Hope Lodge, a residence where cancer patients and their caretakers can stay for free when receiving treatment in another city, for four months after Jaouad received her bone marrow transplant in a New York City hospital.
“What the American Cancer Society does, in addition to funding research for clinical trials, is prevent a medical crisis from becoming a financial crisis,” Jaouad said.
Wednesday’s kickoff launched the 2014 Relay for Life season at Georgetown, which culminates in the main Relay event on Apr. 11.
“From the beginning, we knew that we wanted to get someone who would be able to speak to the whole student body and the whole Georgetown wider community,” Relay for Life Special Events Co-Chair Dale Barnhart (SFS ’14), who planned the event, said. “Jaouad was really a wonderful choice for that because what she says is so relevant to so many people our age.”
The university has hosted an annual Relay for Life event since 2007 and has raised a total of $2.1 million for the American Cancer Society. Last year, Georgetown received the Collegiate Top Five Per Capita award, a national honor from the American Cancer Society. The event raised $12.41 per undergraduate student at Georgetown in 2013.
“It can be discouraging sometimes to invest in cancer research and to invest in cancer organization. You don’t always see those results firsthand. But I wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for the American Cancer Society,” Jaouad said.
For the past two years, the Relay for Life Kickoff has been open house style and featured carnival games. This is the first year that a speaker came to campus for the kickoff.
“I was really excited to see how well this sort of event was able to engage people. I thought it talked more about our message than previous events had,” Barnhart said.
Each year, 72,000 young adults between the ages of 15 and 39 are diagnosed with cancer. According to a 2006 National Cancer Institute study, the survival rate for this age group has not improved as quickly as it has for other age groups.
“It was refreshing to hear someone talk about [their] experience as a young adult. You always hear about grandparents having cancer or parents having cancer, but you never hear about friends having cancer,” Relay for Life Executive Committee Recruitment Co-chair Cayla Fappiano (NHS ’15) said. “It was refreshing to hear from someone with a similar perspective as your own.”
While Jaouad’s story was personal and unique, Barnhart said that she felt that its larger message was not just applicable to those battling cancer.
“Her stories are not just about the treatments and the challenges of cancer, they are also about recognizing and celebrating moments of joy, small successes and marvelous hope, and that is a message that applies to us all,” Barnhart said.
