One day after the Saturday inauguration of Georgetown University Student Association President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18), the senate voted down the duo’s proposal to restructure the executive branch into policy coalitions in a sign of disconnect between the executive branch and senate.
The Mack-Andino bill proposed replacing existing policy teams with coalitions, which would have fewer members than the current teams, but would give those members more power to make direct policy decisions. The coalitions would also include members of organizations outside of GUSA.
The senate voted down the proposal, with the bill receiving only 13 of the 20 necessary votes to pass with a two-thirds majority of all senators. Nine senators voted against the bill, one abstained and seven senators were absent for the vote.
 
Before voting down the entire bill, the senate voted by acclamation to remove the substance of the reforms with amendments, leaving only the semantic change of renaming “policy teams” to “policy coalitions.” The Senate removed the ability of policy coalitions, which sought to bring together GUSA and student advocacy groups in developing policy, to be held in private and not publish meeting notes.
Mack said some senators said the vote to kill the bill was largely motivated by senators’ antipathy toward the new administration.
“A lot of people have moved past the election, but everyone has not. Getting hung up over semantics that do not affect the senate is something that speaks to that,” Mack said.
During the campaign in February, the majority of senators supported and campaigned for Mack and Andino’s opponents, Garet Williams (COL ’18) and Habon Ali (SFS ’18). Mack and Andino received 1,160 votes in the final round, defeating Williams and Ali by 34 votes.
Mack said the senate has been largely cooperative and helpful during the transition, but that the vote reflects the possibility that some senators have not yet accepted the election results. However, Mack said he is not concerned about the senate and the executive branch’s ability to work together on the administration’s proposed reforms.
“Folks who don’t want to work with us, and don’t want to improve Georgetown, can do as they please. There are enough senators that want to do the actual job, that it will not affect the ability of GUSA to get its work done,” Mack said. “There are a lot of senators who don’t want this to be what the senate is. And those are going to be the senators who are going to be working with us hand-in-hand on the ‘exec’ side.”
GUSA senator Isaac Liu (COL ’20), who helped the new administration write the bill, attributed some senators’ decisions to vote against it in part to resentment of the election results.
“A couple people are still not very happy about the election results, because it was so close,” Liu said. “Some of that anger has carried over and is not creating a productive environment.”
GUSA senator Zach Oschin (SFS ’20) said some senators remain hostile toward the new administration, but that he is optimistic the senate and executive will be able to work together.
“The people who are currently in the senate will get over that animosity,” Oschin said. “Hopefully, there will be a recognition that this is going to be the leaders of our student government, and we are not going to make progress by stifling what they want to do.”
Oschin said he did not agree with the administration’s proposed changes, but said the senate should have allowed the administration to enact its own agenda.
“If the executive wants to move forward with structuring their government in this way, the senate should be okay with changing the bylaws to fit that,” Oschin said. “Even if I disagree with that, we should respect the wishes of the executive and codify them in the bylaws.”
GUSA senator Scott Lowder (COL ’17), who is vice chair the Finance and Appropriations Committee that appropriates the student activity fee, said he voted to remove the provisions to have closed-door meetings and unpublished meeting notes in keeping with the principle of transparency, though he acknowledged they may do little practical harm.
“I doubt we’ll find anyone that says the public is banging down the door of the room to get into policy team meetings, but it definitely is about the principle,” Lowder said. “Some of us who supported those changes last year were hesitant about going back and making things less transparent.”
GUSA senator William Morris said the senate only voted to reject the bill because passing it would not be necessary for the administration to enact its proposed policies.
“While some may interpret Sunday’s debate as an example of Senate obstructionism towards the new administration, this is frankly not the case,” Morris wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Senate simply concluded that alterations to the bylaws were not needed for the Mack-Andino administration to move forward with their policy initiatives.”
Lowder said he rejected the bill in opposition to the name change and to signal opposition to parts of the new administration’s push to develop policy coalitions.
“Coalition, in the minds of many senators, myself included, becomes synonymous with heading back to a more insular GUSA that focuses on the opinions of certain student leaders rather than the student body at large,” Lowder said. “If the bill had passed, it wouldn’t have done a lot substantively. For me, the ‘No’ vote was to register opposition to codifying a whole new system again after we had this huge reform just one year ago.”
At the Saturday ceremony, Mack discussed his vision for what his administration will accomplish.
“We want to continue building on the good work that’s been done, but also reacting to things that students see as negative,” Mack said. “Jessica and I want to continue reaching out to people who oftentimes feel like they’ve been left out, and that they haven’t had a seat at the table.”
Former GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) spoke about the challenges of having such a limited time to enact her desired change.
“Obviously, if we each had four-year terms, it’d be great. We’d get a thousand things done. But the reality is we have only one year, and what you take out of the year is what’s really important, because at the end of the day, students need change,” Khan said.

At least Mack didn’t reflexively cry wolf and claim it was racism.  That’s something to be glad about.

So all the angry GUSA INSIDERS in the Senate, still steaming over Garet and Habon’s loss now won’t even let Mack and Andino, the administration that this student body chose, enact so much as a name change? A new low for GUSA.
[…] its first cohort of residents, who currently live there, was March 15, 2017. Mack and Andino were inaugurated March 18, […]

In the spirit of feminist activist Susan B. Anthony’s call to organize, agitate and educate, more than 100 invited speakers and 500 attendees convened for the fourth annual OWN IT summit Saturday in a daylong series of discussions on women’s rights and female empowerment.
The summit included panels, breakout sessions, performances and presentations, with three of the four main panels tasked with tackling these verbs as they relate to women. The fourth panel, Hoya Visionaries, featured female Georgetown faculty and alumnae.
University President John J. DeGioia kickstarted the summit, following a slam poem by Summer Durant (COL ’18) and a singing performance by former Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17). DeGioia said the summit embodied Georgetown’s commitment to inclusivity.
“Your presence and participation is a testament to the strength of our university’s commitment to fostering a sense of inclusiveness,” DeGioia said.
Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla., MSFS’ 04) received the 2017 OWN IT Trailblazer Award, which seeks to recognize an outstanding female leader. In her acceptance speech, Murphy said young girls should not be discouraged by those who doubt their abilities.
“I remember that any time I am discounted for my gender, my immigration status, my race or any other factor that’s out of my control, that I do what I’ve always done, and that’s to kill them with confidence,” Murphy said.
Murphy urged attendees to find their voice and forge their own unique path to success.
“I encourage you all to find your own voice, and to use it, and to blaze your own trail through the wild country that we find in our nation right now because this is not the time for silence. It’s the time for action,” Murphy said. “Together, we will blaze a trail, far and wide, so that every girl and every woman is empowered to choose her own future and seize her own destiny.”
OWN IT 2017 Executive Director Soraya Eid (MSB ’17) said in her opening address the summit is a call for further action to promote women’s rights.
“We must continue to listen and learn from those different than us,” Eid said. “Let’s do that here today, in a comfortable and welcoming environment. Wherever you lie on the gender spectrum, your contribution to advancing women’s rights is incredibly valuable.”
Twenty undergraduate women led the organization of the summit with the support of 70 male and female student volunteers. This year’s summit marked a roughly 38 percent decrease in attendance from last year’s 800 attendees.
Helen Brosnan (SFS ’16) and Kendall Ciesemier (COL ’15) started OWN IT at Georgetown in 2014, which has since expanded to 11 universities since its inaugural summit.
This year’s summit featured a number of changes from last year, including having four equally-sized panels and updated topics of discussion to reflect the current state of feminism.
According to Eid, the OWN IT board aimed to make the summit more relevant to the current state of feminism.
Eid said the structure of this year’s panels reflect the shift in dynamics within the women’s movement.
“You don’t really see any one woman leading the charge in any one cause or any one industry or one endeavor, very much you see communities of women coming together to support each other and lift each other up,” Eid said. “That’s why we went with four panels of equal sizes and equal lengths because we wanted to give everyone the same amount of time to share their incredibly valuable thoughts and experiences.”
According to Eid, Murphy was chosen for the award because of her status as a role model for Georgetown students.
“It was a remarkable, big achievement for us on the main stage,” Eid said. “But I think it’s beautiful because she’s a Hoya, so we can identify with her, and her life story is so moving and so beautiful.”
The two morning and afternoon panels were separated by breakout sessions, and within the breakout sessions attendees could choose from panels, workshops and office hours. Attendees had access to 90 breakout session speakers who spoke on topics ranging from “Storytelling in the Media” and “Arts & Activism” to “Deconstructing Masculinity” and “Inter-Religious Dialogue: Feminism & Faith.”
The office hours, capped at 10 participants each, were hosted by a diversity of speakers from the first female U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith to Muslim Girl Founder and Editor-in-Chief Amani Al-Khatabeh.
For Eid, the speakers at this year’s summit represented a variety of perspectives but all conveyed a distinct message of female empowerment.
“I’ve gotten a lot of feedback that a lot of women were super impressed by the diversity of the women on stage,” Eid said. “Every woman brought such a unique perspective and such fascinating stories and such passion.”
Correction: This article previously stated Soraya Eid (MSB ’17) is in the College; she is in the MSB. The article also previously stated the summit did not feature a keynote address; the summit featured a keynote address by Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla., MSFS’ 04).

When Zoe Mowl (SFS ’15) graduated, she did not join the 42 percent of her graduating class that went into consulting or financial services. Instead, she went to Junik, Kosovo to teach English to elementary school children through the Peace Corps.
Mowl, who is in her second year in Kosovo, is one of 31 alumni currently serving communities around the world in countries including Botswana, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Mongolia, Rwanda and Thailand through the federal volunteer program. These participants work in fields of education, health, agriculture, environment, youth development and economic development.
The 31 alumni currently in the Peace Corps are just a small fraction of a long history of Georgetown graduates’ involvement in the service. Since the Peace Corps was founded in 1961, Georgetown has produced 957 of its 225,000 volunteers. On Feb. 28, the Peace Corps ranked Georgetown seventh on its list of top volunteer-producing colleges of medium size, its 11th year in a row in the top 10 ranking.
Georgetown’s ranking is one component of its relationship with the Peace Corps. Last summer, the Peace Corps teamed up with the McDonough School of Business to create the Paul D. Coverdell Fellows Program, which offers scholarships to Returned Peace Corps Volunteers to attend graduate school.
Emily Webb, a public affairs specialist for the Peace Corps, said Georgetown plays an important role in the success of the organization.
“The Peace Corps thrives on a volunteer force that represents the best and the brightest our country has to offer, so we hope that Georgetown graduates can help to fortify that legacy for years to come,” Webb said.
Mowl said her commitment to service comes in part from the values she learned at Georgetown, specifically the Jesuit objective of being “women and men for others.”
“They influenced me through the Jesuit identity,” Mowl said. “They really drill in that those who have a lot should be giving back. They just make it clear that they expect this out of their students, that we will contribute to the greater good. Their identity pushes it towards students, and probably because they attract those students to begin with.”
Before her participation in the Peace Corps, Mowl was introduced to international service through several programs at Georgetown. She went to Ghana with the Summer Impacts Fellowship through the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation in her sophomore year, and spent two years working for the Center for Social Justice.
Elyssa Skeirik (SFS ’15) also joined the Peace Corps after graduation. Currently stationed in East Java, Indonesia, Skeirik works as a high school English teacher.
“Peace Corps is also an unmatched experience in terms of opportunities for cultural integration and technical training,” Skeirik wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Skeirik had served abroad before joining the Peace Corps. In the spring of 2014, she studied in Amman, Jordan, and taught Syrian refugees. After receiving grants from Georgetown’s Social Innovation and Public Service Fund and the School of Foreign Service, she continued that project through the summer.
Sheirik said her Georgetown education motivated her involvement in the Peace Corps.
“My Georgetown education taught me how to combine critical thinking with an open mind. Inside and outside the classroom I was confronted with new ideas and different cultures that challenged my conception of reality and broadened my worldview,” Skeirik wrote in an email to The Hoya.
An additional responsibility of a Peace Corps volunteer involves acting as an ambassador for the United States. Skeirik, who served as the vice president of the College Democrats while attending Georgetown, acknowledged the added struggle of representing the United States in the current political climate following President Donald Trump’s November victory.
“People here have a lot of questions and fears about what the Trump administration means for world politics, Indonesian-American relations, and particularly Muslim people – and I don’t know the right answers,” Skeirik wrote. “It sometimes feels like the US of today is a different place than the US I left a year ago, but ultimately my job is to represent the American people and I don’t think they have changed.”

The rift between Washington, D.C. leaders and the federal government has deepened as the House of Representatives passed an initial committee markup for the Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Act, a federal school voucher program for D.C., on Wednesday.
The act was voted through by the U.S. House of Representative’s Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Wednesday, despite District leaders criticizing federal interference in the city.
SOAR, Washington D.C.’s federally funded school voucher program, provides vouchers to more than 1,100 low-income D.C. students to transfer from public schools to private schools. Since being passed by Congress in 2004, the program also has provided federal funding to traditional public schools and public charter schools in the District.
However, Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the District’s non-voting delegate to Congress, opposed the bill, saying the SOAR Program weakens the public education system and serves as a partisan grab by congressional the District to test a contentious policy on a community outside of their constituency.
“The most interesting question today is why Republicans consider the D.C. voucher program necessary in light of such a strong charter school alternative choice from the public schools,” Norton said. “There is very limited support for private school vouchers in the Congress and in the nation. When Republicans cannot pass controversial national legislation, they instead abuse their power over a jurisdiction they view as defenseless.”
President Donald Trump promised to expand state school voucher programs by $20 billion, while Trump’s Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is also a champion of school voucher programs.
The Opportunity Scholarship Program, the central program that regulates the voucher funds within the District, faced mixed support among congressional leaders during the committee meeting.
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) sponsored the bill, arguing that it provides educational opportunities for District students.
“Providing every possible opportunity for students to achieve the best education available ensures that the next generation is on a path to success,” Chaffetz said at the committee markup session. “This is exactly why this SOAR reauthorization act is so desperately needed for what it will do.”
House Democrats proposed amendments to ensure that private schools participating in the voucher program must obey civil rights laws and protect LGBTQ students and students with disabilities.
However, these amendments failed along party lines.
A majority of D.C. councilmembers have maintained their opposition to the program.
Councilmembers, including David Grosso (I-At Large), Anita Bonds (D-At Large), Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), Trayon White (D-Ward 8), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7), Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1) and Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), sent a letter Tuesday to Chaffetz encouraging the committee to phase out the SOAR program, temporarily extending the program to allow students currently receiving vouchers to graduate from high school.
The councilmembers cited a U.S. Department of Education study on the effectiveness of the scholarships administered through the SOAR program, finding that the program has no effect on student achievement on math and English assessments.
“Despite ample evidence that the Congressionally-imposed voucher program is ineffective, and while D.C. public schools improve every year, some members of Congress continue to see our city as their personal petri dish,” the letter reads. “With the new Administration and leadership in the Department of Education, it is even clearer that our public education system is and will remain under attack.”
The letter also references studies on school voucher programs from school systems in Ohio, Louisiana and Indiana. In each of the states, student scores on math and English assessments fell between 6 and 25 percent.
Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) Communications Director Kevin Harries said Bowser has been a long-time champion of the SOAR Act because it offers area students greater choice in pursuing their education and provides funds necessary to improving District of Columbia Public Schools.
“It will safeguard millions of dollars in federal funds the District currently receives for both DCPS and D.C. Public Charter Schools,” Harries wrote regarding SOAR in an email to The Hoya. “The legislation has been an asset in helping Washington, D.C., become the fastest improving urban school district in the country, with increasing enrollment and graduation rates. Her goal is to ensure we are doubling down on these successes and expanding opportunities to every child in the District.”
House Democrats proposed amendments to ensure that private schools participating in the voucher program must obey civil rights laws and protect LGBTQ students and students with disabilities. However, these amendments failed along party lines.
At a Feb. 2 press conference, Bowser argued the District has achieved a balance between charter school options and the traditional public school system.
“We have achieved a delicate balance that has worked for us,” Bowser said. “There’s enough choice for parents who want to go outside of their neighborhood schools and we have a robust investment in our traditional public neighborhood schools.”
Despite her support, Bowser maintained her opposition to increased federal government interference in local education policy as inappropriate.
“People who like to experiment with education have sometimes looked to Washington, D.C., as a place to try things,” Bowser said. “In my discussions with the president and people who are surrounding him regarding education policy, my message is, ‘We got it right in D.C.’”
Rachel Sotsky, the executive director of Serving Our Children, the organization that distributes OSP funds to District students, said she was glad to see a program extended that helps District students gain access to education.
“We believe it is important to reauthorize the program, and that the House bill is an excellent measure,” Sotsky wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The councilmembers also took issue with the committee’s interference into District policies, calling the congressional action a violation of the Home Rule Act of 1973, which grants the District the power to elect its own city council and pass legislation.
“It is insulting to our constituents that members of Congress, where D.C. has no voting representation, would push their personal agendas on our city in a way they could never do in their home states,” the letter reads. “Attacking D.C. Home Rule, including any expansion of the voucher program, is irresponsible governing on the part of Congress.
[…] March, the U.S. House of Representative’s Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved reauthorization despite District leaders criticizing federal interference in the city. […]

After at least nine pregnant women were erroneously told they tested negative for the Zika virus and months of flawed testing, the Washington, D.C. Public Health Laboratory Division is being audited by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversee human tests in labs across the country.
Between July and December of last year, the PHL routinely made mistakes in testing that were noted or corrected for over six months.
The PHL’s procedures failed at two stages. A chemical indicator was over-diluted, rendering it less sensitive to detecting the Zika virus. Furthermore, a lab worker incorrectly entered a formula used to analyze test results into an electronic spreadsheet.
According to D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences Director Jenifer Smith, the city no longer employs any of the staff members who made the mistakes. During the period time of faulty testing, the PHL was understaffed and without permanent management.
One of the nine pregnant women tested positive for the virus. The other eight may have tested positive for antibodies that could signal the presence of the virus, but the tests were inconclusive. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol, these cases ought to have been treated as positive for Zika.
Zika is a virus that can be contracted after a bite from a carrier mosquito or through unprotected sexual activity with an infected partner. Those infected often exhibit symptoms of fever, red eyes, rash, joint pain and headaches.
If a woman is pregnant when she contracts the virus, her baby may suffer from the birth defect microcephaly, a condition characterized by a shrunken head and an underdeveloped brain.
As of March 8, the CDC has recorded 5,109 cases of Zika in the United States, and 38,099 cases in United States territories. Of the cases in the U.S., a majority came from people who travelled abroad to other affected areas. Currently, there are no medicines or vaccines to treat or prevent Zika.
Samples from approximately 400 District residents will be retested for the virus in light of the mistakes, including 294 from pregnant women that were sent directly to the CDC.
The audit could potentially lead to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to revoke the PHL’s license, shuttering it until it comes into compliance and preventing the facility from serving District residents.
The health care providers of individuals who tested positive for the virus during the retest process have been notified. The children of the infected pregnant women will be tested again after one year to assess their vitals and development.
The botched Zika testing was a major topic at the annual meeting of the D.C City Council’s Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety on Feb. 28. Smith explained the reaction to the inaccurate testing.
“Our response reflects our ethic and desire to be transparent,” Smith said. “As we received the initial results, we contacted over 3,000 medical providers, set up conference calls and a contact email to ensure their questions would be answered. We went one step further, and working with the mayor’s staff, we held a press conference sharing this information with the public.”
CDC spokesperson Benjamin Haynes said the center will be working to address the failed tests in the coming months.
“CDC has confirmed in the last two weeks that of the 62 samples they have retested to date, that two of the tests were incorrect,” Haynes wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The additional testing on the remaining samples will occur over the next few weeks and confirmed if any others are shown to be positive.”
PHL Director Anthony Tran, who discovered the testing mistakes last year, is no longer taking interviews.
According to Smith, the lab is now working on changing its protocols in an attempt to prevent future errors.
“Since the discovery of these errors, several measures have been instituted into the PHL to ensure that newly added tests are preforming optimally,” Smith said at the committee meeting. “PHL will conduct more extensive internal validation testing on all CDC issued protocols beyond what is recommended to verify that the tests work. Additionally, all protocols that involve a person embedding a calculation into a worksheet will be technically reviewed by at least one other individual for verification.”

Georgetown University Medical Center has begun two trials to test a cancer drug’s ability to modify the progression of Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, potentially creating the first drug to successfully combat these two diseases.
Nilotinib is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a drug treatment for leukemia. In 2015, GUMC researchers found that among 12 patients given nilotinib in small doses, the drug reduced the toxic proteins that build up in the brain with the development of Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s, without killing the brain cells.
These trials, which started Feb. 27, mark the second phase of trials launched in 2015.
The GUMC Parkinson’s trial will last one year. The outcomes will be evaluated after six and 12 months. Afterwards, patients will participate in a one-year extended trial to observe nilotinib’s long-term effects. The GUMC Alzheimer’s trial will last one year as well and include brain imaging and spinal fluid collections.
Novartis, the company that manufactures nilotinib, is donating the drug and the matching placebo pills for all the participants in the Parkinson’s study. For a 28-pill prescription for the higher doses used for leukemia, the cost would normally be between about $9,000 to $10,000.
Potential side effects of nilotinib include an elevated risk of heart rhythm disturbances. While the trials are using a lower dose than typically prescribed to cancer patients, the participants will be monitored every two to four weeks, and patients with heart diseases are barred from participating.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s are the two most common neurodegenerative diseases, and both arise from damage in brain cells.
Parkinson’s involves physical effects on movement such as tremors, stiffness, loss of balance and slurred speech. Alzheimer’s is characterized by memory problems, disorientation, mood swings and language difficulties.
Currently, there are no known cures for the diseases. Though medications able to treat the symptoms are available, none halt their progression.
Last year, the FDA approved this stage of testing after it evaluated the studies GUMC ran in 2015. These studies are based on years of research conducted by Charbel Moussa, the scientific and clinical research director for Georgetown’s Translational Neurotherapeutics Program.
Moussa performed the initial research on the effect of nilotinib on neurodegenerative diseases in animal models to ensure that the drug was worthwhile and safe to test on human patients.
Fernando Pagan, the medical director of the GUMC Translational Neurotherapeutics Program, is the principal investigator on the Parkinson’s study. Pagan had teamed up with Moussa for the 2015 trials.
He said the trials were designed to measure the effects the proposed treatment will have on the patients.
“This study isn’t for treating symptoms, but rather aims to modify disease progression,” Pagan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “If the drug is safe and shows some benefit, the drug would then need to be studied in a much larger population and at several different institutions. It’s important to note that while I’m optimistic and certainly hopeful, many drugs that do well in early phases of study fail in larger trials.”
GUMC Professor of Neurology and Director of the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown R. Scott Turner is serving as the principal investigator on the Alzheimer’s study.
Turner said the studies mark a significant point in the history of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s research.
“If successful, these trials would have a tremendous impact. Current treatments for AD and PD are symptomatic only — not disease-modifying. This may be a first,” Turner wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Jonathan Lessin, a retired anesthesiologist and one of Pagan’s patients, is currently in the screening phase to participate in the Parkinson’s study. He was diagnosed 14 years ago, at age 38. He will find out if he was approved for the study in the next few weeks, and he said he is hopeful about the possibility that the trial has an impact on patients suffering from these diseases.
“I’m cautiously optimistic,” Lessin said. “He’s had some pretty impressive results in mice that he’s cured of Parkinson’s. He’s got people to walk again and talk again — they were in stage four or five Parkinson’s. I’m always cautiously optimistic. I’ve heard so many things that were promising in the past.”
One way in which this phase’s trials differ from the one performed in 2015 is the inclusion of a placebo group, designed to test how much of the changes experienced by patients can be attributed to psychological factors and not the drug. Neither the patients nor the researchers will know who is in the experimental group and who is in the placebo group until the end of the trials.
According to Turner, if these trials are successful, then phase-three studies could begin. These would involve many more participants receiving treatment at study sites all over the country. This would be the next step toward FDA approval to prescribe nilotinib for neurodegenerative diseases, not just cancer.
Lessin, whose medical background helped him critically read and interpret the results of the 2015 phase-one study, found the trial’s potential to find cures for these diseases impressive.
“It’s the most promising research I’ve heard of in a long time about Parkinson’s,” Lessin said.

The 1634 Society is looking to raise $150,000 in its third annual One for Georgetown fundraising campaign, which launched March 15.
The campaign asks freshmen, sophomores and juniors to make a one-time donation of $1 to access daily free food, beverages and events for a month. The schedule of events is released weekly on social media and via email.
Student donations unlock scholarships for future undergraduate students in various increments. Donations up to $150,000 will be matched by an anonymous alumnus.
All proceeds will go to Georgetown’s general scholarship fund.
988 student donors have activated $15,000 in donations for the general scholarship fund as of March 19. The program hopes to reach 1,012 more donors to reach the full scholarship of $150,000.
In 2016, 38 percent of the student body participated in the campaign, raising $100,000 in scholarships.
This year, the program hopes to have 40 percent of students participate overall, which ideally consists of 51 percent participation among the freshman class, 41 percent of the sophomore class and 31 percent of the junior class, according to Caitlin Garrabrant (SFS ’18), one of two philanthropy chairs for the 1634 Society.
One for Georgetown 2017 has partnered thus far with Georgetown Bubble, GUGS, Dunkin Donuts and Ledo Pizza. Garrabrant said vendors connected to the Georgetown community have been especially supportive.
“I’m really excited about how much cooperation we’ve gotten from local vendors like Georgetown Bubble, Amsterdam Falafel Shop and Dog Tag Bakery that want to see the campaign be a success,” Garrabrant said.
Garrabrant said One for Georgetown has gained increased traction this year and is gradually becoming a well-known campus event.
“The purpose of the campaign is to foster a spirit of giving back at Georgetown in a way that is still financially feasible and inclusive for undergraduate students,” Garrabrant said. “This year we’ve really seen a lot of recognition of the campaign that we haven’t in years past. I’ve heard people explaining it to their friends as they’re walking up to the table, and most people already know how it works before they make a gift.”
Jack Pelose (COL ’19), who is responsible for marketing for the campaign, said One for Georgetown aims to make donating easy for students.
“I hope students realize that giving back to Georgetown doesn’t have to be difficult or onerous and can still have a tremendous impact,” Pelose said. “Scholarships are a great way to help people come to Georgetown who otherwise would not be able to come here and donations to scholarships almost completely go directly towards helping students.”
1634 Society President Luke Gile (SFS ’18) said interest in One for Georgetown has increased substantially over the past three years.
“I am most excited about this campaign because it’s the first year that every class has participated all three years. Even the juniors saw this campaign when they were freshmen,” Gile said. “People have come to expect it and get genuinely excited about it. We’ve built some buzz and students are starting to learn about and support our mission.”
Pelose said One for Georgetown is engaging in new ways to reach more Georgetown students, .
“We are trying to engage even more students before they even show up at one of our tables by increasing our social media presence and flyering across more of campus,” Pelose said. “We are also working to sustain engagement through our giveaway program. Students who engage with us on Snapchat will be entered into a drawing for a swag bag or a gift card to Sweetgreen or Good Stuff Eatery.”
Pelose said in order to increase their presence on campus, the campaign will continue to table in new locations.
“The biggest challenge is breaking through to students in the Georgetown environment, which is highly saturated with clubs and events,” Pelose said. “We try to break out of the noise by tabling in unique spots on campus so students will see us as they’re walking around.”

The Georgetown School of Continuing Studies finalized a partnership with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to provide scholarship benefits to current federal employees, the university announced in a press release Tuesday.
The scholarship benefits for federal civil servants applying to the SCS cover 10 percent of tuition costs each semester. Students using the program, called the OPM Federal Scholarship Alliance, can receive benefits for every semester during which they remain employed by the federal government.
In a statement provided to The Hoya, SCS Dean Kelly Otter said the collaboration will improve access for students and enrich the classroom academic environment.
“We are proud to expand and enhance the ability for qualified federal employees to access a world-class Georgetown education,” Otter said. “Federal employees bring a broad and rich perspective to the classroom which compliments the skills and knowledge of students working in other sectors. It is my hope that this agreement will expand educational opportunity for talented civil servants.”
According to the SCS website, the school was founded in 1970 and offers 17 Master of Professional Studies programs in areas including project management, technology management and global strategic communications. The school currently has a student body of about 2,200 students. Students can take classes at the school’s Washington, D.C. campus, and an expanding number of programs are offered online.
The partnership is the latest in a line of collaborations between the SCS and the federal government. In response to the 2013 federal government furlough, the school offered free courses to affected federal employees and contractors, and also trained and assisted outgoing executive branch staffers with future career plans during the 2016 presidential transition.
SCS Chief of Staff Kristen Consolo said the federal scholarship program is in keeping with the purpose of the school.
“We have a long history of trying to be cognizant of the needs of the workforce,” Consolo said. “This has kind of just grown out of that mentality that I think our school has had for its entire existence.”
Consolo said the timing of the program is not related to the recent transition of federal administrations, noting that the program had been in the works for nearly two years.
Though the focus of the program is on federal employees in the D.C. area, Consolo noted that the SCS has an expanding range of online programs that federal employees around the nation can use.
“More and more, how we offer more and more online programs is just going to make them more available to civil servants around the country,” SCS Manager of Communications Andrew Glass said. “The number going forward, it’s not going to just be in the D.C. area, it’s going to be in the states that we’re approved to operate in all around the country.”
Georgetown does not have any concrete prediction as to how many federal employees will enroll in the program, but several dozen current students may apply for a tuition reduction. About 7 percent of the 2,200-person student body works in public administration, a portion of which works in the federal government.

Washington, D.C., is ranked the fourth-most expensive city for renters in the United States. and sixth globally, according to a study released last month by Nested, a London-based online realtor and property research service.
Nested compared the average price of renting per square foot of property across 72 cities worldwide in its annual rental affordability index. A single person renting in the District can expect to pay $1,397.90 per month on average, requiring an annual income of at least $57,670.76.
For a family of four, rental costs soar to $2,652.44 per month, and a combined income of at least $109,756.14 is required. The price per square foot of property was calculated based on the average market rate for apartments, condominiums and houses in each of the cities included in the study.
Nested conducts the survey each year to raise awareness about the lack of affordable housing in cities worldwide.
“The comprehensive study was undertaken in order to understand the costs associated with renting as an individual and as a family, and to determine whether cities are becoming increasingly unaffordable,” the survey said.
According to the United States Social Security Administration’s most recent Average Wage Index, the average wage for Americans is $46,119.78. However, the SSA data show that about 67 percent of wage earners earned less than or equal to this number, making the District’s rental costs out of reach for most ordinary Americans.
The Georgetown Office of Neighborhood Life Director Cory Peterson said it is important for students to be aware of how to find affordable, safe housing that best meets their needs.
Peterson said the ONL has worked to get over 150 properties inspected and licensed with D.C.’s Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, which sets health and safety laws for student housing.
“Over spring break this year, ONL sent postcards to all sophomores to make sure students considering living off campus are aware of all the resources available to them,” Peterson said. “ONL encourages students to consider their options carefully — to shop around, talk to the ONL team and know their rights as tenants.”
Georgetown students have expressed frustration with housing prices in the Georgetown and Burleith neighborhoods.
Bianca DiSanto (MSB ’17) said she decided to live in university housing during her senior year because she found it to be a cheaper housing option than living off campus. (Full disclosure: DiSanto was a columnist for The Hoya last semester.)
“While I initially planned to move off campus for senior year, as my housing group began looking at the options available it quickly became obvious that the average rent for west Georgetown townhouses was well above what it would cost to live on campus,” DiSanto said. “As a result, we decided to just take our chances in entering the university’s townhouse lottery, and luckily it worked out for us.”
Adriana Kranjac (NHS ’17) chose to move off campus and said she has struggled with the cost of living in Georgetown as well as interacting with her private landlord.
“My rent is ridiculously high; it’s like robbery,” Kranjac said.
However, Clare Kelly (COL ’17) lives in Burleith and said she believes living off campus presents a better value for money for students.
“My rent is actually still a little lower than on-campus housing prices through Georgetown. which is why I decided it was possible to live off campus,” Kelly said. “There are definitely a lot of interesting and challenging issues surrounding housing for people in the greater D.C. area because of the definition of affordable and who or what kinds of people are intended to be given access to such spaces.”
Tori Morgan (COL’17), who also lives in Burleith, agreed that it is an affordable option for students who want to live off campus.
“I calculated last year that living off campus for an academic year was about $250 cheaper than living on campus, which is not a huge difference in price,” Morgan said. “That said, the square footage that my rent buys me is strikingly more than what I could get on campus.”

The university launched a website dedicated to Georgetown women in science March 9 in conjunction with Women’s History Month.
The website celebrates the contributions of Georgetown’s female students, alumnae and faculty members in the mathematics, medicine, physical, social, computer and life sciences.
Fourteen events are being held at Georgetown for Women’s History Month, including a panel on women in the military March 23 and a panel called “Unboxing the Patriarchy” March 29.
Women remain minorities in the sciences across the United States. According to a report from the National Girls Collaborative Project, although they constitute half of the total American college-educated workforce, women constitute only 29 percent of the American science and engineering workforce.
University Media Relations Manager Ryan King said the website was inspired by the December death of astronomer Vera Rubin (GRD ’54), whose research exploring galaxy rotation rates and dark matter led to a major shift in understandings of the cosmos among scientists.
“The idea for this project was formed after Georgetown alumna and renowned astronomer Vera Rubin died this past December,” King said. “Our office began to evaluate our legacy of pioneering women in science and also to reflect on the current female faculty in science at Georgetown. We are continually looking for opportunities to feature research conducted by our outstanding faculty.”
Vice Provost for Research Janet Mann, who is also a professor in the biology and psychology departments, said the website showcases just some of the successes of Georgetown women in science.
“The website was created to highlight women scientists, past and present, during Women’s History Month,” Mann said. “This was an opportunity to highlight the many women who make Georgetown a great place to engage in scientific endeavors. This feature is just a snapshot and not comprehensive of everyone—or even every woman—contributing to our rich community.”
Mann said she hopes the website draws attention to the scientific work being done by women at the university.
“As Vice Provost for Research, we want to promote Georgetown research, across every discipline, as much as possible. Sometimes I hear members of our own community say, ‘Georgetown doesn’t do science.’ That is patently false,” Mann said. “We have some truly exceptional scientists, natural and social scientists, from past and present, male and female. Some of the historical figures are legendary — and many community members are unaware of their achievements and incredible contributions.”
Current Georgetown undergraduate students featured directly on the website include Breanna Walsh (COL ’17) and Angela Bai (COL ’17).
King said the website helps showcase Georgetown’s diversity and innovation, especially in light of Women’s History Month.
“It’s clear that we have a rich and diverse community of faculty, students and alumni in the sciences,” King said. “We saw that we had generated a great collection of digital content that features female faculty, students and alumni in the sciences through our regular coverage. We saw an opportunity to pull this content together in a showcase to our larger campus community during Women’s History Month and on International Women’s Day.”
King said the university hopes to continue highlighting under-recognized communities on campus.
“We hope visitors will gain a better understanding of the scientific work being done within the campus community through faculty, graduate and undergraduate research,” King said. “We hope to do similar projects in the future that highlight contributions of our communities in different disciplines.”
While the website highlights accomplishments of women in science, assistant professor of molecular oncology Chunling Yi said the field is still full of obstacles for women.
“Science is still a very male-dominant field, like many other fields,” Yi said. “So it is also an extra challenge for women just in terms of socializing with our scientists.”
