Recent deaths of bicycle and electric scooter riders have prompted Washington, D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh to call for stronger safety regulations as part of the city’s Vision Zero initiative.
A 20-year-old man riding a Lime electric scooter was killed in a collision with an SUV on Sept. 21, and a 64-year-old man biking was killed in a hit-and-run on Sept. 24, according to The Washington Post. These incidents are cause for greater safety regulations, Cheh said to the Post, particularly as D.C. aims to reach zero bicyclist and pedestrian fatalities by 2024 with its Vision Zero initiative.
“I am a little concerned about safety issues, because I do see some [scooter] users who do appear to me to be a bit reckless, weaving in and out of cars and going up and down on sidewalks,” Cheh said in a Sept. 26 interview with The Washington Post.
Lime and Bird are the two primary scooter rental companies in D.C., and Lyft launched its own fleet of 250 dockless scooters in the District on Oct. 18. They function through a smartphone app that unlocks the scooter for a few dollars, depending on the amount of time using the scooter and which company is used. The scooters can be found in cities across the United States and even internationally, according to their respective websites.
Bird, which is valued at over $2 billion and has one million Americans users, according to CNN, affirmed its dedication to rider safety.
“Bird is committed to partnering with cities to ensure that the community, and its visitors, safely embrace our affordable, environmentally friendly transportation option,” a Bird spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We strive to improve and enhance the well-being of our riders and communities through concrete action.”
Lime similarly affirmed its commitment to rider safety.
“Lime advocates for city and state laws to require driver education for motorists around non-motorist transportation to greater emphasize safe driving around scooters and bikes in roadways,” a Lime spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
As of Sept. 24, when the bicyclist was killed, there were 27 traffic fatalities in D.C. this year, compared to 24 at the same time last year, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. This year’s total includes the bicycle rider, scooter rider and 14 pedestrians, according to The Washington Post. The District has constructed 80 miles of bike lanes since 2000, and about 5 percent of the city’s commuters bike, according to City Lab.
The District Department of Transportation oversees regulating bikes and e-scooters of companies like Bird and Lime, deeming the vehicles “dockless vehicles,” according to a DDOT news release. Through the Dockless Vehicles Program for bicycles and scooters, each company is allowed 400 vehicles.
The program began Sept. 2017, and has been extended until the end of 2018, with new changes arriving in 2019. These new changes are set to align with regulations from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, according to the DDOT news release.The new regulations involve forcing the companies to educate riders about parking the vehicles, as well as the implementation of new racks for storing the vehicles.
The death of a Lime rider in D.C. was the company’s second casualty, with the first occurring in Dallas earlier in September, according to TechCrunch. Numerous cities have begun to impose regulations on scooter companies, according to Vanity Fair.
Meanwhile, scooter companies are continuing to implement their own safety precautions.
“Bird recently formed the Global Safety Advisory Board, which will create, advise, and implement global programs, campaigns, and products to improve the safety of those riding Birds and other e-scooters,” the spokesperson for Bird said.

The Georgetown-Kennedy Center Seminar Series, launching in November, will enable Georgetown students to attend three performances at the center free of charge and engage in post-performance discussions centered on an annual theme, the university announced Oct. 17.
The seminar series is a joint collaboration between Georgetown College, the Georgetown Humanities Initiative, which promotes academic discoveries in the humanities on campus, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the Designing the Future(s) Initiative, which designs new models of teaching and learning to facilitate educational innovation. The 2018-19 theme is “The Human Journey.”
Students will be able to attend performances of “Long Way Down” on Nov. 1, “Silent Night” on Nov. 14 and “Barber Shop Chronicles” on Nov. 28 and 29 for free. Each is designed to engage with the theme “The Human Journey” in a different way.
The collaborative seminar series aims to show students the opportunities afforded by Georgetown’s proximity to a cultural institution like the Kennedy Center and to enhance the student body’s understanding of arts’ applicability to today’s world, Vice Provost of Education Randall Bass said.
“All three of these performances are engaging with really big, powerful themes. There’s a lot going on here about race, resilience, human relationships, peace, violence and hope,” Bass said in an interview with The Hoya. “I hope it’s a way for students to really think about how studying culture and the arts can be a very vital, vibrant activity that engages faculty, artists and the public.”
Students have the opportunity to sign up for one of the three performances and will participate in an on-campus post-performance discussion led by performing arts professor Derek Goldman. These conversations will also include artists, other scholars and faculty members to help create a discussion about the process behind the performance’s production, and the issues that the shows bring up, according to Goldman.
“For each one we will try to bring someone into the room who will have something to add to that conversation. In some cases that will be artists who worked on the project, but in other cases it might be faculty from another discipline, like African Studies, where they would have something to add,” Goldman said in an interview with The Hoya. “So that’s part of the fun, trying to curate these conversations so that it’s not a template each time where it’s always the same, but where each one has its own distinct flavor.” 
Students wishing to devote more time to the seminar series have the option to become a seminar scholar. Between three and six students will be selected as seminar scholars and will participate in in-depth writing and reflection pieces on the performances, according to Goldman. These students will be mentored by visiting scholar and American University professor Isaiah Wooden (COL ’04).
“We also wanted to give some students, who could give a bigger time commitment, the chance to really have a sustained engagement across a full set of performances where they can really engage a little more deeply with the conversations that may extend between the different performances, even though these are different pieces that occur in very different art forms,” Goldman said.
Although all the slots for the seminar series in the fall semester are full, it will continue in the spring with a focus on three different performances.
“Our intent is that this [will be] the first of a very long running Georgetown-Kennedy Center seminar that, even if we experiment with different formats, will essentially have the same principle of connecting students and faculty with performances and the creative artists, as well as some community patrons, around the role of the arts in our culture,” Bass said.
As the seminar series is led in part by the Georgetown Humanities Initiative, it will hopefully help create a path for a center of humanities at Georgetown in the future, according to Bass.
“One of the hallmarks for a center of humanities at Georgetown will be partnerships between the University and cultural institutions in the city,” Bass said. “So for us, this is a really important prototype of a signature partnership with a great public cultural institution of the city.”

A woman shot at the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and Water Street was located by police near 20th and L streets Oct. 11 around 10:30 p.m., according to Metropolitan Police Department Communications Director Dustin Sternbeck.
The woman sustained non-life-threatening injuries after being shot while sitting in the passenger seat of a car, Sternbeck wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Officers located an adult female [who] had suffered from multiple gunshot wounds as a passenger in a vehicle,” Sternbeck said. “Our [Washington, D.C.] Fire and [Emergency Medical Services] partners arrived on scene and transported her to a local hospital with non-life threatening injuries.”
MPD officers from the 2nd District Station responded to the area after a reported shooting, according to Sternbeck. The victim was found conscious and breathing at 20th and L streets after she had been shot in the stomach.
The shooting was not random, and the suspect is still at large, Sternbeck said.
The suspect is a black man who wore a mask and drove a black Dodge Neon with purple neon lights around the license plate, according to an Oct. 11 MPD tweet.
MPD is asking anyone with information regarding the shooting to contact its detectives.
This shooting is not the first to occur at the Georgetown waterfront. Nineteen-year-old Kennedy Javier Amaya-Olivares died after a double shooting that hospitalized another victim on the 3500 block of Water Street around 3 a.m. July 8, 2017, according to The Washington Post. Another shooting was reported in the same area May 29, 2016, according to WUSA9.
The homicide rate in D.C. has risen by 43 percent this year, while the rate of assaults with dangerous weapons has decreased by 10 percent as of Oct. 23, according to MPD’s 2018 Year-to-Date Crime Data.
This trend stands in contrast to most major U.S. cities, which have seen lower murder rates in 2018. Homicides are down 35 percent in San Francisco, 20.9 percent in Baltimore and 23.2 percent in Chicago, according to a Sept. 20 preliminary report by the Brennan Center for Justice.
The District has taken measures to address the recent spike in violent crime, with the D.C. Council Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety hosting a public oversight roundtable on MPD programs combatting violence Sept. 25. In June, MPD Chief Peter Newsham demoted Regis Bryant, the police commander of the 7th district, following a surge in homicides in his jurisdiction, according to The Washington Post.
Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) has also introduced legislation to reduce gun violence in D.C., banning the possession of 3D-printed “ghost guns” and other undetectable firearms without serial numbers, on Sept. 17.

The chair of the literacy and media department at Duke Ellington School of the Arts is being investigated by Washington, D.C. police after allegations of sexual assault against a minor were raised Oct. 14.
The school placed the teacher on leave and the Metropolitan Police Department is conducting an investigation into the allegations.
Ellington Principal Sandi Logan sent a letter Oct. 17 informing Ellington parents about the accusation of sexual misconduct by the staff member that allegedly occurred in 2013, according to The Washington Post.
The accusation first materialized Oct. 14, when a former student emailed the Ellington administration, according to Kristen Metzger, a public affairs specialist for MPD. The student alleged that, in 2013, the department chair sexually assaulted a female student, who was at the time underage.
“The Duke Ellington School officials then notified MPD’s Youth and Family Services division and this is currently under investigation,” Metzger wrote in an email to The Hoya. “At this time MPD does not have a name of the victim and cannot confirm the name of the suspect. MPD will look into all allegations and address this accordingly.”
Logan referred inquiries about the accusations to D.C. Public Schools.
DCPS Press Secretary Shayne Wells identified the suspect as the head of the literacy and media department at Ellington in an email to The Hoya.
Wells emphasized that DCPS can play only a limited role in the investigation because of the special status of Ellington in the school district.
Duke Ellington School of the Arts, unlike the District’s other public high schools, is operated as a joint partnership between DCPS, The George Washington University, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the Ellington Fund, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit which helps raise money for the school.
“While Duke Ellington School of the Arts is part of D.C. Public Schools, it has a unique governance structure and its teachers are not represented by the union or considered city employees,” Wells said. “DCPS will support Duke Ellington as needed throughout the investigation.”
The Oct. 14 sexual assault allegation against a staff member is not the first DCPS has seen this month.
On Oct. 10, police in Montgomery County, Md., arrested Rudy A. Gonzalez, a DCPS music teacher at Shepherd Elementary School, on charges of second-degree rape, according to The Washington Post. The survivor alleged that she went to Gonzalez’s home for citizenship lessons, after which he served her drinks and she passed out. She was found unconscious the next morning in a Wendy’s parking lot.
Gonzalez has been placed on leave, according to Wells, and was released on bail Oct. 12.
DCPS has faced criticism for failing to inform parents of the reason behind Gonzalez’s absence in Shepherd Elementary Principal Jade Brawley’s initial letter, which was sent Oct. 8, according to WJLA. A second letter sent Oct. 16 notified parents of Gonzalez’s involvement in “an alleged incident” but did not provide details on the specific allegations.

Christy Felix (MSB ’20) is preparing to relaunch UHustle, a social media and marketing platform she designed for students to advertise their entrepreneurial ventures on college campuses.
The platform is set to launch in January 2019 after experiencing technical problems due to faster-than-expected growth following its initial launch Oct. 14.
UHustle primarily aims to help students connect with student entrepreneurs who offer low-cost alternatives to goods and services, according to Felix. The idea of creating a streamlined platform for both consumers and entrepreneurs came from Felix’s own experiences as a student entrepreneur during her freshman year at Cornell University.
“I decided to do it because I had a business doing hair for other people on campus, but it was so hard for them to find me and for me to find them,” Felix said. “It’s very limiting, because it’s constricted by my own social network — so who my friends know — but I needed to reach out to a broader network.”
Due to the involvement of users from five different college campuses — Georgetown University, Cornell University, University of Connecticut, Northeastern University and Rutgers University — in the span of one week, the UHustle website slowed down, causing Felix to put the website on “maintenance” to help accommodate for the platform’s fast growth.
“I just got back from a software developer, and they said that there is another plug-in I can install to make it faster,” Felix said. “The website slowed down because I was using another system, and now I just switched to a new system which will help.”
Felix plans to relaunch UHustle on Jan. 1, 2019, with the updated system and plug-ins.
UHustle intends to reduce the number of forums through which students have to go as consumers to find a product or service and will provide a greater platform and audience for student entrepreneurs to market their own ventures, Felix said. The site gives users the option to register as a student or a business, depending on whether they want to be on the platform as a consumer or a seller.
UHustle is also set to cater to users who register as a club or organization by giving them a marketing platform for uploading flyers and notifying users of events and meetings. According to Georgetown University Women of Color President Shakera Vaughan (COL ’19), UHustle would widen the scope of students who are exposed to the organization’s events.
“Our organization has a focal point of women of color; however we encourage any and every one to come out to our events,” Vaughan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “UHustle will allow us to reach a diverse range of people and not just our typical audience.”
Although UHustle users do not have to register under their university name, users who choose not to register as a university student will not have access to students, clubs or organizations that only to advertise to students from their campus.
Since UHustle’s initial launch Oct. 14, Felix has worked with other students to aid in the development process and to increase UHustle’s outreach on campus. According to Felix, UHustle Content Manager Sinclair Jones (MSB ’21) has helped come up with ideas about the platform’s potential to benefit student communities on college campuses everywhere.
Being heavily involved in the Georgetown entrepreneurial community through Georgetown Aspiring Minority Business Leaders & Entrepreneurs and Georgetown Ventures, UHustle serves the group of student entrepreneurs who struggle to find a platform on which to promote their services with current on-campus offerings.
“What I’ve noticed is that a lot of the businesses that we accept into those programs are more large-scale or aren’t businesses that are like ‘I braid hair’ or ‘I make art,’ but those are still student ventures,” Jones said. “So really, for me, UHustle is a way to call attention to the wide array of entrepreneurship that is present here on campus and uplifting everyone who considers themselves to be an entrepreneur.”
