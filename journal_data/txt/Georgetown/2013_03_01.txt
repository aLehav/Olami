Despite his preconceived notions of American culture, Max Campbell did not expect to personally experience the Second Amendment in action when he arrived at International Pre-Orientation in August.
“I got a gun pointed at my face when I was knocking door to door [for the Obama campaign],” Campbell said. “Coming from a country where guns aren’t legal, I was not expecting a real person with a gun, let alone a gun pointed at my face.”
This encounter was one of many cultural shocks Campbell has faced during his time as an exchange student from the University of Edinburgh.
“I expected the workload to be tougher and the level of professionalism within each school to be a lot higher than the British schools,” Campbell said.
He was surprised, however, by how different reality was from his expectations.
“I had this idea of coming to an Ivy [League school] or prestigious East Coast college and seeing all these students who were almost like intelligentsia, but no, not everyone was like that,” Campbell said. “I guess what I always thought was a stereotype.”
A World of Opportunities
Exchange students often cite Georgetown’s academic prestige and Washington, D.C.’s, professional and political opportunities as reasons to spend a semester on the Hilltop.
“Georgetown appealed to me because of its quality teaching in my areas of interest … and, of course, it is in D.C,” Trinity College Dublin exchange student Catalina de la Sota said.
Universidad San Francisco de Quito exchange student Maria Aguirre agreed, saying that of all of the options her university provided for exchange programs, Georgetown was the most reputable.
“I’ve learned that the professors here are very successful and this is a very high-achievement university. Only the best people study here, so I wanted to be near them,” Aguirre said.
To attend Georgetown, exchange students must submit a transcript, personal statement, resume and letters of recommendation to a competitive applicant pool in a similar process to the one regular applicants undergo.
Home universities often have their own internal applications prior to the Georgetown application process. For those coming from countries where English is not the official language, students also need to send Test of English as a Foreign Language results.
After acceptance, however, come more barriers to Georgetown enrollment: the student visa process often takes two to three months.
“If I hadn’t had the Georgetown International Office sending us emails with step-by-step instructions of what to do, I probably never would have made it here,” University College Dublin exchange student Laura O’Philbin said.
Culture Shock
Upon arriving at Georgetown, exchange students are often startled by the vast cultural differences.
“I was really surprised at the amount of shops dedicated to cupcakes, doughnuts and other stuff like that,” O’Philbin said.
Campbell said the largest difference is the American drinking age.
“Americans have a weird relationship with alcohol. A lot of people put alcohol on a pedestal here, which they don’t do back home,” Campbell said. “Just the scarcity of alcohol and the difficulty to get ahold of it … definitely drives students here to do some pretty unnecessary things.”
According to Campbell, who had his first experience with the Department of Public Safety on his 21st birthday, Edinburgh does not have campus police.
“We had a barbecue in the backyard with a bit of beer going around — something like a family gathering, really — when suddenly there’s 10 DPS officers,” Campbell said. “It was really shocking getting dragged into a disciplinary hearing over a barbecue.”
After the initial culture shock, exchange students have found the university environment, both socially and academically, to be vastly different from their home experiences.
“It’s just different in the way you live,” Universidad San Francisco de Quita exchange student Paola Carrera, who lives at home in Quito, said. “Me and my friends — we live at home, so you’re at school, then you go home, and you’re away from the constant pressure of school. Here, though, you don’t have the same luxury.”
Campbell agreed.
“There are some good things, such as not having to walk a mile to get to class,” Campbell said. “[At Edinburgh], after first year, nobody lives in dorms; everybody lives out in the city, so everyone’s very much independent.”
Campbell said that despite the convenience of living on or near campus, he preferred living off campus, adding that he would not have enjoyed living at Georgetown for four years.
“Life as a freshman seems miserable — a rubbish existence — walking around the streets looking for parties,” Campbell said. “It’s after you move off campus that life gets better.”
Campbell added eating in a dining hall for four years seemed unsavory.
“I can’t imagine eating Leo’s for four years,” Campbell said. “I think the dining hall is grimy and horrible. … If I was a real third-year, I’d think that would be the most depressing thing, eating at Leo’s.”
Academic Pressures
Exchange students said that Georgetown students are more involved on campus and more academically motivated than their international counterparts, attributing their universities’ lack of residential life programs to disinterest in campus clubs and societies.
“At home, the majority lives off campus and thus is less involved,” former Trinity College Dublin exchange student James Crampton said.
The students’ home universities’ focus on independence is also reflected in the universities’ academic policies. According to Hassan, Georgetown’s mid-semester assessments, as opposed to foreign schools’ reliance on final exams, add more stress to student life.
“You only have exams at the end of the year for everything,” Hassan said. “There are few assessments in the middle of the semester, so people slack a lot more in the middle.”
Perhaps due to this constant assessment, exchange students said that the academic environment at Georgetown is more driven than at their home universities.
For example, Campbell said that his university did not give assignments. Rather, students were graded based on one or two papers and a final exam, often contributing to a “slacker attitude.”
“Probably more than half of the time students spend in Lau here is spent in a pub in Dublin,” de la Sota agreed.
But Aguirre added that the attitude exemplified at Georgetown is contagious.
“I feel that here academics are more of big deal,” Aguirre said. “People spend a lot more time studying, so that’s challenging because you feel more pressure, and it’s infectious — you feel like you have to keep up with everything.”
Campbell also said that with fewer excuses to visit professors, student-professor relationships are less common at Edinburgh.
“Georgetown professors are a lot more approachable — on the whole, it gets a lot less personal [back home],” Campbell said.
De la Sota said she was surprised that Georgetown students could manage to find time to participate in so many activities.
“Being able to fit so much in was invented by Georgetown students who take six classes, have an internship, a job, are on a sports team, in three student associations and who still have friends to go out with,” de la Sota said.
But de la Sota said that such an intense lifestyle is not without its repercussions.
“Sometimes when you run into someone you know on campus, that person would barely say hi because saying so would be delaying their tight daily schedule of class-gym-Lau,” de la Sota said.
A Home Away From Home
Because exchange students are only at Georgetown for a semester or a year, it falls on them to get involved and active in university culture.
“There was a lot of information available about joining various organizations,” Aguirre, who is a member of four organizations on campus, said. “Everyone was very welcoming.”
Crampton agreed and said the best way to meet fellow students was to join organizations.
“I played hockey and had a radio show, so that got me mixing with a lot of Americans,” Crampton said.
Campbell said it was easy to make close interpersonal connections quickly, citing his 21st birthday as an example.
“I’d always been worried about coming over here and celebrating my 21st birthday with people I would’ve known for two or three weeks,” Campbell said. “But when it came around, people were so cool about it — it was 24 magical hours.”
Campbell attributed this to the roommate system present in American university housing, in contrast to that in the United Kingdom, where roommates are uncommon for college student.
“It’s completely unheard of to have a roommate; it’s a very American thing,” Campbell said. “I was surprised how good it was.”
Programs such as the International Ambassadors program and the Global Living and Learning Community are instrumental in helping exchange students make connections on campus. Aguirre said that Exchange Students Advisor Lisa Gordinier was especially helpful.
“She was like our mom,” Aguirre said. “Any time we have problems, we could go to her. I took advantage of it, and she was helpful in every way. At no point did I feel like I was alone — I always felt supported.”
GLLC Advisor Amy Dorsey agreed and said that her LLC provides a community of peers.
“I think the GLLC provides a community of peers through which not only is it easier to get to know other students but also students who are willing to provide additional support,” Dorsey said.
But O’Philbin said that it was sometimes difficult to make friends outside of student ambassadors or fellow international students.
“It can be hard to make friends with Georgetown students, particularly because we are juniors, so most students already have well established groups of friends,” O’Philbin said.
Lasting Impressions
Though exchange students only stay at Georgetown for a short time, they bring their Hilltop memories back home.
“The classes are amazing, the people here are amazing … just everything. I’m going to all the events I can — I can’t go to all of them — but I’m trying,” Carerra said.
Aguirre said she would encourage others to spend a semester at Georgetown.
“I will recommend anyone to come here because it gives you the opportunity to see the world from a different perspective,” Aguirre said. “Not only that, but to share that with people of other cultures and to get to know yourself better. When you come from a place where you’ve lived all of your life and then come to a new place where you don’t know anyone, you get to know yourself and what you look for in life.”
And despite her excitement to reunite with family and friends, O’Philbin said that some elements of Georgetown would always remain with her.
“I love Midnight Mug,” O’Philbin said. “In Dublin you are only allowed to have water in the library, and if you’re caught with anything else, you get fined 20 euros.”

The U.S. Senate voted to confirm Georgetown professor and former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) as the next Secretary of Defense on Tuesday after an embittered nomination process.
President Barack Obama nominated Hagel Jan. 7, but his nomination stalled temporarily as Hagelfaced scrutiny for comments he had made both during and after his tenure as senator.
Republicans filibustered Hagel, marking a historic first in a Secretary of Defense nomination, and forced at least 60 senators to vote in favor of proceeding with the confirmation debates. The Feb. 14 vote failed, but Hagel garnered the votes necessary to break the filibuster and then win confirmation Tuesday.
Government Professor Stephen Wayne noted that historically, the Senate has deferred to the executive branch when it comes to secretary-level nominees.
“One of the effects of this partisan political polarization has been to really slow down the appointment process in the Senate and to subject it to the filibuster process in the Senate,” Wayne said. “This meant that you needed 60 people to stop the Republicans from talking to vote on the nomination.”
Hagel served two terms as senator before joining the School of Foreign Service as a distinguished professor of national governance in 2009.
“It may be that while he was in the Senate, there was some personal interchange that people didn’t like and didn’t want him there,” Wayne said. “And maybe they thought that that kind of nature was not the nature of a person that we need as Defense Department Secretary.”
Government Professor Andrew Bennett said that Hagel and Congress will have to move past the protracted confirmation battle and work together in the areas where the president lacks authority.
“I don’t think he’s going to hold any personal rancor against the senators who voted against him — they’re going to need him and he’s going to need them,” Bennett said.
Confirmation is just the first of many stumbling blocks Hagel will face as he takes office. One of Hagel’s first challenges will be the sequestration, which is expected to slash around $42 billion from the military’s budget, representing half of the total cuts.
“I think [Hagel’s] biggest challenge will be the downsizing of the defense budget, the downsizing of the number of military personnel and eventually civilian personnel,” Wayne said. “The budget, which has been expanding for years, is going to be contracting in the future and yet the interests of our country have not contracted. … The world is still very volatile, and America’s presence needs to be out there.”
Hagel’s other major challenge will come from managing the largest department of the executive branch. The former senator has never had managerial experience, a quality that has produced mixed results for past defense secretaries.
“Sometimes that didn’t work out so well, like when Les Aspin came from the Congress and was famously loose in his managerial style,” Bennett said of secretaries with no past experience managing large organizations. “I don’t think that’s going be so much of an issue for Hagel, considering his style is different already.”
Hagel is known for being fiercely independent, a quality that may prove crucial to his success.
“One of the hardest things to do to a president is to tell him what he doesn’t want to hear,” Wayne said. “If Chuck Hagel, behind closed doors, can do that to the president, he’ll be making a contribution to Obama’s presidency.”

Economics professor Garance Genicot is exploring the possibility of a starting a Georgetown branch of the Food Recovery Network, a program that supplies the large quantities of food waste produced by campus dining halls to local shelters.
Since its founding at the University of Maryland, the program has expanded to universities across the country, including Brown University, University of Texas at Austin, University of California at Berkley and Pomona College.
According to Leo’s Marketing Manager Kendra Boyer, Leo’s uses a computerized menu management system to accurately calculate the amount of food required for a full menu each mealtime. Leo’s cooks smaller amounts of food throughout an extended time period rather than cooking a large batch at the beginning of the meal to prevent waste. Unused portions are also sometimes worked into other recipes.
“This allows us to provide a continuous supply of fresh cooked food and minimize the amount of overproduction,” Boyer wrote in an email.
Using these methods, Leo’s produces two pounds of usable food waste along with an average of 240 pounds of unusable food waste per day.
GUSA Senate Subcommittee on Food Service Co-Chair Sam Greco (SFS ’15) added that a recent poster campaign encouraged students to take only what they can eat.
In addition, although Georgetown has worked with nearby shelters and food banks to donate food waste in the past and sponsored a canned food drive in November, Greco noted that specific types of food are commonly wasted.
“There is an opportunity to donate … bread, but Leo’s hasn’t identified a food bank that will take it,” Greco said.
But for Genicot, any food waste is a matter of personal concern.
“My grandmother was in Belgium during the war, and the idea of throwing food away is something I absolutely hate. As much as I can, I try to give away extra food and not throw it away,” Genicot said. “If you are exposed to anyone who lived during those times, then throwing food in the trash seems like such a waste.”
To solve this problem, Genicot proposed a partnership with Martha’s Table, a local nonprofit that provides food and nutritional programs for D.C. residents in need, but said that Georgetown’s relatively small size could be an obstacle in establishing this program.
“Georgetown is much smaller [than the University of Maryland], and I don’t know what the level of waste is here and at what level it makes sense to organize food recuperation,” Genicot said. “This is something that is worth exploring.”
Martha’s Table depends on donations from academic groups, charities and other informal organizations for volunteers and donations. Martha’s Table Food Programs Assistant DirectorDemetrios Recachinas, however, said that the organization is selective about food donations.
“We are being more selective about things that people donate,” Recachinas said. “Going through some of the product tends to be more laborious. While some product does really well, some product takes much more effort and is not worth the cost. But we are all about developing partnerships.”
Recachinas did not specify what steps would have to be taken for Leo’s to partner with Martha’s Table.
Boyer stressed that Georgetown Dining is also open to new partnerships, and Greco added that the Georgetown student body’s commitment to social justice suggests it would be an effective partner of Food Recovery Network.
“Georgetown students are incredibly committed to helping others, the environment and social justice,” Greco said. “We are in a better situation than Maryland, but if a group of students wanted to work with Leo’s to initiate a similar program I’m sure students would rally around that and take that initiative.”

For four decades, the sisters of Delta Phi Epsilon Professional Foreign Service Sorority have been encouraging foreign service among the women of Georgetown.
Founded in 1973, the sorority celebrated its 40th anniversary Feb. 24.  It takes its name from the DPEfraternity, which was founded in 1920. Though the fraternity and sorority are separate, they are both the charter chapters of the DPE nationwide fraternity.
The sisters will celebrate their 40th anniversary with a Founder’s Day luncheon next month with DPEchapters at American University and The George Washington University.
“We’re definitely trying to increase communication with our other chapters in the D.C. area because in the past there hasn’t been a lot of coordination,” DPE Vice President Alexandra Eitel (SFS ’13) said.
The sorority hosted a panel in the fall featuring eight D.C.-area alumnae working in jobs everywhere from Deloitte to the Department of Defense, an example of the networking it tries to facilitate across generations of members.
“I am in awe of where our alums are and how they help us get there,” DPE President Lara Markarian(SFS ’13) said. “In this bad economy it helps to see people that are very successful.”
The sorority is working on a mentorship program between alums and current sisters based on career and personal interests.
“Sisters in DPE can empower them and show them different career options,” Eitel said. “Getting this many motivated women in one room is a great thing — we feed off each other. We pass around internship opportunities.”
Markarian said that the group’s presence on campus has changed since it was founded.
“I think we have a bigger campus presence now,” she said. “It’s progressed to an organization that encompasses everything Georgetown is about: community, integrity, professionalism, community service.”
This year, the sorority partnered with the Knights of Columbus on a community service project and sponsored dance classes with Take Back the Night and campus dance groups to support the nonprofit One Billion Rising,
Makarian and Eitel said that DPE could not have found a better home than Georgetown.
“For us to be able to open our own professional foreign service organization at Georgetown was a big stand for women,” Eitel said.
DPE Secretary Christine Folger (COL ’13) agreed.
“We have such a politically, socially, and economically conscious student population,” Folger said. “I can’t imagine a better place to have a foreign service sorority.”

Georgetown’s Department of Public Safety reported eight cases of assault this February — the most on record since DPS started posting crime numbers on its website in 2009 — in addition to a continued string of dorm burglaries and an off-campus burglary attempt last month.
Seven of the assault incidents were between students and one was between two university employees, but none involved sexual assault. October 2009 featured the former record number of reported assaults with six, of which none was sexual in nature.
Despite the assault spike, crime figures were lower overall last month, with 40 total reported incidents, compared to the previous February, in which 58 incidents were reported, representing a decline of 31 percent. However, the number of reported incidents was higher than this January, when 33 were reported.
Thefts were down from 26 in February 2012 and 14 last month. Drug and alcohol violations remained constant, with three drug cases in both February of both years. One alcohol violation was reported this February, down from two in the same month last year.
The number of burglaries remained consistent with the January total of six incidents, but this represented a sizable increase from the two that occurred in February of last year.
DPS has been investigating a rash of dormitory burglaries that began in January and has extended into February. A room in McCarthy Hall was targeted Feb. 4, and two burglaries occurred in Copley Hall Feb. 26.
According to DPS Chief of Police Jay Gruber, the suspect in the Copley burglaries, a young female, matches the description of the suspect in recent dorm crimes.
“The working relationship with the other universities has been key to developing the suspects and exchanging photos and images,” Gruber said.
Gruber denied that the suite system in Copley, in which two double rooms share a common bathroom in the middle, created any additional risk of theft.
“The suite system only creates issues when doors are left unlocked,” Gruber said.
The introduction in January 2012 of the Community Action Team, which most recently arrested a man attempting to enter university townhouses Feb. 13, is part of the campus police’s efforts to bolster analytical and investigative capabilities.
“We continue to improve our crime analysis function and to use our CAT team to focus on crime trends including the burglaries,” Gruber said. “We have also procured funding to fix, replace and upgrade our video camera infrastructure.”
Gruber could not provide official commentary on the spike in number of assaults before press time.

In the year of its 40th anniversary, Students of Georgetown, Inc. announced a record revenue of $5,077,956.24 in its annual report released Feb. 18, marking the first time the company’s revenue has surpassed $5 million.
But while the company’s operating income increased from approximately $77,000 in 2011 to more than $91,000 in the 2012 fiscal year, representing an increase of 18 percent, its net profits decreased by just under 56 percent from the 2011 record of $244,384.17 to $108,158.01 in 2012 due to poorer investment performance this fiscal year. While The Corp made $166,935.36 from investments last fiscal year, it made only $16,777.62 this year, a 90 percent drop.
Nonetheless, top executives were optimistic about the company’s performance
“We’ve had a very successful year — a record year,” Corp CEO Michael West (COL ’13) said. “We’re very excited about projects going forward.”
This marks the second consecutive year that The Corp has posted profits, following a two-year streak of losses, when itrecorded net losses of $181,745 and $10,418 in 2009 and 2010, respectively.
While a slim majority of the company’s services posted profits this year, three of them — coffee shops Uncommon Grounds and More Uncommon Grounds and a grocery, Hoya Snaxa — reported losses. The most profitable division was coffee shop Midnight Mug, with $63,859.78 in net income this year, whereas the least profitable was Uncommon Grounds, which reported a net loss of $18,176.51 this year.
The student-run nonprofit is working on expanding through new initiatives, such as the salad and smoothie shop in the New South Student Center, set to open in fall 2014.
“It’ll be a huge challenge, but it’s something that we’re excited about,” incoming CFO Matthew Oswald (COL ’14) said.
The shop is intended to provide students with a healthy alternative to current Georgetown dining options and will feature the Corp’s premade sandwiches and coffee in addition to salads and smoothies.
According to the annual report, further projects include new coffee cup design, the continued streamlining of operations at current Corp storefronts and the internal Corp Capital Investment Fund.
“It’s a very exciting time to be a Corpie,” acting Chief Financial Officer Vidur Khatri (MSB ’14) said.

The new leaders of Georgetown’s two largest student-run companies, Students of Georgetown Inc. and the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, will begin their terms today.
Both Lizzy MacGill (COL ’14), who was selected as the next CEO of The Corp, and Chris Kelly (COL ’14), the new CEO of GUASFCU, list improvements to customer satisfaction as top priorities.
“I really want to focus on customer satisfaction and overall quality,” MacGill said of her coming promotion at The Corp. “We have made strides this year, but there is still so much more to be done.”
MacGill started out as a barista at Uncommon Grounds after joining The Corp in the second week of her freshman year and later became director of UG. She also served on the company’s Service and Outreach Committee.
Kelly specified improvements to bank processes and competitiveness as priorities in addition to improvements to client satisfaction.
“We’re definitely looking to focus on growing our loan portfolio along with rolling out a new fleet of convenient products for our members,” Kelly said, citing GUASFCU’s new ATM in Hoya Snaxa and the introduction of remote deposit capture, which allows customers to deposit checks electronically.
“The constant goal for the credit union is to remain competitive with not only other credit unions, but larger commercial banks as well, and I think we’re doing a lot of things toward this end,” Kelly added.
This focus on competitiveness inspired this year’s GUASFCU leadership to introduce free overnight deposit service, Quick Pay service, student-friendly branch hours and house accounts, which are designed for housemates to conveniently split payment for rent and utilities.
“We’re competing with commercial banks with tools that many other credit unions do not normally provide,” he said.
Kelly acknowledged that the presence of Capital One in Leavey Center presents a constant competitive challenge.
“Our biggest challenge is going to be on-campus competitors and maintaining our image as the premier Georgetown banking institution and competing with technology and scale,” he said.
MacGill’s term as CEO of The Corp will be dominated by the development of the company’s new salad and smoothie shop, which is slated to open in the New South Student Center in fall 2014.
“It’s going to be a huge challenge but also really exciting to work on,” MacGill said.
MacGill, who has been working closely with outgoing CEO Mike West (COL ’13) since learning of her appointment Jan. 14, said she looks forward to serving as the final stop and sounding board for various Corp directors and management teams, she will miss the hands-on experience of working inUG.
“The most frustrating aspect of being CEO is actually the lack of tangibility you have since you’re not in the stores every day, so in a way, I’m visualizing a lot more and communicating with different services’ directors to support their visions,” she said.
But MacGill stressed that her early days as a barista at UG formed an indispensable foundation to her success as CEO.
“It was so valuable to learn the business from the very bottom up — from stocking shelves to making coffee to managing the cash register,” she said. “If you don’t know the ins and outs of how a Corp service works, you can’t successfully manage it.”
Kelly, too, earned his stripes at GUASFCU first through an entry level position as teller and then as a member of the company’s credit and information technology departments. He was named vice-chair of the credit department in his sophomore year and later chosen to manage GUASFCU’s operations alongside three other interns last summer.
“It becomes easy to work long hours when you’re with people whose company you genuinely enjoy,” Kelly said.
Reflecting on their early days with their respective companies, both Kelly and MacGill expressed a degree of disbelief at how far they have come.
“To think that I was once a freshman meeting the then-CEO and being impressed that he’d even know my name, to now being in this position and getting to train new hires is such an incredible feeling,” she said. “It’s really exciting to watch someone else discover just how much The Corp shapes their entire Georgetown experience, like it has for me.”
Kelly’s assessment of his ascendance through the ranks was similar.
“I honestly never thought about becoming CEO early on. I was just excited to be a part of the organization,” he said. “I think it’s natural to want to do as much as you possibly can for something you love, though, so in this case, I think then wanting to become CEO is a natural extension of that sentiment.”
The CEOs of both companies — Nikhil Lakhampal (MSB ’13) at GUASFCU and West at The Corp — expressed confidence in their successors’ ability to carry the torch forward.
“Chris brings a number of skill sets to the table and I am confident that [he] and the new Board of Directors will collectively improve the Credit Union over the next year,” he said.

The university is planning a crackdown on rowdy off-campus parties after spring break, outgoing GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) confirmed.
“It’s not that the university is going to be stricter, per se, but they’re going to enforce the rules that already exist,” Gustafson said. “It’s not a policy change.”
The crackdown honors a pledge to neighbors to refocus student socializing on campus. The Georgetown Community Partnership, formed in June as a solution to contentious campus plan negotiations, made noise reduction and decreased off-campus parties a top priority.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Student Advocacy Office senior advocate Constantine Petallides (SFS ’13) was unsurprised by news of the crackdown, referencing the university’s dual standard for discipline on and off campus and neighbors’ discontent with student presence in the area.
“The writing was on the wall, especially with the ‘clear and convincing’ ruling applying to on-campus and not off-campus housing, the neighbors voicing their concerns and just the way things have been going,” Petallides said.
Citing the university’s need to cooperate with its neighbors, Petallides stressed that it is important for students keep the various sides of the issue in mind.
“The reaction is, on one hand, it’s a bit arbitrary and unfair, and at the other, the university is doing what it needs to,” Petallides said. “There’s no solution that will make everyone happy all of the time.”
Gustafson said that a successful partnership between the university and the community must rely on mutual compromise.
“There is some need to demonstrate commitment from all sides that this is something everyone wants to participate in, and the neighbors have been around here for a very long time,” Gustafson said. “Noise has been their primary concern, but they also understand we’re college students, and we need ways to enjoy ourselves and each other. We’re currently working on ways on how both of those things can happen in a safe way.”
Burleith Citizens Association board member Christopher Clements said that the planned crackdown is a step in the right direction toward minimizing town-gown disputes.
“To be honest, I didn’t know there was an impending crackdown,” Clements said. “But my understanding was that’s been part of the goal of the Georgetown Community Partnership — to manage some of those things that residents identified as problems.”
The university has made some efforts to fulfill its promise of making on-campus life more inviting by bringing food trucks to campus on weekend evenings, eliminating party registration for on-campus parties, upping on-campus evening activities and announcing plans to increase student housing space on campus.
Clements said that the new focus on campus life would benefit both students and community members.
“I agree with Georgetown in the strategic vision of making campus more student-friendly,” Clements said. “If you have a dynamic and entertaining campus, everybody wins; I definitely support that.”
But Petallides said that the transition period toward a more campus-centered social life is still littered with obstacles, citing a culture that places emphasis on off-campus life.
“A lot of juniors and seniors live off campus because there’s not enough housing on campus,” Petallides said. “And there’s incentives to get out [of campus], such as price differences.”
Petallides added that until the university can provide the additional promised on-campus housing, there would be a large number of students living off campus with nowhere to go.
“There’s going to be growing pains,” he said.
Petallides said that the university’s crackdown would be a strategic move.
“Every four years, they get a completely new fresh pot of people; anyone who is a freshman here will be gone,” Petallides said. “And [Georgetown] can just say — ‘hey these are the new rules now.’ It’s a smart decision for them.”
Clements said that BCA’s ultimate concern was to minimize objectionable student behavior.
“The main concern is for people to be good neighbors, and if that means cracking down on an extremely loud and disruptive party at one in the morning on a weekend, I don’t think that’s a bad thing,” Clements said. “That’s just not being a good neighbor, so I don’t see what’s controversial.”
Petallides, however, saw the situation as a fight over the campus plan that strands students in between.
“The students are stuck in the middle, and they will react on an individual basis how they feel like they want to react,” Petallides said. “Some will say what they want, this will cause more incidents and this will cause a downward spiral. It has happened before, and it can certainly happen again. It may be productive, or it may be counterproductive; there’s no way to predict it.”

Without successful negotiations between President Obama and Congress today to prevent sequestration, spending cuts intended to save the government $85 billion will begin automatically as a result of the “fiscal cliff” deal reached in January.
Congress failed to find a solution Thursday, and today’s meeting is not expected to produce any meaningful results, according to the Washington Post. Instead, politicians are looking toward preventing the government from shutting down on March 27.
The spending reduction is expected to have widespread consequences for the nation as a whole and the District of Columbia in particular. The cuts will be split evenly between defense and non-defense government programs, with such essential services as Medicare and Social Security protected from the automatic cuts.
Education programs will inevitably help bear the brunt of the cutbacks, and Federal Work Study and the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant, two financial aid programs for college students, are vulnerable to these cuts.
According to a factsheet from the White House, the cuts will affect about 500 fewer students in D.C. receiving college aid and approximately 510 fewer receiving work-study.
However, Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming (SFS ’72) said that sequestration would not affect financial aid packages until next academic year. The severity of the cuts remains uncertain.
“It’s not like a cookie cutter, where everybody does the same thing,” Fleming said.
Each federal agency has the authority to choose the areas of its budget to cut and how much to cut from each area, but no official specific plans for how sequestration cuts will be applied have been announced by any departments.
“They are holding it close to the vest,” Fleming said.
Despite the impending cuts, the university still remains firm on its policy regarding need-blind admissions, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr
The majority of the money in Georgetown’s financial aid packages comes from the university itself and donors, not the federal government, which supplies fewer than 10 percent of aid. Fleming believes that the university can produce funds to compensate for changes in federal policy to ensure that the university maintains its financial aid standards.
Federally funded science and medical research grants will also be impacted. The White House factsheet stated that the National Science Foundation would issue about 1,000 fewer research grants and awards, affecting around 12,000 scientists and students.
The National Institutes of Health, the primary source of biomedical and health-related grants, expects to see a 10 percent cut in non-competitive renewals of existing awards.Individual institutes and centers at the NIH will set policy for how the cuts will be addressed, and Georgetown University Medical Center will work to absorb the cuts the best it can, according to Howard Federoff, executive dean of the Georgetown School of Medicine. Federoff believes that GUMC, which receives much of its $132 million in sponsored research from the government, will be able to effectively manage the cuts anticipated by the NIH.
Kerr said that the university’s medical research is also funded in large part by the Department of Defense, whose spending will be cut by 23 percent.
In addition to medical grants, the university also receives funds from government agencies for research and education in other areas. Fleming noted that Georgetown receives money from the State Department to run programs such as the English Language Fellows Program, which brings with it an $8.5 million grant, and the Scholarships for Education and Economic Development, among others.
The White House indicated that the District would lose about $1 million in environmental funding that could affect water and air quality. The city is also expected to have a cut of about $80,000 in Justice Assistance Grants that go towards crime prevention and prosecution.
