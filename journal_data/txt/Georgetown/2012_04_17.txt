In the wake of the viral popularity and ensuing controversy surrounding the KONY 2012 campaign, Co-founder of Invisible Children Bobby Bailey spoke about the roots of the organization Monday evening.
 
Bailey made his first trip to Africa more than a decade ago with the intention of filming a documentary about the civil war in Sudan. On his drive through the east African country, a near-miss car bombing first introduced Bailey to the Lord’s Resistance Army, a militant group that employs child soldiers led by Joseph Kony and the focus of KONY 2012.
 
“You know those moments when you’re standing on the edge of something and you can only take one road or another?” Bailey said in his lecture, which was sponsored the Lecture Fund, Invisible Children Georgetown, College Republicans, College Democrats and The Georgetown University Undergraduate Marketing Association in Lohrfink Auditorium. “[The child soldiers] grabbed our hearts in so many ways.”
 
Upon his return to the United States, Bailey founded Invisible Children with his friends Jason Russell and Laren Poole. They used the footage from their time in Africa to make films they hoped would promote advocacy and draw attention to the atrocities committed by Kony. Despite their passion for freeing child soldiers, the founders worried about the sustainability of the organization.
 
“We didn’t believe that our generation would care about a cause thousands of miles away that didn’t affect them,” Bailey said.
 
In response, Bailey focused on creating an organization that operated differently from the traditional non-profit.
 
“The non-profit model sometimes feels broken,” he said.
 
Bailey no longer works for Invisible Children, and he is not pursuing a career with any other non-profit organization at this time. Instead, he is working to create a hybrid private-public business model through Social Hero, a for-profit gaming company with activist goals, citing TOMS Shoes as an influence.
 
Addressing responses to the KONY 2012 video, which has been met with criticism for presenting the conflict in an overly simplistic way, Bailey said that Invisible Children has faced similar attacks from its beginning but on a lesser scale.
 
“We’re going to continue and not pay attention to this,” he said. “There’s always going to be a critic.”
 
Bailey urged students to find one cause to support and advocate for, what he deemed their Kony.
 
“The greatest part is that a lot of what Bobby had to say is about Invisible Children but is also broader than that and can be extended to all students at Georgetown,” KC Harris (SFS ’14), co-president of Invisible Children Georgetown, said. “Anyone can take what he says to heart.”

Although the planning for the 2012 New Student Orientation is well underway in its selection of coordinators, captains and advisers, the Center for Student Programs has not yet filled the position of assistant director of student programs and director of NSO.
The spot opened after Kathryn Kay left Georgetown to become director of orientation and leadership at the University of Utah in January.
According to Director of the Center for Student Programs Erika Cohen-Derr, the search for a replacement has attracted a large applicant pool. CSP is focusing on finding a candidate who can engage and collaborate well with the student body.
“A successful candidate for this job will demonstrate an understanding of the priorities and complexities of directing a New Student Orientation program …” Cohen Derr wrote in an email.
The position’s responsibilities include communicating with new students and their families, working with the five NSO student coordinators to recruit and train orientation staff and coordinating all beginning of the year activities. It also includes advising CSP student organizations, particularly the Lecture Fund.
According to Cohen-Derr, preparation for NSO 2012 has remained on schedule despite the vacancy.
This year’s team of NSO coordinators is comprised of five undergraduates and has already chosen this year’s captains and advisers.
“We have chosen our entire staff, and we are so excited to meet all of them in person on April 28 at full staff training,” student coordinator Matt Chung (COL ’14) wrote in an email.

Amid a growing movement for colleges to undergo national standardized assessments, Georgetown officials have said such efforts are misleading and narrow in scope.
In the past five years, a number of measures designed to gauge the quality of a college education through standardized test scores and other indicators have been developed. The largest of these, the Voluntary System of Accountability, is a project of 321 public four-year universities that compiles basic information about the participating schools into an online database called the “College Portrait.”
According to David Paris, the executive director of the New Leadership Alliance for Student Learning and Accountability, an organization that encourages higher education institutions to gather and publicize evidence of student learning, much of the enthusiasm for a standardized assessment of colleges stems from concerns about rising tuition costs amid a weak economy.
“People are worried about the value of a degree, especially given the increasing cost,” he said. “The pressure, such as it is, has been coming from state governments, rather than students or the federal government.”
But administrators at Georgetown, including Associate Provost Randy Bass, say that standardized assessments are often too general and fail to take into consideration goals of a particular course or department.
“There is a great danger unless the assessments are done in a collaborative and organic manner,” Bass wrote in an email. “The danger is when a common assessment or standardized test is applied and isn’t carefully aligned with [a] program’s goals. Then you end up judging faculty on an assessment that is unrelated to the goals of the course.”
In 2008, Georgetown joined 92 other schools in signing a statement issued by the Consortium on Financing Higher Education that argued against relying on simple, quantitative measures of program effectiveness.
Paris acknowledged this perspective.
“The concerns are that it will lead to comparisons of institutions that are not fair, that reflect the incoming skills of students rather than their growth, and that such an assessment does not help a school improve,” he explained.
However, Paris stressed that standardized assessments, if analyzed in context, can help paint a full picture of the value of an institution’s education, especially to prospective students.
“A standardized test is one indicator of whether students have reached a certain level in skill or knowledge,” he said. “Such tests should be used in combination with other measures, especially those that look at actual student work. … Transparency is important, especially for current and prospective students.”
Georgetown has considered, and ultimately rejected, using a standardized tool called the Collegiate Learning Assessment. The CLA was the basis for a book, “Academically Adrift,” which asserted that college students learn nothing in their first two years of college.
According to Bass, other institutions that had used the test did not find it to be helpful.
“Using tests like the CLA is certainly one instrument and strategy,” he wrote. “But an institution that is among their certified leaders would certainly have to have many assessment measures in place and they need not all be certified.”
Bass added that while the university has avoided using standardized tests, he would support the increased use of assessments which measure the comparative value of courses within one institution.
“We could do a better job of knowing these things. It would serve a lot of our objectives,” Bass wrote.

The University Office of the Registrar will revamp the format of course and professor evaluation results to make data more accessible to students.
In collaboration with the Georgetown University Student Association and the Inter-School Academic Council, the administration is investigating transitioning the way feedback is made available in an electronic format. The first step in this process is requiring that all class evaluation forms be submitted online, rather than in paper, by Fall 2012.
“The results are used for very important things — for promotion, tenure and merit increase, and used by the faculty to improve their courses based on the feedbacks,” University Registrar John Pierce said. “Now we hope it can be used by some students during their course-selection process.”
The Office of the Registrar and the ISAC hope to make the evaluations accessible to students directly through MyAccess during registration.
“It would be ideal to have professor evaluation results in MyAccess next to courses, so that when you select a course, there would be ‘view course description,’ ‘view textbook’ and also ‘view professor evaluation,’” ISAC Co-Chair Jed Feiman (COL ’12) said.
Course evaluation results, arranged by course number in a single document, have been posted on the registrar’s website in PDF format since fall 2004.
“When we used to publish a little booklet for class schedules, GUSA published a paper document of faculty evaluation results at the same time for preregistration for students to look at,” Pierce said.
When the Office of the Registar started to publish the class schedules online, GUSA requested that it do the same for faculty evaluations.
“Basically the format that it’s published in is the format that was created at the time when the results were published on paper. I just took the spread sheet format that [GUSA] had and put that up on the website,” Pierce said.
According to Feiman, few students are aware that evaluation results are available online, and the current format discourages students from using them.
“It is simply not practical to have to go on a different website, find the PDFs and sort through an Excel sheet with just numbers that no one really understands the meanings of,” Feiman said.
Feiman believes improving the availability of the faculty evaluations will give students a more accurate understanding of the courses and professors than that reviews available through sites like ratemyprofessors.com.
According to GUSA Secretary of Academic Affairs Jonathan Askonas (SFS ’13), a change to a more modern system will not be difficult. “Fundamentally, it revolves around the switch of a database to one that can be advertised to students as resource,”
Faculty Evaluations Coordinator Joseph Davies anticipates that making the evaluation results more accessible to students will encourage more undergraduates to complete course evaluations.
ISAC Co-Chair Lucas Stratmann (SFS ’12) agreed that it is important for students to complete course evaluations to make the results posted on MyAccess more useful.
“The more students participate, the more accurate the idea you get from the faculty evaluations,” he said. “There should be more awareness and utilization of the evaluations, so that students will know how taking five minutes to complete the evaluations will be beneficial to everyone.”

Though one of the Student Activities Fee Endowment proposals is behind schedule, organizers of all three initiatives still hope to meet key deadlines as the end of the semester approaches.
Georgetown Energy’s plan to install solar panels on university townhouses and create a fund for sustainability projects, the Student Innovation and Public Service Fund and the New South Student Center renovation were passed by student referendum in late January.
Georgetown Energy, which was allocated $250,000 to install solar panels on university townhouses, expected to choose a solar panel vendor by mid to late February, but has not yet done so. According to project leader Patricia Cipollitti (SFS ’15), the team has evaluated candidates on cost and installation methods and has narrowed its list to two companies.
Members of Georgetown Energy and the university also signed an agreement that required the group to decide on a start date for the project and the number of townhouses that would receive solar panels by April 3. Both of these choices, however, rely on the selection of a vendor and thus have not been made.
Cipollitti expects to select a firm and gain university approval by the end of the semester, and she anticipates that nine or 10 houses will receive solar panels this summer as part of the project’s first round of installations.
Before construction can begin, the plan must be approved by the university administration, the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E and the Old Georgetown Board.
If the project remains on schedule, the two neighborhood boards will review the proposal over the summer.
GUSA Director of SAFE Reform Implementation Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) was initially worried that working with the university would slow implementation efforts.
“I was concerned that the university would be slow and drag its feet in this whole process and that the timeline would get away from us and that we wouldn’t be able to install the solar panels by the summer,” Malkerson said. “But thus far they have worked as efficiently as the process allows.”
The SIPS Fund’s 12-member steering committee is also waiting for university approval before it can take its next steps.
According to steering committee chair Paige Lovejoy (COL ’12), the group, which was allocated $1.25 million, is working to have its bylaws approved by the administration.
The steering committee reviewed applications for SIPS’ seven-student executive committee this week and is currently selecting a board of directors which will consist of three undergraduate students and six members who are either faculty or alumni.
The steering committee anticipates that SIPS will launch in the fall in accordance with the group’s original timeline.
Like Georgetown Energy, the team working on the New South Student Center has yet to select a firm with which to partner in construction efforts.
Malkerson, former GUSA President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12), former Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) and Senator Zach Singer (SFS ’15) are spearheading the implementation of plans for the New South Student Center renovation, which received $2.04 million to expand planned student space in the lower levels of the building.
The SAFE reform funding intends to add a new terrace along with increased study and lounge space to existing plans for renovations to the second story of New South Hall. The majority of the renovations are being financed by the university, and construction is slated to end in summer 2014.
According to Laverriere, the group is selecting an architecture firm from among five candidates. Once the firm is chosen, the NSSC team will start a conversation about the student center’s design and function. The student committee plans to select a partner by the end of the semester.
“New South is something they’ve been trying to build for over a decade now,” Laverriere said. “SIPS is something that will make Georgetown unique in its service to D.C., and with Georgetown Energy, [the university has] been trying to do sustainable things for a long time.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson emphasized the importance of quickly implementing all of the projects funded by SAFE reform.
“The entire SAFE reform process and the implementation represent very thoughtful student initiative and commitment to strengthening Georgetown,” he wrote in an email. “All the projects funded … are excellent ways to serve student needs and interests, and we support each of them.”

With a mobile phone application set to go live Thursday and the university’s inaugural Innovation Summit planned for this week, Georgetown is attempting to speed up its slow crawl into the 21st century.
The mobile app will allow the university community to access the Georgetown directory, campus map, events calendar, GUTS bus schedules and news via smartphones.
The university partnered with Modo Labs, which also works with Harvard University, Villanova University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology on their mobile apps, to create the Georgetown platform.
According to Lisa Davis, who became the university’s chief information officer in February, the development of a mobile app marks a big step for the university.
“Student focus groups and surveys have identified mobile as the number one priority for students,” Davis wrote in an email.
Davis and UIS also hope to address student concerns by expanding wireless Internet coverage across campus. Much of campus did not have Wi-Fi until last spring. Within the past week, University Information Services added Wi-Fi coverage to all of Copley and Healy Lawns, according to Davis.
UIS is also in the process of determining the cost of entirely replacing the HOYAS network, which is still the only Wi-Fi available in several buildings including the Leavey Center, the Southwest Quad, ReissScience Building and New South Hall.
The inaugural Innovation Summit, to be this Thursday and Friday, intends to encourage students and faculty to utilize new educational technologies.
Chief Innovation Officer Michael Wang hopes the event can be replicated every semester.
“The idea just came because there’s an obvious place for technology, and it goes beyond just widgets and gadgets,” he said. “It’s about finding things that are useful and that are relevant to our constituents at the university.”
The summit’s first day, titled the “Day of Ideas,” includes several 15-minute presentations and conversations. Approximately 18 companies, including Dell, Grockit, HelloWallet and LivingSocial, will present during the event.
“The companies and presenters will hopefully expose participants to a wealth of new products and ideas,” planning committee member Hilary Cohen (COL ’14) wrote in an email. “However, there’s also a hope that they will help us collaborate and innovate to find solutions to real problems on campus.”
The “Day of Action,” the second day of the summit, will focus on discussing how to realistically implement the ideas proposed during the summit’s first day.
“I think [we invited outside companies] because we’ve heard a lot of feedback from students, staff and faculty that they’re interested in the ideas from these companies, and if it’s something that the community finds valuable, it hopefully is something that we can explore,” Wang said.
Co-Chair for Strategy and Events R. Scott Munro (COL ’12), former chief financial officer of Students of Georgetown, Inc., believes the summit is a signal of a new focus on technology at Georgetown.
“I think this summit represents a larger shift at Georgetown around really making our campus cutting edge, innovative and an ideal learning environment for us Hoyas,” he wrote in an email.

Government professor Valerie Earle, one of the first female professors to teach in Georgetown College, led a career of firsts on the Hilltop.
Earle, who died in 2004, was the first female chair of a university department, the first president of the Georgetown University Faculty Senate and, in 1974, became the first woman to receive the Patrick Healy Award for distinguished teaching, scholarly achievement and service to Georgetown.
Earle, who had earned her bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate in government, economics, public administration and law from the University of Texas, was appointed associate professor of government in 1955 in the business division of the School of Foreign Service.
Prior to coming to Georgetown, she taught at the University of Texas, San Francisco State University and the University of Alabama. She also served as a research associate for the subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Banking and Currency Committee.
When she arrived at Georgetown, Earle was the first female professor in her division. The following year she moved to the College’s government department, where she remained for 30 years teaching courses focused on constitutional law. Among her students was then-freshman and now University President John J. DeGioia (COL ’79).
Government professor George Carey, who has taught at Georgetown since 1961 and whose office was next door to Earle’s for almost eight years, recalled the respect and admiration that she commanded.
“She was a lady in every respect,” he said. “Valerie was very much admired by the students who took her [class] … and she was a marvelous colleague and very loyal to Georgetown.”
Earle was a proponent of women’s rights at a time when there were very few women at Georgetown; female students were not even admitted to the College until 1969. Within a few years of her arrival at Georgetown, Earle and her close friend and colleague, mathematics professor Anne Schreer, started organizing luncheons for graduating female seniors, because all the end-of-year events were for men only.
Earle also believed that faculty should take a larger role in the university if Georgetown was to become a global research institution. She helped to establish and write the bylaws of the faculty senate, the purpose of which was to give faculty members a voice in advising the university.
“[The faculty] do not want merely to make recommendations, produce reports and write papers without consequence. We must become a contributing party to decisions,” Earle said in the October 1967 issue of the Georgetown Record.
Earle was elected the faculty senate’s first president in 1967 and remained involved for many years, all the while advocating for the recruitment and hiring of more female professors.
Professor of Government Emeritus Karl Cerny, who worked closely with Earle on the faculty senate, said that Earle’s involvement in the senate and engagement with the Georgetown community helped to strengthen the university’s reputation.
“When I first came here and when she first came here, Georgetown was in many ways a provincial place,” he said. “[Earle] played an invaluable role in establishing [Georgetown] as a major university.”
Former colleague and professor emeritus of history Dorothy Brown, who arrived at Georgetown in 1966, said that the senate and other faculty organizations enhanced the role of female professors.
“Women had a lot of opportunities, because committees needed women in order to give a new voice. We got to be known very quickly around campus and found almost universal acceptance.”
In the July 1975 issue of the alumni magazine, “Georgetown Today,” Earle said that she did not consider herself a radical feminist but still believed that women should work hard to make their voices heard.
“Being too quiet won’t get you any place,” she wrote.
In 1989, Peter G. Kelly (COL ’59), one of Valerie’s former students, established a John Carroll Scholarship in honor of her work and legacy. This need-based scholarship is awarded to incoming freshmen admitted as political science majors.
Although Earle retired in 1986, she still was an important force on campus and continued to teach part-time through the School of Continuing Studies and the Association of Main Campus Retired Faculty from 2001 until her death. She maintained her independence despite being confined to a wheelchair and taught until the last few months of her life.
Cerny was at her side when she died on Aug. 20, 2004.
“She was a tower of strength, and a very dear friend,” he said.

Timothy Barbari, director of the Science, Technology and International Affairs program in the School of Foreign Service, will leave Georgetown at the end of the semester to become associate provost for graduate affairs at Boston University.
Barbari, formerly dean of Georgetown’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, will be replaced by Timothy Beach, the Cinco Hermanos chair in environment and international affairs, on July 1. Beach previously served as director of the STIA program from 2009 to 2010 and also served as director for Georgetown’s Center for the Environment from 1999 to 2007.
Beach joined the STIA program when he arrived at Georgetown in 1993. He is currently the only tenured member of the STIA faculty.
Beach plans to expand the number of faculty in the program to improve its student-faculty ratio.
“We hope to add more people in the future because we have a large program with a small number of faculty members,” he said.
Beach hopes that this will, in turn, help the program expand.
“We would like to be able to grow,” he said. “We think that the topics that we deal with are completely germane to the SFS and the university at this time.”
Beach’s appointment was announced in an email sent by SFS Dean Carol Lancaster to all SFSstudents Monday afternoon.
“He has provided superb leadership for both programs in the past and I am sure will do so again in the future,” Lancaster wrote. “I join my colleagues in expressing our gratitude and best wishes to bothTims in their new ventures.”

After being thrust into the media spotlight in the national debate on contraception coverage in healthcare, Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12) shared her story Monday in Gaston Hall.
Fluke testified Feb. 23 on contraceptive access for students of religious universities before the U.S. House of Representative’s Democratic Steering and Policy Committee after being invited by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Her testimony was met with harsh criticism from conservative political pundits, particularly by radio host Rush Limbaugh, who called her a “slut” and a “prostitute.”
Fluke’s lecture was sponsored by the Lecture Fund and the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and moderated by professor Judith Feder.
The conversation began with a description of Georgetown’s contraception coverage. Both undergraduate and graduate students can enroll in an insurance plan underwritten by the university or purchase private insurance. Georgetown’s plan does not cover contraceptives for pregnancy prevention needs but does cover birth control pills used for hormone control or other medicinal purposes.
According to Fluke, this approach causes problems for many women at Georgetown.
“Those problems ranged from having a doctor question extensively what your symptoms are … and not believing you … because they suspect that you may be trying to get contraception to prevent pregnancy,” she said. “Women have gone through very difficult conversations and many still don’t get reimbursement for the contraception that they need.”
In February, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius announced that the Affordable Care Act would require religiously-affiliated universities to provide complete contraception coverage in the health insurance they offer. Backlash from the U.S. Conference of Bishops and other religious organizations prompted President Obama to instead require insurance companies, not religiously-affiliated organizations themselves, to pay for birth control.
However, opponents of the regulations argue that by forcing private insurance companies to cover contraceptives, the federal government is still placing the burden on religious institutions that pay or contribute to their employees’ private insurance plans.
In response to this criticism, Fluke noted that the university does not contribute to student insurance plans.
“I do want to point out that here at Georgetown, student insurance was never subsidized. It’s always been entirely paid for by students,” she said. “Our own premiums pay for our own insurance, and there’s no institutional money involved.”
Fluke stressed that she does not feel that women should have to sacrifice their education in order to have access to affordable contraception.
“It seems wrong to ask female students to choose between their healthcare and the quality of their education,” she said. “If Georgetown is the best school you got into or offers you the best career opportunities, why should you as a female student have to not attend Georgetown and have to find somewhere else because of your healthcare needs?”
Though she has been divisive on the national stage, the audience in Gaston Hall was composed largely of students in support of Fluke and her role in advocating greater contraception coverage.
But her speaking appearance was not without controversy.
An open letter to University President John J. DeGioia prompted by Fluke’s role in the debate was signed by 103 current and former students and alumni, calling on the university to clarify its position on the healthcare mandates.
According to Knights of Columbus member and letter signatory Kevin Sullivan (SFS ’14), Georgetown can comply with the regulations by fall 2012, file for a one-year religious exemption or follow several other Catholic universities in suing the federal government over the perceived deprivation of religious liberty.
The letter is slated to be sent today to university administrators including DeGioia, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olsen and Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J.
Sullivan also reiterated DeGioia’s calls for thoughtful discussion of the issue.
“We also need informed civil discourse,” he said. “When there is uninformed civil discourse, we can’t get anywhere. We want the university to clarify its reaction to where it stands on the Health and Human Services mandate, because we believe it should be an informed discussion.”
After the event, Kieran Raval (COL ’13) criticized the Lecture Fund for the format of the event.
“There was very little dialogue today. … It was Sandra speaking about her position and her activities, and obviously the moderator is very sympathetic,” he said.
Raval, who is Grand Knight of GU’s Knights of Columbus and also signed the open letter, suggested that a dialogue or panel format could have remedied the situation.

Representatives from the Office of the Tenant Advocate and the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs came to campus Friday to talk with students about the logistics of renting and sub-letting. The Hoya sat down with Delores Anderson, a program support specialist who helps tenants resolve problems with landlords. Anderson spoke about the perils facing students who are signing — or ending — their first lease.
 
The Hoya: What does an ideal process for a student renting an apartment for the first time look like?
Delores Anderson: The first [step] is identifying the apartment and … the area of concern here is that students not become victims of all the scams out there. … The second thing is making sure that the housing provider is in compliance. … The next thing is the application process [which is] required by most housing providers. … Once you pass that … you have to look at whether or not they are going to provide you with a lease, which is what guides the relationship between the landlord and the tenant. … And then what we encourage students to do is when [you] move in you want to do a walkthrough to establish the condition of the place when you move in so when you move out … there will not be this great fight over the return of the security deposit.
 
The Hoya: What should students be looking out for during the walkthrough?
Anderson: They should be looking to see what the conditions of the walls are. Are there any cracks? Are there any holes?…. If there are a lot of housing problems, then a red flag should go up. … If there’s roach infestation and there’s … major leaks, that’s expensive to deal with and it may mean that the problems have been there for a long time. … Basically, you want to look and see, what’s going on here? … That will tell you whether or not this is a place that you want to rent.
 
The Hoya: What are some of the major concerns that students have come to you about?
Anderson: One of the biggest concerns is the return of their security deposits. … What we do is walk them through the steps they need to take to make sure that if that the landlord does keep all or part of their security deposit they can mount a successful challenge. …
The next big issue, of course, involves housing code problems. Bedbugs, infestations, leaks, no heat during the winter months, no air conditioning during the summer months, things like that.
For students [these issues] come up a lot. Each time I’ve done a clinic I’ve had students who were experiencing housing code problems. It’s a big deal because students are transient — they’re not going to be here forever. So landlords … think, “Let’s just collect the money. [The students] are not going to complain, they’re going to be gone at the end of the year, [and] we don’t have to fix anything.”
 
The Hoya: Is there anything students can do to be better or more informed tenants?
Anderson: Yes. They have to realize that they’re living in a community. They have to take care of the property. …  But even more important is reporting any problems as soon as they occur. … From my experience dealing with students, a lot of time they’re hesitant [to lodge a complaint], because they think the landlord is going to retaliate against them. Other times it’s a time issue, because they are going to vacate the premises at the end of the academic year.
 
The Hoya: What steps can students take to resolve issues with their landlords?
Anderson: They have a choice. If they [have] housing code problems they can contact the DCRA and request an inspection. An inspector will come out and look at the premises and if there are violations the inspector can cite the landlord and give him or her a certain amount of time to make the repairs. … The other option is to file a complaint with the housing conditions calendar, … [which] basically is just a docket within superior court. And it’s not a hard process … you fill out the complaint … and then you have a hearing before the judge.
