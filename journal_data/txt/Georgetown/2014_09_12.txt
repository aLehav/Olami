Georgetown fell out of U.S. News and World Report’s annual top 20 university rankings, released Tuesday, and was also named the best university for veterans. Georgetown also placed 46th among the 90 schools ranked in The New York Times’ first ever socioeconomic college-ranking poll, released Monday.
U.S. News and World Report
The popular U.S. News and World Report National University ranking placed Georgetown at 21, tied with Emory University, one place lower than last year’s ranking of 20, also tied with Emory. Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said he was unconcerned.
“Whatever tiny decimal point might have separated [the 20th school] out, we’re essentially all in the same place as we were before and I don’t think it has any significant difference,” he said.
University Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh agreed, adding that she did not anticipate any change in donations to Georgetown now that the university is no longer in the top 20.
“I am not aware of this being an issue. We are pleased to be recognized with strong ratings across all categories,” she wrote in an email.
Georgetown has never fallen below 23 or risen above 17 in the U.S. News rankings.
“You shouldn’t really change very much at all, unless they change the metrics,” Deacon said. “And unless they reduce the impact of dollars, of endowment per student, faculty endowment in the ranking, we’re never going to rank much higher than 20, unless we suddenly raise lots and lots of money.”
Number One for Veterans
Georgetown’s U.S. News top rank among the Best National Universities for Veterans comes after a comprehensive university push to increase resources for veterans.
To qualify to be ranked, the university must be certified by the G.I. Bill and registered with the Yellow Ribbon Program.
Jack Schumacher (MSB ’15), a veteran who served six years in the army deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, praised Georgetown for participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program, which gives veterans more financial support in addition to the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill grant, and for providing veterans with speakers and networking opportunities.
“Being able to link up with former veterans who are either Georgetown graduates or just want to give back to the Georgetown community is a big help, for them to give us personal guidance coming to the university and helping us network and kind of branch out with our veteran experience,” Schumacher said.
He also hailed Washington, D.C., as somewhat of a haven for veterans.
“If you throw a stone at someone in the D.C. area, you’re going to hit another veteran,” he said. “So it’s a great area where we hold our heads high, talk to other people who’ve had similar experiences and also share that with the general student body who are extremely welcoming, and I hope for the future, that the veterans community at Georgetown only grows.”
Last year, the first year that the U.S. News released a ranking for veterans, Georgetown did not even place in the top five. University President John J. DeGioia honored Georgetown’s veterans in a Facebook post sharing the news.
“All Hoyas should be proud that Georgetown University has been named the #1 Best College for Veterans by the U.S. News and World Report! Reporting an engaging educational experience for our veterans enriches our community,” he wrote.
New York Times Rankings
Released by the Upshot, a data-driven blog focused on politics, policy and economics, The New York Times rankings, also known as the College Access Index, were based on the percentage of students receiving Federal Pell Grants and the average net cost per year for students from families making between $30,000 and $48,000 per year.
A school at the mean in both measures would receive a score of zero. Out of schools with a four-year graduation rate of at least 75 percent, Georgetown received a score of 0.2 standard deviations above the mean, along with five other schools, including Bowdoin College, Bryn Mawr College, Wofford College, the University of Richmond and Yale University.
David Leonhardt, managing editor of The Upshot, wrote in an accompanying article that the college access index measures efforts by colleges to attract poor and middle-class students.
Deacon identified several factors contributing to Georgetown’s average ranking, such as Georgetown’s smaller endowment, despite a push to attract low-income students.
“They’re trying to take data and make it support a point of view. And it’s data that’s apples and oranges,” Deacon said.”My reaction is, we were tied with Yale and they have a $2 million endowment per student and we have $80,000, so they could’ve done better than we did, but they obviously haven’t.”
Deacon also criticized the rankings for not including graduation rates for low-income students in the analysis, as the Georgetown Scholarship Program, Georgetown’s program for low-income students, flaunts a 97 percent graduation rate.
Georgetown’s $80,000 endowment per student is the smallest among the schools with which it tied, and was less than or equal to every school ranked above it, with the exception of Susquehanna University. The rankings included the institutions’ endowment per student as a reference, but endowment did not figure into the calculation of the rankings.
Additionally, Georgetown was ranked highest of all of the Catholic schools on the list.
Nora Gordon, a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy, stressed that the Times’ rankings failed to factor in selectivity, capturing too many schools under the umbrella of “top colleges.”
“It would be interesting to see their access index side by side with how selective the colleges are. Among colleges with a graduation rate of at least 75 percent, there is a lot of variation in selectivity,” Gordon said.
Regardless of Georgetown’s place in the rankings, Deacon said that for an institution of Georgetown’s endowment and selectivity, it is performing well on economic diversity.
“We are definitely moving in the right direction, there’s no question. Within our capacity to afford what we’re doing, I think that extremely successful graduation rate and programs like the GSP and Community Scholars and others are really making sure that those kids who do get here get a really great experience and come out the other end with opportunities,” Deacon said.”I don’t worry so much, just like I don’t worry about U.S. News rankings. I don’t think that ranking is going to make much difference in our situation.”
GSP Director Missy Foy said that with peer support, alumni connections and professional guidance for low-income students, the program offers a quality of experience for low-income students. Despite Georgetown’s average ranking, she added that she was appreciative that the rankings drew greater attention to progress in diversity.
“There is so much doom and gloom about low-income students ever making it to college or first [generation students] ever making it to college; it seems like the press focuses on that news. So I was pleasantly surprised to see an article that actually recognized schools that were making progress in this area too,” she said. “There is still a lot more to be done. There’s certainly room for improvement and the university hopes for that.”
Queen Adesuyi (COL ’16), a GSP student, was surprised to hear of Georgetown’s mediocre NYT ranking.
“I was kind of surprised because GSP has been expanding and the strength of the program made me feel like we were different in so many ways,” she said. “The survey doesn’t reflect that, unfortunately.”

John Christopher Courtin (CAS ’70, LAW ’78), a 2014 recipient of the John Carroll Award and former executive director of the Georgetown University Alumni Association, died after a prolonged illness at the age of 65 on June 29.
Born and raised in Buffalo, N.Y., where he went to Canisius High School, Courtin graduated Georgetown with a degree in psychology. After graduation, he worked in the university’s Office of Admissions and coached the men’s lightweight crew team. While working at the university, Courtin began attending law classes at the Georgetown University Law Center at night, earning his J.D. in 1978. Courtin later served as an adjunct professor at the Law Center.
Courtin met his wife, Sharon (NHS ’74), while at Georgetown, and the two were married in 1974.
After briefly moving back to Buffalo, Courtin returned to Georgetown in 1984 and worked as the executive director of the Alumni Association, a position he held until 1990. Under his guidance, the association constructed the Reed Alumni Residence at the corner of 36th and O streets, across from the Wagner Alumni House, to serve as a meeting place for alumni.
“When John conceived of and led the charge to build the Alumni House at 3601 O St. in Georgetown, it was only partly about the house.  It was really about so much more — it was about the community of Georgetown, it was about building a place to celebrate all those former students who had benefitted from this great inquiry into faith and reason,” Paul Stebbins (CAS ’79) said in his eulogy at Courtin’s memorial service.
Stebbins recounted his first meeting with Courtin when Courtin conducted his admissions interview for Georgetown. Stebbins was a 17-year-old high school student at the time, and Courtin was 25. Stebbins described how Courtin managed to immediately put his nerves at ease and even invited him to dinner at the Tombs. Courtin later told him that he had fought for his acceptance into Georgetown; he called him a “non-traditionally credentialed candidate.”
“John had taught me a life-long lesson and I have built an entire global company by looking for and hiring ‘non-traditionally credentialed candidates,’” Stebbins said in the eulogy.
Courtin and his family moved back to Buffalo in 1990, where he worked at a law firm until 1998, leaving to become the executive director of the Martin House Restoration Corporation. Allison Courtin, his older daughter, said that even after leaving Washington, her father maintained his connection with the Hilltop.
“He stayed involved with the crew team, he stayed involved with the admissions office. I remember we were constantly having prospective students over to the house for interviews. He was always talking to people about going to Georgetown,” Allison said.
She described her father as having an active mind, constantly reading books. Although not formally educated in architecture, he loved studying design, which played into his work later in his life.
“He would read anything and everything that crossed his path. He was a very active person. He never liked to sit around. He was always outside, doing something, going for a run, going hiking. He was just kind of a curious person. He always wanted to know more,” Allison said.
Courtin was integral in starting the restoration of the Martin House Complex, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in Buffalo, to its original state from 1907; the project is now in its final phase. Additionally, he spearheaded a project to build an unbuilt rowing boathouse, designed by Wright in 1905. The boathouse was finished in 2007, and it is located on the Buffalo waterfront Club, where John was a member.
His passion for Georgetown and architecture was perhaps only surpassed by his devotion to rowing. While an undergraduate, Courtin rowed in Boat 1 during the 1969 Dad Vail championship heavyweight rowing team.
“I think the crew team was so important to him because the team was such a big community,” Allison said. “I think that’s something that my dad looked for in almost all aspects of his life — just finding a really great group of people to surround himself with and to work with.”
Allison, who currently works at Georgetown as a coach for the men’s lightweight crew team, credits her father for her interest in rowing.
“Rowing is this great tradition in my family. My parents rowed, and we watched our brother learn to row, and so it was kind of a rite of passage almost, getting to learn how to row with my dad in the family boat. So that was a really special moment for me,” she said.
Her younger sister Cathryn Courtin (SFS ’13) was a coxswain for the men’s lightweight crew team, as well. The women’s crew team honored the contributions of the Courtin family last year by christening a boat after them.
“You can see it out on the Potomac, called the ‘Courtin.’ So last year, we were all in D.C. for the boat christening, and … I know that meant a lot to him. It was a really special thing to have a boat named after him,” she said.
At the John Carroll Weekend for Alumni held in February earlier this year, Courtin received the John Carroll Award from the Alumni Association for “lifetime achievement and outstanding service to [his] alma mater.”
“He was a loyal son of Georgetown ever since coming to campus as a student in 1966, and it is his extraordinary warmth, integrity and dedication to the ideals and principles which define our tradition that will live on,” Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia wrote on a memorial page for Courtin.
Courtin is survived by his wife Sharon, his son Christopher and his daughters Allison and Cathryn.

O’Donovan’s Hall limited its lowest and least expensive meal plan options this year, among other dining changes including adding two new meal plans, barring freshmen from purchasing the 10-meal-a-week plan and altering how Flex dollars can be used on campus.
The two new meal plans include a default 18-meal-per-week plan that comes with 220 Flex dollars and a 60-meal block plan that includes 60 Flex dollars. These plans replaced the 24-meal-per-week plan and 45-meal block plan, respectively.
The 45-meal block plan, previously the lowest option for a semester-based meal plan, used to cost $641. The 60-meal block plan, now the lowest offering, costs $885 per semester.
The limited 10-meal-per-week plan costs $1,958 per semester. The closest option available to freshmen is the 14-meal plan, which costs $2,238.
Marketing Manager of Aramark at Georgetown University Adam Solloway said the decision to limit the 10-meal-a-week plan to sophomores and upperclassmen was based on nutritional concerns for freshmen who had opted for the lower plan. Freshmen and sophomores who live in dormitories are required to purchase meal plans for Leo’s.
“Our nutritionist recommends first-year students to go no lower than 14 meals per week so they’re receiving well-balanced meals throughout the week while they transition into their new college lifestyle,” Solloway wrote in an email.
Solloway said that the university receives many concerns from freshman students’ parents about their children’s nutrition.
“Parents have told us that they don’t want their child to worry about not having the nutrition they need. College is a transition. Our goal is to provide a program so neither parents nor students have to worry about nutrition, and can focus on education. The 10-meal plan provides less than 50 percent of the meals for a week for students,” Solloway wrote.
Solloway also said Leo’s is limiting the meal plan to help freshmen transition to college socially.
“The first year is very important for building friendships, and those friendships are generally built around food and social occasions,” Solloway wrote.
Students were disappointed by Leo’s restrictions on meal plans for freshmen.
“The fact that they take away that smaller option is pretty shady in my opinion. If you are a resourceful freshman and you prefer to cook for yourself, you shouldn’t have to pay,” Connor Bellows (COL ’16) said. “If you’re a parent and you’re concerned about that, you can pay for your kid to have as many meals as you want them to have but if you are a parent or a student who is indifferent to that then I think you should still be able to have the option of the smaller version.”
The absence of a 10-meal plan may leave freshmen with excess meal swipes at the end of the week.
“I have real food in my dorm like vegetables and fruit or I get a salad at [Epicurean and Co.]. If I want ice cream, I might as well [go to Leo’s and] use the meal swipe,” Emily Smith (COL ’18) said.
This fall’s changes to meal plans also updated where students can use Flex dollars on campus. Students can now pay with Flex dollars at any on-campus establishment, including all restaurants in Hoya Court, Cosi and Starbucks in the Leavey Center, Epicurean and Co., and the not-yet-opened Bulldog Tavern in Healey Family Student Center. Last year, Hoya Court did not accept Flex dollars.
Speaker of the Georgetown University Student Assembly senate Sam Greco (SFS ’15), a member of the Student Food Committee, said he is pleased with the new changes.
“Most of the changes that they made have been based entirely on input that they received from students, including myself and others,” Greco said. “They’re very responsive to student input. [Associate Vice President for Auxiliary Services] Joelle [Wiese] is relatively new at Georgetown, but she has always been very interested in getting student input and welcomed me and others onto numerous projects.”
The changes also came with advice from Aramark, according to Wiese.
“Aramark is able to provide insight into what works on other campuses, they get feedback all year from students that is important, and they need to execute the meal plans,” Wiese wrote in an email. “The overall goal was to drive student satisfaction, and students were loud and clear in that satisfaction was driven by flexibility.”

Preliminary site work has commenced for the Northeast Triangle,as the university places new electrical gear near Reiss and White-Gravenor Halls, resulting in the closure of Tondorf Road.
“Right in the middle of [the Northeast Triangle] site is an electrical transformer that serves other buildings on campus, so you can’t just dig that site out, you actually have to install new gear,” Vice President for Facilities and Management Robin Morey told The Hoya. “Once that happens, then we can decommission it and de-energize it in the demolition and excavation of this site.”
Morey said that the Reiss pathway will close at the end of the month.
Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., will bless the future site of the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall on Friday, Sept. 26 at 3 p.m.
Construction will begin with the trenching of the area between Reiss and the site at the end of September. Excavation will start in January and the foundation and floor should be in place by the end of March.
The university is also continuing to develop various other housing projects, including the conversion of the former Jesuit residence into student housing and the temporary conversion of two floors of the university hotel into dorms.
Jason Wilcoxon, project manager with Ayers Saint Gross for the conversion of the Jesuit Residence, spoke at length at an open house in the Healey Family Student Center’s social room Tuesday evening about the renovation of the former Jesuit Residence. Wilcoxon outlined decisions such as the incorporation of lofts because of abnormally high ceilings and the restoration, as opposed to replacement, of two staircases.
“Our job is to restore what we can and repurpose what we can,” Wilcoxon said. “So our goal is to get 148 student beds into the project, and to make it a really innovative and interesting space for the residents, and to give the students back some spaces that they can use and share and collaborate. But they’ll be mostly controlled by the students. So the spaces in this building, including the dining hall, will be for the students’ use.”
According to Wilcoxon, the old Jesuit dining hall will not have the same function in the new building, but will instead serve as a more general student space. Administrators have not decided what will be done with that space, but it is expected to resemble the main area of the new HFSC.
Construction will begin on the repurposed Ryan and Mulledy Halls, which do not yet have permanent names, toward the end of 2014.
“We are now complete with all of the first phase of [demolition] and abatement of the building. So basically, the building is pretty much gutted right now, and it’s been cleaned, and right now we’re getting ready to start the next phase of construction, which is the structural demolition,” Greg Davis, project manager at Manhattan Construction Company, said, “Over the next couple of months we’re going to be focusing on the structure of the building and getting it ready to build back the interior partitions and put the finishes back in the building.”
Apartments, which will constitute the majority of living set-ups in the building, range from four-bed semi-suites with lofts to eight-bed apartments with balconies to a nine-bed ground floor apartment.
Architects also highlighted that, upon completion of the renovation, the area will become more handicapped accessible, since the cut-through to Dahlgren Quad and new access to Old North Way by Gervase will actually aid the overall accessibility of the campus.
Morey told The Hoya that the renovation of the hotel will likely start in May and is expected to take about two months.
“The construction is minimal,” Morey said. “The concept now is that we’ll enter from the esplanade level to try to separate the normal hotel clientele from the students. If that’s the case, then we’re talking about making some renovations on the esplanade for how the students get in, probably some laundry room type things for the students.”
Two floors of the hotel will be repurposed as student housing for only one year before being reverted back for hotel use. Morey said that he was not sure of the financial impact of the hotel construction and the revenue loss from losing two floors of hotel space for a year.
“We know that there is financial impact. I don’t know that we know the exact details of that,” Morey said.
Other spaces around campus will also be optimized for the 2015-2016 academic year. Morey said that plans for space optimization will not be finalized until the university determines how many students can be housed in the hotel.
“I thought the presentations were really informative, and it really seems like a lot of thought has gone into making sure both new housing projects reflect what students want in a living space,” Patrick Sullivan (SFS ’17), who attended the open house, said. “Both students and administrators raised valid concerns about the projects, and these concerns were more than adequately addressed or noted by the architects and construction managers.”
Sullivan, who heard noise from the construction of the HFSC while living in New South last year, still has doubts about the university’s expectations.
“Both of these projects seem to have really demanding timetables. Looking at the delay in opening the HFSC, I wonder whether they will actually be completed on-time and under budget,” Sullivan said. “Also, with these timetables and the sheer amount of construction going on around campus, I think we will see noise problems no matter what. The university should take efforts to minimize these as much as it can, but at the end of the day it’s pretty much unavoidable with these sorts of projects. I just hope a better job is done than with the New South construction last year.”

Georgetown will host the IgnatianQ Conference, a national conference that explores LGBTQ issues in the context of Jesuit values, in March, after GU Pride received approval to host the event from the Office of Mission and Ministry and the Office of Student Affairs this week.
The inaugural conference was held at Fordham University last April and attracted about 120 LGBTQ students from a quarter of all Jesuit universities across the country, including Georgetown, the University of San Francisco and the University of Seattle. GU Pride President Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) said that he expects to nearly double the number of attendees this year.
“We really need to network because there’s a huge disparity in how LGBTQ students are treated in each of their universities,” Lloyd said. “And it’s not necessarily about changing the policies of those universities, but this weekend itself will provide an outlet for students who don’t have access to the number of resources that we have access to.”
After attending the conference last spring, Lloyd spoke with LGBTQ Resource Center Director Shiva Subbaraman and Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., about bringing IgnatianQ to Georgetown, and both administrators expressed their support. According to Lloyd, GU Pride faced no pushback from the university, and O’Brien and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson offered their blessings.
“[Fr. O’Brien] Iprovided some guidance about what Campus Ministry would like us to address in the conference, which he identified as the notions of faith and justice, and interreligious understanding, which Georgetown does particularly well,” Lloyd said.
A board of Fordham students selected the bidding committee to choose the next university to host the conference. The committee selected Georgetown in July.
Last spring’s conference theme was “Finding God in the LGBTQ Jesuit Campus Community.” Next March, the theme will be “Forming Contemplative Communities to Ignite Action.”
“The joke is that, at Fordham, they were looking for God. At Georgetown, we found God. He’s here. Now, it’s about what we do next and how we go forward. And it’s drawing upon Georgetown’s rich history of student activism and programming around LGBTQ issues,” Lloyd said.
Fr. Gregory Schenden, S.J., a Catholic chaplain at Georgetown who has worked with GU Pride in organizing IgnatianQ, said that the conference will reflect Jesuit values.
“The purpose of this student-led conference is to help students from Jesuit universities grow in their faith and appreciate their worth as human beings. These values are central to the Jesuit commitment to cura personalis — care for each person in their uniqueness,” Schenden wrote in an email.
Lloyd said that one of his goals for the conference is to expand its reach.
“Moving forward, what we’re going to do is establish a national advisory committee for the conference, pulling from student leaders at each of the schools who attend the conference this year,” Lloyd said. “Whereas last year, it was Fordham-directed, part of bringing the conference to Georgetown is making it more sustainable and raising its national profile.”
At Fordham, the conference was entirely student-run. According to Lloyd, funding for Fordham’s conference came primarily from academic departments, rather than from the university’s Student Affairs.
“[IgnatianQ] was wonderfully organized by Fordham students and was well-attended by our own students and by those from other Jesuit colleges and universities across the country,” Fordham’s Vice President for Mission and Ministry Msgr. Joseph Quinn wrote in an email. “We all saw it as a graced opportunity to evidence Fordham’s active commitment to creating and sustaining a campus environment that is truly open to and welcoming of LGBT students and their allies.”
Invitations for this year’s iteration went out earlier this week to LGBTQ students at other Jesuit universities, as well as at Catholic University and Notre Dame.
“This gathering is unique in that there aren’t that many spaces where we can explore the intersections of faith identities and LGBTQ identities and I think it will draw in national attention that will showcase this, not only to other Jesuit schools, but to all schools with a religious affiliation,” Lloyd said.
The conference will include a series of workshops where students from various universities can present about programs, ministries or instances of activism at their respective schools. Lloyd said that he also hopes to include panels of LGBTQ Georgetown alumni, including those who attended the university before the creation of the LGBTQ resource center.
Students can register for the conference, which will take place March 27 to 29, on the IgnatianQ website, and Lloyd said that scholarships will be available for registration fees and travel. These scholarships will most likely be funded by the Tagliabue Initiative for LGBTQ Life, an initiative that was established in 2011 by Paul Tagliabue (C ’62), the chair of the university’s board of directors, and his wife, Chandler.
Lloyd said that he is excited to collaborate with LGBTQ students from other Jesuit universities, both to showcase the progress that LGBTQ activism has made at Georgetown and discuss initiatives that are ongoing at other universities.
“It’s a way for us to learn from these other schools. It’s not just about exposure, it’s about learning,” Lloyd said. “There are ideas that we still have a lot to learn from.”

The university announced a new Protection of Minors Policy this week, stating that the policy will ensure the safety of non-student minors on campus who participate in Georgetown programs or activities.
The policy states that any minor who is 16 or 17 years old may sleep overnight in university housing, provided that they bring a permission slip signed by a parent or guardian. Minors under the age of 16 cannot enter university housing unless accompanied by a parent or guardian and cannot sleep over on campus. If minors come to campus unaccompanied by a parent or guardian and without a signed permission slip, they must report to the Georgetown University Police Department.
Georgetown hosts many programs for minors, which University President John J. DeGioia said will remain active. The policy requires leaders of such programs, including summer programs for high school students, to participate in extensive background checks and training to ensure a safe campus environment.
“Programs and activities that involve minors are integral to Georgetown’s mission and identity,” DeGioia wrote in a statement. “At the core of all of these programs is a commitment to providing a safe environment and a positive experience for all participants.”
Student who are hosting minors may face disciplinary action if they allow their guests to commit a violation of the Code of Student Conduct. Hosts are also responsible for ensuring that their guests have submitted permission forms and obtained minor guest passes. Hosts are required to stay with their minor guests at all times.
The policy was developed over the past year with input from various minor program directors, legal entities and peer institutions with similar programs. According to Stephanie Lynch, assistant dean in the Office of Residential Living, the new policy will help make campus more minor-friendly.
“Georgetown University is committed to constantly strengthening our ‘culture of care’ on campus, and an important part of this work is creating a safe environment for minors who spend time here,” Lynch wrote in an email to The Hoya.“The protection of minors is a responsibility that all members of our campus community share, and one that we take very seriously.”
Lynch said that the creation of the policy was also guided by the university’s moral ideals.
“We’ve taken a comprehensive approach to this work, prompted by changing times and situations, and always with an eye towards continuing to uphold the moral principles that have guided us as a Jesuit institution throughout our history,” Lynch wrote.
Sara Carioscia (COL ’17) has three younger siblings aged 17, 14 and 10. Although she hopes her siblings will visit, she believes the policy will effectively provide a safe campus environment for children.
“I don’t dislike the policy,” Carioscia said. “The safety of children is really important so I like knowing that the kids are accounted for.”
Shannon Duffy, the 17-year-old sister of Megan Duffy (COL ’17), said that the stricter policies could make it harder for visitors to get a feel for the campus.
“I feel that this new rule will result in less visitors and ultimately less applicants because many of these potential applicants are under 16 and will not be able to get the whole Georgetown experience,” Duffy said. “It will be harder for my younger sister to visit Megan since she is still 9. She is bummed that she will never be old enough to stay with Megan.”

As D.C. Public Schools reopen for this school year, the issue of redistricting public school boundaries has emerged as a hot-button topic for the D.C. mayoral candidates.
Last week, current mayor Vincent Gray approved a new D.C. Public Schools redistricting plan, intended for the 2015-2016 school year. By making the call to redraw the public school boundaries for the first time in 40 years, Gray spares the next mayor from having to make such a politically unpopular decision.
“I don’t have any political motives at the point, obviously,” he told The Washington Post. “The ball got punted down the field repeatedly. No more punting.”
In addition to redrawing the boundaries, Gray also included a provision in the plan that will give at-risk students preference in the lotteries for out-of-boundary spots.
Democratic mayoral nominee and D.C. Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) voiced her opposition to the plan, 10 months in the making, on the grounds that there remains a high polarization in educational equality between D.C.’s public schools.
“The mayor’s plan on school boundary changes is not ready,” she said in a press statement. “His plan serves to exacerbate educational inequality and does little to move school reform forward faster.”
This position places Bowser at odds with the current mayor and with DCPS Chancellor Kaya Henderson (SFS ’92, GRD ’07), who has supported the redistricting plan.
D.C. Councilmember David Catania (I-At Large) (SFS ’90, LAW ’94) echoed Bowser’s sentiment.
“I have maintained all along that I cannot support a plan that moves students from higher-performing schools to lower-performing ones.  Yet the final recommendations do just that. In addition, the recommendations are silent as to how we intend to improve those lower-performing schools,” Catania said in a press release. “Asking parents and guardians to take this leap of faith without more is asking too much.”
Instead, he calls for a one-year delay on the redistricting to allow the city to improve some of the District’s lower-quality schools. Appointed chairman of the D.C. Council’s Education Committee 18 months ago, Catania has faced criticism from both Bowser and Henderson for his plan to delay reform.
Associate professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy Nora Gordon, who specializes in the economics of education, said that while that plan would be great in theory, she did not think that Catania could realistically make too much of a change in only a year.
“I think that would help that issue but I don’t think he’s going to do it in a year. I think that people have been trying to make those schools better for a long time,” she said.
Catania also stressed the importance of creating a sense of accountability within D.C. schools, specifically through the employment of objective evaluations of public schools, something Gordon said has already been happening over the past few years.
“I think a lot of the things that DCPS have been doing are moving in the right direction, trying to increase accountability,” Gordon said.
Bowser, however, has yet to provide specifics on her solution to D.C.’s long-standing overcrowding problem.
Two-term Board of Education member Carol Schwartz, also running as an independent, wrote in her Summary of Education Position Paper that she would “accept the need for new boundaries, but make modifications where necessary.”
In Gordon’s opinion, redistricting, while politically unpopular, is a necessary evil in order to solve the District’s overcrowding problem.
“Well some sort of redistricting is necessary because it’s my understanding that some of the schools are overcrowded, and I can see why no candidate wants to support any sort of redistricting plan because any redistricting plan is going to leave some voters unhappy,” she said.
She explained that redistricting can lead to devaluation of property, increasing such a plan’s unpopularity.
“You’re buying a house and you’re buying the right to go to the school, and if you change, basically you’re taking away property that somebody bought, somebody gets unhappy. Somebody has to lose with redistricting,” Gordon said.
Additionally, if students are redistricted into lower quality and less desirable schools, those who can afford it will seek other options, Gordon said.
“I guess the big question is whether those students would remain in DCPS or whether they would go to private school or move to Maryland,” she said.
Students living in most parts of Georgetown currently attend Hyde-Addison Elementary, Hardy Middle School and then Wilson High School. Under the new boundary plan, residents from the area around Burleith would also follow this path.

The rise of online bookstores offering students textbooks at lower prices has prompted universities to launch rental and buyback programs in order to compensate for the loss of revenue. Despite their best efforts, however, Georgetown students still view the bookstore as the more overpriced option.
Georgetown’s campus bookstore has entered into an exclusivity contract with its manager provider, Follett Corporation. According to this contract, other rival textbook-selling businesses, such as Amazon and Chegg, are barred from selling or advertising on campus.
“We are the exclusive provider on campus, and we understand that there’s competition and that people have the right to make choices. But we also definitely support the university and the educational mission. We’re very involved with a lot of things on campus,” Georgetown University Campus Bookstore Director Janet Uzzell said.
The tension between online bookstores and campus bookstores reached its peak at Southern Connecticut State University when the university sent a cease-and-desist letter Aug. 29 to Chegg for illegally advertising on its campus.
Chegg Vice President for Communications Usher Lieberman said that the company was founded to create a “disruption” in the textbook industry by giving students more options, which has threatened campus bookstores.
“Simply put, the model that campus bookstores have operated under for a very long time has been put under significant strain because the Internet gives students lots of choices. Students are no longer a captive market, which is great news for the wallets of students and their families,” Lieberman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Uzzell, Georgetown’s bookstore instituted the rental program in 2010 in response to a dip in revenue. Now constituting approximately 45 percent of the bookstore’s sales, the rental program has successfully boosted revenues since.
“That’s why we came up with rental,” Uzzell said. “I think it’s been a benefit for students.”
Uzzell maintained that the bookstore remains an attractive option for students because of the easy availability of books on campus.
“We’re pretty much in stock right now 100 percent,” she said. “If the professor communicated to us what the textbook was, we have the book.”
Shannon McNulty (COL ’16), however, said that the bookstore has not always had the books she needed in stock.
“Sometimes I have books that I can only get at the bookstore because they’re specially ordered, and they’ve gone out of stock, and that’s been a real hassle, because it takes a long time to get them back,” she said.
Despite the presence of their lower-cost options, students still voiced their dissatisfaction with the prices of books offered on campus as well.
“I buy the absolute minimum I can from the Georgetown bookstore, not because of the store itself, but because of the prices. The prices are, frankly, offensively high, like there’s a definite markup,” Ben Card (COL ’17) said.
McNulty agreed.
“The bigger ones, I buy online … They’re really expensive at the bookstore, and you can find them online cheaper,” she said.
Card noted that though he tried to buy as many books online as possible, some books were specific editions he could only obtain through the university.
“Some books — for instance, my Spanish textbook — the bookstore has a definite arrangement with the Spanish department, the administration and the textbook companies, so that’s a special Georgetown University Spanish book, and I have to spend $170 at the bookstore for this book. I can’t shop around,” he said.
Lieberman critiqued this practice as a common tactic used by bookstores to compete with online retailers.
“These custom editions are typically available only in the campus bookstore and again are not materially different than what can be found online for a fraction of the cost,” Lieberman wrote. “In our opinion, this is a shameful practice as it serves only to bolster profits on the back of financially struggling students.”
Hannah Shushtari (COL ’17), said that in her experience, the bookstore prices tend to not vary much from those sold by online sellers, especially paperbacks.
“Honestly, a lot of times, they end up being pretty similar,” Shushtari said. “In terms of paperback novels, the prices don’t really vary.”

The Office of International Programs split into two offices this summer — the Office of Global Education, which will manage study abroad and international education, and the Office of Global Services, which will oversee the university’s global engagement and provide services for international students.
“This reorganization is the outcome of a year of reflection on how we can best facilitate the international work of students, faculty and staff,” Provost Robert Groves wrote in an email to the student body. “It will not disrupt existing processes and procedures.”
According to Director of Global Services Vanessa Meyers, the internal reorganization of the OIP will help the university keep up with its international growth.
“The rationale for the reorganization, which took place after months of consultations across the university, is the need to better support Georgetown’s growing international educational and administrative activities — activities once centered within OIP but now distributed within and among schools,” Meyers wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Dividing OIP’s functional areas into two new offices, while maintaining current staffing and location, allows both OGE and OGS to streamline their work in support of students, faculty and staff and to better support other units across the university.”
Vice Provost for Education Randy Bass said that the change reflects a shift in Georgetown’s international trajectory over the past 40 years.
“I think we felt that over that time, the world had changed, and the relationship of the globe to the university had changed,” Bass said. “Once upon a time, it made sense to have all of the international programs and business consolidated in one place. Since that time, Georgetown has become a global university with interests everywhere. We felt we needed a more robust and distributed structure to serve what had evolved into a much greater sense of Georgetown’s identity.”
The two new offices will serve distinctly different functions to accommodate the distinct needs of students who desire to study abroad and international students who have come to Georgetown. According to Bass, OIP’s staff, which has been split between the two new programs, is pleased with the reorganization.
“I think the reaction has been universally positive,” Bass said. “We’ve made sure that we engaged all the stakeholders around the university and there was no negative reaction that we encountered. People were concerned about one kind of service or another that they wanted to make sure continued in the excellent way that they had become accustomed, but I think everyone thought that splitting the OIP into the two distinctive divisions were both positive moves that would strengthen each of those two dimensions and better integrate them with other elements of the university.”
The OGE, according to Director of Global Education Craig Rinker, will work to enrich study-abroad experiences and provide support for students.
“Our intention is to continue to provide outstanding student advising and programmatic support while also positioning ourselves to adapt to innovative learning pedagogy that will define higher education at Georgetown for years to come,” Rinker wrote in an email. “Our hope is that the establishment of the Office of Global Education as a separate unit will expand our ability to support and enrich the international experiences of students while working with the four undergraduate schools to connect those experiences with the curriculum and co-curriculum.”
The OGS will continue to support current Georgetown international students, while adding new programs that bolster the university’s international engagement. Additionally, the OGS provides advice on a range of issues, such as global safety and relevant tax and finance policies, to administrators and faculty members conducting operations internationally.
“This reorganization has allowed us to strengthen the support we can give the Georgetown community in the following areas: global activities and operations; global partnerships and agreements; services for international students and scholars, teaching and research abroad with Georgetown; and international travel and safety,” Meyers wrote.
The new programs that the OGS plans to incorporate include training classes on faculty-led trips abroad, international collaboration and global operations policies, according to Meyers.
Rinker said that this split will not have a direct effect on students, but will instead push the university toward an even more global focus.
“Building upon our international character and expanding our global presence is a core aspect of our institutional mission,” Rinker wrote. “This reorganization is designed to recognize and support the significant international expertise of our faculty and the interest and engagement of our students, faculty and staff in global activities.”
Meyers agreed, and said that the reorganization will help Georgetown remain at the cutting edge of international programs.
“It is important for Georgetown to remain at the forefront of student learning including offering opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in diverse communities that provide significant engagement with different cultures and global issues,” Meyers wrote.
Karen Zhang (COL ’17), an international student from Beijing, China, said she experienced frustrations in working with the OIP, but hopes that the reorganization will help the OGS make some necessary changes.
“I think it’s going to be a really good thing because I don’t think that enough attention is paid to the needs of international students here,” Zhang said. “For example, when students move back in on campus after summer and winter breaks, there is barely any wiggle room and that’s extremely inconvenient for international students because we’re taking [long] flights two days before classes start. There is no attention paid to that.”
Livia Matteuci (COL ’16) is studying abroad in Chile now, and said that despite initial problems, the OIP has been extremely helpful and hands-on.
“I feel like the OIP office wasn’t very organized or clear before I left about what to expect or what was needed in terms of the application when I was applying,” Matteucci said. “Initially, it was pretty frustrating working with them, but since I’ve been here it’s been really positive.”
After two months in Chile, Matteucci said she feels well-supported by the OGE.
“I’ve been in Chile for almost two months now and have felt fully supported both with CIEE staff here in Valparaiso and also my study-abroad adviser and academic dean back at Georgetown,” Matteucci said. “It’s especially crucial that we have support not only for questions about credit transfers and the like, but more importantly for security and safety reasons. In the past week there has been an earthquake and two bombs in my area, and my family back home was immediately contacted to assure them I was safe.”

Georgetown received the title of “Top Producing Fulbright Institution” for the 10th consecutive year, with 18 students awarded the fellowship in 2014, marking an increase from 13 in 2013.
Georgetown University students and alumni have earned a total of 236 Fulbright Fellowships since the program’s conception.
The Fulbright Fellowship was created in 1946 and provides students with grants and opportunities to travel to different countries for graduate studies, research projects and teaching from the primary to university level in order to increase understanding between the United States and the rest of the world.
“This program especially fits the typical ‘Georgetown student — globally minded, social justice oriented, academically ambitious,” Georgetown Fulbright Program Advisor and Associate Director of the Office of Fellowships, Awards and Resources Lauren Tuckley said.
The Fulbright award is of particular interest to Georgetown students interested in foreign cultures, languages and teaching English.
“The Fulbright is open to all fields — really for anyone that desires a year abroad researching or teaching English as a second language in one of 140 countries that currently participate in this binational cultural exchange program,” Tuckley said.
Kaley Beins (COL ’14), who received a grant to study plant communities in Panama for 10 months, said that she appreciates the Fulbright for the benefits that it provides beyond financial support.
“The Fulbright Fellowship itself is wonderful, not only because it gives you a stipend to fund your research and living expenses, but because it gives you a lot of connections, both professionally and socially,” Beins said.
Beins said that she hopes to do more than just research during her time in Panama.
“I obviously hope to complete solid research with workable data, but I also want to make sure that I immerse myself fully in Panamanian culture and take the risks that our Jesuit education has taught us to take: asking questions, getting to know people deeply and fully and approaching each new opportunity with gratefulness,” Beins said.
Beins credited Tuckley and the Office of Fellowships for their guidance throughout the application process.
“She led information sessions, scheduled one-on-one meetings and even volunteered to read draft personal statements and statements of proposed study. She hosted a recipients’ lunch in the spring to talk to us about the process and get feedback for the next group of applicants,” Beins said.“She really roots for each of the applicants every step of the way, which means a lot, especially with an application process as intimidating as this one.”
Caroline Cotto (NHS ’14), the Class of 2014 School of Nursing and Health Studies valedictorian, received a grant to teach English in Taiwan. Cotto, who studied abroad in Shanghai during her junior year, said in an interview with The Hoya last spring that she hopes to improve her Mandarin during her fellowship.
Cotto also said that she hopes to use her year in Taiwan to figure out her future career path.
“I’m very much a type-A planner,” Cotto said. “But when it comes to my life, I haven’t really planned beyond this year. I’m trying to … just sort of see where it takes me.”
According to Tuckley, the program has grown at Georgetown in recent years and will continue to expand.
“I see growth. This year, we’ve had a record number of Georgetown applicants seeking internal endorsement, due in part to our efforts to improve our outreach strategy.” Tuckley said. “We are actively working on getting the word out to a greater number of students that would be competitive for this opportunity.”

Mustafa Ceric, who served as Grand Mufti of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1999 to 2012, spoke at Georgetown on Tuesday on the interplay of religion and governance and peace and conflict at an event co-sponsored by the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies and the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding.
The former leader of religious law in the Eastern European nation emphasized the importance, especially now, of the power that lies in interreligious dialogue.
“Indeed, at this time of intellectual, intercultural and interreligious tensions in different parts of the world, it is of utmost importance that we share a positive political and religious message on the significance of peace and dialogue,” Ceric said. “This message is important not only for the enlightened one, but also for the whole world as we are faced with a range of genocidal proportions in many parts of the world.”
Ceric called on leaders, both political and religious, to work together to create global peace, but also focused on the power of average individuals.
“Individual rights are the means of subordinating society through moral law. In this context, the first of the two fundamental ingredients for righteous social context in a democratic society is the capacity for every individual to think for him or herself,” Ceric said. “The problem is less the extremists than the silent majority that sits by and watches things happen. Most people are peaceful. But too few speak up when necessary.’”
In particular, Ceric highlighted the injustice that arose in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the 1995 signing of the Dayton Agreement, meant to stop over three years of the Bosnian War. Ceric outlined how the agreement systematically discriminates against segments of the population.
“The Dayton Agreement is made on the basis of structural discrimination, where only two or three ethical groups are eligible for election in Bosnia and Herzegovina,” Ceric said. “It is not acceptable that now and here, in the heart of Europe, any nation, any man and woman, has no right to elect and to be elected. Therefore Bosnia, with its European peace accord, must be among European moral questions of the highest order.”
Ceric also displayed philosophical insight into law and order, based on his years as the voice of religious law in his country.
“It is the sense of my Bosnian experience that the law and order will not rest in the books. The law is in the heart of every individual, the heart with the first blessings of innocent faith or innocent trusting,” Ceric said. “A powerful religious mind lies between an innocent faith and good morality.”
Ceric harkened back to one of the defining moments of the 20th century.
“With the centennial of World War I which was ignited in Sarajevo, the challenge remains: building social structures that are just and inclusive, pluralistic and secure. … This challenge is not only in Europe, but around the world,” Ceric said. “No person is too small or too big to make an impact. As long as there is at least one of you with me, we are many. Let’s not settle until we uncover the common code of global ethics, security, peace, freedom and justice for all.”
Ahmet Caskurlu (SFS ’17) said that he was impressed by Ceric’s speech, although he was surprised by Ceric’s occasional confidence in international law.
“Grand Mufti Ceric seemed really knowledgeable and also quite brave in his speech,” Caskurlu said. “He challenged much settled concepts of the Muslim world and he tried to lay out a blueprint for the advancement of Muslim societies. While doing that he underlined the importance of universal humanist values, which is not the kind of rhetoric you hear from religious leaders.”

In an attempt to create more successful matches between participating students, the Office of Global Services has redesigned the Language Exchange Program to allow participants to play an active role in selecting their language partners.
LEP connects students with different language backgrounds to allow them to hone their skills in their desired language. Before this year’s changes, the OGS matched participants without considering their input. Now participants will provide more detailed information through an online profile and will have the chance to pick a language partner based on common interests or an ideal age range.
“I think our vision was always to give participants a little more control over the matching process just because before people would just put in an application through a Google form and then we would do the matching manually just reviewing applications,” International Student Adviser Emily Donnelly said. “We found that while that worked, ideally, people would be able to match up together based on common interests or availability or location.”
Donnelly said that she hopes that transitioning to a more interactive approach will create a greater sense of community among LEP participants. After applying to the program, students are able to post information about themselves on an online network that other participants can view.
“I’ve already noticed kind of looking at the posts that people have put, it kind of requires people to engage more in the forum and in the language exchange community,” Donnelly said.
The change was in part made to avoid compatibility problems that some participants faced, often due to lack of common interest or age difference.
“I think that allowing people to find other partners who are more compatible will increase the success of matches and, I would hope, increase the longevity of the relationship that they are establishing and in turn increase their language learning as well,” Donnelly said.
The increasing number of international students on campus over the past few years also created logistical problems within the program because of increased demand for the program.
“We’ve got to the point where we didn’t have the capacity to handle a lot of the requests so I think it probably started with 20 or 30 students and at that time the manual matching worked great, way back when. But just as the international population at Georgetown has grown and the interest in language exchange has grown, it has become more in demand,” Donnelly said.
Callie Flanagan (COL ’17), who participated in LEP last year, was paired randomly through the previous system and said that she and her partner got along well.
“I feel like there are pros and cons to both. I think with the random match, it can either turn out really well or turn out pretty badly,” Flanagan said. “Mine turned out really well. I really liked the girl and when her family came up from Venezuela we all went out to dinner … so we ended up being pretty good friends.”
Flanagan said that she thinks that the new system runs the risk of spurring disappointment among participants.
“I think that there’s more of a chance for disappointment because you’re like ‘I chose this person and it just didn’t turn out the way I wanted’ whereas if you don’t know then you are like ‘it happened, that’s okay,’” Flanagan said.
The new system offers a potential solution for those who have had little in common with their partners.
“I had a great 30-minute conversation with this one girl from Venezuela and it was great, a lot of introductory stuff, a lot of Spanish I material … but after that it was sort of like ‘what do we talk about now?’ Either we are clicking and we just became best friends or we kind of forced ourselves to be here and we don’t have much to talk about,” Patrick Denenea (COL ’17), who participated in the program last year, said.
The new system can also reduce the anxiety that could come with the program. Renee Slawksy (GRD ’16) has not participated in LEP before but said that the new format for selection partners has increased her interest in the program.
“You have more control over it, which might lead to less anxiety and less nervousness about who you are going to be talking with for an hour,” Slawsky said.

Georgetown’s Office of Risk Management and the Georgetown University Student Association publicized the need for fire safety on college campuses with a screening of “After the Fire: A True Story of Heroes and Cowards” on Tuesday evening in the ICC Auditorium. Shawn Simons and Alvaro Llanos, the documentary’s stars, spoke at the event before the film began.
“After the Fire” tells the story of Simons and Llanos’ experiences after a Seton Hall University fire on Jan. 19, 2000 that occurred after two students started a fire in a freshman dorm at around 4:30 a.m. The students lit a bulletin board on fire as a prank, and the flames quickly spread across three couches in the common room lounge within less than five minutes, killing three students and injuring 58.
“The carnage of the innocent can never be forgotten. I think one of the things that makes it so, so memorable was that it was so senseless. It was an act of pure stupidity and pure cowardice, not malice, that caused this much carnage,” a police officer in the film said. “I think that is one of the things that gives the memory of this fire such staying power.”
After the fire, Simons and Llanos spent three weeks and three months, respectively, in comas. They suffered from severe burns and faced significant challenges both physically and emotionally during the recovery process.
“[Llanos’] whole identity is going to change, but what doesn’t change is the inside of him and that’s very difficult for people to realize,” a nurse said in the documentary.
The documentary not only followed Simons and Llanos through their personal journeys, but also included several of the court proceedings. Due to the nature of the crime, it took several years to convict the perpetrators.
The arsonists, Joseph LePore and Sean Ryan, were members of a fraternity at Seton Hall.
“They were known to be troublemakers. They had gotten into trouble earlier. We call them arsonists because they set this fire,” Simons said.
Seven years after the crime, LePore and Ryan admitted that they had set the fire in the common room. They were sentenced to five years in a juvenile correctional facility while they were in their mid-20s and released early on parole.
“To this day, they haven’t reached out to us and we haven’t reached out to them. The last time we saw them was in the courtroom,” Alvaro said.
Both Simons and Llanos now visit college campuses around the country to promote fire safety and bring awareness to the tragic fire that shaped their lives. They place a strong emphasis on the actions they could have done that night to get out safely.
“If we would have made a left that night and crawled to two doors down, we would have been able to get out with maybe just some smoke inhalation, but nothing that we went through,” Simons said. “It’s important that you think of those things in your everyday life.”
Simons and Llanos engaged in a question and answer session with Georgetown students, faculty and staff after the documentary ended.
GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) inquired about the number of states that still do not have laws set in place that require sprinklers in residence halls.
“I believe there are only five states in the country that have mandatory laws for sprinklers in residence halls,” Simons said. “I always say there is the potential for it to happen. … A great thing that happened was a lot of schools across the country started to look at the Seton Hall fire, but a lot of the things that started happening were off-campus fires. A lot of students are moving out and getting their own places in major cities across the U.S.”
While Georgetown does have sprinklers in all its residence halls, there is still a need for fire safety precautions in off-campus housing. In 2004, Georgetown student Daniel Rigby (MSB ’05) was killed in a fire at his townhouse on Prospect Street.
“Although we have not had a fire like the one at Seton Hall, Georgetown has well experienced tragedy regarding student fires with Daniel Rigby’s death,” GUSA Secretary for Health and Safety Nora West (SFS ’15) said. “Looking forward, Georgetown has sprinkler systems with all its residence halls, but not off-campus. While the Office of Neighborhood Life and the Friends of Daniel Rigby organization do a lot to provide fire alarms and fire extinguishers, we aren’t talking about second points of exit. If someone lives on the second or third floor of a house, how will they get out? We have to consider both the small kitchen fires and large fires that can occur.”
Mike Bergin (COL ’18) felt personally connected to the event because he was born in the same hospital as the burn victims were treated in, and attended Seton Hall Prep.
“After seeing the video, what hit me the most was [that] it was my community. I was born in that same hospital where they were,” Bergin said. “This event made me realize to actually take it seriously, especially after seeing all the photographs of the victims.”
