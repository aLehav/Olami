The Hoya transitioned to a new editorial and publishing staff for fall 2016 on Sunday, April 24, producing their first print issue today.
Kristen Fedor (COL ’17), who served as City News Editor in the fall of 2015, will return from a semester abroad in London, England, to begin a year-long position as Chair of the Board of Directors.
“Working at The Hoya was the aspect of home I missed most while studying abroad, so I am incredibly excited to be back in Leavey 421 next semester,” Fedor said. “After overseeing the news section, I am looking forward to collaborating with the talented Board of Directors on broader organization initiatives.”
Matthew Trunko (MSB ’18), who served as Layout Editor in the spring of 2016, will take over a semester-long term as Managing Editor.
“I’ve had a great time being able to meet and work with so many talented people while I’ve been with The Hoya these past couple years. As Managing Editor I look forward to continuing to help lead and develop our paper,” Trunko said.
Toby Hung (COL ’18), who was Campus News Editor in the fall of 2015 and Guide Editor in the spring of 2016, takes over from Suzanne Monyak (COL ’17), as Executive Editor.
“Having edited two vastly different sections, I look forward to further expanding our coverage to include typically underrepresented communities and perspectives on- and off-campus,” Hung said.
Jinwoo Chong (COL ’17), who served as Managing Editor in the spring of 2016, in addition to previous terms as Guide Editor, Director of Human Resources and Opinion Editor, begins his year-long term as an At-Large Board Member.
“After having worked at The Hoya in a number of different capacities, I’m excited for the opportunity to take a step back and guide the paper on a broader scale,” Chong said. “It’s a bit of a welcome blessing, judging by how much time I’ve spent doing the nitty-gritty day-to-day operations of the paper.”

Israeli citizens Khaled Farrag and Yasmin Yablonko defended their refusal to serve in the Israel Defense Forces because of the Israeli government’s treatment of the Druze and Palestinian communities during an event in White-Gravenor on Monday, April 18.
The event, which was sponsored by J Street Georgetown, featured Farrag, a 34-year-old Palestinian Druze and Israeli citizen, and Yablonko, a 23-year-old Israeli, who both refused to serve in the Israel Defense Forces because of their ideological objections.
The Druze is a religious minority found mostly in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. Originated from Islam in the 11th Century, the Druze today is considered an independent religion. The Druze is the only Palestinian community required by law to serve in the Israeli army.
All other non-Arab Israeli citizens are required to serve in the military after turning 18.
Historically, refusing military service has been one of the most prevalent ways that Israelis resist occupation from within. As a result, in spite of ‘compulsory’ conscription, less than 50 percent of Israelis and 64 percent of the Jewish-Israeli population serve in the IDF. Approximately 75 percent of the Israeli population identifies as Jewish and 21 percent identifies as Arab.
While both Farrag and Yablonko have focused on helping other youth follow in their footsteps by partnering with various organizations, their efforts primarily go toward aiding Israeli Jews and the Druze.
Through her work with Mesarvot, a network of Israeli organizations resisting occupation, Yablonko aims to offer young Jewish citizens assistance and help them organize their own efforts to refuse to serve. Farrag’s movement, Urfod, asks Israel to end compulsory military service for Druze.
According to Farrag, Israel uses the education system to isolate the Druze and pressure them to join the military. The curricula and the content in the Druze schools aim to erase any rebellious qualities in the Druze communities.
“I think the most dangerous tool they used was imposed in the 1970’s where total separation of the educational systems was done for the Druze,” Farrag said. “They created a Druze curriculum which means that the content they taught in schools that have a majority of Druze was just different from any other Arab school. This is the most dangerous one because this is the one that actually works.”
Yablonko agreed with Farrag’s assessment of the education system as perpetuating the illusion that everyone enlists and increasing social pressure to join the military.
“It seems to everyone in Israel ,and I think also outside of it, that everyone is going to the military in Israel. The truth is it’s not like that, and I think that the right question to ask is ‘how come that’s the situation; how come everyone thinks that the military’s obviously something you have to do?’” Yablonko said. “I think that the major answer to that would be the education system.”
According to Yablonko, in Israel the pressure to become a soldier starts as early as kindergarten. Then, in tenth grade, students are ordered to come to the military and start testing. The whole education system is geared toward helping students determine which job in the military they will get.
“There is no question about will I go, just what will I do there?” Yablonko said.
Beyond preparation in school, the immense social stigma imposed on those who refuse ensures that young Israelis enlist in the military.
“When you’re seventeen, eighteen years old and all your friends are going and doing something, it’s really hard not to do it, especially when this something is so obviously the next thing you should do,” Yablonko said.
According to Yablonko, pressure to join the military not only comes from peers but also from parents.
As a result, according to Farrag, many Druze today serving in the IDF no longer connect to their Palestinian or Arab identity. Farrag said he hopes the Ufrod movement, which advocates eliminating conscription for Druze, will work to connect the Druze men refusing military conscription with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, two historically-linked groups.
“When [Palestinians] see a Druze who’s not a soldier first of all and then talks just like they do and is part of the Palestinian struggle for liberation, they are very inspired and happy to know that there are other voices,” Farrag said.

Hosted by black female students on campus, the inaugural BRAVE — black, resilient, artistic, vigilant, enough — summit featured a day of speeches, breakout sessions and panels Saturday with black leaders from a range of fields, including Black Lives Matter D.C. Co-Founder Erika Totten, Federal Communications Commission Acting Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn and Core Health and Wellness Center Founder Dr. Gloria Wilder (GRD ’93).
BRAVE was founded to promote dialogue and uplift black women amid misrepresentations of the community in the mainstream media, according to the summit’s website.
Alexis Oni-Eseleh (COL ’16), one of the summit’s organizers, said it is important for black women to come together and share their experiences.
“It is one thing to have passing conversations about being a black woman, sharing bonding moments with kitchen beauticians, and commiserating when the media inevitably forgets about us. It’s another thing to take our experience and broadcast it in a public forum,” Oni-Eseleh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Taking place in the Healey Family Student Center, Reiss Science Building and the Intercultural Center, the conference engaged an audience of around 250 people.
The conference included breakout sessions and panels such as “Black Women in Executive Positions,” “Religion and Communities of Color,” “Health Disparities to Women in Media” and “Generational Feminism and Black Women in Public Policy.”
In her keynote speech, Wilder advocated for the potential of black females to create impactful change in the community.
Wilder said the goals of activists have not changed since she began advocating for women of color as a teenager.
“The era of change that you are in is very similar to what we were in when I arrived here in Washington, D.C.,” Wilder said. “We wanted Martin Luther King to have a birthday, a holiday, we wanted Nelson Mandela to be free. We wanted to be able to finish our educations. We just wanted to be.”
Wilder stressed that young black women should not let society prevent them from seeking to achieve their goals.
“When you see injustice, say something. Don’t feel powerless when you actually have all the power you’re ever going to need,” Wilder said. “Have the courage to follow your passion and have the courage to know that nobody can write this script for you.”
Wilder said society perpetuates a cycle of poverty, which she experienced firsthand as her mother had to work three jobs while receiving welfare.
“The condition of poverty in the United States is a condition that we put on a certain percentage of our citizens,” Wilder said. “We do not even give access to civil law to people who are poor.”
Wilder encouraged alternative solutions to address the issue of poverty. Wilder completed her medical residency in a mobile van, as part of an effort to better serve underprivileged Washington, D.C. residents.
“This community had decided that this was important and that in this one little case of the little mobile van that could, justice would speak to some children in Wards 5, 6, 7 and 8,” Wilder said. “I had been the first resident in the United States to do their entire residency on a mobile program. After I finished it and people realized that you could actually learn a little medicine out in the field, they approved these types of residencies across the country and we had more applicants than we could deal with.”
Wilder said she looks forward to the impact future generations of black women will have on all facets of social justice, including education, economic justice, environmental justice, legal justice and health care.
“The beautiful thing about life is that one day you’re going to pass the baton. And you’re going to hope that the people behind you are just as swift so you can watch them move ahead of you,” Wilder said.
Speakers in the “Black Women in Public Policy” panel detailed how they are using their positions to help women of color in the public sector.
Moderated by African American studies professor Meredith Anderson, the panel featured Clyburn; Anita Hannon, intergovernmental liaison in the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations; International Finance Corporation attorney consultant Adeola Olagunju; Open Society Foundation senior policy analyst Nkechi Taifa; and Deputy Mayor for Greater Economic Opportunity Courtney Snowden.
Snowden said while working in the public sector is difficult, it is rewarding.
“Nothing is harder than trying to force the government to do something that it always doesn’t think it wants to do,” Snowden said. “When you are taking on a bureaucracy that has been entrenched for many years, it is a battle every single day.”
According to Clyburn, public service is the most effective method to instigate real change.
“Not all of the things that you think are yours you’re going to get on the first, second or even the third time,” Clyburn said. “But if you want it, then you will find a way to maneuver to get it. I am sitting here promoting public service because I think that it is the greatest gift you can give to your communities and this nation.”
Taifa said young people can make a difference if they choose a career that allows them to pursue their passions.
“One piece of advice that I would give to young people out there is to follow your passions, because if you follow your passions you will not go wrong,” Taifa said. “My advice to you is to demand change and demand that there must be a difference.”
Sarah Santana (COL ’16), who attended the summit, said she was fascinated by the summit’s emphasis on intersectionality.
“I was curious as to how the summit would approach intersectionality and look at various issues that we don’t necessarily talk about directly at other events on campus,” Santana said. “I think that it’s really great to hear those experiences because I think that a lot of the time you don’t really get a chance to hear about someone’s vulnerability.”
Shakera Vaughan (COL ’19), who volunteered at the summit, said she found the experience empowering.
“I chose to volunteer for BRAVE because I feel like there are not enough events that celebrate ‘Black Girl Magic,’ and I think that it is very important that we are reminded why we are important,” Vaughan said.

Student-led mental health program Project Lighthouse officially launched its anonymous online chat service Sunday, responding to 25 students’ messages on its first day of operations.
The new service, available from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. daily, connects students with student peer supporters to discuss issues ranging from stress and sleep problems to thoughts of self-harm.
The peer supporters, who underwent over 40 hours of training, are trained to actively listen to students and refer them to mental health resources such as Counseling and Psychiatric Services and Health Education Services.
According to Project Lighthouse Executive Director Benjamin Johnson (NHS ’17), the spring semester launch is a soft opening that will run for two weeks until May 6, before it relaunches in the fall semester with additional peer supporters.
Johnson said the program’s first night was a success.
“Almost everyone who chatted in was successfully referred to appropriate on-campus or off-campus resources,” Johnson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We really didn’t know what to expect for our first night, but are encouraged that initial results point to this being a much-needed resource for Georgetown.”
Johnson said Project Lighthouse’s launch post on Facebook reached around 5,700 people, while its website received 350 unique visitors.
“Our current goals are just getting our operations smooth with the continued training of supporters, and planning for our full launch in the fall semester,” Johnson wrote.
The name of Project Lighthouse is meant to symbolize the service’s goal of guiding people to mental health resources, and it was initially launched by the Georgetown University Student Association Mental Health Committee in January of this year in order to better connect students with mental health services and lessen the workload for CAPS and other university services. CAPS has been criticized for being unable to provide timely services to students in need.
The project, while being student-led, is supported by GUSA, CAPS, HES and other university departments.
According to Johnson, Project Lighthouse serves as a supportive listening resource rather than a counseling service or a crisis-intervention service.
“I personally see Project Lighthouse as the ‘first line’ for mental health on campus — it’s very approachable, very easy to access, and can serve as a portal to figuring out which on-campus resource would be most effective,” Johnson wrote.
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said she is excited about the potential of the new service.
“We are super excited about the launch of Project Lighthouse,” Khan said. “We hope that this new peer-to-peer resource will serve as an easy way for students to seek support or talk about any issue.”
Khan said the service’s anonymity is a major advantage for students who want to speak to a peer supporter.
“The anonymity factor helps students who feel uncomfortable sharing their identities when talking about mental health,” Khan said.
GUSA Mental Health Policy Team Chair Sylvia Levy (SFS ’18), who works with the Project Lighthouse team, said the program aims to reach all students.
“This incredible resource is going to make sure that Georgetown students don’t fall through the cracks,” Levy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think we’re well on our way to really helping Georgetown become a more mentally healthy campus. Our peer supporters, who have been through 40-plus hours of training, are really fantastic and are undoubtedly making a difference.”
Student Chair of the Mental Health Advisory Board William Emery (COL ’19) said Project Lighthouse fulfills one of the MHAB’s ongoing recommendations to improve campus mental health resources. The MHAB consists of students and staff from across the university.
“One way the MHAB has identified improvement is in increasing student awareness of the resources available to them. Project Lighthouse goes a long way towards making those improvements,” Emery wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Emery said the program’s unique structure builds confidence with students.
“Project Lighthouse volunteers are not just there for support; they are trained in on-campus and off-campus resources — and not only for mental health,” Emery wrote. “Instead of a student having to try to figure out where to go alone, a Project Lighthouse volunteer can talk with them about the available resources and provide them with the contact information for those resources.”
Levy said she hopes Project Lighthouse expands to other campuses. Cornell University currently operates a similar service, called the Empathy, Assistance and Referral Service.
“In the future, I hope we can increase student knowledge of our program and continue to attract talented, passionate people who would like to train to be Project Lighthouse Peer Supporters,” Levy wrote. “Hopefully other colleges and universities will be interested in the work we’re doing and consider starting their own Project Lighthouse chapters.”
Khan said she hopes the launch is a step toward a cultural shift regarding mental health on campus.
“As a community, we can best support each other by being empathetic. Project Lighthouse is proof that we as students are here for one another.” Khan said. “Project Lighthouse is a major step towards breaking the stigma around talking about mental health on our campus.”

— “Project Lighthouse is a major step towards breaking the stigma around talking about mental health on our campus.”
If there is a stigma on your campus, the proper action to take is to file a civil rights complaint. You do not simply say it exists.
Like racism, you address it formally.

SFS '17 says

Odd argument Harold. So an effort by hoyas to take a stand against “stigma” should be dismissed because it did not manifest in the form of  lawsuits? Doesn’t that buy into the often whined about culture of suing for everything? And does that not preclude anybody unable to afford a lawyer from advocacy?
From reading the article, I would certainly not say that the creation of Project Lighthouse is just “saying” that stigma exists. It’s the creation of a website and the training of a volunteer corp to address a need on this campus. That is taking a big step towards decreasing stigma around seeking mental health treatment.
Not sure why the Hoya did not put the link to their website into the article but it is projectlighthousegu.com if you want to check it out so you can see what “saying stigma exists” looks like.

Seventy-seven percent of riders sexually harassed on the Metrorail do not report the incident, according to an inaugural survey measuring awareness and reporting of sexual harassment on the Metro released by the Washington Metro Transit Police on April 12.
With data collected from 1,000 respondents over the course of the month of January, the survey reported that 21 percent of riders have experienced a form of sexual harassment, ranging from sexual assault to verbal harassment, in the Washington, D.C. area, higher than the national rate of 18 percent.
The study also found that women were three times more likely to face harassment, with 28 percent of female respondents reporting incidents compared to 9 percent of men who reportedly experienced harassment.
Released in light of Sexual Assault Awareness Month and International Anti-Street Harassment Week from April 10 to 16, the survey was part of a yearlong collaborative effort between WMTP and advocacy organizations Collective Action for Safe Spaces and Stop Street Harassment to combat sexual harassment on the Metro.
Additional efforts include public outreach through an advertisement campaign, a $40,000 grant by the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities dedicated to public art addressing the issue and more advanced methods of reporting incidents to Washington Metro Transit Police, including a website, an email address and text messaging system.
The survey found that 75 percent of sexual harassment was labeled as “verbal harassment,” while 47 percent was characterized as “leering.” Two percent of reported incidents were sexual assault whereas 9 percent were groping incidents.
SSH Founder and Executive Director Holly Kearl said the purpose of the survey was to provide her organization with a baseline for how best to proceed with anti-harassment efforts.
In a press release, Lynn Bowersox, assistant general manager of customer service, communications and marketing of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, said the purpose of the extended efforts to combat sexual harassment is to ensure the welfare of riders.
“Metro is working to make all riders feel safer and more comfortable on the system, and raising awareness about sexual harassment is an important part of that effort,” Bowersox wrote.
Kearl also praised WMATA for taking steps to combat sexual harassment by conducting the survey.
“The fact that they did this survey at all is a huge signal that they are trying to take this issue seriously,” Kearl said. “No other transit system has done this level of surveying on this issue in our country.”
Kearl said she believes more incidents will be reported with the implementation of a quarterly report system.
“We’ve been trying to let our constituents know that Metro is keeping records of all the harassment,” Kearl said. “You can report something that happened a while ago, you can report something that happened today, something that you witnessed.”
Kearl added while she appreciates Metro’s efforts, its employees are still untrained to handle harassment cases and are perpetrators in some cases.
“Something that they have done before and we’re pushing them to do is to train their staff so that when someone does make a report in person that person is able to help them,” Kearl said. “Unfortunately, sometimes we do hear about Metro employees being the harasser.”
CASS Executive Director Jessica Raven said the organization is committed to spreading awareness of the issue at a grassroots level and through the Sexual Assault Education Campaign.
“In the first place we have to make sure people know it’s a problem,” Raven said. “[We should] make sure people know that police officers and staff are trained to respond to people who have experienced sexual harassment and assault.”
Raven said the Metro’s anti-harassment campaign is a step in the right direction toward combatting a culture in which citizens, especially women and the LGBTQ community, have been conditioned to accept harassment as a fact of life.
“These ads on the Metro have been significant,” Raven said. “They’re actually saying for the first time, if it’s unwanted, it’s harassment. We’re defining it, naming the problem, letting people know that this behavior is unacceptable and they don’t have to tolerate it.”
According to the survey, 41 percent of Metro riders are familiar with the education campaign. Furthermore, those familiar with the campaign are twice as likely to report sexual harassment incidents compared with the 77 percent who indicated they never reported sexual harassment incidents.
Georgetown University Student Association Policy Chair of the Safety and Sexual Assault Team Maddy Moore (SFS ’17), who is also a member of Sexual Assault Peer Educators, said she is grateful for a report detailing sexual harassment incidents on the Metro.
“It wasn’t surprising to know that people are receiving unwanted harassment and attention in public spaces,” Moore said. “I think that’s something that women especially have been subject to this for a really long time, so I’m glad there’s finally a report detailing that.”

With the mission of increasing recognition for Georgetown’s workers, Facebook page Unsung Heroes captures their personal stories through videos and photography on its Facebook page, which has gained more than 1000 followers since its April 1 launch.
Sponsored by the Clinton Global Initiative University, the page has featured eleven posts to date, including interviews with Food & Service Worker at Leo O’Donovan Dining Hall José Manzanares and Food & Service worker at Leavey Center’s Grab & Go Station Javier Reyes. The posts follow a similar style to the photographs on popular Facebook page Humans of New York.
Febin Bellamy (MSB ’17) initially founded the project as an assignment for philosophy professor Jason Brennan’s “Moral Foundations in Market Society” class last spring. Since then, Bellamy and his team, consisting of Harrison Williams (COL ’16), Lucas Berry (MSB ’17), Isaiah Jones (COL ’16), Jonathan Carrington (MSB ’17), Naiara Parker (MSB ’18) and Kevin Durham (MSB ’19), have been working on reaching out to campus workers and creating posts.
Bellamy’s inspiration came during a three-week period of studying in the Hariri Building until the early morning, when he began to notice a facilities management worker who cleaned the windows each night. Bellamy eventually became friends with the cleaner, Oneil Batchelor.
Bellamy said his interactions with Batchelor encouraged him to start the Facebook page.
“I started started making conversations with Batchelor every day and got to know him really well,” Bellamy said. “I thought, ‘Why don’t all students get a chance to know their stories as well, and more than just facilities management workers? What about the people at Elevation Burger or the people at Leo’s?’”
After pitching the idea to his classmates, Bellamy began conducting interviews with Georgetown employees from various departments, including facilities management, utilities plant, cleaning and maintenance, transportation and food and service.
Before they launched the Facebook page, Bellamy and his team had archived 60 interviews. Since then, over 15 additional employee interviews have been conducted.
Bellamy said he selects unique parts from the conversations and includes photographs of the individuals, often in their respective work environments, when he publishes a post. He also aims to have conversations that gradually bring out an employee’s story instead of formal interviews.
“We try to talk broadly at first,” Bellamy said. “Then we ask them about what they do on the weekends or in their free time, which is when they [are] talking about their kids or things that are important to them. I don’t even call them interviews. I just ask if I can talk to them for a few minutes.
According to Bellamy, potential subjects were apprehensive toward being featured when the project began, but are now more willing given the page’s positive reception.
“A lot of times, these workers are just looking for someone to talk to and want someone to hear them out. For students to show that they’re actually interested in getting to know them, that’s very different from what they’re used to,” Bellamy said.
Among Unsung Heroes’ most popular featured workers are Frankie Capers, a food and service worker at Einstein Bros. Bagels who discusses her life-long commitment to the truth, facilities management night worker Memuna Tackie, who discusses passing her citizenship test and learning English from Katherine Leopold (COL ’18) and facilities management night worker Vernetta Butler, who helped three girls who were being followed by strangers. Capers’s feature received around 900 likes.
Bellamy said the employees’ responses to questions give insight into ways Georgetown students can be more supportive of workers.
“One question that I always ask is, ‘What does a thank you mean to you?’” Bellamy said. “I also usually ask what the most memorable moment they’ve had at Georgetown is. One time someone said it was when a student bought her coffee. She had been here for 20 years and the most memorable moment she had was when a student bought her a coffee. If we can do more of that, we can really make these lives and experiences much better.”
Georgetown Individuals Vocal and Energetic for Service President Lauren Bachmann (SFS ’18) said the mission of Unsung Heroes is important in supporting workers.
“It is important to recognize those people who work behind the scenes because they are most often forgotten and deserve appreciation — we are all Hoyas. A simple act of kindness can go a long way, and the goals of Unsung Heroes are really wonderful,” Bachmann said.
Bellamy said he hopes the project can move beyond interviews to finding ways to help workers.
“The style that we have used so far is just to get students to understand that [these workers] are human beings — they have stories. I think once students start seeing that, we’re going to continue doing that but it’s going to also be more action. Sort of like, now that we know that they exist, how do we give back to them?” Bellamy said.
Unsung Heroes recently secured funding from StartupHoyas to purchase equipment and fund its expansion to other campuses, after Bellamy and his partner Harrison Williams (COL ’16) presented their idea during the StartupHoyas Challenge earlier this semester. Unsung Heroes was selected as one of eight finalists from an original pool of 80.
Williams said he is not surprised by the project’s success.
“You have to give this issue a humanizing touch and make students think, ‘Wow, these are people that have the same experiences and thought processes as me and I shouldn’t look at them any differently because I go to Georgetown and they don’t,’” Williams said. “They’re not our maids, they’re not our servants. I think the popularity comes from the emotional connection.”
Unsung Heroes also recently teamed up with Georgetown Individuals Vocal and Energetic for Service, which seeks to spread happiness in the community, to make posters for university workers. The team filmed the project and featured it on the Unsung Heroes page.
Bellamy is currently working to expand Unsung Heroes beyond Georgetown. While Unsung Heroes will remain the parent organization, Georgetown’s chapter will eventually change its name to Unsung Hoyas.
Bellamy said he is pleased with the positive feedback students are giving.
“I hear a lot of students already saying that they see a change in myself and that they think twice when they see a worker and walk past them. That makes me really happy because that’s our whole goal as an organization,” Bellamy said. “Just say thank you. That’s all we want.”

Six university administrators emphasized the need to expand Counseling and Psychiatric Services and better publicize resources available for victims of sexual assault at the third annual Sexual Assault Open Forum in the Leavey Program Room on Wednesday.
Hosted by Take Back the Night and the Georgetown University Student Association, the panelists included Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, Title IX Coordinator Laura Cutway, Georgetown University Police Department Sexual Assault Response and Prevention Coordinator Sergeant Sarah Halpren-Ruder, Director of Health Education Services Carol Day, HES Staff Clinician and Sexual Assault Specialist Jennifer Wiggins and Director of CAPS Dr. Phil Meilman.
The panel highlighted recent changes to support survivors of sexual assault, including the printing of campus resource phone numbers on the back of all new GOCards, the provision of a semester’s worth of free CAPS appointments to survivors and respondents and the addition of stickers with information on resources for survivors placed in every public restroom on campus.
Panelists agreed that there is still room to improve sexual assault services, despite strides made in increasing prevention, access and transparency of support measures.
Meilman said CAPS staff needs to be expanded in order to decrease wait times while increasing accessibility.
“In terms of reforms going forward, we want to grow the size of the CAPS staff. I’m pleased to say that that’s already begun and we anticipate that we will continue to do that in the next couple years. It’ll be incremental but we’re moving in the right direction,” Meilman said.
Meilman said CAPS plans to further develop its outreach programs. According to Meilman, the ultimate goal of the programs is to end sexual assault on campus.
“Until everyone on campus understands that the university doesn’t tolerate this kind of behavior, then we have a lot of work to do,” Meilman said. “That may be aspirational but it’s a good aspiration and I’d like to see us move in that direction.”
Wiggins, the faculty advisor for Georgetown’s Sexual Assault Peer Educators program, said there is a lack of diversity in the dialogue surrounding sexual assault. According to Wiggins, only 15 of the 60 students involved with SAPE identify as male and few people of color are represented.
“I think diversification is something I’d like to see in the sexual assault [education] community here at Georgetown,” Wiggins said. “Even just taking a look in the room right now, I don’t think there are many students of color who are engaging in this conversation overall.”
Wiggins said she has begun to tackle the issue by collaborating with the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access. As part of this effort, Wiggins has set up office hours in the CMEA, but said a community-wide effort to diversify conversations about sexual assault is required.
“I think that there are a number of things that we as a community need to do overall to invite a different level of experiences to the sexual assault conversation,” Wiggins said.
According to Wilson, SAPE has reached 700 students on campus through its programming this year.
Cutway, who became Georgetown’s first full-time Title IX coordinator when she was hired in January, said there is a need for greater transparency and an increased focus on developing preventative measures.
Cutway said she hopes to clarify on-campus services for sexual assault survivors, such as a flowchart on how to access services, a checklist indicating the confidentiality of services, as well as a FAQ document.
“I would like to increase reporting by ensuring that students understand the process. I want as much transparency in that process as possible,” Cutway said. “I would also like an avenue for online reporting, and I would like to bolster the website because we’ve heard feedback that it’s not so user-friendly or mobile-friendly.”
Halpren-Ruder said it is important for GUPD to develop a stronger reputation and relationships with students to ensure effective sexual assault responses.
“We want to continue to bridge gaps between the way we’re viewed as law enforcement officers between the students and to continue to build the relationships we have with other departments. The stronger the relationships are, the stronger we are as a resource for everyone here,” Halpren-Ruder said.
As part of its efforts, GUPD has implemented 40-hour training sessions for all incoming personnel as a way to enhance sexual assault responses.
Olson said he is proud of both the work that has been achieved and the university’s attitude toward addressing sexual assault moving forward.
“I’m still very restless and eager to hear what our working groups come up with. I think we need to be restless, while also acknowledging the fact that we’ve done a lot of great work,” Olson said.
Meredith Lostaglio (SFS ’19), who attended the event and volunteers as a SAPE coordinator, said CAPS and HES should focus on preventative measures for sexual assault in the future.
“The administration is taking a lot of steps when it comes to this issue, but a lot of the steps are retroactive in the sense that they deal with survivors, rather than preventing rape. SAPE is one of the few organizations I see on campus that try to deal with the issues that lead to rape, rather than the fallout of rape,” Lostaglio said.

Washington, D.C., is one of three cities alongside Baltimore and Chicago that account for more than half of the surge in the number of murders nationwide between 2014 and 2015, according to a study released last Wednesday by the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice.
The second annual report, which examined crime in the United States’ 30 largest cities through 2015, found that in Washington alone, the murder rate increased by 54.3 percent from 105 in 2014 to 162 in 2015.
According to the report, although the crime rate is at an all-time low in the nation with a 0.1 percent decrease from 2014, the murder rate leaped 13.2 percent in D.C., Baltimore and Chicago. The reports listed these three cities as having declining populations, higher poverty rates and higher unemployment rates than the national average.
The Brennan Center said the surge in murders in these three cities may have been caused by small numerical increases.
“Murder rates vary widely from year to year, and there is little evidence of a national coming wave in violent crime. These serious increases seem to be localized, rather than part of a national pandemic, suggesting that community conditions remain the major factor,” the study reads.
According to James Cullen, a research and program associate in the Brennan Center for Justice, the competing trends of reduced crime with increased murder rates highlight the need for a multifaceted approach to analyzing crime.
“While Washington, D.C., saw less crime, mostly because burglaries and motor vehicle thefts went down, it saw more violent activity, such as robberies and murders,” Cullen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This was true for many cities, but illustrates that talking about crime alone or murder alone often does not give a full picture.”
While Cullen emphasized the difficulty of making generalizations at a national level based on a one-year sample, he acknowledged the inconsistency present in Washington, Baltimore and Chicago compared with the rest of the country.
“The data suggests that the nation is on the same trend towards greater safety, but something is happening in those cities,” Cullen wrote. “We did not study these cities closely and do not want to guess the cause of the spikes. And it’s hard to know after one year. We will have to wait and see.”
Cullen said compiling the study was a rigorous exercise of data collection and analysis.
“The study itself was quite involved, and took time,” Cullen wrote. “We had to gather the data, only some of which is available publicly, sort through the different definitions of various crimes to ensure a uniform analysis, and determine a methodology before we could go about analyzing the data and drawing conclusions from it.”
Georgetown sociology professor William McDonald attributed the increase in murders to a possible shift in the population cohort of 15- to 25-year-olds and the District’s high population density.
“The crime rate will increase even if at the individual level people are committing the same number of crimes per year,” McDonald wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In D.C., the population density may have increased due to gentrification process forcing lower income people to share space or accept tight living conditions.”
Cullen said while the study may be useful for policymakers, it was intended for public consumption in order to dispel the misconception that crime has been rising nationally over recent years.
“Very few people are talking about the fact that the murder rate is half of what it was 25 years ago, and that crime has fallen across the country,” Cullen wrote. “Some cities have clearly seen a spike in murders, like Washington, D.C. That cannot, and should not, be ignored. But from everything we’ve seen in the data, that is a localized spike.”
Georgetown Against Gun Violence member Katherine Cienkus (SFS ’18) said gun violence contributes to a cycle of crime and poverty nationally.
“As college students in the area who have the potential to work on these issues, we must recognize that one death by guns is one too many, and how violence systemically destroys communities and continues the cycle of poverty and violence,” Cienkus said. “Awareness is a huge part of the problem, but engagement is what we should strive for.”
Allie Little (COL ’18) said as a current resident of D.C., she is upset by the increasing rates of murder in D.C.
“The high rate of gun violence obviously makes me sad, but it also makes me want to empower people to figure out why it exists, because I don’t like that statistic. I don’t like that we live in a city like that,” Little said.

The Georgetown Community Partnership Steering Committee postponed its deadline to submit a draft of the 2018 Campus Plan to the Washington, D.C. Office of Zoning to July 1 — two months later than its original goal of April 22 — due to unresolved negotiations regarding MedStar and campus housing.
The committee, which comprises administrators, students, community members and Medstar Hospital officials, agreed to submit the completed campus plan to the Office of Zoning in time for a Sept. 1 hearing.
Agreements in which existing campus buildings and spaces can be used for development and the placement of entrances to Georgetown MedStar hospital still need to be reached.
Georgetown University Student Association Deputy Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), who is responsible for campus planning and helped lead the “Let’s Not Get Screwed Again” petition in 2015 to ensure increased student voice in the 2018 Campus Plan negotiations, said the committee missed the deadline to continue negotiations.
“There are still pretty significant gaps that exist, specifically in housing between different community members and also on MedStar’s plans,” Goldstein said.
According to Goldstein, the original deadline was moved ahead because of MedStar’s new construction plans, which include building a surgical pavilion and a green space.
“The original deadline was July 1, 2017 to submit to the zoning commission. After Medstar voiced their concerns we rushed the process by a year,” Goldstein said.
Goldstein said the goal now is to finish the campus plan by the middle of summer.
“There is a goal of some to finalize the last elements by the middle of this May and continue with our plan to submit this summer,” Goldstein said.
According to Goldstein, the neighbors hope to increase the number of students living on campus. However, Goldstein said the university does not have the funds to create more housing on campus, as it already borrowed $68.4 million to build the Former Jesuit Residence and the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall.
“We leveraged a lot of debt to build the Former Jesuit Residence and Northeast Triangle,” Goldstein said. “There is a goal to house 90 percent of students on campus by 2025.”
Goldstein said some of the issues regarding campus development stem from the university’s lack of funding.
“We are in a large urban area. We are a medium-sized school. Frankly, we have a lot less money than comparable institutions like Harvard or Stanford,” Goldstein said.
The GCP was formed after the 2010 Campus Plan was implemented in 2012 after a lengthy legal battle between several Georgetown resident associations and the university. The Office of Zoning approved the 2010 Campus Plan in July 2012 after more than two years of negotiations between the university and neighbors, which included significant concessions by the university to neighbors, including a three-year on-campus housing requirement for students.
Jack Pelose (COL ’19), a member of the GCP Transportation and Parking Steering Committee Working Group, said the GCP has had a positive impact on relations between the university and neighbors.
“It is important that when the university submits a campus plan the neighbors know that they have been included and that students can be assured that their interests have been heard and prioritized as well,” Pelose said.
Goldstein said the GCP seeks to foster better relations between the community and the university.
“We can work together on it every step of the way so that by the time we submit it, everyone is on the same page,” Goldstein said. “The 2010 Campus Plan took three years to litigate in court. It was a hugely expensive battle for the neighborhood and the university.”
Former GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) said while the university should attempt to balance its obligation to students and respect for the community, students should be the first priority.
“I think the university should try to be a good neighbor to the community, but not at the expense of students or the student experience. Students should always be the university’s priority,” Luther said.
Lily Ryan (COL ’18) said the new campus plan should focus less on building new dorms, but instead aim to benefit on-campus residents in other ways.
“My concern is that the university is putting a lot of money into building infrastructure when there are a lot of places where they could also put their money where students and on-campus workers would be better served,” Ryan said.
Seth Maslowski (MSB ’19) said he opposed parts of the campus plan that would increase the number of students living on campus.
“I think the community can be kind of ridiculous with trying to keep students on campus,” Maslowski said. “I don’t think we should try to make our campus more congested than it already is.”

The Georgetown University Student Association executive charged its first federal relations team to advocate for student affairs and engage students on local and federal government initiatives.
The March addition to GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Vice President Chris Fisk’s (COL ’17) executive, the office is directed by former Executive Officer of the GUSA Senate Kotryna Jukneviciute (COL ’18), and is divided into local advocacy, national advocacy and programming departments.
Within the federal relations team, the National Advocacy team, Local Advocacy team and Programming teams, alongside National & Local Liaison Trey Tadepalli and Secretary of Civil Rights Advocacy Ibilola Owoyele, report directly to Jukneviciute. Jukneviciute meets routinely with Vice President for Government Relations and Community Engagement Chris Murphy.
The National Advocacy team, Local Advocacy team and Programming teams each have secretaries working in more focused areas.
According to Murphy, the team will work with the university’s Office of Federal Relations to advance campus dialogue on national issues such as federal student aid, D.C. statehood and mental health.
According to Jukneviciute, the team has already begun three initiatives: a student leadership alliance to encourage cooperation between student government at colleges around the country, a mentorship program with D.C. public school students and a partnership with D.C. Central Kitchens to provide storage space on campus for its summer operations.
Jukneviciute said the SLA will develop a website that brings student governments together.
“The Student Leadership Alliance is basically a website bringing different institutions together across the country in a centralized location for advocacy purposes, so basically a resource for us to reach out to different student body presidents from different student governments,” Jukneviciute said.
Khan said she and Fisk saw the need for a new GUSA executive office after she saw common issues arise at college campuses around the country.
“The very first time Chris and I sat down, this was a conversation that we had,” Khan said. “At the time, a lot of it pertained to the conversations we saw were happening about race and inclusion on campuses and we realized there are a lot of issues that spur on college campuses, but then can become a more widespread national conversation.”
Khan said Georgetown is in a unique situation to lead national advocacy.
“Since we are at Georgetown, in D.C., we have access to the actual federal government, which puts us in a unique position,” Khan said. “We realized that since there is that interest at Georgetown, we have a responsibility to be able to connect students and empower them to be able to do that.”
Murphy said he looks forward to working with the federal relations team on various student-related issues.
“We have really enjoyed the partnership our office has formed with Kotryna Jukneviciute and the other students on the GUSA Federal Relations [Team],” Murphy wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“They bring a wonderful energy, ambition and commitment to their work.”
Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said he plans on meeting with team members to discuss issues the administration should support.
“We have already had terrific conversations about some of the issues coming up down the road in Congress impacting students,” Fleming wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In fact, last evening I met with the GUSA federal relations team and we discussed a number of ideas where I am sure we will work together, most especially in areas of student aid funding and the Higher Education Act Reauthorization.”
GUSA Secretary of Institutional Outreach Zachary Schroepfer (SFS ’19), who oversees the SLA project, said he hopes to facilitate communication among student activists around the country.
“We figured that as students that are in D.C. we have a certain benefit because we are so close to Capitol Hill that we don’t want to just keep for ourselves,” Schroepfer said. “We want to share with other universities.”
Schroepfer said the SLA will also analyze congressional bills that might impact students and aggregate student advocacy at the federal level to advocate for or against policy proposals.
“For example, if there is a piece of legislation on the Hill on mental health that is good for students then we would have a petition for or against it depending on how it affects college students and then from there we would get student body presidents of different universities to sign on to these petitions,” Schroepfer said. “That way when we go up to different congresspeople and staffers we can say it’s not just Georgetown students who care about this issue.”
According to GUSA Secretary of Local Educational Affairs Kamar Mack (COL ’19), his team focuses on building relationships between Georgetown and D.C. public school students.
“My role is twofold – first, giving Georgetown students more avenues to improve DC education and second, advocating to DC city leaders on behalf of schools needing the most help. My passion for education motivates me because improving our schools will address countless other social issues while opening doors of opportunity,” Mack wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Mack said he is also developing a mentorship program that will match Georgetown students with three Anacostia elementary school students. Students will guide their mentees through their college career.
“The idea is to build strong, long-term relationships with their mentees, and the group can grow together,” Mack wrote. “This is extremely important for the Anacostia students because academic and moral development must begin early in order to succeed in secondary and higher education.”
GUSA Secretary of D.C. Statehood Cheryl Liu (SFS ’19) will push for District statehood through partnerships with local government (full disclosure: Liu is a staff writer for The Hoya).
“D.C. statehood should be seen as a bipartisan issue,” Jukneviciute said. “You have thousands and thousands of people who don’t have a voice, who are living in the city and whose vote doesn’t really matter too much, who don’t have representation. I think ultimately that’s a civil rights issue.”
Jukneviciute said she and Secretary of D.C. Programming Sabrina Romulo (SFS ’19) are working to secure storage space on campus for D.C. Central Kitchens’ summer programs for low-income students.
“What we want to do is make Georgetown’s freezer space available to them in the summer because they are very low on freezer space,” Jukneviciute said. “With this, D.C. Central Kitchens would be able to provide more meals during the summer when the students who rely on school lunches and go to school for school lunches will have food during the summer so they won’t be starving when not in class.”

The District Department of Transportation launched a program to enable low-income residents in Washington, D.C., to receive a yearly membership to the bicycle rental service Capital Bikeshare for as low as $5 on April 13.
Through the new initiative, D.C. residents who use certain social service programs, such as the D.C. Department of Human Services, Back on My Feet D.C., Unity Health Care, Whitman-Walker Health, Community of Hope D.C. and the D.C. Center for the LGBT Community, will be connected with Capital Bikeshare to receive discounted memberships.
The government-run bicycle sharing organization, which has more than 350 stations and serves residents of Washington, D.C., Arlington Country, Alexandria and Montgomery County, typically charges customers $85 for new memberships.
A 2014 Capital Bikeshare survey found more than 50 percent of its customers are white and make an annual income of more than $100,000, despite 50 percent of the District’s population being black and 19 percent living below the poverty line.
The program, similar to others offered in cities like Boston, is intended to reduce barriers low-income individuals face in attempting to use bike sharing programs by not only reducing cost, but also increasing allowed trip time and providing cycling-focused education.
In a press release, DDOT Director Leif Dormsjo stressed the role the Capital Bikeshare community partnership will play in providing residents with an accessible means of getting to and from important engagements.
“It is critical that those with the most need are able to travel quickly and economically to and from their appointments, jobs, training and classes,” Dormsjo said.
Capital Bikeshare Project Manager Kimberly Lucas said Capital Bikeshare will also be providing low-income residents with free helmets and improving program outreach and education.
“By bringing the cost down to $5, we make Capital Bikeshare more accessible for the folks who need it the most,” Lucas said. “In addition, if you’re learning about the community partners program through one of the organizations that you’re already a member of, then you’ll have someone there who can educate you on how Bikeshare works, show you all the safety materials and provide you with a free helmet as well.”
A 2015 study from the National Association of City Transportation Officials indicated low-income residents encounter barriers to bike sharing programs, including a lack of communication between government officials and city residents, a lack of cash payment options for membership and an absence of bike sharing stations in low-income neighborhoods.
“While evidence suggests that the total cost of an annual bike share membership is not an insurmountable barrier for most low-income people, many low-income people have difficulties coming up with the lump-sum payment for annual membership,” the report read.
Arlington County initiated a program in 2015 allowing residents to pay for Capital Bikeshare memberships using cash; however, only ten residents joined the program through the new payment option. Under the District’s new community partnership program, low-income residents who are matched with the service will be able to purchase Capital Bikeshare memberships using community partners’ credit accounts without requiring a credit card themselves.
At $5, the new Bikeshare membership will be cheaper than the discounted weekly Metrobus pass that the Metro system currently offers to senior residents.
Aidan Thaggard (MSB ’19) said that the new Bikeshare initiative would mitigate the negative effects limited transportation options have on lower-income residents seeking to gain or maintain employment.
“I think definitely one of the primary obstacles in lifting oneself out of the vicious cycle of poverty is being able to consistently be available for work,” Thaggard said. “One of the biggest challenges with being available for work is transportation, because obviously public transportation exists but it’s neither perfect nor attuned to exactly where everyone needs to go.”
Liam Flanagan (NHS ’19) said he envisions the Bikeshare initiative as providing an environmentally friendly alternative to other forms of transportation.
“[Capital Bikeshare] is a healthy alternative to other modes of transportation that are not only damaging to the environment but not as specific to the needs of their users,” Flanagan said.

The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Policy will accept student applications through May 8 for its newly launched 2016 Convention Ambassadors program, an initiative providing members with access to the presidential nominating conventions in July.
GU Politics will fund transportation and housing for selected students traveling to either the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia from July 25 to 28 or the Republican National Convention in Cleveland from July 18 to 21. Both undergraduate and graduate students are eligible.
According to Lauren Mullins, director of communications of the McCourt School of Public Policy, ambassadors will volunteer in committees and attend events with media outlets and other political organizations to develop a behind-the-scenes understanding of the nominating process.
In addition to serving as spokespeople to political media, members are expected to generate content through social media including Snapchat, Twitter and blog posts documenting their experiences on the trail.
The programming further includes meet-and-greet sessions with prominent political actors from the campaign trail, along with collaborations with other Institutes of Politics representing schools including Harvard University and the University of Chicago.
Mullins said the program allows participants to witness one of the most instrumental processes in each presidential race.
“The whole idea of GU Politics is really kind of pulling back the curtains and allowing Hoyas to see what politics is really like up close,” Mullins said. “I think we want to give Hoyas that experience to help both conventions and open up their eyes to the process while we’re up there meeting with political figures, meeting with other organizations involved in the process and continuing that learning effort on both sides.”
Mullins said although the number of available slots has not yet been established, students accepted on the basis of their political engagement and background will be notified of their selection by May 15. Applicants can indicate their preference for which convention they would like to attend on the application.
“We are looking for kids who are smart and driven and interested in this topic, who are from both parties and want to go to the convention and experience it,” Mullins said. “I think successful candidates will be familiar with social media, and we will absolutely look for representations from both political parties and from the middle as well.”
Gabriela Barrera (SFS ’19), who identifies as a moderate Democrat, said she is applying to the program to gain knowledge about how the nomination process works.
“I want to leave either convention with a better understanding of how conventions work, from the delegate process, internal political agreements or disagreement within parties and how the voice of independents and third parties candidates will respond to having a position of influence over how both establishment politics and general constituents will begin looking more critically at the two party system,” Barrera said.
Chairwoman of Georgetown Students for Rubio Alexandra Williams (SFS ’19) said she hopes her participation in the program could bolster her voice as a politically engaged millennial.
“Attending this event would help me with my future political ambitions by allowing me to make a name for myself as a millennial who is engaged in the political process and determined to have a voice, by giving me a platform as an ambassador on social media for my peers and millennials around the country,” Williams wrote in an email to The Hoya.

In honor of Earth Day last Friday, several offices and student organizations, including Students of Georgetown, Inc. and the Office of Sustainability launched various environmental initiatives, such as the addition of four solar-powered outdoor chargers throughout campus.
In addition, The Corp also launched the Corp Sustainability Committee and a composting program at The Hilltoss, while the Georgetown University Student Association will host the second Annual Georgetown Day Cup on Saturday, where students compete to collect and dispose of the greatest number of red solo cups and aluminum cans.
The solar chargers were a joint effort with University Information Services, Planning and Facilities Management and the Georgetown Energy and Environmental Network. One of the panels is currently situated at the new bus turnaround near McDonough Arena.
The Coca Cola Company sponsored three of the chargers, while University Information Services sponsored the fourth.
Jessica Lee (SFS ’16), an intern in the Office of Sustainability, said she is hopeful this initiative will help students to become more aware of their individual impacts on the environment.
“It creates a new mindset about energy,” Lee said. “I hope that people will be able to learn from the solar charging stations and apply that new knowledge to other parts of their life as well.”
Formerly known as the Corp Green Team, the CSC aims to evaluate and advance The Corp’s sustainability and environmental awareness concerning the operations of its storefronts and products.
The result of a partnership with the Office of Sustainability, the CSC is headed by Katie Harper (SFS ’17) and will include both members of The Corp and the larger Georgetown community, with applications closing April 28.
According to Chief Operations Officer of The Corp Alex Donovan (SFS ’17), The Corp’s upper management began to explore options for composting last year. Donovan worked closely with
Director of The Hilltoss John Dodderidge (COL ’17) to establish a partnership with EnviRelations, a suitable composting vendor. The monthly composting charge is supplied by The Corp’s own funds.
Donovan said, while she is excited about The Corp’s progress, there is still room for improvement in improving sustainability at Georgetown.
“Georgetown needs to increase its focus on sustainability, and I think the best way to boost that focus is through student-led initiative and projects,” Donovan wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Georgetown will host the 20th annual National Jesuit Student Leadership Conference, an annual meeting of student leaders from the 28 Jesuit universities in the United States, next summer.
The five-day event will last from July 19 to 23, 2017 and will include keynote speeches, breakout sessions and presentations from dozens of Jesuit university students.
The conference is sponsored by the Jesuit Association of Student Personnel Administrators, and has been occurring annually since 1997.
This will be Georgetown’s first time hosting the conference. In 2013, Georgetown students placed a bid to host the 2015 NJSLC, but JASPA chose Canisius College in Buffalo, NY instead.
As the host university in 2017, Georgetown will design an overarching theme and plan out the conference itself, including social programming, catering and housing for the estimated 400 attendees.
Connor Maytnier (COL ’17), Will Simons (COL ’16) and Angela Bai (COL ’17) drafted a forty-page proposal last fall and submitted the plan to JASPA. The hosting proposal included a projected budget, a planned schedule and letters of reference from a number of top university administrators.
After JASPA awarded the bid to Georgetown, three students were selected to co-chair the planning committee: Tashi De Sousa (NHS ’17), Adri Corriveau (SFS ’19) and Maytnier.
This past semester, the three co-chairs accepted applications for other committee members to form the planning committee of 12 students who will begin work this summer.
According to Maytnier, however, the bulk of the organizing and marketing for the conference will happen over the course of the 2016-2017 academic year.
“We’re going to hit the ground running in the fall,” Maytnier said. “It’s a lot of things, big picture: it’s housing, it’s dining, and it’s overall programming for over 400 people. It’s a lot of advanced work so far out.”
According to Maytnier, student leaders at Jesuit universities share challenges with Georgetown student leaders that make an exchange of ideas particularly beneficial.
Maytnier said the NJSLC offers an important opportunity for Georgetown students to learn from their Jesuit peers.
“These are students coming from schools that have the same core values, the same guiding principles,” Maytnier said. “Just the way we see our different offices and departments across campus trying to live out Jesuit values and incorporate that into their mission and what they’re trying to do, the leaders of the other twenty-seven [Jesuit universities] are experiencing that very similarly.”
