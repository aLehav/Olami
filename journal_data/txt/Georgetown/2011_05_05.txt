A forced and an unforced burglary occurred at two residences on the 1300 block of 33rd Street Tuesday morning, according to the Department of Public Safety.
In a Public Safety Alert emailed to the campus community, DPS said that a Georgetown staff member reported the two burglaries at 7:56 p.m. Wednesday night. Both burglaries occurred at approximately 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
In the first incident, the residence was entered through an unlocked door, and three laptops, an MP-3 player and jewelry were taken. In the second burglary a screen was cut, but nothing appeared to have been taken. No victims were harmed in either incident.
A witness saw a potential suspect leaving the second residence. The suspect is described as a black male in his thirties and over six feet tall who was wearing dark blue clothing and carrying a toolbox.
According to Associate Director of DPS Joseph Smith, DPS is dealing with the incidents in a number of ways.
“In addition to being the standard criminal investigation, we’re going to meet with the residents of the apartment block [to] and discuss crime prevention measure and have a dialogue with them and see what we can do to help them with their safety profile,” Smith said.
MPD is handling the ongoing investigation of the crimes.

The GUSA-sponsored Student Life Report 2011 Committee, which will evaluate the reform of advisory boards, university bureaucracy and intellectual life outside the classroom, accepted applications this past week.
The group aims to assess student life on the Hilltop by reviewing the Georgetown Programming Board and the five club funding advisory boards — the Student Activities Commission, the Media Board, the Advisory Board for Club Sports, the Performing Arts Advisory Council and the Center for Social Justice’s Advisory Board for Student Organizations.
The group will collect student input through surveys, interviews and comparative studies with comparable universities.
According to Shuo Yan Tan (SFS ’12), Georgetown University Student Association’s director of funding and administration reform, the comparative studies section of the report will include visits to other schools for context as well as input from members of the advisory boards.
“[Comparative trips] will allow us to draw on best practices by other schools and see if they can work for our campus,” he said.
Tan stressed that including members of other boards on the committee would be beneficial, rather than a conflict of interest.
“Obviously, we don’t want a Media Board representative to be reviewing the Media Board, but we are encouraging board members to apply and review another board and do a comparison review,” he said.
The last student life report, conducted in 1999, attempted to address many of the problems students at Georgetown still face today, according to Tan.
“If you read it, you’ll realize some things haven’t changed very much, which is unfortunate. But a lot of things have really changed,” he said.
The 1999 report focused on funding, student space and bureaucracy. Included in the final document were recommendations for creating a Club Sports advisory board, online classroom requests for student groups holding events and free GPB movies on the weekends. While some of these goals have been realized, many — like recommendations for increased student space and a new student union building — have not.
Student space has recently been a hot topic of debate, spurred by the recent recommendation for the Student Activities Fee Endowment money to be distributed by GUSA for a student space in Healy Hall.
Student space will not be a main focus of the 2011 report however, according to Tan. The committee will use the earlier report created by the Student Space Working Group, which began its efforts in 2008, as a resource instead.
Students hope that the creation of the Student Life Report will help solve some of the perennial issues Georgetown students face. Tyler Anyan (COL’14) was intrigued by the idea of comparative trips.
“I mean, things aren’t perfect here and the allocation of funds isn’t perfect, so it would be nice to see what other universities are doing and try and bring that here,” Anyan said.
He also thought that having students, rather than the administration, lead the investigation would strengthen the committee’s findings.
“It’s by the students for the students. I love that,” he added.

Mailrooms at more than two dozen D.C. public schools received packages filled with a suspicious white powder this afternoon.
According to Pete Piringer, D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services spokesman, a series of schools reported receiving envelopes of an unidentified white substance beginning at 1 p.m. today.
“In all cases we’ve been able to run a battery of tests and have identified no toxic material or anything that represents an immediate safety issue,” he said in a recording on the D.C. Fire and EMS media hotline.
According to the statement, which was recorded at 3:45 p.m., between 12 and 15 schools across the city had reported incidents. A later statement recorded at 7:45 p.m. increased this number to 27. Additionally, a corrections facility in North East D.C. received a package similar to those sent to the public schools.
Two of the schools reporting incidents are in the Georgetown neighborhood: Hardy Middle School and Duke Ellington School. The latter is located on R Street, a few blocks from the Georgetown campus.
The FBI is working to identify the substance and is taking down the names of people who were exposed. No one who was in contact with the material has showed signs of illness, and no students were in danger at any point.
The FBI could not be reached for comment.
