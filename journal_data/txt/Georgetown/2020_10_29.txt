Twenty landlords executed nearly half of all eviction filings in the District of Columbia in 2018, according to a report published by Georgetown University graduate professors.
Professors in the McCourt School of Public Policy found the combined effect of a small number of landlords and low eviction filing fees aggravate housing instability and evictions in the District of Columbia.
The report, titled “Eviction in Washington, DC: Racial and Geographic Disparities in Housing Instability,” was written by Georgetown professors Brian McCabe and Eva Rosen to research and summarize the nuances of D.C.’s housing instability and eviction policies. The project enlisted a team of undergraduate and graduate student research assistants to analyze court records from every eviction filing in the District between 2014 and 2018. 
The report highlighted that 60% of evictions take place east of the Anacostia River in Wards 7 and 8, with an executed eviction rate in Ward 8 that is 13 times higher than in Ward 2, which includes Georgetown. In the report, McCabe and Rosen found a small number of landlords have claimed responsibility for the total number of evictions in the district, with 20 landlords owning 21% of rental units accounting for nearly half of evictions.
“Evictions are concentrated in the hands of a small number of property owners,” the report reads.
One undergraduate research assistant, Mickey Cervino (COL ’21), said the disproportionately large number of evictions in the 7th and 8th Wards shows D.C.’s resources continue to be distributed unevenly, leaving many Black residents in the city unprotected.
“DC is a heavily segregated city and looking at virtually any statistic of social support or well-being it is clear that the Black residents of this city are targeted and left unprotected by our public infrastructure, this report just continues to show that this trend is more pervasive and malicious than we can imagine,” Cervino wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Dalila Cuevas Rodriguez (SFS ’21), another research assistant, said while the report’s findings did not surprise her, its findings provide new evidence of the predatory behavior of certain landlords who take advantage of low filing fees.
“I was responsible for gathering data from court documents, and when inputting data I quickly noticed a pattern,” Rodriguez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In every other court document, the same landlord organizations kept popping up. Our data provided visualization of these patterns, for the purpose of making a strong legal case in the future.”
Despite the high number of court filings, the report found most renters only owed a modest amount of rent and most cases did not result in a formal eviction. When summoned to court, the average tenant owes $1,207, with 12% of households oweing $600 or less. Although 5.5% of eviction filings resulted in a formal eviction, the report states many renters must leave their homes for reasons not captured by court records.
This data demonstrates legislative and judicial systems are partly culpable for these trends because they enable landlords to take advantage of an easy eviction filing process, according to Cervino.
“The report shows just how widespread and weaponized the eviction process truly is for DC’s residents, and that often the end goal isn’t even a full eviction,” Cervino wrote. “The courts are being used to intimidate and put pressure on people who are already struggling to pay bills, and as the report shows, this is disproportionately clustered in Wards 7 and 8 — those wards with the highest proportion of Black residents.”
Professor McCabe said the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have made it more imperative to prevent evictions, and he emphasized the importance of the eviction moratorium currently in place in the city.
“There is currently an eviction moratorium in the District that will be extended into early next year,” McCabe wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Given the ways that eviction filings create housing instability for households already struggling with the pandemic, this eviction moratorium is really important for keeping families housed throughout the crisis.”
When D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) declared a public health emergency in March, as a part of the state of emergency, D.C. instituted a temporary ban on evictions to account for residents experiencing financial instability. Right now, the eviction moratorium will expire 60 days after the state of emergency is set to end Dec. 31, according to U.S. News.
McCabe said the report’s publication led to legislation protecting renters from frivolous evictions, citing a meeting his team held with the D.C. Council about a bill to ban evictions for under $600.
The report “heavily influenced” the bill, according to The Washington Post. Co-sponsored by D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) and Ward 3 Councilmember Mary M. Cheh (D), the legislation temporarily suspended rental evictions, while also urging the Superior Court to raise the filing fees for eviction cases.
“It is the sense of the Council that the Superior Court should raise filing fees for eviction cases to $100 so that serial filers seeking small sums of money from their tenants are deterred from using eviction filings as a mechanism to collect rent from their tenants,” the legislation reads.
McCabe expressed gratitude for the several undergraduates involved with coding and researching to produce the report.
“The report would not have been possible without the work of these students, and the support of the Meyer Foundation and the Provost’s Office in supporting the research opportunities for undergraduates was important,” McCabe wrote.
Rodriguez reciprocated McCabe’s gratitude and said working on the project was a deeply personal experience she hopes will ultimately bring more attention to the painful reality of the eviction crisis.
“The project was very personal for me, since my family and I have faced eviction. No one deserves to be without a home,” Rodriguez wrote. “Being evicted in high school inspired me to want to do more, to help other people facing this issue. Having the honor to work on the report, was definitely life changing. Hopefully, we will make further strides in the future when it comes to housing issues.”

This article and the underlying report are perfect examples of how out of touch universities have become. Would anyone believe this author would ever accept an eviction as necessary?
Housing, and more specifically, rental housing is not now nor will it ever be free. Most renters pay – some cannot or will not. Eviction is unpleasant, especially when the tenant wasn’t living beyond their means, they simply lost their income. If you were arguing or asking that the government (or socialist government) should provide income to all so that renters can meet their contractual obligations to a landlord (either corporate or mom and pop), then that would be one thing – increased government assistance. However you seem to want to blame the property owner as fueled by racism and classism for addressing the inability of a renter to pay. Nowhere do you acknowledge the renter broke their contract, stopped paying and therefore should vacate. You want to curtail eviction, the only mechanism landlords  have to transition a delinquent tenant to a more affordable and sustainable housing solution. Stop using faulty logic and pulling heartstrings to paint capitalism in a bad light. This dishonest presentation of the argument extends beyond the current pandemic crisis and should be called out for what it is- a request for more handouts.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s free college plan could pay for itself within ten years, despite its multi-billion dollar price tag, according to a recent report.
The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce study, titled “The Dollars and Sense of Free College,” analyzed the costs and benefits of three different models of government-funded higher education: the first-dollar model, in which the government pays the entire tuition; the last-dollar model, in which the government completes the tuition after financial aid is applied; and the debt-free model, in which the government covers the entire cost of attendance.
According to the study, Biden’s plan, which falls under the first-dollar model, is expected to cost $49.6 billion in its first year. If passed, the plan commits to covering tuition to a four-year, public university for people with an annual family income under $125,000. The plan also promises to cover a full community college education for all students. 
According to Michael Quinn (GRD ’09), a research analyst at CEW and one of the study’s authors, the cost of Biden’s plan came out much lower than expected, which makes the implementation of the plan more feasible.
“It isn’t cheap, but in the magnitude of other policies that we have gone through as a country, it isn’t so out of the ordinary. The projected cost we have over ten years is roughly in the ballpark of revenue lost from the Trump tax cuts, more or less,” Quinn said in an interview with The Hoya. “I was expecting it to be a lot higher than it was, and it’s much more reasonable.”
Biden’s plan deserves praise for making genuine attempts to promote equity in education, even though it does not go as far as to make the whole college experience free, according to Artem Gulish (GRD ’10), a co-author of the report. 
“Compared to plans that are either last-dollar or first-dollar but without the income cap, it would cover more low-income students, it would cover more Black and Latino students, so from that perspective it would be a more effective plan. It still wouldn’t cover all the costs of attendance — a debt-free college plan would potentially cover all the costs,” Gulish said in an interview with The Hoya. “Biden’s plan falls more on the generous side, but not the most generous possible.”
The move toward more free college options has risen to national prominence in recent years, with many states proposing or implementing plans to expand the affordability of higher education. The report mentions various free college plans have already been implemented in 15 states. Democrats in the House of Representatives proposed including a free community college provision in the Higher Education Act during the law’s reauthorization in 2019. 
To evaluate and project the final costs and revenues from these models, the study made assumptions of changing future behaviors, according to Quinn. They considered the fact that private school might become less attractive if public education were made free. The research also weighed the fact that people who otherwise would not have been able to attend college would take advantage of the new educational opportunities and apply to school en masse.
“So we took all that into account, and that raised the obvious question of, ‘how much would this actually cost?,’ which is always at the top of people’s minds,” Quinn said. 
However, the value of a college education when looking for work will remain relatively constant even if there are more college graduates, according to Gulish.
“The U.S. economy has enough capacity to handle more college graduates,” Gulish said. “College graduates start businesses, they come up with ideas, they help expand businesses, so that creates more jobs. We do not believe in the idea that demand is fixed, that no matter the number of college graduates we have, the demand will be fixed.” 
The report estimated new college graduates who would not have otherwise been able to afford college without the Biden program would end up paying more than double the program’s cost in state and federal taxes by the program’s 10th year. 
“All we are talking about is that more people will get degrees, they will earn more money, and because they will earn more money, they will pay more taxes. And over ten years, that will start bringing in more revenue than the cost of the program,” Gulish said.
A free-college policy could help lower the financial barriers to attending college, but a lack of transparency and information about programs could present obstacles for prospective students.
“There are people who can get financial aid, there are people who can get scholarships, there are people who can get a better deal at a private college, but the main issue is that especially people who are low income don’t know that,” Gulish said. “It’s very confusing, and that often discourages them from going to college. Having a clear message that you can go to a public college for free, that would change their perspective, change the way they think about their future in terms of college.”
As higher education becomes increasingly important for job placement, Gulish wants people to know they have options to pursue postsecondary education, regardless of whether a free college plan comes to fruition.
“People who are first generation, low income students mainly think this is outside their realm of possibilities,” Gulish said. “We as a country need to do a better job of communication that there are postsecondary pathways and options for everybody and that people have opportunities to pursue those.”

The American public should expect election interference from both foreign and domestic actors in the 2020 U.S. presidential election but should not be discouraged from voting, panelists said at a conversation with the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service moderated by Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94).
GU Politics hosted the Oct. 9 event, “Protecting Democracy: A Conversation on Election Integrity with Former DHS Secretaries,” which featured two former Secretaries of Homeland Security: Michael Chertoff, who served under President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2009, and Jeh Johnson, who served under President Barack Obama from 2013 to 2017.
The panelists said although misinformation and voter manipulation online pose a real problem, voters can be confident in the United States’ electoral process and that their votes will count.
Given the structure of the U.S. election process, Johnson said the biggest threats to the integrity of the election could be classified into three main categories: a cyberattack on election infrastructure, the weaponization of stolen cyber information and the spread of disinformation and misinformation.
“A national election result can be altered by upsetting the voting in just a few key precincts in a few key states,” Johnson said. “That is not necessarily a cyber vulnerability; there are things one could do, or have attempted in the past to do, to suppress particular precincts.” 
In 2016, the Russian government hacked into and stole information from the Democratic National Committee. It is believed the Russian government weaponized the stolen information to influence the results of the election. Although this was not the first time a foreign actor hacked a campaign, it was the first time the information was deployed to assert influence over voters. 
Russia is not the only country believed to have meddled in U.S. elections. China and Iran have also been known to involve themselves in some of the same ways Russia did in the 2016 U.S. elections. 
The federal government must be proactive in establishing deterrents against foreign interference in future elections, according to Johnson.
“I believe, at some point, our government will create sufficient deterrents so that foreign governments discontinue the bad behavior and move on to something else,” Johnson said. “Don’t plan for the last attack, plan for the next attack.”
Although foreign interference was a main culprit of election meddling in the 2016 election and will continue to pose a threat, Chertoff warned domestic interference is just as serious this election season.
“Much of the most inflammatory content is domestically generated,” Chertoff said. “All that Russians do is sit back and watch and pick the things they think are the most outrageous.”
Social media has become a gateway for the spread of misinformation and disinformation among the public. Recently, Twitter and Facebook have taken measures to limit their role in the advance of fake news. Twitter decided to make changes to the ability of politicians and others to retweet fake information, and Facebook announced they will not allow any political ads in the week leading up to the presidential election. 
Johnson agreed most distribution of interference in U.S. elections comes from domestic content and said some of the responsibility to keep elections fair is on the shoulders of the American public.
“The public has a role to play here. The public has to accept responsibility for discerning some of the junk they consume and recognizing it as such,” Johnson said. “And if we do that, then we go a long way from insulating ourselves from this type of threat and this type of vulnerability.”
The difficulty that comes with content moderation is discerning where freedom of speech crosses the line into the manipulation of eligible voters. According to Chertoff, social media does not bear all of the responsibility when it comes to regulating misinformation. Other media, including news radio or broadcast television, must moderate their own content too.
“We need to have professionalism restored to mainstream media,” Chertoff said. “The truth is, many people get the most misleading disinformation from turning on their favorite cable news channel.”
The panelists agreed fears about voter fraud are overblown because it would be difficult for fraud to affect a large-scale election. Johnson and Chertoff also said no eligible U.S. citizen should be deterred from voting this election cycle.
“It should not discourage anyone from participating in our democracy,” Johnson said. “I believe that there is a civic obligation among voters, among those eligible to vote, to be smart about their vote, and to pierce through the disinformation out there on social media and be a smart voter.”

The Georgetown University School of Foreign Service named professor Lahra Smith as the new director of the African Studies Program. Smith hopes to bring an environmentalist perspective to the department as well as strengthen ties to the continent amid the pandemic.
Smith has been a fixture of Georgetown’s African Studies department for 14 years and has studied the subject since her undergraduate days at University of New Hampshire, according to the Oct. 1 announcement. She also serves as an associate professor in the government department, a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of International Migration and a faculty fellow for African migration at the Center for Social Justice. 
Smith takes over the directorship from professor Scott Taylor, Georgetown University’s new vice dean of diversity, equity and inclusion. The African Studies director position had been left vacant since Taylor assumed his new role Aug. 15. 
Smith considers the African Studies Program an interdisciplinary field ripe with opportunities for students to explore subjects of interest. 
“I think it’s the jewel of the university, and I also think Africa is such an important continent to study, so it’s such an honor to be part of it,” Smith said in an interview with The Hoya.  “It’s a really youthful continent, and that means that there’s a lot of connections between the things that our students are interested in and young people on the continent.”
Smith’s involvement with the African Studies Program through both her research and teaching qualified her for the directorship, according to SFS Dean Joel Hellman. 
“To some extent, she was a natural choice because she had already been so deeply engaged in the program and beloved by the students who are part of it,” Hellman said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Another of Smith’s goals for the African Studies Program is to bring students to a greater number of African countries once travel restrictions are lifted. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the program typically sent students to Africa on a number of yearly trips, including a spring break trip to Kenya, summer trips to Tanzania and South Africa and a biannual summer research program in Zambia. 
While Smith and her colleagues in the African Studies Program intend to leverage technology to communicate with associates in Africa under the current restrictions, Smith remains focused on organizing opportunities to travel to Africa as soon as possible. 
“Africa, as a continent, has had the lowest COVID-19 rates, and not just for the first couple of months, but continually. We hope that if and when opportunities to travel come up, Africa would actually be at the top of the list of places to travel to. That’s something that, as the director, I’ll be pressing very hard for,” Smith said. 
Smith is also examining the program’s curriculum to expand the lenses and disciplines through which students and professors examine Africa. She particularly hopes to incorporate environmentalist perspectives into African Studies. 
“What I would love to see more is the environment. We can have more course offerings, more programs about this, because this is obviously hugely impacting the continent, and our students are also very engaged in climate change and environmental issues,” Smith said. 
Taylor shared Hellman’s enthusiasm for his successor, noting not only Smith’s credentials but also the new perspective she brings to the program.
“It’s good to bring in fresh thinking, ideas and energy into our institutions, and Prof. Smith brings all of that. She is also an accomplished scholar and teacher of African politics and African affairs more broadly,” Taylor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “She has long been a valued and active member of the African Studies faculty, and I have every confidence she’ll take the program to new heights.”
Hellman agreed with Smith about the importance of the program, and he said the study of Africa is a key component of the SFS’ push for diversity, equity and inclusion.
“The call to action for the SFS is broader than the American story because it is designed to say that we have to understand that international affairs are heavily impacted by racism and inequity and injustice,” Hellman said. “The story of colonialism, of the subjugation of the African continent, the depletion of natural resources: all these things are vital in understanding global affairs, and so Africa plays a very important role.”
The current sociopolitical climate, particularly the rise in anti-racism movements in the United States, means the African Studies Program bears an increased responsibility to pursue racial justice in the realm of academia, according to Smith. 
“We feel people who study African Studies often do and should take up questions of race centrally to their work, regardless of who they are,” Smith said. “For me, thinking of histories of race, racism and colonialism have always been part of how I’ve studied African Studies, but the urgency of the moment, I think, provides us the opportunity to think about those connections even more.”
Taylor said the African Studies Program has long served as an example for other programs in the university in its anti-racism efforts.
“We’ve long included authors of color on our syllabi, as well as presented diverse viewpoints. Moreover, African Studies has one of the most ethnically and racially diverse faculties in any unit in the university,” Taylor said. 
Both Taylor and Smith envision increased collaboration between the African Studies Program and the Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness. The two programs hosted a series on Race and Racism in Africa and the Middle East that began last month in collaboration with the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies.
Smith urged students and groups to contact her to build relationships with organizations across the university. 
“I would love to hear feedback now that I’m in this new position from various student organizations, various constituencies,” Smith said. “If they have ideas of how they see that we can interact with their program or student organization, they’re welcome to just email me, and I would love to meet with them.”

The university has not provided the Academic Resource Center the funding and employees it needs to serve the Georgetown University community as the universitywide hiring freeze enters its eighth month, according to student activists in the disabled community.
The ARC provides general academic support as well as special assistance for student-athletes and disabled students. Accommodations for disabled students include extra time on tests, private exam rooms, visually enlarged materials and, since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, transcripts of online lectures. After Georgetown initially moved online in the spring, many students reported difficulties accessing the accommodations and expressed concerns about whether they would have accommodations for the fall semester. 
Because the university put a hiring freeze in place to guard against expected financial losses, students say a personnel deficit at the ARC has not been filled for the duration of the pandemic. Activists in the student body admit the ARC does what it can with the limited resources provided.
Gwyneth Murphy (SFS ’23) said she struggled to get her accommodations implemented in a timely manner both in the spring and the fall because the ARC could not equip professors with the right tools to make the switch on their own.
“I had three midterms this week. I didn’t get my accommodations figured out until the morning of each exam,” Murphy said. “And this is not because my professors were anti-disability. It is because they were so utterly confused with how to make the transition.” 
With the help of organizations like the Georgetown Disability Alliance and The Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, the ARC has been working with faculty and administrators since March to ensure students are being supported in their accommodations and faculty have the resources to build those accommodations online, according to ARC Executive Director Joseph Fisher.
“To the fullest extent possible, the ARC continues to work with students individually to assess the administration of accomodations in the online environment and to make appropriate adjustments as necessary,” Fisher wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Recognizing the challenges of administering accommodations remotely, the Academic Resource Center, CNDLS and the Georgetown Disability Alliance have created a host of accessibility-related resources to help faculty, and we plan to continue working together on this initiative.”
The ARC should not be faulted for this semester’s shortcomings because they do their best with the limited resources they have, according to GDA Co-Chair of Community, Dominic DeRamo (COL ’23).
“There is an undue burden put on the ARC. I truly sympathize with the pressure they’re under. And the unfortunate reality is that even though the ARC is working every waking minute of the day, accommodation needs are still not being met,” DeRamo said in an interview with The Hoya. 
In February 2020, the ARC Associate Director Amy Mullarkey, retired from Georgetown University. Mullarkey’s position, as well as three other positions, remain vacant, according to the ARC website. 
“Amy’s position was an absolutely crucial position because even three people are not enough to cater to close to a quarter of the undergraduate population that needs accommodations, let alone medical housing and student athletes,” DeRamo said. “We went from an under-resourced position to an even further under-resourced position.”  
DeRamo said that the onus is on the university to give the ARC the resources it needs.
“The only solution that exists because of the Georgetown bureaucracy would be for the ARC to take a more active approach in ensuring that these accommodations are being honored,” he said. “The ARC does not have the time, nor the resources, nor the people to be able to do this.” 
Despite the disabled community’s efforts to fill gaps where the ARC is stretched thin by encouraging the university to educate faculty on equitable education, widespread misunderstanding continues, according to Murphy.
“The professors who are really committed to accessibility have been attending accessibility training and doing research on this for months,” Murphy said. “Then there are professors who do not prioritize accessibility. Accessibility in their classroom is not something they’re familiar with. This is our target audience, but they’re also less likely to attend our webinars and check out our website. It’s unfortunate that we have that gap.”  
Matt Hua (COL ’22) has also struggled with receiving appropriate academic accommodations this semester. Georgetown’s decision to not require waiting rooms on Zoom, specifically during office hours, is especially problematic for students with disabilities, according to Hua.
“If you’re in the middle of talking to a professor about your situation and someone comes onto the Zoom screen, the conversation comes to a halt,” Hua said in an interview with The Hoya. 
As this semester progresses, solving the ARC’s understaffing issue is imperative for student support, according to GDA Advocacy Co-Chair Andrew Bialek (COL ’22).
“Anyone who’s close to disability knows that it’s a very personal experience and very tough subject. Without that personal connection any support is really superficial, at best. We need more staff to be able to help them facilitate this,” Bialek said in an interview with The Hoya. “For an average counselor to have above 400 students is quite impossible. Many students feel like they can’t get to know their counselor. There’s no relationship.”
The lack of support for and within the ARC has been exacerbated by, not caused by, the pandemic, according to Murphy. 
“The ARC is doing its best. Joe Fisher is doing his best. Student advocates are doing their best. The Administration and faculty need to meet us halfway,” Murphy said. “Accessibility is consistently treated as an afterthought. We are incredibly understaffed and we are, at the end of the day, fighting against an administration that doesn’t value disabled students to the extent they should.”

Georgetown University Law Center launched celebrations for its 150th anniversary this month, kicking off a year of celebration of the Law Center’s growth from a small program for a handful of students to a world-renowned school with a stated commitment to justice. 
Only a two-year evening school at the time, the Law Center held its first class Oct. 5, 1870. Its first class comprised 25 students from 13 states, Washington, D.C. and Cuba, and it was the first law school created by a Jesuit university in the United States. Now, 150 years later, roughly 40,000 students have graduated from the Law Center.
The history of the Law Center shapes and informs the school’s educational and administrative philosophies, according to William Treanor, dean of the Law Center.
“Georgetown Law is unique among top law schools in that it opened as an evening school, and that meant that people who worked could go to law school and get a great legal education,” Treanor said in an interview with The Hoya. “So, that commitment to opening doors has really shaped us for 150 years.”
The legacy of the Law Center over the past 150 years is reflected through the school’s motto, “Law is but a means, justice is the end,” according to Paul Ohm, associate dean for academic affairs at the Law Center.
“It’s just this reminder that justice means, you know, how is this affecting the poor or how is this affecting people of color, how is this affecting students who are disadvantaged, students with disabilities,” Ohm said in an interview with The Hoya. “We are constantly reminded to think of things like that in all of our decision making, and I think it’s pretty unusual for a law school, at least based on what I’ve seen, that this is something we talk about so often.”
To commemorate the anniversary of its first classes, the Law Center launched the 150th Anniversary Week Oct. 5, which featured assorted virtual programming and tributes, including a Twitter video featuring commentary by Law Center faculty members, students and others connected to the school, along with a lecture series called “Lawyers as Leaders.”
These “Lawyers as Leaders” lectures, which will continue to take place over the next few months, highlight the achievements of various faculty members of the Law Center who are prominent in their respective fields, according to Treanor. Among those featured so far are public health lawyer Lawrence Gostin, constitutional and criminal lawyer Victoria Nourse and Peter Edelman, who specializes in constitutional law and issues of poverty in law.
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many celebrations and events have been reconfigured to a virtual format. Regardless, the events will still serve as meaningful celebrations of the Law Center’s legacy, according to Treanor.
“We’ve been dealing with the virtual environment, but we’ve been trying to be creative about having programs that are exciting and innovative and that you wouldn’t have anywhere else,” Treanor said. “It’s not the 150th anniversary that we’d anticipated, but it’s still going to be exciting and community building and historic.”
In the future, the Law Center will continue to be at the forefront of legal studies and advocacy, according to Wallace Mylniec (LAW ’70), a professor in clinical legal studies at the Law Center.
“There’ll always be some work for us to do, but that will be the constant at Georgetown. It’s part of our motto, it’s part of our historical legacy through the Jesuit mission and it’s part of what all of our faculty believe in,” Mylniec said in a video posted to the Law Center’s Twitter account. “We believe in contemplation through action. That is the best of what education does, and if we can do that in every decade, maybe we’ll make ourselves irrelevant in the long run and solve all those problems.”

Because the Georgetown University Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service moved its Washington, D.C.-area tutoring services online this semester, student tutors worry tutees’ limited ability to access technology impedes their learning. 
Programming run by the CSJ gives Georgetown students the opportunity to engage with the broader D.C. community. Services range from Jumpstart and D.C. Reads, programs focused on improving child literacy, to the After School Kids Program, a mentorship initiative that works with at-risk students throughout the District. Though the CSJ has continued its programming, internet access has proved a hurdle in connecting with youth. 
The pandemic has highlighted the unequal infrastructure present throughout D.C., especially in Wards 7 and 8, where the CSJ normally provides many of its tutoring services. The District’s rate of positive cases is continuously changing with recent increases, but all D.C. public schools operate via remote learning currently. The District’s virtual learning plan has forced CSJ programs to discover how to keep kids engaged while tutoring over Zoom.
ASK initially entered the virtual world in April, only a few weeks after D.C.-area students were sent home from school. 
ASK’s approach to virtual tutoring, which consists of Zoom tutoring sessions to work on homework and build mentor-mentee connections through breakout rooms, has been consistent since last spring. ASK coordinator Brennan George (SFS ’23) said facilitating consistent youth attendance and engagement has been difficult, however. 
“Our less engaged students often choose not to come to tutoring, and when they do come, they come for only a portion of the session, and they may choose not to show their faces,” George wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Difficulty developing mentor-mentee relationships and encouraging engagement represent two of the many challenges facing the CSJ. According to George, the CSJ is also evaluating the tutees’ access to technology and resources like quiet study spaces and time. 
Madison Barrett (MSB ’22) explained accessibility issues plague many schools that ASK serves because many students do not have access to WiFi or technology in their homes to take classes, let alone participate in outside tutoring.
Barrett called for tutors to be flexible to bridge the digital divide.
“We are able to give tutors a lot more guidance from examples from the past summer and spring which worked and give more resources to our youth so they can connect with us easier,” Barrett wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Working with community partners to tackle accessibility issues has been an essential part of the learning curve for CSJ programs, according to CSJ Deputy Director Raymond Shiu. The CSJ has been working to maintain contact with their connections throughout the District to ensure tutoring programs are able to best respond to the needs of various communities. 
The virtual environment has made collaboration with community partners much more difficult, however, specifically when it comes to recruiting new students to tutor. 
George explained that, normally, the D.C. Department of Human Services and D.C. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services help connect new mentees to the ASK program. 
“My feeling is that we’ve received much fewer referrals from them than we typically do,” George wrote in an email to The Hoya.

In addition to being a student, activist and writer, Anna Landre (SFS ’21) represents Georgetown University as a member of the local governing body, Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E. Landre has served on the commission since February 2019, but she has never been inside of the ANC’s formal office suite at the Jelleff Community Center.
Landre has been a wheelchair user for most of her life due to spinal muscular atrophy type 2, and the Jelleff Center is far from compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act regulations for accessibility, rendering it impossible for her to enter. 
“The symbolism of it, the principle of it — that the ANC has an office in a place that is not physically accessible to someone who is elected commissioner — it’s really disappointing,” Landre said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
The center’s lack of accessibility is one of several reasons Landre and other ANC commissioners are advocating for the Washington D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation to renovate Jelleff. The center, which is the only publicly owned indoor recreation space in the Georgetown or Burleith neighborhoods, has long been a staple of the community, currently used for its pool, gymnasium, and after-school classrooms. It has never been significantly renovated since opening in 1953 across Wisconsin Avenue from Hardy Middle School.
As a result, ANC Commissioner Kishan Putta said students in after-school programs study in a “dark” and “windowless basement,” while visitors to the pool are relegated to “terrible” locker rooms. 
“The showers look like they’re from a prison camp,” Putta said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “The building is unwelcoming, uninviting, in bad shape and very outdated.” 
The fight to modernize Jelleff — both to bring it in line with the ADA and to update its offerings for the community — has been a long one; DPR first allocated $7 million to fund the project in 2018. The process went as far as a search for contractors before DPR dropped the issue, according to Putta.
“They didn’t give a public reason,” Putta said. “But we in the community knew that the project needed more funding.”  
The advocates are now redoubling their efforts, calling for an increase in funds in order to fully revamp the center and bring it in line with the ADA. 
“We’re all aligned: Brooke Pinto, the ANC commission, the community partners and residents. We all want more funding for the project,” Putta said.
However, Landre said not everyone appreciates the urgency of the project or the need for the community space to be renovated as soon as possible.
“Everyone is pretty much in agreement that it has to be renovated, certainly in the community,” Landre said. “The thing is that even though we have that promise [from the DPR], there hasn’t been action.”
According to Landre, that lack of concrete action speaks to a wider problem throughout the Georgetown neighborhood, which she described as having many inaccessible historic buildings and pedestrian routes. 
“I think Georgetown has this problem in a larger sense than just the community center,” Landre said. “Our nature as a historic part of our city has been used as a tool to exclude certain members of the community and as justification for not updating buildings and making them as accessible as possible.”
According to Putta, DPR is already running behind on its first deadline: a feasibility study that was originally scheduled to be completed in December. The study will determine how much funding should be allocated to the project and what specific renovations should be done. The ANC passed a resolution in September  calling for a series of community meetings to generate feedback on what the center needs and urging DPR to at least complete the study by January. 
“The only update is that there is no update yet as the study is not complete,” a DPR spokesperson said in response to an inquiry from The Hoya. The spokesperson maintained that there is “no delay to speak of,” although they confirmed that a contractor had not yet been hired to complete the feasibility study.
More than 400 residents of Georgetown and Burleith filled out a survey taken last year to gather community opinions about plans for the Jelleff renovation. More than 50% said they wanted “yoga, fitness, and other exercise classes and spaces” at the new center. Over 30% supported the inclusion of “basketball and soccer facilities,” while 20% wanted “more general community-related programming ranging from photography to art classes to movie screenings to senior wellness.”
ANC Commissioner Elizabeth Miller said Georgetown University students are one of the community groups she hopes will become active in an updated Jelleff Center. 
“I would love to see a collaboration between the university and aftercare program [at Jelleff] with some tutoring and baking classes,” she said. “Georgetown students are some of the best and the brightest in the country. To put your passions and brains and extracurricular activities that you’re good at and merge that together with what’s happening there after school, it would be wonderful.”
Miller envisions the updated Jelleff Center becoming a “beacon” for the entire community to come together.
“I think that a community center can be a heartbeat,” she said. “And I would like to see Georgetown and Burleith and everything included have a place where we can gather to exercise and meet and socialize and do everything in between.”

Georgetown University McDonough School of Business undergraduate accounting students reap higher starting salaries entering the workforce than accounting students at any other college or university in the United States, according to a study published by a business software research firm.
The study, published by Best Accounting Software Sept. 1, found median earnings for MSB accounting graduates amount to $83,100 per year, $17,800 more than the median at  second-ranked Santa Clara University in California. In addition to median earnings, the rankings also looked at graduation rate, total debt, monthly loan repayments and the comparison between the median earnings and the state or province’s average salary for all graduates.
The program owes its success to the hard work of both students and faculty, according to professor William R. Baber, the Accounting Area coordinator in charge of recruiting faculty to the accounting program and communicating with deans who oversee the different areas of the MSB.
“We have students that have strong people skills, and if we can properly develop the intellectual piece of the accounting curriculum, then they become problem solvers in addition to having the ability to communicate,” Baber said in an interview with The Hoya. “I’d like to see the faculty take credit for all of it, but I think that when you have such wonderful students coming into the program, we work hard not to undo that talent.”
The accounting major at Georgetown predates even the McDonough School of Business. The school’s predecessor, the Division of Business and Public Administration, which was founded in 1936, administered the major first. 
The program aims to give its graduates a diverse skill set to prepare them for a variety of jobs. The wide range of fields graduates enter may contribute to their higher starting salaries, according to Baber.
“We place people not in just traditional accounting jobs; we place about a third of our graduates with financial services, Wall Street jobs, another third go into consulting and the final third go into public accounting, which is the traditional model for accounting jobs,” Baber said.
Double majoring might also augment graduates’ earnings, according to accounting professor Kirsten Anderson. 
“When they double major in accounting and finance, and then they choose the Wall Street role, that’s going to pull up starting salaries a bit,” Anderson said in an interview with The Hoya. “But if you compare us to what I’d call our ‘peer group,’ like Notre Dame for instance has a similar setup and similar type of student generally, they don’t seem to have the same flexibility, and their students don’t seem to have the same opportunities we have.”
An analysis of the study done by Poets & Quants, a media organization that ranks both graduate and undergraduate business schools throughout the world, suggests the rankings may have been biased by geographic location, as wages in certain cities would be higher than other regions with a lower cost of living. 
Most Georgetown accounting graduates find work in New York, followed by Washington, D.C. and then California, according to Anderson. New York, D.C. and California have among the highest costs of living in the United States.
Regardless of the various explanations for the ranking, the accounting faculty places emphasis on career development and exploration beyond what the Cawley Career Education Center offers, according to Anderson. She also serves on a committee that is currently working to update and improve the accounting curriculum.
“Specifically, the things we’re looking at adding are a little more the technical aspect of it, so requiring a tech-based class,” she said. “And then we are always eyeing flexibility, so offering more electives, et cetera.”
The accounting program’s ranking reflects not only current but continued success of students with MSB accounting degrees, according to Baber.
“There is a long tradition of accounting scholarship at Georgetown,” Baber said. “A nontrivial number of our successful alums were accounting majors. That in itself would attract a lot of people to the accounting programs at Georgetown.”

Every year, restaurants and bars in the Georgetown neighborhood gather on a closed-off K Street for Taste of Georgetown, a local food festival and foodie’s paradise that is as tasty as it is packed.
In 2020, however, with the coronavirus pandemic taking a bite out of large gatherings and events left and right, the Georgetown Business Improvement District switched things up and launched a four-week promotional event, Taste and Shop Georgetown, a pandemic-safe alternative to its annual Taste of Georgetown festival.
Running from Oct. 5 to Oct. 31, the event provides Washington, D.C. locals with outdoor dining deals and shopping and service discounts at over 65 restaurants and retailers in Georgetown. 
Planning for Taste and Shop Georgetown began in July with the District Department of Transportation. In conjunction with DDOT, the BID built 25 new streateries — outdoor seating in sidewalks, streets or parking lots — for restaurants within the commercial Georgetown district. Having expanded the outdoor dining options, the BID was able to retain many of the restaurants that had participated in the event in previous years. 
The reformatted event also includes a wider variety of businesses, such as shops and salons, and allows customers to engage with the promotions in a safe manner, according to Lauren Boston, communications director for the BID. 
“It really opens it up to the entire business community, and spreading it out over three weeks also gives everyone a chance to come several times and to not all come on one afternoon, making it a lot more pandemic friendly,” Boston said. 
The event offers promotions at over 35 restaurants in four different categories: Breakfast Club, Happy Hour, Family Matters and Treat Yourself.
As part of the Happy Hour promotion, Martin’s Tavern on Wisconsin Avenue is offering discounts on its oysters, draught beers and a number of specials. Even after having participated in Taste of Georgetown for years, Martin’s Tavern believes this year’s format will draw in more people, according to Chrissy Gardner, the restaurant’s marketing manager. 
“We felt the combination of dining and shopping this year would bring people from the Metro area to spend a day in Georgetown,” Gardner wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
New establishments like Levain Bakery, which opened an M Street location Sept. 16, have also joined the Taste and Shop Georgetown event. The bakery hopes the event will further connect the business with the Georgetown community, according to Pamela Lewy, director of marketing and communications at Levain. 
“We’re brand new to the neighborhood, so when we heard about Taste and Shop Georgetown we knew we’d want to participate,” Lewy wrote in a statement to the Hoya. “What a fantastic way to meet our new neighborhood and connect with the community!” 
Retailers and salons are also presenting store-individualized discounts and deals. Stores include familiar names such as J. Crew, Intermix, South Moon Under, Escape Room Live, United Bank and more. Depending on the store and the services offered, customers can receive a variety  of different promotions. 
Women’s apparel store Veronica Beard on Wisconsin Avenue is offering private in-store events and at-home trunk shows. As a first-time participant in Taste and Shop Georgetown, Veronica Beard is excited for the opportunity to engage more with its clients and do so in a safe way, according to General Manager Erika Stempel. 
“We wanted to be part of the event because it brings the Georgetown community together,” Stempel wrote in a statement to the Hoya. “It allows us to reach clients and inform them of the various safe-shopping options we have to offer.”
Founded in 1993 by Grace Episcopal Church, Taste of Georgetown has provided the D.C. community with restaurant deals and promotions for the past 26 years.
In past years, the ticket sales generated from Taste of Georgetown were donated to Georgetown Ministry Center’s initiative in helping the homeless. Although this year’s event is free, Boston says the BID encourages customers to donate to the center. 
“Georgetown Ministry Center has always done incredibly important work in Georgetown to those who are experiencing homelessness,” Boston wrote. “Although this year’s event has shifted, we still wanted to spread the word and support Georgetown Ministry Center.”

Thanks, Yalda Zarrabi, words are too small for the value you add through your content, This is the best guide I have seen so far on the internet. Local Restaurant and Retail Deals were easy to understand with a comprehensive and easy explanation.

Mediocre description. Next time drop the attitude, and put on a real journalistic lens. Unfortunate that my beloved Georgetown has been invaded by woke leftist mob journalism.
