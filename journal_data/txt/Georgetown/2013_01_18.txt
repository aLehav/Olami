Students of Georgetown, Inc. and the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union selected new boards this week. Board transitions will occur Mar. 1 for both entities.
Lizzy MacGill (COL ’14) was named The Corp’s new president and CEO, having previously served as a barista and director at Uncommon Grounds.
“When I joined The Corp, I just wanted to make new friends. I could not be more fortunate to have this opportunity to give back to an organization that has given so much to me,” MacGill said.
GUASFCU named Chris Kelly (COL ’14) as its new CEO. Kelly has been with the credit union since fall 2010, beginning as a teller his freshman year. He said he was excited about the new position.
“The biggest thing for me is directing a Georgetown tradition,” Kelly said. “I’m really looking forward to giving back to the Georgetown community.”
Joining MacGill on The Corp’s new board are new Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Rashaad Eshack (SFS ’14) and new Chief Financial Officer Matt Oswald (COL ’14), the first officer to ever be selected from Corp Catering.
MacGill expressed excitement for her planned collaboration with her fellow board members.
“I’m ecstatic to work with [Eshack] and [Oswald],” MacGill said. “They’re incredibly bright and dedicated. I think we all bring a variety of experiences to the table. “
She added that she is already planning her goals for the incoming board.
“In the next year, a lot of our energy’s going to go into designing the new service [in the New South Student Center],” MacGill said. “But we’d also like to work on continuing our attempt to engage customers in a more standardized way across operations.”
Outgoing CEO Mike West (COL ’13) said he was confident in the new board’s leadership capabilities.
“We’re very excited to have them,” West said. “It’ll be a big year for The Corp with the expansion of our services into the New South Student Center, and I know that these kids are the people for the job.”
For his part, Kelly is looking to expand GUASFCU’s services from banking to serving as a student resource for financial literacy.
“I’m also looking forward to working with [MacGill] and everyone else at The Corp,” Kelly said.
Joining Kelly on GUASFCU’s new executive board are Chief Operating Officer Brian Sykes (MSB ’14), Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board Margaret Reilly (MSB ’14), Chief Lending Officer Joseph Santos (SFS ’14), Chief Communications Officer Jessica Parry (COL ’14), Chief Information Officer Michael Matuozzi (MSB ’14) and Treasurer John Triebsch (COL ’14).
Outgoing CEO Nikhil Lakhanpal (MSB ’13) was confident in the new board’s abilities.
“I’m really excited for what they have planned and I’m very confident that they will follow through on all their ideas and initiatives,” Lakhanpal said.

Fouzia Saeed, director of Mehergarh, a human rights and democracy institute based in Islamabad, Pakistan, spoke to students about her role in securing pro-women legislation in Pakistan and the challenges facing Pakistani women Tuesday afternoon.
The talk was part of the Walsh School of Foreign Service’s Global Human Development program.
Saeed began by speaking about the considerable diversity of women in Pakistan, noting that although many live and work in rural areas, some have succeeded in politics, business, sports and entertainment.
“We have huge rock stars with huge followings … and we have women who experience acid attacks because they weren’t complying with the patriarchal rules,” Saeed said. “I want to establish that when I talk about Pakistani women, I don’t want you all in the room to think about one blob.”
For Saeed, however, the expanded role of women in Pakistani politics in recent years is an important indicator of growth.
“Every step that we take is a big step for us,” Saeed said.
But though there have been improvements in the lifestyles of many Pakistani women, Saeed said that widespread discrimination toward women continues, largely because of patriarchal culture.
“The issues range from crimes against women like rape, honor killing [and the] exchange of women for conflict [resolution] to discrimination in health, facilities [and] education,” Saeed said. “But most of them are rooted in patriarchal culture.”
As an example, Saeed said that she faced sexual harassment while working for the United Nations. After many years, she filed a complaint against her perpetrator and discovered that 11 of the 16 women in her office also felt harassed in workplace. The women filed a joint complaint, which Saeed said was the first class-action suit against the UN.
“When I took that decision I realized that almost all the women were experiencing exactly the same thing,” Saeed said. “So what I thought was my problem was actually not just my problem, but actually it was that man’s problem.”
After that experience, Saeed turned her efforts toward criminalizing sexual harassment not only for women in the workplace but also for non-working women.
“I realized that we have always been paying attention to these flamboyant issues of acid attack, of wife-beating, and then many people saying that this only happens to two percent of the women,” Saeed said. “[Sexual harassment] is something that everyone in the country has experienced. … It is something that is so invisible and it stops us at every stage.”
One of Saeed’s main goals is to remove the stigma around sexual harassment. She said that many people in Pakistan believe that sexual harassment is usually the woman’s fault.
“We cannot touch the issue unless we deal with the myths,” Saeed said.
Saeed helped form An Alliance Against Sexual Harassment to reduce sexual harassment in Pakistan, where she believes every women suffers from some kind of daily discrimination.
AASHA decided to push for legislation protecting women in the workplace and in public spaces. According to Saeed, it was easy to mobilize people toward the issue, especially women.
To promote the legislation, AASHA organized public debates, held events and enlisted the help of popular Pakistani celebrities. Initially, very few people in AASHA held close ties with the government, so Saeed and her colleagues had to network from scratch.
“We did not come from a class who had aunts or uncles in the parliament. We didn’t know anybody in the beginning, and we didn’t have nice schools like you have here to teach us lobbying and how to do politics,” Saeed said. “All we had was our logical arguments and sheer passion. Once we had our foot inside, there was no stopping.”
Saeed said that AASHA participated in eight years of movements and two years of lobbying before its two bills against harassment in public and private sectors passed in Parliament. Some religious figures in the country lobbied against AASHA, but after tireless efforts, the president of Pakistan signed the bill into law in the presence of 100 women.
“Every step was a very long, drawn process,” Saeed said.
Saeed said that the legislation was the first of many steps toward breaking down the patriarchal structure in Pakistan. She added that nearly all countries adhere to some form of patriarchy. For example, she cited women changing their last names upon marriage as a widespread example.
“There are hardly any countries that have broken the shackles of patriarchy,” Saeed said.
Saeed’s advised that civil- and human-rights activists should work with their governments to bring about change rather than merely criticize the governments for lack of change. Through cooperative effort, she said that groups could achieve their goals.
“Human rights should not become a beating stick in countries because, trust me, that doesn’t help us,” Saeed said.
Saeed inspired and impressed members of her audience.
“To me, what was most impressive is the determination and the willingness to work with this step by step, to stay with it until they got it all the way through legislation,” global human development professor David Sprague said. “That was very impressive because so often these are one-shot campaigns that people take and then they’re over. What they have done is going to last.”

Despite predictions that turnout at Monday’s Presidential Inauguration will be much reduced from the crowds that overtook the nation’s capital in 2009, city officials have announced several modifications to public transport to accommodate hundreds of thousands of visitors.
According to Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority spokesperson Philip Stewart, around 600,000 to 800,000 people will use public transportation, marking a significant decrease from 2009, when 1.1 million people rode the Metro trains and 400,000 took the bus.
“Second inaugurations tend to have lower attendance,” Stewart said.
In order to accommodate the expected increased traffic on Monday, trains will start running at 4 a.m. and remain open until 2 a.m., with rush hour services running from 4 a.m. through 9 p.m.
According to John Lisle, spokesperson for the District of Columbia Department of Transportation, DC Circulator buses will not operate along their normal routes Monday due to security perimeter and vehicle restrictions. Instead, the vehicles will operate as shuttles from the Robert F. Kennedy Stadium to the Inauguration site.
In light of these restrictions, Georgetown students may find that walking and biking are the best, most practical ways to reach the inauguration site, although the city’s bike-sharing infrastructure will also be compromised.
Two new bike corrals will be set up for Capital Bikeshare bikes from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Farragut Square and the USDA building, located at the intersection of 12th Street and Independence Avenue. In addition, DDOT will set up a biking station at 16th and I Streets, which will have racks equipped to accommodate hundreds of bicycles for those who will ride their own.However, all six CapitalBikeshare stations along the parade route have already been removed.
According to The Washington Post, a number of bridges and roads in and around the District will be closed for inaugural proceedings. While the Key and Chain Bridges will remain open as normal, traffic from the 14th Street, Roosevelt and Memorial Bridges, among others, will be diverted, and the latter bridge will be open only to pedestrians and authorized vehicles.
Among other closures, Pennsylvania Avenue NW will be closed from 18th Street NW to the U.S. Capitol, D through I Streets NW will be closed from 12th to 18th Streets NW, and D and E Streets will be closed from 6th to 18th Streets NW.

Before the university terminated its licensing contract with Adidas Jan. 14, the sportswear giant attempted to defuse Georgetown’s concerns about employee severance at the former Indonesian plant PT Kizone, according to a letter obtained by The Hoya.
Following an Oct. 11 recommendation from the Licensing Oversight Committee, a body comprised of students and administrators, that the university cut its ties with Adidas, Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson sent a letter to Adidas representatives Dec. 3 saying that the corporation’s steps to help workers from the Indonesian plant following its closure “[could] not reasonably be considered a serious effort to effectively respond to this situation.”
Gregg Nebel, Adidas’s head of social and environmental affairs for the Americas, and Chris McGuire, director of sports marketing, disputed Smulson’s claims in a letter dated Jan. 3.
“Although the Adidas Group had no business with PT Kizone at the time of its closure — or for months before it closed — the Adidas Group has directly dedicated more towards the former PT Kizone workers than any other brand with our $525,000 in humanitarian aid,” they wrote. “The only difference with our actions is that we have distributed our humanitarian aid in the form of food vouchers and not cash.”
Nebel and McGuire said that while the Supreme Court of Indonesia had approved their manner of compensating workers following the plant’s closure, the distribution of their aid to workers had been prevented to date because of an appeal by the primary creditor, the State Bank of India.
“We remain committed to finding sustainable solutions to the Kizone case and we are confident that we are adhering to and, in fact, exceeding both the spirit and the letter of the codes of conduct our university partners require,” they wrote.
However, Georgetown administrators were not convinced.
“Quite frankly, their letter didn’t satisfy the university,” Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations said. “Within a week, the decision was made and acted upon.”
Fleming pointed to other companies that complied with Indonesian labor laws.
“Nike also had products produced in PT Kizone and Nike stepped forward and made a cash payment that has helped the workers,” he said.
Although the university sent a letter Jan. 14 cutting ties with Adidas, Fleming attributed the delay to school holidays and pointed out that the school ultimately followed through on the LOC’s recommendation.
“The difference between Dec. 15 and Jan. 14 was irrelevant,” he said. “The process of considering things like this in a university is complicated. … The important thing is that the university took a bold position — a clear position — to terminate the agreement.”
University spokesperson Stacy Kerr concurred.
“In these instances, we make sure that we are fully evaluating the matter, which we feel that we did,” she said.
According to Fleming, the LOC is promoting Alta Gracia, a clothing company that pays a living wage to its employees, as an alternative to companies like Adidas. However, the school said it would reconsider Adidas’s contract if the corporation adequately responds to the dispute.
“If you don’t hold out that opportunity, they’ll never change,” Fleming said. “One would think that at some point, an organization that relies on these licensing agreements to be able to sell products that people want to buy might come to the conclusion that they should revisit this issue.”

Italian Ambassador to the United States Claudio Bisogniero spoke about Italy’s foreign policy and its cultural influence on America in Riggs Library Thursday.
According to Bisogniero, Italy’s foreign policy has been rooted in three basic pillars since the end of World War II: support for European integration, partnership with the United States and its trans-Atlantic policies and focus on regions important to Italy’s political and economic interests.
Bisogniero spoke positively of European cooperation’s influence on the continent’s stability.
“The process and idea of European integration goes well beyond the trade, financial or economic issue,”Bisogniero said. “It is more than anything else a political project based upon shared values. It is a dynamic process, which has allowed Europe as a continent … to have a period of about 60 years in peace and stability and providing for economic growth.”
Concerning the European economic crisis, Bisogniero discussed the steps Italy has taken to maintain financial and economic activity.
“On the fiscal side, there has been a significant cut to government expenditures and other important measures,” Bisogniero said. “Last year, Italy’s spending was down to 2.5 percent of GDP. We also have now a balanced budget provision in the Italian constitution.”
Bisogniero added that Italy’s pension system recently incorporated an automatic adjustment mechanism that increases the mandatory retirement age alongside changes in life expectancy without consulting Parliament.
“The pension system has been significantly revised to make it stable and sustainable in the long term,”Bisogniero said.
Bisogniero also talked about trans-Atlantic cooperation between Italy and the United States as a driving force in Italian politics.
“Italy and the U.S. see eye-to-eye on the most important international political issues,” Bisogniero said. “Italian troops operate side-by-side with American troops in the most important international conflict areas from Afghanistan to Kosovo, Libya and in the past, Iraq. We have about 4,000 troops today in Afghanistan, which is the third largest contingent after the French contingent.”
Approximately 50 Italian troops have died in Afghanistan since the conflict began in 2001.
“Italy is not rushing for the exit,” Bisgniero added. “We are committed to the situation in Afghanistan, so our own [withdrawal] of our forces will be conducted closely with the U.S., NATO and ISAF toward the end of 2014. So as you can see, Italy is an active provider of security and we maintain a close collaboration with the United States also in areas such as counterterrorism and intelligence cooperation.”
Rights protection is another joint mission between Italy and the United States.
“We cooperate with the U.S. in other important issues such as the promotion and protection of human rights, the freedom of religion, freedom of expression, the rights of women, the rights of children — these are all issues in which we in Italy are extremely active and which we are very close in working with the United States,” Bisogniero said.
Finally, Bisogniero spoke about the regions of Lithuania, the Middle East and the Balkans, regions that are especially important for Italian geopolitics.
“We are working via the European Union and the Western world to facilitate the exit of [Syrian PresidentBashar] al-Assad from his grip of power, by strengthening the opposition and by also providing humanitarian assistance to refugees that are caught in the Syrian crisis,” Bisogniero said.
Closer to home, Bisogniero said that instability in the Balkans remains a challenge.
“It is for us, next door, an area of concern,” Bisogniero said. “Italy firmly believes that stability in the Western Balkans and former Yugoslavia [will] only be possible when all the countries of that region have entered the Euro-Atlantic architecture and are part of the European Union and of NATO.”
Bisogniero concluded his talk on a positive note, promoting “The Year of Italian Culture in the United States,” a program organized by the Italian Embassy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs under the Italian presidency.
“We want to showcase everything that has to do with Italian culture during this year,” Bisogniero said. “A notion of culture begins with a tradition of artists in Renaissance, Baroque and Classical Italy. But in addition to that, we also want to showcase the Italy of today: what we do in the areas of design, fashion, food, research, technology and innovation because we believe that that also belongs to the wider notion of culture.”
Kate Sugg (COL ’15), who attended the event, said that she plans to see one of the Italian sculptures installed this December.
“I thought that the ‘Italian culture in America’ initiative sounded very interesting, and I’m planning to see the Michelangelo statue in the National Gallery,” Sugg said.
The “David-Apollo” statue by Michelangelo will be on display until early March.

Pinstripes, a chain that combines bowling and fine dining, scored a victory Tuesday when Board of Zoning Adjustment members unanimously approved its bid to open a location in the Shops at Georgetown Park.
The BZA approval came less than two weeks after Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, which oversees the Georgetown area, opposed Pinstripes’ application. The ANC cited the lack of formal agreement between Pinstripes and Georgetown Park Condominiums, which houses tenants in condominiums above the site of the proposed bowling alley, as its reason for the disapproval.
By Tuesday’s meeting, however, Pinstripes had assuaged the concerns of Georgetown Park Condominiums residents and the ANC by agreeing to include terms in the building code requiring Pinstripes to adhere to strict sound requirements.
“One of the conditions is that the place be built so that no sound coming out from the bowling alley or from their events is heard in the residences,” said Martin Sullivan, an attorney for Georgetown Park Condominiums.
Chris Pollock, the sound engineer hired by Pinstripes, told the BZA that his mandate was to make Pinstripes “essentially inaudible” to nearby residents.
In response to Pinstripes’ promises to soundproof its premises, both Georgetown Park Condominiums and ANC2E dropped their objections to the bowling alley. In turn, the BZA approved Pinstripes’ application.
To ensure compliance, the agreement stipulates that an engineer hired by Georgetown Park Condominiums will work with Pollock and review the final construction blueprints.
“They’ll send their plans to our acoustic engineer, and he will confirm that they are doing what they said they would do,” Sullivan said.
If the standards for soundproofing are not met, the District of Columbia’s Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs will not issue Pinstripes a certificate of authenticity.
Although Pinstripes, which already operates four locations in Illinois and Minnesota, has not yet decided precisely how to soundproof the facility, engineers contracted both by the company and the condo association are confident in their ability to successfully block noise.
In addition to soundproofing the facility, Pinstripes also agreed to close the restaurant’s patio at 10 p.m. on weekdays to further limit excessive noise.
According to Sullivan, the clauses about soundproofing in the building code stipulate that after construction is completed, a resident complaint would warrant a DCRA investigation. If the DCRA determines that Pinstripes is no longer in compliance with soundproofing standards, it would have to take remedial action or risk losing its certificate of occupancy.
“If they can’t follow through, they can’t operate,” Sullivan said.

Five of Georgetown’s institutions will collaborate to offer a Master of Science in Global Health starting next fall.
Faculty from the Walsh School of Foreign Service, the School of Nursing and Health Studies, the Georgetown University School of Medicine, the Georgetown Law Center and the Georgetown Public Policy Institute will teach courses for the program. Bernhard Liese, chair of the department of international health in the NHS, will direct the program.
Graduate students in the program will be able to choose from five concentrations: disease prevention and control; health policy and financing; health and development in Africa; demography and reproductive health; and trade and health. The new degree is designed to be completed in a full-time, three-semester program with 17 credits in global health core classes, nine concentration-specific credits, 10 field-research modules and scholarly project credits.
The relatively short program will allow both postgraduates and professionals returning to school to take advantage of the program.
“The possibility of completing the three-semester degree, if necessary using the summer, in one calendar year is very attractive,” Liese wrote on the university website Jan. 8.
The program, which will be run through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, emphasizes research and application as its learning objectives.
According to Liese, the details of the program will be finalized in the next few months as initial faculty meetings and the advisory committee meeting take place.
The program is now accepting applications for next fall.

The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority has proposed suspending multimillion-dollar construction on its tunnel systems project while it explores the implementation of more environmentally friendly options.
The original project proposal, announced in 2003, called for the construction of three large tunnels to prevent sewage overflow during heavy rainstorms. This overflow has been responsible for a large amount of the pollution in theAnacostia and Potomac Rivers and Rock Creek.
In light of recent developments in green technology, however, D.C. Water is now proposing that progress be halted on the Potomac and Rock Creek tunnels in favor of exploring environmentally conscious alternatives, which may include tree planting, bioretention facilities, rain gardens, green roofs and infiltration basins.
D.C. Water has requested an eight-year study of green infrastructure so the body can evaluate its options. The authority believes that new technologies could potentially provide a more sustainable method of cleanup than the tunnel system.
“What we are proposing is a large-scale demonstration project, doing monitoring to determine the efficacy of [green infrastructure],” said Pamela Mooring, external communications manager for D.C. Water. “At the end of that analysis, we will make a recommendation to the Environmental Protection Agency to do [an] all-green, all-tunnel or some hybrid program.”
D.C. Water’s green initiative envisions both public infrastructure as well as an incentive program to incorporate green infrastructure on private property. John Cassidy, a D.C. Water project manager, is confident that these new proposals will receive positive feedback from the community.
“[Residents] like the idea of greening the city and the fact that it could increase property values as well as improve the aesthetics of the city,” Cassidy said.
Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Jeffrey Jones expressed his enthusiasm for the proposals.
“I’m glad that [D.C Water] is doing this. Anything we can do to improve the environment the better,” Jones said.
Some environmental groups, however, are upset with the potential delay of the 20-year tunnel project. The Rock Creek and Potomac segments are currently scheduled for completion in the next two or three years.
“Right off the bat we have a concern with the timing,” said Jennifer Chavez, an associate attorney withEarthjustice, a D.C.-based, non-profit, public-interest, environmental law firm. “The consent decree that was entered in 2003 allows D.C. Water to incorporate green infrastructure and modify the size of the tunnels based on that. They could have been testing back in 2003. Now they are two years away from their facility deadline and lo and behold they want to do what the decree already provided for them to do.”
Earthjustice is primarily concerned with the adverse health impact of the sewage runoff in rivers that are frequently used by kayakers, rowers and the occasional swimmer.
“We would support D.C. Water building green infrastructure into their facility plan to close the gap, but they need to stay on schedule and get back on track,” Chavez said.  “The tunnels are the most certain method [of reducing runoff pollution] … Everybody would prefer green infrastructure, but our first priority is the river. Overarching environmental concerns have to take a backseat.”

Robert Costanza, a leading ecological economist, spoke to students about the intersection of ecological and economic policy Wednesday.
Costanza, a professor of public policy at the Crawford School of Economics and Government at the Australian National University, began by speaking about the correlation between human development and the environment.
“What we’re doing to the climate is moving it out of the regime of where we were for the rest of the history of the human race,” Costanza said.
Costanza said that the climate has changed rapidly within the last century, in areas such as biodiversity, the ozone layer and the amount of available resources.
“Often, [natural systems] get to points where they change quite rapidly … [and] the world we live in is a complex, non-linear, adaptive system,” Costanza said. “We do live on a finite planet. Because of these potential tipping points, we can start to identify what is the safe operating space.”
Costanza offered practical solutions, including a focus on well-being over gross domestic product, a fair distribution of wealth and a legal system based on common property rights rather than individual property rights.
Costanza was also critical of the methodologies the environmental movement currently uses, saying that environmental activists need to shift their focus from looming global crises to building a better world.
“It’s going to require breaking our addiction to this ‘growth at all costs’ paradigm,” Costanza said. “It’s going to be a longer-term process, perhaps, than we might hope for.”
Student reactions to the presentation were mixed.
“Overall, I thought it was very good,” Teresa Geruson (COL ’15) said. “One thing that rang true was the idea that people with a positive vision of the future are more likely to achieve that, and when people are told that something they’re doing is wrong, they’re more likely to keep doing that. At the same time, I also feel like he didn’t offer very concrete solutions.”

Students of Georgetown, Inc., launched Corp Capital, an internal investment fund of more than $50,000, last semester.
The fund was established with a focus on education. Corp Capital will provide Corp employees with the opportunity to learn more about finance and offer a program in which the members of the student-run business can educate D.C. school students about finance.
“Overall, the purpose is to educate within The Corp, but also be different from other funds by having a service component,” Chief Financial Officer Vidur Khatri (MSB ’14) said.
Corp Capital’s Managing Director Pete D’Amato (MSB ’13) said the fund includes approximately 20 members from all years, schools and branches of The Corp.
“Most of them have zero background in finance or investing,” he said. “With The Corp you get a lot of different personalities.”
D’Amato decided to help start Corp Capital partly because of his previous experience as CEO and president of the Georgetown University Student Investment Fund.
“I saw what GUSIF did for me and I really appreciated that opportunity,” D’Amato said.
After graduation alumni of The Corp more often find work in consulting than in finance, something D’Amato hopes will change with Corp Capital.
“I sort of wished The Corp had the same ties to finance as it did to consulting,” D’Amato said.
“We’re an educational nonprofit  —  the goal we have is educating students in a specific area,” Khatri said.
Khatri said he hoped to expand The Corp members’ overall knowledge of finance and to help them contextualize their work in The Corp as a whole. Unlike GUSIF and other student investment funds, Corp Capital’s analysts look at stocks across all sectors, not just in one particular industry.
As part of The Corp’s mission of service, Corp Capital’s board has also provided financial literacy lessons to students in D.C. schools that participate in the Knowledge Is Power Program, a group of charter schools that formed an admissions partnership with Georgetown last fall.
According to D’Amato, it was rewarding for the board to teach a group of students interested in finance and investing who otherwise might not have had a chance to learn about those topics.
“To have someone leave that presentation realizing that it’s something available to them, I think we really hit our goal there,” D’Amato said.
Khatri said he enjoys the chance to give back to the community.
“It’s pretty cool to have that service component,” Khatri said.
The board expects that Corp Capital will continue to be successful, both financially and educationally.
“I hope that in 10 years — wherever I am on Wall Street — I’ll be recruiting at Georgetown and I’ll be able to pull some guys from Corp Capital,” said D’Amato, who will be working at Credit Suisse next year.
“We’ve realized that a lot of the people who started this are going to be gone next year,” D’Amato said. “But I think we’ve set the pieces in place so that this will be a sustainable part of The Corp.”

The third phase of renovations to Dahlgren Chapel, scheduled to be completed this summer, will shift inside to focus on the worship space’s interior.
Geier Brown Renfrow Architects, LLC, the firm leading the interior renovation, presented the latest phase to students, faculty and alumni in the chapel Thursday. Major changes include moving the organ to the front of the church and increasing the total seating capacity from 270 to 325. The aesthetic of Dahlgren Chapel is not expected to change significantly, though lighting improvements, painting and sound updates are intended to enhance the worship experience.
Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., said that design plans also include adding new chairs. The chapel will be distinguishable from a church because of the wooden chairs with kneelers attached to the row in front of them, as opposed to pews, according to O’Brien.
“To maintain the appearance of the chapel we made the decision to keep chairs,” he said.
Other changes to the interior will include the relocation of the baptismal font to the entrance and the addition of Stations of the Cross to the sides of the chapel. Students in attendance noted that a credence table was still needed. Some suggested changes, such as the addition of a confessional, were not included.
The renovation is scheduled to be completed over the summer so that students can use the space for the remainder of the semester. During the summer renovations, mass will be held at an alternate location on campus.
Phases one and two of the renovation process included fixing the foundation of the building and cleaning the stained glass windows. An opaque protective glass formerly covered the windows. The renovations replaced the opaque glass with a transparent protective glass that allows light to filter in through the colorful windows.
Overall, the Francis (F ’77) and Kathleen Rooney (C ’75) Foundation’s $6 million gift carried the project through its subterranean stages. Phase three will cost approximately $2.5 to $3 million, including $1 million for moving and renovating the organ. So far, the project has stayed on schedule, according to O’Brien.
Kevin Sullivan (COL ’14), who attended the open meeting Thursday, is happy to see that a variety of factors affecting students, faculty and staff have been taken into consideration through the renovation process.
“It’s the central space on campus so seeing seating increased is good.” he said.
When the third phase of the renovation is completed, the only remaining step will be to finalize designaesthetics.

Access to the university’s Zipcar program has been extended to drivers between the ages of 18 and 20 after initially only being offered to those 21 and over.
More than 1,000 people have rented vehicles through the car-sharing program since its introduction to the Georgetown campus this fall, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr.
In anticipation of heightened demand from the relaxed age restriction, three cars were added to Georgetown’s fleet, bringing the total to eight on-campus vehicles. The new cars are located under the Leavey Center walkway, while the five original vehicles are stationed outside McDonough Arena. The Zipcar website also indicates that a vehicle is stationed at 3237 N St., and at the CVS at the corner of Wisconsin and O Streets.
According to Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), GUSAand Auxiliary Services had been in discussions from the beginning of last semester to allow younger students to drive Zipcars, citing the urgency of providing alternative transport methods to students in order to alleviate parking strain.
“It’s one of the things that was important to us after the campus plan agreement last summer was in; making sure the student transportation issue was taken really seriously because it affects students, but it also affects the entire campus community,” Gustafson said. “At the beginning of the fall when this program started, it was great that it was starting, but since it was 21-plus, it excluded a large part of the student body, so making sure it was a solution not just for part of the community but the whole community was very important.”
University officials said that although insurance liability issues prevented the age from being lowered last semester, the school moved forward to promote the program for younger drivers.
“We worked in a comprehensive way with GUSA and Zipcar to work as quickly as possible,” Kerr said. “We’re thrilled that this is an option we can give students. … This supports the goals of the city to alleviate parking issues in a dense and urban area.”
D.C. Zipcar’s General Manager Scott Hall was glad to be able to serve students under 21.
“Zipcar is very excited to have the opportunity to expand its presence on campus with the ability to offer membership to students ages 18 [to] 21,” Hall wrote in an email. “We look forward to providing a cost-effective, environmentally-sustainable solution to get around Washington, D.C., for the majority of Georgetown’s student body.”

Georgetown’s Board of Regents will match each percent of student participation in the Class of 2013 Fund with a gift of $1,000, the board announced Wednesday.
This announcement comes after the senior class hit 500 gifts in November, the earliest in the year a class has ever reached that milestone. These gifts marked a class participation rate of 30 percent.
This year’s match comes in lieu of an initially anonymous $1 million gift from graduate parents James (B ’80) and Elizabeth (NHS ’80) Eisensteinlast year that made the Class of 2012 Fund the most successful ever.
Class of 2013 Fund co-chairs Jessica Douglass (MSB ’13) and Christina Dupre (SFS ’13) see the contribution as a commitment to philanthropy.
“We have a lot more parents that were involved in [the decision]… and the way they look at giving is a lot more of actually giving as opposed to how much they give,” Dupre said.
Douglass, who became involved in Georgetown-related philanthropy through the 1634 Society, agreed.
“It’s just getting in that spirit and tradition of giving back,” Douglass said. “The message that we and [the Office of Advancement] and rest of the school are trying to say is that anyone can make a difference.”
In an email to Douglass, the Board of Regents shared their enthusiasm for the progress thus far.
“The Regents believe strongly in the importance of your efforts in creating a class of young philanthropists who are already making a priority to give back to Georgetown. Every one of your gifts matters and we hope that this match will help boost your fundraising efforts,” the email read.
Dupre is confident that the Class of 2013 can continue the upward trend and surpass the Class of 2012’s participation rate of 70 percent.
“Seeing the success of last year has been helpful in learning what works well and what we can improve on,” said Dupre. “Our goal this year is 85 percent participation, and if we reach 85 percent [the Regents] will donate $85,000.”
The class fund will support the Campaign for Georgetown and its 1789 Scholarship Imperative, which funds 1,789 undergraduate scholarships. Nonetheless, bothco-chairs encouraged members of the senior class to make contributions to specific Georgetown programs and services based on their individual passions.
“What we’re trying to make people understand is that you’re not just arbitrarily giving your money to Georgetown. If you have something that has really been a big part of your experience here, you can donate to that,” said Dupre.
Upcoming events will include a wine and cheese tasting, school-oriented speakers and event nights and a challenge to raise 224 new gifts by Georgetown’s 224th birthday Jan. 21.
Douglass stressed that participation in these events is imperative to the class fund’s overall success.
“It’s a lot, but we’re hoping that people will step up to the plate. That would be really amazing and that would bring us up close to 45 percent,” she said.

European immigration experts Olga Gulina, Sarah Perret and Olivier Vonk led a panel discussion on immigration policy and reform in Europe and the United States Wednesday afternoon.
The talk, co-sponsored by the BMW Center for German and European Studies and the Institute for the Study of International Migration, covered policies in France, Russia, Germany and the United States.
“I think having a comparative perspective on immigration is always valuable, particularly for those of us in the United States who will be moving into a very intensive round of new debate on immigration reform,” ISIM Director Susan Martin said.
Vonk, an ISIM visiting fellow, began the discussion by introducing the European Union Democracy Observatory Data Centre, a database that compares immigration standards and procedures in countries around Europe.
“We provide country profiles on 47 countries in Europe, in which we also include country reports where we discuss the historical and political backgrounds of nationality laws in Europe from the 20thcentury up to the present,” Vonk said.
EUDO is a work in progress and hopes to expand to the United States, Caribbean countries and other countries around the world, possibly enlisting Georgetown’s help to do so, Vonk added.
Perret, a BMW Center visiting fellow, then spoke on immigration reform in France, Germany and the United States, focusing on naturalization and securitization.
“For me, naturalization is the transition from ‘them’ to ‘us’ and the final step of an immigrant’s journey,” Perret said. “This process goes both ways as it [involves] the will of an individual to belong to a community but also the community accepting this individual.”
Perret said that the United States began to fear immigrants after 9/11, viewing them as a possible threat. Perret added that President Obama’s recent immigration efforts would decrease thesecuritization of the American immigration process.
Gulina, a visiting fellow at the Kennan Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, contrasted the immigration policies of Germany, Russia and the United States. Gulinadeemed the United States’ immigration policy the clearest of the three countries’.
Attendees appreciated the scholars’ views on international immigration and recognized immigration as a multi-faceted topic.
“I thought the talk was very interesting, and these are extraordinarily complex issues,” Mike Gelner, who worked in the Foreign Service in China for many years, said. “Different countries have different things that they ask of their citizens … there’s really a lot to immigration. After all, millions of people are moving around the world.”

The Georgetown University Student Association will launch a new website by the end of January, regaining an official online presence after three months without a website.
The site, gusa.georgetown.edu, which will be hosted on a WordPress server, will offer students a more integrated and easy-to-use domain than the former site, which was powered by content-management system Drupal. The change to a georgetown.edu URL will also be more cost effective and student friendly, according to GUSA Executive Director of Technology Strategy and IT WellesRobinson (COL ’14).
“We switched to WordPress because our previous content-management system was difficult for most people to understand and use and it was expensive to have someone else maintain and host the website,” Robinson said.
Throughout its time without an official website, GUSA continued to have an active online presence through Facebook, Twitter and email. Nevertheless, GUSA Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS’13) hopes that students will view the website as a one-stop shop for helpful resources and answers to questions about GUSA.
“The new website would be able to get across all that GUSA does,” Kohnert-Yount said. “There will be a resources section of the website, which will have everything from diversity to athletics to Campus Ministry.”
The GUSA Senate will also have its own section on the website, providing students with quicker access to public meeting notes.
“I’m really excited about the potential of putting Senate documents right on the website,” GUSASenate Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said. “It will make it easier for the student body to access our minutes and bills, which is crucial to furthering transparency and accountability.”
Kohnert-Yount worked with a team of GUSA members for several months and surveyed them about their opinions on the website’s design.
“We’re waiting on a few things — a lot of people are contributing to it — so it’s all a matter of populating the website and altering the template a little bit,” Kohnert-Yount said.
A preview of the upcoming website shows a user-friendly template with several drop-down menus across the top where students can click to learn more about the history of GUSA, the GUSA Senate, on-campus resources and more.
Each page also features a feedback section, which will facilitate interaction between the student body and GUSA.
“It will be a great way for us to solicit feedback from others,” Kohnert-Yount said. “We have a feedback form right there that people can use to offer comments or ideas.”
The greater focus on integration is a legacy that Kohnert-Yount said was central to her campaign platform with GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13).
“One of the big questions people have is ‘What does GUSA do?’” Kohnert-Yount said. “I think the thing I’m most proud of that Clara and I have done is to reach out and communicate that, so that each student has at least one answer to that question.”
Tisaagreed that greater transparency between GUSA and the student body is crucial and said that the website will be the best way to reach that goal.
“The website will be easier to update and keep current, so future executives and the Senate can really utilize it as a tool … [for] outreach and transparency,” Tisa said.

In January 1981, Kathleen DePippo (NHS ’84) found her way into one of President Reagan’s inaugural balls as an unassuming Georgetown freshman.
“One of my friends was a freelance reporter for The Washington Post, so she had two press passes, and there were eight of us so we just kept passing them back and forth until we all got in,” DePippo said.
 
A Tradition for Every Georgetown Generation
Experiences like these highlight what makes Georgetown so special come inauguration time: with its politically active culture and location just a few miles from the National Mall, Georgetown allows its students to better appreciate both the glamor and historical significance of a tradition that every undergraduate gets to experience once in his four years on the Hilltop.
True to tradition, hundreds of thousands of Americans will congregate in front of the Capitol building to witness President Obama’s second inauguration Jan. 21. While most students will not be able to bypass security nowadays with recycled press passes, many will wait outside in the cold for hours just to catch a glimpse of the president taking his oath of office.
Kevin Leahy (COL ’12) was part of a large group that trekked to the National Mall at 2 a.m. to witness Obama’s first inauguration in 2009.
“There was just a universal fervor about the inauguration, especially after the mandate of the election. There were Democrats and Republicans alike who came out, even if they didn’t vote for Obama,” Leahy said. “The idea of hope and change, even if people didn’t vote for him, still really brewed in everyone.”
Some of Leahy’s group turned back before the ceremony, while others who braved the cold later suffered from hypothermia after hours outside.
The College Democrats are leading a similar charge to the inauguration this year, and plan to leave campus at 3:30 a.m. Monday.
“Some people didn’t get tickets, and we didn’t want to exclude anyone, so we’re going down together so they can still be included and be around friends,” College Democrats President Trevor Tezel (SFS’15) said.
Many students were able to obtain tickets through the Democratic National Committee or their representatives in Congress, who are allotted a limited number of tickets from the inauguration committee and can distribute them to constituents through a lottery system or other methods.
Students who live in solid red states or congressional districts often had an easier time getting tickets than students who hail from areas that supported Obama in the general election.
Chad Carson (SFS ’14), who interned for Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) last spring, emailed the senator’s office to inquire about tickets last week. The office still had tickets available, which Carson was able to secure.
“Not many people from Missouri want to make the effort to come out here. It could be influenced by the fact that Missouri is Republican,” Carson said. “It is weird that I was able to score tickets somehow a week before the inauguration.”
Christina Wing (MSB ’16), who is from New York, was able to get tickets through personal contacts in her representative’s office, which used a lottery system that also allowed for comments.
“I was able to put that I was a Georgetown student,” Wing said, “and so already in D.C. Even though it was a lottery system, they were still aware of people’s situations.”
 
A Nonpartisan Political Event
The inauguration does, however, have the effect of appealing across party lines, with both Republicans and Democrats turning out in large numbers.
College Republicans Chair Alex Cave (COL ’15) explained that even though he does not agree with Obama on certain issues, he sees the inauguration as separate from the political debate that dominates on other days of the year.
“I think that there’s a difference between the election and inauguration,” Cave said. “Elections are about political persuasion, but the inauguration is about the fact that [Obama] was elected by a majority of Americans in the popular vote and the Electoral College [and] we need to respect that. We should celebrate that our democracy works and changes power consistently every four years.”
College Republicans Treasurer Victor Tolomeo (COL ’14) agreed.
“I have a friend who works for the Obama campaign who had extra tickets, so he is dragging me along for the ride,” Tolomeo said. “Obviously I did support Governor Romney, but at the same time, you give respect to the office of the president and its history.”
Some students, however, said they would prefer to stay on campus to watch the televised inauguration.
Jack Harrington (MSB ’16) said he is unsure if he would make the effort to attend if he didn’t have a ticket. “You wouldn’t even be able to see if you are back by the Lincoln Memorial, and I just don’t know if it’s really worth it,” he said.
 
A Campus Abuzz
Despite similar reservations about the cold, crowds and limited visibility, Georgetown administrators expect that campus dorms will welcome hundreds of student visitors this weekend.
Housing Services sent a campus-wide email Dec. 6 stating that students are required to register any guests before Jan. 17, adding that each student can host a maximum of two guests for the period between 8 a.m. Jan. 18 and 8 a.m. Jan. 22. Student Housing also forbids students from subleasing their apartments to visitors and warned that guests to campus may be asked to produce formal identification by campus police.
“It obviously is reflective of an increased number of visitors to the district,” University Spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said. “It’s a precautionary measure to make sure university services remain accessible.”
Ethan Chess (COL ’14) and his roommates will play host to four guests during the inauguration, doubling the occupancy of his apartment to eight.
“I think this is going to be a great chance to showcase Georgetown to all my friends,” Chess said. “We have a street apartment so we won’t need to worry about IDs or anything like that.”
According to Department of Public Safety Chief JayGruber, the university will not have increased security on Inauguration Day, although all DPS officers will be on duty despite Monday’s status as an official university and national holiday.
“Crowds will be smaller, and the inaugural activities will not come close to campus,” Gruber said.
 
A Full Day of Festivities
In addition to attending the inauguration ceremony and celebrating the event on campus, some students are participating in the dozens of inaugural balls and parties across the District.
Anna Hernick (SFS ’16), who is attending an official inaugural ball, said that she is looking forward to the experience.
“Attending an event like this is an amazing and rare opportunity,” Hernick said. “Like most Georgetown students, I love political events and any excuse to dress up, so attending an inaugural ball is basically a dream come true. I’m also really hoping to catch a glimpse of the president and first lady.”
Others are volunteering for inauguration-related events, such as the Millennium Trains Project’s inauguration ball.
MTP is holding events through the weekend leading up to the inauguration, which Phil Wong (SFS’15), who volunteers for the non-governmental organization, said was a way of filling a void left by this year’s Presidential Inaugural Committee.
“Last time, Obama held a youth ball for supporters,” Wong said. “That is not the case this time around, so MTP is filling that niche and addressing that audience.”
DePippo said that her experience at the 1981 Inaugural Ball underscores one way in which government has changed in the three decades since.
“It made you realize how accessible the U.S. was back then — that a group of college girls could actually be part of the inaugural events,” DePippo said.
Many alumni look back fondly on their memories of inauguration, but James Lynch (C ’51) missed out on attending Harry Truman’s inauguration in 1949.
“Stupidly, I stayed home to study for my civics exam the next day,” Lynch said. “It was a wonderful opportunity to go to Inauguration Day, and I stayed home to study and I’ve never forgiven myself.”
Current students are determined not to miss out on this year’s inauguration.
“Years from now … I want to tell my kids with a lot of pride that I was there when the first black president was sworn in if not for the first time, for the second time,” Tezel said.

The university’s external review of conduct policies and practices, which was completed in December, focused on reducing bureaucracy, simplifying the Code of Student Conduct and improving communication among students, faculty and staff.
Robert Kelly, vice president for student development at Loyola University Chicago, and Stephen Bryan, associate dean of students and director of student conduct at Duke University, conducted the review.
Kelly and Bryan evaluated Georgetown’s conduct policies, taking into consideration its space and staff limitations as well as its Jesuit mission. Before reviewing the code, Kelly and Bryan heard testimonials from students chosen by the Georgetown University Student Association.
“I feel like they listened to the testimonials and that was reflected in the final report,” GUSA Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) said.
Recommendations for reducing bureaucracy included centralizing functions of the disciplinary system, which currently includes the Honor Council, Residential Judicial Council, Disciplinary Review Committee and Weekend Review Council, among other bodies. The results of the review suggested that this could reduce the time it takes to resolve disciplinary matters and increase transparency in the disciplinary process.
Kelly and Bryan highlighted the role of the Student Advocacy Office in disciplinary procedures and recommended that their student advocates work directly with the Office of Student Conduct.
“We didn’t even exist a year ago, so the fact that we’re in this document is great for our legitimacy,” SAO advocate Constantine Petallides (SFS ’13) said. “We’re working to prove we’re not just some rabble-rousers, and [we’re] finding ways to be institutionalized. This is part of the process.”
The reviewers also suggested simplifying policy definitions in the Code of Student Conduct and creating a mediation system to help resolve disciplinary cases.
To improve communication among students, faculty and staff, Kelly and Bryan suggested that the university change the language used in parts of the Code of Student Conduct, improve its layout and accessibility online, provide yearly updates of policy changes to students and introduce the policy to freshmen during New Student Orientation.
Kohnert-Yount agreed that students need to be made more aware of the role of the Office of Student Conduct and the complexities of the code.
“Until you interact with the code, whether as a victim or violator, most people don’t know the office exists,” she said. “We’re never educated until we have to learn.”
NSO Coordinator Dan Silkman (COL ’15) said that NSO could play an important role in informing new students about the code, both by educating Orientation Advisors about the code and introducing it to new students in the discussions that surround the Pluralism in Action program. According to Silkman, any changes to NSO programming would be finalized in June.
Kelly and Bryan also suggested changes to the code itself that would make it clearer to students.
Their suggestions included eliminating bureaucratic names for forms and documents and simplifying guidelines for board hearings. The reviewers also recommended eliminating the Category A, B and C violation system in favor of a system with standalone policies for different violations.
Georgetown currently keeps disciplinary records for only one day after a student graduates, and the reviewers suggested keeping online records for a longer period of time.
Kelly and Bryan also suggested elaborating on Georgetown’s speech and expression policy and providing examples of what the university would consider a violation of the policy.
Some students had hoped that the university’s external review would encourage revision — not just clarification — of the free speech policy, which currently restricts free speech outside of the designated zone in Red Square.
“When I heard free speech was in [the review,] I was excited, and then I read it and I was disappointed because it didn’t really say anything,” said Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), who speaker of theGUSA senate and a member of the GUSA Free Speech Board.
The final recommendation was to increase support for alleged assault victims, which Kohnert-Yountconsidered a significant step, and cited a personal experience with assault.
“My experience was tough at best and very traumatic. I think a key recommendation was providing more support to alleged victims and possibly [extending this to] alleged violators,” she said. “They very much listened to the perspective of students and made clear recommendations to improve the experience of students going through the process.”
According to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, the Office of Student Conduct will work with the Disciplinary Review Committee to discuss these recommendations this semester and will implement any changes in the fall.

Though the Golden Globes have traditionally been known as the less important cousin in the film awards family, always second to the Oscars, they still set a precedent for the awards season. On the TV front, they are somewhat awkwardly placed four months after the Emmys, evaluating a season’s worth of television far in the back of viewers’ minds.  They are also notoriously just a little off, always snubbing what seem like obvious choices and including strange outliers. Most notably, however, this year’s Best Television Series — Comedy or Musical nominations seem particularly error filled.
First of all, since the category is supposedly for both comedies and musicals, it appears to be obligatory to fill at least one of the spots with a music-filled program, regardless of its quality. Though a loyal viewer of NBC’s “Smash” last season, even I cannot deny that it was incredibly inconsistent and often frustratingly committed to keeping its characters flat and its plots outlandish. Yes, the cast is incredibly talented, but no amount of amazing pitch or great comedic timing could outweigh the show’s serious structural issues. For this reason, it seems particularly unworthy of a nomination.
“The Big Bang Theory” and “Modern Family,” though both certainly funny at times, are committed to their respective formulas, regardless of kinks that need working out. Though “Modern Family” took the big prize at the Emmys in September, it interestingly did not at the Golden Globes on Sunday night. While its inclusion in the nomination list to begin with was a snub to other higher-quality shows, perhaps its loss signals the beginning of the end of its reign as the most-loved comedy on TV.
Still egregiously snubbed is NBC’s “Parks and Recreation.” Led by the fantastic Amy Poehler, who was downright hilarious as co-host at the Golden Globes telecast, “Parks and Recreation” has only gotten better with age. As the program progressed, each character and each performance has become increasingly complex.  The show has managed to make its characters three-dimensional without turning every hint of character development into a teachable moment.
Never having won a major award for Best Comedy, it seems “Parks and Recreation” still suffers from the somewhat lackluster impression its first season made back in 2009. It may not have been a breakout hit, but the show is consistently laugh-out-loud funny and has a lot of heart. Yes, Amy Poehler received a nomination for her work on the program, but if the show itself and its other incredibly talented performances are not going to be recognized as well, something is remiss. Voters must stop sticking with what’s trendy now or what was trendy three years ago and start recognizing true quality.
This is not to say that I have a gripe with every comedy nomination, or with the program that won on Sunday:  HBO’s “Girls” was stellar in its first season and is certainly deserving of the praise it has received. Its writing is sharp, its performers are talented and its premise means that it touches a generation of viewers in a profound way. Still, its win may just signal its designation as the new trendy comedy chosen by awards show voters.
Further, if “Girls” represents what voters are looking for in a comedy, it becomes even clearer that “Parks and Recreation” was unfairly snubbed. Though awards are certainly less important than true quality, it still helps when a show — particularly one that has somewhat low ratings — receives recognition. Thus, voters must reevaluate their qualifications for what is truly award-worthy.
