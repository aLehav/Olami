An altercation between two roommates took place outside Epicurean and Co. around 1:15 a.m., according to a Department of Public Safety officer.
A police officer at the scene told The Hoya that the students were under the influence of alcohol. One roommate was treated by the Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service and was subsequently sent to the hospital. The other roommate has been arrested by the Georgetown University Police Department. The acting captain, also on the scene, said that no further comment would be forthcoming tonight, pending investigation.
Students inside Epicurean said they were unfamiliar with the details but they saw multiple DPS officers and a GERMS ambulance outside.
At around 1:40 a.m., there were three police cars and around five officers outside the restaurant, but the two students involved in the altercation had been removed from the scene.

The Center for Student Engagement will discontinue the What’s After Dark program in response to university-wide budget cuts, resulting in a partial loss of funding for Relay for Life, the Georgetown Program Board and other groups.
What’s After Dark operates on a grant from the university and distributes funds to student organizations for late-night programming that do not involve alcohol. While the program will proceed with established commitments, it will no longer accept new applications for funding beginning today.
“There are some annual programs that we know we want to try to support, and we’re honoring the commitments that have been made so far but not actively soliciting new apps for funding. And there won’t be … What’s After Dark-generated programs in the spring,” Director of Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr said.
What’s After Dark was axed in lieu of pay cuts for staff members, Cohen Derr said. Current program staff will stay on in student affairs.
“The university is going through a cost-cutting exercise across the board, so when we looked at the programs that we could potentially cut, obviously we didn’t want to cut staff positions,” Cohen Derr said.
The funding from What’s After Dark will go toward future initiatives, like the Healey Family Student Center, set to open in fall 2014. What’s After Dark’s exact budget was not available at press time.
“I think one of the reasons What’s After Dark was where we took the cut was we’re preparing to open the HFSC. We want to make sure that that space has funding and support to provide an active social life for students,” Cohen Derr said. “HFSC will need programming, staffing and maintenance money. Right now we’re in the process of making those plans for next year. If we have to both cut costs and also plan to open a new space in the future, all of that’s being taken into consideration.”
What’s After Dark is a large contributor to the Georgetown Program Board, in addition to Relay for Life and — for the first time last year — Georgetown Day, for which the group funded the 2AM Club concert.
“We’ll have to start earlier with seeking our donations [but] there’s more than enough time to salvage,” said Georgetown Day Chair Andi DeBellis (MSB ’14), who also works in marketing and programming for the Center for Student Engagement.
Midnight Breakfast, offered during finals week, will likely be limited to offering free food, as What’s After Dark funded the night’s additional programming, such as prizes and giveaways.
Relay for Life, whose annual event has a budget of $25,000, traditionally received $5,000 to $8,000 from What’s After Dark since the event’s establishment in 2007. Last year, the organization saw reduced funding and anticipates even less this year. 2013 Relay for Life Chair Dan Silkman (COL ’15) said that his group did not yet know if it would receive leftover funds from What’s After Dark.
“This year, apparently, they’re still staking out the funding, so we got an email that there was still an opportunity for student programs … to secure funds for second semester,” he said.
Relay for Life typically runs from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. and What’s After Dark’s money goes to nighttime entertainment, which has previously included bouncy castles, food and caricaturists. Silkman is primarily concerned with attracting funds for next year’s event.
“This year, if we get less funding, and next year if we don’t get funding at all, we’ll have to rethink our activities,” he said, adding that Relay would consider apply for money from the GUSA Fund.
The Black Student Association received $10,000 in grants from What’s After Dark last year, including $6,000 for its Visions of Excellence ball.
“It’s going to be very difficult moving forward,” BSA President Erika Nedwell (COL ’14) said. “A lot of the board members are really upset, and we are not sure if we will have to cancel some of the events that we usually do.”
These events include the popular Hoya Late Skate night, which brought an ice skating rink to Red Square. Board members are currently brainstorming ideas but have thus far failed to conceive a way to completely recoup lost funding.
GPB receives funding from multiple groups, and one of its main priorities is the Spring Kickoff Concert, which was not included in this year’s What’s After Dark budget.
“Any remaining funds from What’s After Dark — we’ll look at programs that have been historically funded in the spring and allocate them as needed,” Cohen Derr said.
GPB also has the potential to fulfill the alcohol-free late-night programming that has traditionally been the purview of What’s After Dark. Beside cosponsoring events like Club Lau and Midnight Madness, What’s After Dark held its own events, like finals study breaks, the foam pit and Ladies’ Night In.
“I feel like GPB Late Night will start to step up their late-night efforts, and there’s always room for individual student organizations to pick it up,” DeBellis said. “It’s sad, but I feel like the student body will be able to make up and start programming more at night. We’ll find new, creative ways to seek funding for those events, as well.”
While student leaders are ultimately disappointed with the demise of a source of funding, the necessity of budget cuts draws understanding.
“I am very, very close with the staff members of CSE, and I know that they’re always short on money, so I totally understand that this was a necessary decision,” Silkman said. “I think that its unfortunate that student groups won’t benefit, and I wish there was a way to keep it.”

The GUSA senate established a subcommittee on funding reform Sunday, coming toward the end of a year in which student activities funding plateaued and approximately 63 percent of funding requests were met.
Finance and Appropriations Committee member Robert Shepherd (MSB ’15) proposed the creation of a subcommittee on spending reform that was approved with a unanimous vote.
“We’re creating this subcommittee to focus on addressing some current funding issues we’re seeing across student groups,” Shepherd said at the senate meeting.
The committee will evaluate the current structures for funding student groups before emitting any suggestions.
“There is a general consensus within the senate that a re-evaluation of the funding systems on campus needs to take place,” Shepherd wrote in an email. “If we determine that changes do, in fact, need to be made, we will work with the groups to bring about these changes.”
The re-evaluation comes less than two years after the student body approved the Student Activities Fee and Endowment reform in a January 2012 referendum. The reform increased the student activities fee from $125 in the 2011-2012 school year to $150 in the 2012-2013 school year, with the understanding that after those two increases the fee would only increase to compensate for national inflation levels. This year, Fin/App allocated $979,200 to student groups.
“If groups were hurting across the board, severely underfunded and unable to complete their functions, that would be an issue that would make it worth considering adjusting the Student Activities Fee,” Fin/App Chair Seamus Guerin (COL ’16) said, though he maintained that increasing the fee is not currently necessary.
Former Fin/App Chair Sheila Walsh (COL ’14), however, called for another student activities fee reform in March after the previous funding cycle.
“In addition to all the independent student initiatives, the need far, far outweighs the money that we have available to fund those student groups and initiatives,” Walsh said.
Student Activities Commission Chair Jennifer Chiang (SFS ’15) agreed that student activities funding could use re-evaluation.
“There needs to be a discussion about the Student Activities Fee that involves students and their informed perspectives,” she said. “Our organizations have ambitious and innovative programming ideas, which is amazing; however there is not enough funding to go around to make all of those events come to life.”
According to former SAC Chair Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), tying the student activities fee to inflation is realistically a 1 percent increase. Appelbaum called for overhauling the student activities funding system during his campaign for GUSA executive in February.
“It would be nice to see the fee grow,” Appelbaum said, adding that a fee increase would raise tuition, which has already increased by 4 percent in the past year. “It’s tough.”
While Appelbaum did not acknowledge any concrete plans for reform in the future, he said he heard rumblings of student activities fee reform, rather than increases, within GUSA. However, GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said raising the Student Activities Fee is not currently a priority.
“I think the fact that we can’t fund all requests doesn’t mean that we’re failing, it doesn’t mean that the system doesn’t work,” Tisa said.
Lauren Watanabe (MSB ’15), president of the Hawaii Club, said that while her club would always like more funding, the problem is not the activity fee but rather SAC itself.
“They need to break down where the money is going so I can understand that my student activity fee is justified,” Watanabe said. “SAC is not really supportive even though they’re supposed to be here to support us.”

Students who lose their books or hold on to them a bit too long will be able to pay late fees and other library charges with credit cards by the end of the semester.
Library staff have begun the final stages of adding credit card capabilities, working on paperwork for banking, setting up equipment and circulation-desk staff in the new technology. Currently, the library accepts cash, check or GOCard for late fees.
The implementation process required sign-offs from several offices on campus: the Campus Fiscal Office, the Office of the Counsel, the Information Access Office, the Security Office and the Tax Department.
Faculty and graduate students will be able to rent carrels and lockers using credit cards, whereas they would previously have needed to pay via cash, check or GOCard.
“I think that it’s a small service change, but I think that for some people, it will be significantly more convenient for them to be able to use their credit cards and not have to make a special trip to the ATM or put money on their GOCards specifically to pay their fines,” Library Coordinator of Communications, Outreach and Programming Jennifer Smith said.
The idea was first suggested by Matthew Eckel (GRD ’16) on Georgetown Ideas in March.
“A lot of graduate students end up taking out a lot of books, and there are times when you end up raking up more than just a $2 or $3 fine. There have been several occasions when I was trying to get a locker, and they only take check or cash payments for what are often fairly large sums, and I’m usually not carrying a hundred bucks in my wallet or my checkbook,” Eckel said. “I get a sense that most of my colleagues are in a pretty similar position. It seems kind of archaic at this point that they don’t have a credit-card reader.”
Students who work at the circulation desk agreed that the new system would benefit library users.
“I guess it’ll make it easier, really just for patrons because most patrons don’t really carry cash,” circulation desk employee Max Menard (SFS ’16) said. “It wouldn’t really change my job; it would just be easier for others to pay.”

Ongoing frustrations between the District of Columbia Taxicab Commission and taxi drivers have culminated in the formation of a union and the establishment of the Washington, D.C. Taxi Operators Association, which held its first meeting Oct. 29.
A crowd of more than 1,000 D.C. cab drivers and Teamsters Union members gathered at the meeting to demand better representation and fewer hidden costs for individual drivers, with organizational help from Teamsters Local 922.
“The meeting was great, as there was a wonderful outpouring of support, and there appears to be tremendous interest in the association. By gaining the power of the union, these taxi drivers can truly begin to fight for change,” Teamsters Spokesperson Galen Munroe said.
More than 1,000 of the city’s 6,000 cab drivers had already signed union membership papers before the meeting, according to Teamsters Local 639 President Thomas Ratliff, who held the inaugural DCTOA meeting.
Union organizers are hopeful that the DCTOA will follow in the footsteps of the 500 Seattle taxi drivers who formed the Western Washington Taxicab Operators Association last year, which has been largely successful in winning better wages for drivers and representing them in taxicab legislation.
Taxi drivers and Teamster organizers alike emphasized the strength of unity in combating alleged DCTC injustices.
“We must stay strong and fight back for our equal rights. We will not be disrespected by the DCTC. We must have a voice in the decision-making process,” taxi driver Mohamud Samantar said.
The creation of the association is the result of protests against D.C. requirements for all taxi drivers to carry the Modern Taximeter System, which includes GPS capabilities and a credit card reader. Drivers, however, have struggled due to the costs of the mandatory update, which requires returning 25 cents to DCTC per trip. Taxi drivers have also complained of a shortage of MTS providers and penalties they will face if they do not meet the requirements, which also include installing dome lights, by the Nov. 1 deadline.
“We have talked to drivers and have come to understand their concerns with these new regulations. The taxi drivers feel that the regulations are causing them a lot of financial issues and that the process hasn’t been smooth in its implementation largely because drivers were not properly consulted,” Munroe said. “Taxi drivers in this city want a bigger voice in how the city treats them.”
Munroe expressed concern at DCTC’s refusal to extend the Nov. 1 deadline despite the fact that many drivers haven’t yet received dome lights due to the large demand, which has also driven up prices.
“This deadline means that many drivers who wished to comply to the regulation will still have their cars towed and impounded, just because their light hasn’t arrived yet. We think that this is unjust,” Munroe said.
According to the Teamsters, the average D.C. cab driver makes $25,000 to $30,000 a year and spends as much as $40 a day on fuel and $100 a month on auto insurance.
“I’m preparing to sign up for the union because I’ve had to pay $400 for the dome light, instead of the $180 that was promised by the DCTC. Also, the taxi tracker chip is really expensive and it’s an invasion of our privacy. We need more of a say in how we have to operate, and we’ll say it as one, both cab company owners and drivers together,” DCTC commissioner and 50-year taxi driver Stanley Tapscott said.
DCTC spokesperson Neville Waters declined to comment on the recent unionization of DCTOA but said that DCTC has been in communication with drivers.
“We have two active drivers on our commission board, which consisted of only eight members, all appointed by the mayor. We are in constant contact with drivers, and we take their feedback. We meet with drivers every month, and we have had discussions with the two existing taxi driver associations in the city,” he said. “The DCTC is a regulatory body, so if drivers don’t install the new upgrades, of course we have to enforce the legislation.”

As implementation of the Affordable Care Act begins, the university will adjust employee health insurance policies and ramp up educational innovations at the School of Nursing and Health Studies.
The ACA’s individual mandate goes into effect in January 2014, and employers must provide coverage by January 2015.
“Right now Georgetown is looking at the populations who we will be required to cover and putting policies into place that will allow us to be compliant with the act,” Assistant Vice President for Communications Stacy Kerr said.
“Georgetown as a large employer must comply with the act. Fortunately, we are ahead of schedule in terms of compliance with some of the provisions because a lot of these provisions were already in place at Georgetown,” she added, citing that university plans did not exclude coverage based on pre-existing conditions or have maximums on how much insurance companies can pay to customers.
However, universities, including Georgetown, face some difficulties in deciding how to implement changes to fulfill employee insurance requirements.
“The law is written under the corporate model, so a lot of things are unclear for higher education about how to cover non-traditional employees such as graduate students and Ph.D students, and discussions are going on at Georgetown about putting policies into place to be compliant with the law,” Kerr said.
The significant expansion in healthcare coverage resulting from the implementation of the ACA, coupled with increased governmental involvement, has led the NHS to pursue new approaches to healthcare education in order to meet the increased demand for healthcare professionals.
“Students enrolled in our undergraduate and graduate nursing programs will likely witness profound changes in the landscape of practice, as the ACA requires a primary care workforce that is already in short supply,” NHS Dean Martin Iguchi said. “We anticipate greater responsibility and independence in practice for nursing professionals in years to come, and NHS will play a significant part in the development of this workforce.”
The NHS has explored technology as a way to meet this goal, rolling out an online master’s nursing program in spring 2011.
In addition, the school has adapted quickly to the changing curriculum landscape, adding a public health minor that incorporates the skills necessary to participate in bureaucratized healthcare.
The Affordable Care Act will also influence research positively at Georgetown, according to Iguchi.
“The ACA’s emphasis on data-driven decision-making will create demand for research conducted by our students and faculty in areas such as the basic and medical sciences; health insurance coverage and quality of care; and population health and health literacy,” he said.
In addition, increased coverage will result in a larger pool of subjects which can lead to more accurate results, especially since doctors and hospitals, rather than insurance companies, will now provide patient data.
“Some of our current research methods relied on non-traditional sources of data for disease surveillance such as insurance claims data,” assistant professor of biology Shweta Bansal said. “These data sources clearly did not provide a complete picture before with 49 million uninsured Americans. More complete coverage under the ACA will allow us to rely on these data streams more confidently.”
Iguchi suggested that NHS students are already prepared for emerging focus areas, such as health policy and healthcare administration, because of their curriculum.
“We anticipate that these students will actively participate in the transformation of the healthcare system from a focus on illnesses and hospital-centric care to a focus on wellness and community-oriented care,” Iguchi said.

The university’s commitment to broad Hoya Roundtable discussions has waned in favor of more frequent, focused engagement sessions on topics as specific as outdoor space near Northeast Triangle.
Introduced by Chief Operating Officer Christopher Augostini in 2012, Hoya Roundtables sought to facilitate a large gathering of students and high-level administrators, usually in question-and-answer sessions as well as general discussions on broad-ranging subjects relating to student life.
“Roundtables are an opportunity to discuss a broad range of services at a high level and to give feedback on what may need more attention from students and the administration,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh wrote in an email. “The roundtable format provides a forum for students to share their experiences and an important opportunity for administrators to better understand what is important to students.”
The Hoya Roundtables contrast with the dozens of small engagement sessions in dorm lobbies and O’Donovan Hall this semester that have drawn relatively low attendance with lower-level administrators. The university has also held a few larger forums this semester on general master planning efforts and the Northeast Triangle residence hall, most of which have also seen low turnout. Many students counted as engaged in the new forums are just passing through as they walk through their dorm or Leo’s.
“These sessions are an opportunity to share info and have conversations about ongoing projects or issues and to help identify student’s desired goals or solutions,” Pugh wrote. “The continued conversations allow us to work together specifically on issues around student housing and design and function of the NET residence hall. The frequency of these engagement opportunities allows any student many opportunities to participate.”
The Georgetown University Student Association partnered with the Department of Public Safety to hold a roundtable with Police Chief Jay Gruber on Oct. 16.
The first broader roundtable of the year is scheduled for November.
GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said that while roundtables are beneficial, GUSA and the university have shifted their approach to engagement.
“We think through some of the recent feedback we’ve gotten from students and try to pick an issue that’s kind of a hot topic and something that hasn’t been done recently,” Tisa said. “We might do it on housing in general or innovation, which would incorporate some technology. We could also look at the academic side, how are we innovating in the classroom.”
Assistant Dean for Residential Living Stephanie Lynch, present at the New South forum, found the smaller forums to be an effective means of engaging the student body.
“We’ve had good student turnout for all of them, and I think we would all say that their feedback has been essential to creating a space that will work for students now and for the future,” she said.
The first engagement session of the series on Northeast Triangle was an open meeting with administrators in the Office of Planning and Facilities Management. No students were in attendance.
GUSA Director of Student Space Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), who worked with the administration to create the engagement sessions, stressed the benefits of different means of facilitating student-administrator interaction.
“It gives people the opportunity to ask questions and share specific information,” Appelbaum said. “People share things that they might not in front of a large group, they ask questions they might not ask, there’s more dialogue, there’s more back and forth, and you can eventually come collectively to a good idea.”
Tisa agreed and said that while more prevalent this past semester, the focused forum format has not replaced that of its Hoya Roundtable predecessor.
“I think that they’ve been different. The university’s had focus forums more and more over the past few years,” Tisa said. “I think it’s moving in a good direction, but I don’t think it replaces the roundtables.”

To the students in Oded Meyer’s statistics classes, Meyer is just like any other professor. But as a full-time faculty member not on the tenure track, Meyer’s experience is markedly different from that of many other faculty members.
“It really gave me the feeling of being a second-class citizen,” Meyer said. “Who wants to be treated like that?”
After adjunct faculty unionized in May, non-tenure-line full-time faculty at Georgetown are voicing concerns over inconsistency in their treatment.
Their positions are imbued with ambiguity, as the category encompasses 259 professors, ranging from visiting professors to heads of programs whose main focus is teaching rather than research. While these professors work full-time, they are not positioned to apply for tenure. As full-time professors, however, they are also excluded from the adjunct movement.
At a faculty town hall in mid-October, professors questioned University President John J. DeGioia on the topic. DeGioia said that Georgetown was attentive to the increasing concerns formed by non-tenure-line full-time faculty when renovating office space on campus.
“We became aware of the dynamic over the course of roughly the past six, seven years, particularly in the context of building some of our new buildings,” DeGioia said. “We weren’t even sure we had office space for everybody.”
A group of administrators and faculty working to address grievances will be formed in the coming weeks, with changes expected to be implemented by the end of the year.
“We don’t want this process to be unilateral coming from us and the provost’s office saying, ‘This is what we’re going to do.’ We need to engage in a conversation. We need to sit together and work out solutions,” Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Adriana Kugler told The Hoya.
The professors’ concerns are based on a perceived lack of respect from the university and administrative disorganization that affects their treatment.
“We have typically much higher course loads and much less respect, so the idea is that you are ‘just’ doing teaching, so that puts teaching in a second-class position,” said Sylvia Onder, visiting associate professor of Turkish, who has been in her current role since 1989.
Non-tenure-line full-time faculty members lack the ability to vote on departmental issues and also have a wide range of salaries.
Across departments, these faculty members do not have consistent titles and are referred to as visiting professors, clinical professors, teaching professors or associate professors.
“It’s a mess. I have no idea; it’s so vague. The names are very confusing,” Meyer said.
Non-tenure full-time faculty members also face challenges within their departments. Some departments offer greater participation for non-tenure-line faculty in the decision-making process than in other departments, but according to Onder, the incorporation of non-tenure-track faculty is minimal.
“When it comes down to an important vote, non-tenure-line faculty don’t have a vote,” Onder said.
Another issue is the lack of a clear professional-development track to distinguish the performance of new professors from those who have been teaching for 20 years. As such, non-tenure full-time faculty have been left in a sea of uncertainty when it comes to contracts and salaries with The Chronicle for Higher Education’s Adjunct Project reporting salaries as low as $2,100 per course.
Other universities, like Carnegie Mellon, have a structured non-tenure track that allows for performance-based promotions under the title of teaching professor.
“I’ve been spoiled at Carnegie Mellon by being treated as an equal,” said Meyer, who taught at the university before coming to Georgetown.
Yet non-tenure full-time faculty members remain an important part of the teaching force in academia. A study conducted at Northwestern University found that students in an introductory-level course taught by non-tenure full-time faculty, rather than tenure-track faculty, were more likely to take another course in that field and were more likely to excel in that course.
“I think Georgetown realizes it’s a problem,” Meyer said. “This university has a mission ,and without the dedicated and talented teaching faculty, they cannot do it.”
Though this problem has existed for years, the university has been slow to respond, professors said.
“One of the things that concerned me about moving here was Georgetown not having a clear career path for non-tenure track,” Meyer said. “I’ve been hearing about this teaching track since I got here in 2010, and this is the first time something is being done about it.”
Some faculty thought their needs were pushed aside due to the administration’s focus on adjunct unionization last spring. DeGioia assured faculty that progress toward addres-sing the issue was under way and is a priority.
“We are very clear about the challenge of the issue and Provost Groves and our new vice provost [Kugler] are taking this on, and this is regarded as a very important issue for the campus,” DeGioia said at the town hall. “I do not believe the issue regarding adjunct faculty in any way delayed our engagement with moving into the role last year and organizing the office to be able to take on the challenges. … We knew this was one of them.”

While some students put the finishing touches on their costumes and prepared to partake in Halloween festivities, others extended the Halloween spirit to children of the greater Georgetown community at the first Georgetown University Student Association Safe Night on Thursday.
Student groups sponsored and organized Halloween-themed activities for children and families, who trick-or-treated from table to table.
Andi DeBellis (MSB ’14) approached GUSA with the idea and helped organize the event.
“Besides a GUSA position, and a little bit that the Office of Community Engagement does, there’s no student movement to show that Georgetown is a resource to our neighbors,” DeBellis said.
GUSA helped coordinate the event by acting as a cost center and umbrella under which the participant student groups organized activities.
“I thought it was a great idea. This is the type of thing that we’re really trying to push more of, getting students in front of neighbors in a more positive light and also showing the community members what Georgetown has to offer that’s more positive than just noise and trash,” GUSA Secretary of Neighborhood Relations Pieter Fossel (SFS ’14) said.
Office of Community Engagement Special Projects Coordinator Candace Mosely also saw the event as a step toward improving the university’s relationship with the neighborhood.
“A lot of what Georgetown has is, first of all, there’s passion from the students, but there’s also just knowledge they have to share, and I think this is just a great opportunity for neighbors to get to see that side of it,” Mosely said.
The night’s festivities included a pumpkin patch, apple picking, free hot cocoa, free candy and live music. A number of student groups contributed resources, including Students of Georgetown Inc., the Georgetown University Farmers Market, GIVES, Relay for Life, FOCI, Catholic Daughters, the Georgetown University Grilling Society and Right to Life.
“It will also be a great opportunity for us to talk with community members and invite them to our event in April,” Relay for Life Chair Dan Silkman (COL ’15) said. “This year we’re really looking to work with the Office of Neighborhood Life and really seek out the neighbors to come because we do think that our event could be this unifying force on campus for our relationship with the community.”
A number of faculty members attended the event as well.
“Family atmosphere brings the community together, I think it’s wonderful. I like the mix of the college students with the families, I think that’s a nice touch,” Jeannine LaRocque, an assistant professor in the department of human science, said. “We live in the community, so we hear both sides of it, and so I see this as definitely one event of many that Georgetown participates in to try and pull the community life into campus as well.”
The organizers hope that the Halloween event will set a precedent for further on-campus inclusion of the neighborhood.
“I’m hoping that maybe it’ll get students thinking a little bit more about how to involve the community in all of our activities, so that the neighbors aren’t as scared of us and we’re not as scared of the neighbors, and just providing an avenue for more working together and more collaboration,” DeBellis said.

In little over a year, LivingSocial, founded by Tim O’Shaughnessy (MSB ’04) in 2007, has gone from one of Washington, D.C.’s most promising companies to a platform that has alienated D.C. small businesses, including Georgetown restaurants, in attempts to stave off bankruptcy.
“LivingSocial had terrible execution of its product,” Wingo’s Assistant Manager Bold Obi said. “The company had no customer service, and they had a poor website layout. Everything was done incorrectly. Ordering online didn’t make sense. It was a bad experience for restaurants and for their customers.”
LivingSocial profited initially by offering discounts and deals through daily emails, but has recently recorded net losses. In its most recent quarter, LivingSocial posted a $26 million loss, bringing its yearly loss through the first three quarters to $107 million, a sizeable number for a company with slightly more than $500 million in yearly revenue, according to Washingtonian magazine.
Restaurants, including Kitchen No. 1 and Wingo’s, were hopeful that LivingSocial would help to improve their bottom line.
Though these restaurants were disappointed by LivingSocial’s offerings, it was LivingSocial who chose to suspend its service, not the local restaurants.
“They dropped us, discontinuing the product to many restaurants,” Obi said.
Michael Clements, founder of ArtJamz, a public art studio and lounge in D.C., opposed the company on the basis of competition.
“I am not going to do business with a company that says it supports small business and then morphs into a company that is in direct competition with small businesses,” he said.
LivingSocial declined to comment.
The D.C. mayor’s office expressed faith in LivingSocial last year by offering the company a large tax bailout to keep the business afloat while allowing managers to hire more employees from the District. However, Mayor Vincent Gray’s Senior Communications Manager Doxie McCoy noted that while the Gray administration continues to support LivingSocial in its attempt to transform its business model, the company must meet certain conditions to receive the tax break.
“The District isn’t obligated to provide this tax break until LivingSocial meets certain requirements, such as building a 250,000-square-foot headquarters in the city and maintaining 1,000 employees in the District,” she said.
Washingtonian magazine reported earlier this month that LivingSocial has not met these obligations. Only 600 people are currently employed by the company and fewer than 250 are from the D.C. area.
Business owners agreed that LivingSocial would require rejuvenation.
“Part of me wants LivingSocial to succeed, but they are our main competitor. They need to change,” Clements said.

In the two weeks since The Corp launched its “Kill the Cup” campaign, the number of students bringing reusable mugs to Corp storefronts has increased by 61 percent.
The campaign, launched Oct. 15, uses a social media campaign and in-store promotions to incentivize the usage of reusable tumblers, including a limited edition Kill the Cup tumbler sold by Students of Georgetown Inc.
If a customer uses a special Kill the Cup tumbler, there is a 30-cent discount, a five-cent increase in the discount currently given to customers who bring in a reusable tumbler.
Although the sale of the Kill the Cup tumblers will end Nov. 11, the price discounts will remain in effect indefinitely.
“It’s a campaign trying to build long-term habits for people and we’re still going to have certain incentives in place,” Business Development Chair Caroline Williams (MSB ’15) said.
The Corp’s social media campaign encourages students to photograph themselves using reusable mugs at Corp locations. Customers who post photos to The Corp’s website or on Instagram are entered into raffles for a variety of prizes.
While it is common for coffee shops to offer discounts for bringing in a reusable tumbler, Vice Chair of The Corp Green Team Whitney Pratt (COL ’14) said that The Corp’s discount is unusual for coffee shops.
“It’s a norm among coffee shops to give some sort of discount for bringing your own mug but our discount is significantly higher; 25 cents is a lot higher than almost all other discounts,” Pratt said.
For many students, the campaign has been effective.
“I’m definitely planning to make the switch as soon as possible. I just need to take the time and initiative to buy the tumbler,” Eunyoung Kim (COL ’17) said.
The Corp has offered discounts for reusing paper cups for several years but Kill the Cup has been designed to move away from paper cup usage.
“We changed that because first of all, that’s not very sustainable,” Pratt said. “It was a decision to do a Corp-wide change because it is more sustainable to have people bring reusable mugs than to be using a cup in the first place.”
Although many students have noticed the campaign, others were unsure that it would change their coffee-consuming habits.
“I think that most people who already have [tumblers] would use them regardless and people who don’t use them wouldn’t necessarily stop and buy one and then become in the habit of using it,” Nicole Yeo (SFS ’14) said.

Upper-level administrators joined students at the 10th annual Students of Color Alliance Unity Dinner on Wednesday, with many leaving before the evening’s discussion of how to improve diversity and collaboration among students.
Attendees talked about pluralism and diversity while sampling food from various cultural traditions at the dinner in Copley Formal Lounge.
SOCA Co-Presidents Patrick Zhang (SFS ’15) and Minjung Kang (SFS ’15) delivered the State of SOCA address outlining the history of the organization and the steps the group, which includes representatives from cultural clubs, hopes to take in the future.
Leadership in Education about Diversity representatives facilitated discussions at tables with students and faculty about the evolving climate of diversity at Georgetown.
While this year’s dinner saw a record number of administrators and faculty in attendance, including Director for the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access Dennis Williams, Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., and Provost Robert Groves, most did not stay for the discussions.
“I think that something that upset me was that the adults that were invited to come left before the discussion even began. They just came for the food and left,” SOCA Chinese Student Association representative Christina Ling (MSB ’15) said.
Though Kang shared Ling’s disappointment, she understood that administrators may have felt out of place in student-centered discussions.
“I wish they could have stayed but I think that maybe they felt that they didn’t fit into the discussions, because this was a little student-organization oriented,” Kang said.
For many attendees, the dinner represented not only an opportunity for dialogue with fellow SOCA organizations but also an analysis of the state of minority affairs at Georgetown.
“I liked that so many different cultural organizations were able to come together in one spot,” Ling said. “My biggest takeaway from this dinner tonight is that diversity is an issue that needs to be a bigger focus in Georgetown, as part of the administration and on campus.”
Zhang said that the event was successful in facilitating dialogue.
“We’re hoping that this Unity Dinner will set the tone for the coming academic year in terms of collaborative programming among student organizations and also break the ice in terms of discussions between student leaders and staff and administrators,” Zhang said.

In the first steps of fundraising for a new veterans resource center, the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association is planning a gala that could bring actor Bradley Cooper (CAS ’97), who has engaged in veterans advocacy in the past, to campus.
The gala will be part of a larger fundraising plan for a new resource center, which GUSVA said is sorely needed for the university’s 500 veterans.
GUSVA is reaching out to alumni ahead of the gala, including Cooper, who participated in Michelle Obama’s “Got Your Six” campaign that helps veterans readjust to civilian life.
Spread across the undergraduate and graduate schools as well as the School of Continuing Studies, veterans sometimes lack the resources to create a sense of community. Thirty of the university’s 500 veterans are undergraduates, and three live on campus.
“That fact kind of exemplifies the untraditional nature of being a veteran student or a veteran-type family. They have obligations your day-to-day student wouldn’t have,” GUSVA President Zach Zimmerman (MSB ’14) said. “A veterans resource center would have a positive impact for a veteran in the School of Continuing Studies as well as someone in the undergraduate School of Foreign Service and the MBA program and Law Center as well.”
Georgetown opened a Veterans Office with a full-time coordinator in December 2011 after extensive lobbying from GUSVA. Before GUSVA formed in 2010, resources for veterans were sorely lacking, GUSVA faculty adviser Barbara Mujica said.
GUSVA members envision the center, which would cost $1 million to launch and require continual funding, providing career, financial and academic resources to veterans, along with a meeting space to cultivate a sense of community.
“It’s important for vets to talk to other vets because the most important source of information for veterans is other veterans — veterans who’ve already been through it,” Mujica said. “That’s something that the GUSVA seeks to remedy.”
The funding GUSVA receives from the Office of the Provost is minimal, covering mainly panels and guest speakers. The gala will hopefully begin an extensive fundraising campaign to reach the $1 million goal.
“We need to raise money, and this is a first step in that direction,” Mujica said. “We’re hoping that we’ll raise maybe $40,000 to begin with, and we hope to do this every single year until we have enough money to get started.”
GUSVA treasurer Aaron Scheuerman (MSB ’14) pointed to the resource center as the logical progression of GUSVA’s recent expansion.
“I am most proud of how far GUSVA has come in a short amount of time,” he said. “Just a few years ago there were few resources for veterans on campus, but the student veterans now have a strong community and are hosting a whole weeks of events in honor of Veterans Day, have established the Veterans Living Learning Community and continually participate in many service projects in the D.C. area.”

The fire watch in Southwest Quad was lifted Monday at 6 p.m., and fire alarms were restored to full working order after weeks of troubleshooting and repairs.
Prior to the fire watch, the Southwest Quad experienced an epidemic of false alarms, often at early hours of the morning.
“We feel confident that we’ve fixed the problem,” Vice President for Facilities and Planning Robin Morey said.
To minimize the negative impact on the students residing in the three SWQ residence halls, the university took the automatic fire alarm activation system offline Oct. 11 and replaced it with a fire-watch system conducted by Department of Public Safety officers.
During the fire watch, smoke alarms and fire alarms did not automatically activate an audible alarm, as usually occurs. Rather, in the event of detected trouble, a signal would be displayed on a control panel continuously monitored by a technician. The technician would then alert the officers to investigate the situation.
Gregory Simmons, associate vice president of facilities operations, design and construction, said that this fire watch was not necessary, but was instituted for the convenience of students.
“Typically when you do a fire watch, it is because part of the system is out of service and you want eyes and ears in the building. In this case we did it as an extra mile, all the systems were operational except for the actual trigger to ring the bells in the building.” Simmons said.
The fire watch did prevent one alarm and evacuation, and DPS officers confirmed that the situation was safe, according to Morey.
University Facilities determined that the problem was with Loop 1, which includes a small area of the parking garage and a number of service and maintenance rooms.
Through extensive troubleshooting, the problem was determined to be with the wiring and hardware on Loop 1.
Simmons explained that, in order to solve the problem, new wiring and devices were installed in the trouble area.
“Effectively, we replaced most of the devices, about 30 pieces of hardware and all of the wiring on that loop of the system.” Morey said.
The team monitored the system for other problems over four days, and none were detected.
“When we see the panel, we’re seeing completely normal conditions, while prior to this we were seeing notifications of trouble. We feel like we’ve solved the underlying condition.” Simmons said.
