The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) launched efforts to create a national consortium of university student governments to increase interscholastic activism.
The National College Consortium, a proposal GUSA President Nile Blass (COL ’22) spearheaded, along with GUSA Executive Officials Genevieve Grenier (MSB ’24) and Thomas Leonard (COL ’23), will organize around regional and national issues important to college students. In the organizers’ vision, the consortium will include public, private and two-year higher education institutions from across the country and has already confirmed membership from 10 universities.
The consortium’s immediate agenda will include supporting federal voting rights legislation and student loan forgiveness, according to Grenier. 
“There’s a lot of issues that we do align with the interests of other universities on, for example, voting rights and student loan debt forgiveness,” Grenier said in an interview with The Hoya. “There’s no body that brings together all the public, private, HBCUs, tribal colleges, every type of university from across the country. I think there’s 20 million college students on American campuses — so that means there’s a lot of political power.”
Student governments at American University; Howard University; Gallaudet University; the University of Maryland; the University of Mississippi; the University of Iowa; the University of California, Los Angeles; Princeton University; Harvard University and Yale University have signed on, according to Blass. The organization will publish a website Nov. 19.
Currently, many colleges and universities around the country participate in administrative consortiums to share resources and promote advocacy. Georgetown participates in the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area, a group of local university administrations that collaborate around educational and financial resources. 
The National College Consortium will also aim to elevate historically underrepresented voices from HBCUs, public and private universities and tribal colleges, according to Blass.
Existing administrative consortiums are often only among university administrations and do not include student governments and marginalized voices, according to Blass, which is why GUSA is intentionally diversifying participating higher education institutions. 
“We’re talking about demographic differences,” Blass said in an interview with The Hoya. “We still want to have it definitely based on student activism and student voices. We want to make sure that — it’s Georgetown starting this, obviously — but we don’t want this to just be Georgetown.”
Blass’s fall 2021 GUSA Executive campaign platform included a promise to pursue a national college consortium. The GUSA Executive branch introduced the idea to the GUSA Senate at a Nov. 7 meeting and is currently leading efforts to organize the consortium.
According to Rowlie Flores (COL ’22), vice speaker of the GUSA Senate, the consortium will hopefully help GUSA and university administrators better recognize and accommodate students belonging to disenfranchised groups at Georgetown.
“As student leaders in this university, we have to recognize that some of the issues we face are also felt by other universities, so there’s always a benefit to sharing resources and input,” Flores wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have to be cognizant of the fact that Georgetown’s student body leans toward backgrounds of socioeconomic privilege and the consortium allows us to learn from leaders in HBCUs, state and public universities, community colleges, and colleges serving historically marginalized communities.”
The National Consortium has not met as a group yet; however, Blass and other GUSA Executive members plan to meet with other representatives of the consortium Dec. 4 over Zoom to discuss expanding the consortium and future plans for the organization.
While Blass and members of the GUSA Executive are currently focused on expanding the organization’s membership, the group hopes that in the future the national consortium will be a launching point to negotiate with both state and local governments and, eventually, federal officials. However, GUSA will continue to work on issues pertaining specifically to Georgetown in addition to working on the consortium, according to Blass.
Blass hopes the National College Consortium will spur united local and national university advocacy. 
“There are so many problems that go beyond our campus that we are in a position to meaningfully facilitate and support, that I see no reason to say that just because we’re part of the DMV, that means that we shouldn’t be working to organize and help elevate the voices of other people,” Blass said.

The Georgetown University Law Center’s Street Law clinic held its 49th annual fall mock trial event for students attending Washington, D.C. public high schools Nov. 4, offering participants the opportunity to learn about the law and practice legal skills. 
Under the program, students in the clinic teach a semesterlong course about basic legal principles to participating students from Washington D.C. Public Schools (DCPS). At the end of the semester, students participate in a mock trial case on a topic chosen by the course instructors.
The program allows students to learn about the legal process and develop self-esteem, according to Charisma Howell, director of the Street Law clinic.
“The real value is in the young people and seeing them accomplish something that they didn’t necessarily think that they could do,” Howell said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It can be an incredible boost for one’s confidence. It’s a very complicated process, but they do amazing every year.” 
Under the program, the law students create a lesson plan and hold classes, which last between 60 and 90 minutes and occur two or three times a week. The courses cover a wide range of subjects; however, they also help prepare students for the final mock trial competition, which takes place at the end of the semester.
Law students work to make the course materials as relevant and accessible as possible to the high school students, according to Howell.
“The law students need to bring the law to life and make it tangible,” Howell said. “It is about teaching the nuances of the law while infusing relevant examples that students are engaged and interested in.” 
The classes employ a variety of teaching methods, as student instructors use different techniques to teach the high schoolers legal and public speaking skills, according to Elizabeth Choi (LAW ’22), a student coach.
“For each class, I try to incorporate several different teaching methods to accomodate the variety of ways in which students learn,” Choi wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There is usually always some type of reading, a worksheet, some writing, sometimes a video, sometimes a game, etc. One thing I almost always include is time for a classroom discussion/debate.”
At the end of the semester, the high schools participate in a mock trial to assess skills learned throughout the course. The topic of the trial changes every year, with this year’s presenting students with a case focused on human rights, according to Howell.
While preparing for the trial was stressful at times because of student absences during the COVID-19 pandemic, the experience was fulfilling for both students and teachers, according to Shelina Warren, a teacher at Dunbar High School, a DCPS school near the Mount Vernon Triangle neighborhood that won the competition.
“In my opinion, preparing for the mock trial was stressful up until the day of because of the unpredictability of student attendance due to being in a pandemic,” Warren wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It was a delight to see my students perform, some that had been struggling in various ways this semester but that rose to the occasion.”
While Georgetown Law students helped prepare students for the trial, the participants largely competed by themselves, according to Choi. 
“I helped prep my students on our way to the mock trial and while we were waiting for the trial to start,” Choi wrote. “During the trial, I answered some of my students’ questions but for the most part only observed them.” 
The mock trial consists of three rounds of 15 teams, and judges tally points based on various criteria, including speech and feasibility of the legal approach presented, to determine which two teams will compete in the final round, according to Howell.
Competing in the tournament and winning the trial was very exciting, according to Rakiah Willis, a junior at Dunbar high school.
“Preparing for the mock trial was definitely a great experience,” Willis wrote in a message to The Hoya. “It felt very great to win the trial. I felt a burst of excitement knowing all of our hard work paid off.” 
Despite being nervous for the competition, Dunbar competitors were ready to win, according to Dunbar high school junior Jaquan Waller. 
“I was nervous at first but once we went through the doors I was excited and ready to win,” Waller wrote in a message to The Hoya. “When I got there I kept telling myself that, ‘we are going to win,’ so when we finally won I was relieved and I was like, ‘I knew it was going to happen,’ but I was very happy to win.”

Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) spoke on campus about the state of voting rights legislation in the United States on Wednesday.
The event, titled “Race, Religion, and the Assault on Voting Rights,” was held in Lohrfink Auditorium and featured Warnock in conversation with Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Al.) and Rev. Jim Wallis, the inaugural director of the Center for Faith and Justice, a research center that studies the intersection of faith and politics.
Voting is deeply tied to the human condition and should be a human right, according to Warnock.
“A vote is a kind of prayer for the world we desire for ourselves and for our children,” Warnock said. “I believe that is sacred because at root, the vote is about your voice, and your voice is about your human dignity, and we have to stand up for that.”
This year alone, at least 19 states enacted 33 laws that made it harder for Americans to vote, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The laws include criminal charges for handing out water or snacks to voters in Georgia or submitting ballots for those who may need assistance voting in Iowa and Kansas. Compounding the issue, Senate Republicans have invoked the filibuster three times in the past year to block the advancement of legislation to protect voting rights.
Warnock, who serves as a pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, said pushback against voting rights in his home state and across the country is opposite to U.S. democratic values.
“What’s going on in Georgia and all across our country is very serious,” Warnock said at the event. “It is an all out assault on our democracy, and those of us who believe in democracy have to take up this fight, and so I’m deeply honored to be in this struggle with you to fight for our country to fight for our democracy because I believe in democracy.” 
Making voting easier is a straightforward policy for politicians to support, according to Sewell.
“Voting rights, especially among the elected, should not be a partisan issue,” Sewell said at the event. “We should all want, especially as elected officials, our constituents and the people to vote. After all, the vote is your voice in this democracy.”
Sewell is the sponsor of H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021, which establishes new criteria for states to receive preapproval from the U.S. Department of Justice before making changes to laws that affect voting rights. Though the bill passed the House of Representatives on Aug. 24, Senate Republicans blocked passage of the bill in the Senate on Nov. 3.
Warnock has also worked on voting rights legislation in the Senate, co-sponsoring S. 2747, the Freedom to Vote Act. The bill includes several provisions that address voter access and voter registration, such as extending early voting and creating a national voter validation standard. Senate Republicans filibustered the bill Oct. 20.
Voting rights help preserve other democratic rights and are at the core of the U.S. mission, according to Warnock. 
“It’s about the broadening of communities,” Warnock said. “For me, this is deeper than any kind of partisan political argument. I sit here knowing that you won’t win on the face. But that idea of one person, one vote — that’s the covenant that we have with one another as an American people, and we ought to defend it with all of our might.”
Warnock said politicians should push voting rights legislation to restore faith in the American government.
“We’ll keep pushing the issue,” Warnock said. “But I think history will judge us harshly, and it should if we don’t find a way to do something about this. We may well have crossed a Rubicon that will make it difficult for us to set things right for another generation. And so we’ve got to do everything we can to pass both of these bills.”

Collaboration, team-building and restorative justice are central aspects to peacemaking and peacebuilding, former President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos said at a Nov. 18 event. 
The event, titled “The Colombian Peace Agreement 5 Years Later: A Conversation with Juan Manuel Santos,” featured the former president in conversation with Alejandro Werner, founding director of the Georgetown Americas Institute, a university platform that aims to advance research, teaching and impact on policy decisions and challenges in Latin America. The event, which was held in Lohrfink Auditorium, was hosted jointly between the Georgetown Americas Institute; the School of Foreign Service (SFS); the Latin American Policy Association, a policy group in the McCourt School of Public Policy that discusses and debates policies around Latin America; and the Center for Latin American Studies, an SFS research and policy organization focused on the region.
The event falls five years after the signing of the Colombian Final Peace Agreement in November 2016 between Santos and the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which ended over 50 years of violent conflict that killed over 260,000 people and displaced millions more. 
Colombia’s Final Peace Agreement focuses on restorative justice instead of punitive justice, where the victims are centered in the response to the crimes and perpetrators acknowledge responsibility, according to Santos. 
“You don’t send the people that have committed crimes against humanity, war crimes, to jail,” Santos said at the event. “You judge them, you condemn them and you send them to an alternative punishment, which is repairing the victims, and that is exactly what we are doing now. In the process, and this is the first time that this has been done, we put the victims and their rights in the center of the negotiation.”
FARC leaders and others who committed crimes during the war have begun to admit responsibility for human rights abuses, according to Santos. 
“Many of the FARC leaders have recognized that they are responsible for crimes against humanity, war crimes; they have said ‘I’m sorry’ to the victims, and we are in that process,” Santos said. “Difficult process, but it’s a necessary process because that is the way to heal the wounds. It takes time.”
Since the signing of the peace agreement in 2016, multiple ex-FARC leaders have admitted accountability for war crimes, including four former commanders who accepted accusations of crimes against humanity in February 2021. 
The Final Peace Agreement was a significant compromise between the FARC and the Colombian government, as many FARC leaders avoided jail time and some took roles in the government. The Final Peace Agreement guaranteed a minimum of five seats in the senate and five in the lower house for FARC politicians beginning in 2018, causing public backlash. 
To build a successful negotiating team, people from all groups and perspectives should be represented, according to Santos.
“The group that I created was a heterogeneous group that represented the different factors that had usually been against the peace process,” Santos said. “We brought in aspects which were important, including women in the negotiating team, and the indigenous communities and the ethnic aspect.”
With the perspective from indigenous communities and other groups within the country, many of the agreement’s proposals aim to improve sustainability and empowerment, Santos said. 
“That’s why the agreement has an ethnic chapter that has very progressive proposals with the indigenous communities and the Afro-Colombian community, which, if implemented, will solve many of the problems we have right now,” Santos said. “Today, the best thing Colombia can do to contribute to this existential challenge to stop climate change is to empower the indigenous communities to protect the most valuable richness that we have, which is our biodiversity, our Amazon, our water fountains.”
Despite diverse perspectives in the peacemaking process, the agreement faced strong opposition from Colombians and other political parties because of the amnesty granted to many FARC members. The agreement failed in a public referendum in October 2016, less than two months before Santos officially signed it with the FARC.
With many different perspectives within a country, peacemaking is a delicate balance that requires compromise and collaboration, according to Santos. 
“The peace process boils down to where you draw the line between peace and justice,” Santos said. “No matter where you draw that line, somebody would claim that they wanted more justice, or somebody would claim that they wanted more peace.”

Immigration policy is disability policy, panelists said at a Nov. 16 event that explored the intersection of disability, access to health care and immigration in the United States.
At the event titled “Disability and Border Politics” experts examined the intersection of disability, health care and border politics as discussed in “Enforceable Care: Health, Justice, and Latina/o Expressive Culture,” an upcoming book by Julie Minich, a professor at the University of Texas. Minich spoke at the event, followed by a Q&A with Georgetown University professor Emily Francomano, chair of the Spanish and Portuguese department, and professor Jennifer Fink, director of the Program in Disability Studies. The event was hosted by the Program in Disability Studies, the Spanish and Portuguese department and the Women’s and Gender Studies Program.
Storytelling and uplifting the lived experiences of those with disabilities or those immigrating can promote equity in the United States, according to Minich. 
“Literature forces us to re-examine questions we assumed to be settled, like the idea that diabetes is only to be feared or that immigration trauma results only from the act of migration and not the policies that constrain migrants’ lives in the United States,” Minich said at the event. “In doing so, it moves us out of the constraints that shaped our thinking on these crucial issues and pushes us to re-examine them in new ways.”
Latinx artists have told stories of disability and immigration through various forms of literature. ire’ne lara silva is ​​a Chicana feminist poet who details the struggles of living with diabetes in her collection of poems, “Blood Sugar Canto.” Karla Cornejo Villavicencio is an Ecuadorian American writer who shares her experiences as an undocumented immigrant in her book, “The Undocumented Americans.” 
In addition to discussing storytelling, Minich highlighted the history of exclusion that undocumented immigrants, especially those with disabilities, have experienced under U.S. health care policy. 
“How is it that our society has come to deem some people as deserving of health and others as undeserving?” Minich said. “Going back to my opening story about Barack Obama and Joe Wilson, how is it that two politicians on opposite ends of the U.S. political spectrum can agree on the idea that an entire category of person, the undocumented immigrants, should be excluded from a national health care plan.”
In November 2014, former U.S. President Barack Obama failed to provide health care to undocumented individuals in the United States under the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) supported limiting health care on immigrants. Undocumented immigrants, including DACA holders, are still generally ineligible to receive most federal public benefits such as regular Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
According to Minich, U.S. society — and especially the health care system — centers able-bodied individuals and stigmatizes people with disabilities.
“Under a system of compulsory able-bodiedness, behaviors that do not maximize health are not only incomprehensible but subject to punishment,” Minich said. “Those unwilling or unable to perform normative health behaviors are seen not merely as responsible for their own ill health but as a burden on society, a drain on valuable resources, unworthy of care or protection and ultimately disposable.” 
The notion that health is a choice is harmful to individuals with disabilities and can contribute to discrimination, according to Minich.
“When health is construed as the result of so-called good personal choices, motivation, restraints or discipline, those experiencing illness are constructed as indolent, gluttonous and negligent adjectives with a long history in racializing discourse,” Minich said. “In this way, health can function as both an outcome and a source of racial injustice.”
Health care should be expanded, as all of society benefits from collective health, according to Minich.
“Health is not a finite resource that becomes more scarce as more people access it. Instead, health becomes more abundant the more widely it is spread,” Minich said. “Simply put, when everyone in our community is healthier, everyone is healthier.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) proposed a transportation stipend Nov. 8 that would allow qualifying students to receive a stipend for traveling on Metro buses and trains.
Under the proposal, students who commute to an internship in the Washington, D.C. area or students who have expected family contributions of $20,000 or lower would receive a transportation stipend of up to $400 in value. GUSA senators hope this proposal is the first step toward Georgetown University’s implementation of the Metro U-Pass program, which would allow students to receive unlimited free Metro rail and bus rides throughout the D.C. area.
If implemented, the proposal would make Metro services more affordable for students who rely on public transit for work opportunities in and around the District, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Leo Rassieur (COL ’22).
“The stipend proposal, if implemented, would lift some of the financial barriers to participating in internships and other career opportunities that excite people to attend Georgetown,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Promoting public transportation use would also, of course, be a very green approach to this problem.”
In April 2021, GUSA published a referendum calling on the university to adopt the U-Pass program. Ultimately, 84.03% of voting undergraduates voted in favor of implementing the program. After the referendum passed, GUSA leaders sent the referendum to university administrators for approval; however, university officials have not taken any steps to join the program and university officials have not responded to the most recent stipend proposal.
The program, if implemented, would result in an increase in student tuition costs, hindering the university’s inclination to participate in the initiative, according to a university spokesperson.
“Because U-Pass requires enrollment of all students — whether they use the pass or not — and has historically been funded as an addition to student tuition bills with other universities, Georgetown does not currently participate in the program,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The tuition increase presented the biggest barrier to university cooperation when GUSA senators met with administrators to discuss the potential of implementing the program, according to Rowlie Flores (COL ’22), GUSA Senate vice speaker. 
“We received some pushback on not having enough data on student’s usage of public transportation systems in the DC Metro area,” Flores wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Some administrators have also expressed concerns regarding the mandatory fee of $136 that would be charged to every student as the Metro U-Pass program is a universal program with no opt-out option.”
According to Rassieur, the transportation stipend is the best interim solution to students’ transportation needs while the future of the U-Pass program remains uncertain.
“While we’re ultimately pushing for a Metro U-Pass program that would cover all students, we think that having a stipend that would cover low-income students is an important first step that would achieve most of the impact of the broader Metro U-Pass,” Rassieur wrote.
The university will continue to consider the U-Pass program, while also pursuing other transportation options for students, according to a university spokesperson.
“We are pleased to be working with GUSA and GradGov to explore the idea of joining Metro’s U-Pass program,” a university spokesperson wrote. “Student referendums help to express important student perspectives but do not create University policy and are not binding on the University. We are always looking for creative ways to provide our students with transportation options while safeguarding against increases to the cost of attendance.”
Georgetown remains one of the last schools in the District to not participate in the U-Pass program. George Washington University announced Nov. 5 that it will join the Metro U-Pass program, giving students unlimited rides at a cost of $1 per day and becoming the largest university in the District to offer the passes. American University joined the program in 2016, and 26 schools in the D.C. area are currently part of the program. 
Financial barriers should not inhibit student participation in opportunities that require transportation around the District, according to Flores. 
“We hope that the administrators consider our proposal thoughtfully as transportation costs do add up, which sometimes prevents low-income students from partaking in opportunities that complement their academic work on the hilltop,” Flores wrote.
This article was updated Nov. 19 to reflect that university administrators are still actively considering the U-Pass program.

A song honoring the 314 enslaved people sold by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus made its international debut Nov. 5 at a Library of Congress event.
Written over the past three years, “Requiem for the Enslaved” is an approximately 45-minute multigenre musical work written by Carlos Simon, an assistant professor of music at Georgetown University, that features spoken word. The song honors the 314 enslaved people, commonly referred to as the GU272, sold by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus in 1838 to pay off university debts. Simon performed the song, which was funded by the department of performing arts, alongside Hub New Music, a Boston-based classical music group, at the virtual event.
By relaying the story of the GU272 through music, Simon hopes to pay homage to the lives of enslaved people. 
“First and foremost, I really want to honor the lives of the women, men and children that were sold, families that were broken up,” Simon said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “The university owes a large debt to these humans.”
The Georgetown community has been reckoning with its history of slavery in recent years. In April 2019, 66.1% of undergraduate students voted in favor of creating a semesterly fee that would go toward a fund to benefit descendants of the GU272. The referendum drew the highest turnout of voters in Georgetown student government history, but despite the result, the university did not implement the proposal, instead launching an initiative in November 2019 to support research and education efforts surrounding GU272.
In March 2021, the university funded the Descendants Truth & Reconciliation Foundation, which was created in collaboration between descendants and Jesuit leaders and was intended to contribute to racial healing programs and scholarships for the descendants of the GU272. The move was met with pushback from student advocacy groups, however.
During the writing process, Simon researched Georgetown’s history, spending time looking through Georgetown’s archives, talking to descendants of the GU272 and visiting cemeteries where many of the enslaved people are buried. 
In March 2020, Simon also traveled alongside Bernard Cook, associate dean in Georgetown College, and a group of students to visit the former West Oak Plantation in Maringouin, La., where the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus sold some of the 314 enslaved people. Simon’s visit informed his writing process, according to Cook.
Cook said Simon’s song helps listeners engage with the university’s relationship to slavery.
“Prof. Simon’s musical composition and performance create opportunities for connection, communion, and implication,” Cook wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We need to share this new musical work with the campus community and with the descendants communities with whom we are seeking to build and maintain relationships. Much of this work involves listening, and Prof. Simon’s ‘Requiem’ can help us to hear differently.”
Simon’s song offers listeners the chance to commemorate the 314 enslaved people in a personal way, according to Adam Rothman, history professor and principal curator of the Georgetown Slavery Archive, an ongoing project that is part of the university’s Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation initiative.
“I believe the goal of the Requiem is to honor the lives of the GU272 and other enslaved people who built early America,” Rothman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Professor Simon is drawing from a venerable religious and musical tradition. It’s essentially a prayer for them to rest in peace. But they will not be at peace until we are.”
During the Library of Congress performance, Simon played the piano while Marco Pavé, the first hip-hop artist in residence at Georgetown University, performed the work’s spoken word.
The Library of Congress’ presentation of Simon’s song allowed its message to reach a national audience, according to Rothman.
“It shows that Georgetown’s history has tremendous resonance outside of our own campus, and to have it embraced by our leading national cultural and educational institutions is deeply affirming of the work that many people at Georgetown and beyond have been doing,” Rothman wrote.
According to Simon, the experience of writing the work enriched his understanding of Georgetown’s history of slavery.
“I learned about how Georgetown sold slaves, and that as a Black man really stuck with me. Also, I had a lot of admiration for the university coming forward and saying that we did this, and we are not proud of this, but it is a part of our history,” Simon said.

The Georgetown University Law Center announced a record-breaking $56 million in donations over the past year, marking the highest amount in gifts received by the school.
The donations will help to finance scholarship programs, expand teaching and professional opportunities and upgrade Law Center facilities. The school previously recorded its largest amount of donations and gifts in 2019 when it received $40 million in fundraising.
Even with the transition to virtual fundraising events due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, people were still motivated to support the school, according to William Treanor, dean of the Law Center.
“When the pandemic started we quickly pivoted to all virtual programming,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We had over 61,000 people participate in our programming during the year, which was extraordinary.”
The successful year of fundraising will have an impact on all aspects of the Law Center, including subsidizing faculty positions, campus facility upgrades and scholarship funding, according to Treanor.
As part of the Law Center’s fundraising efforts, the school launched several initiatives. To celebrate its 150th anniversary, the Law Center launched a special campaign to secure 150 gifts of $150,000 or more, which closed on July 1, 2021 after exceeding its goal by securing 155 gifts.
Included in the past year’s donations is the school’s largest gift to date, a $24.5 million contribution from the estate of Agnes Williams (LAW ’54), who graduated in the first class of Georgetown Law which included women and was a past member of the Law Center Board of Directors. The gift will fund the Agnes Williams Sesquicentennial Professorships, an endowment that will allow Georgetown Law to hire and retain outstanding professors. 
Frequent donors Timothy O’Neill (LAW ’77), who serves as Vice Chair for of the Board of Directors, and Linda O’Neill (NHS ’77), who is a member of the Board of Regents, donated another $10 million gift to establish the Center for Transformational Health Law, which focuses on the legal and policy impact of the COVID-19. The Center is housed within the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, which was founded in 2007.
The donation will allow the O’Neill Institute to continue research and engage with health issues, according to Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
“On behalf of Georgetown, I wish to express our deep appreciation for the generosity and leadership of Agnes Williams and Tim and Linda O’Neill — who have each enabled us to deepen the context for our faculty to pursue groundbreaking research and scholarship and contribute to advancing justice in our world,” DeGioia wrote in a press release. 
Another important focus of fundraising over the past year has been raising money to support student scholarships and financial aid at the Law Center, according to Treanor. Over the past year, the school’s annual fund, which distributes aid to students through a range of programs, received $8.2 million in donations. 
The Opportunity Scholarship program, which provides aid to students who otherwise might not have been able to attend Georgetown, received significant donations, according to Gene Finn, assistant dean for development and alumni affairs and one of the coordinators for the Opportunity Scholarship campaign. 
“The Opportunity Scholarship program has been a high priority for Dean Treanor because it allows outstanding students to attend Georgetown Law who, without the financial aid, may not have been able to be here,” Finn wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our alumni have been very excited to support the program and to meet the students who benefit from their philanthropy.”
The Opportunity Scholarship program, which currently has 110 participants, began six years ago and has raised $22 million to support high-need and high-merit students at Georgetown Law. 
The large amount of donations represents Law Center graduates’ commitment to supporting students, according to Treanor.
“Our alumni responded with their typical generous spirit and helped us meet the needs of these students,” Treanor wrote.

The McCourt Institute appointed Shéhérazade Semsar-de Boisséson (SFS ’90) Nov. 10 as its first executive director. 
Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy joined with the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po) in June 2021 to found the McCourt Institute, which was created to promote ethical technological innovation. The Institute builds on Georgetown’s Tech & Society initiative, an initiative between all of Georgetown’s nine schools focused on research, driving policy change and improving education around technology. 
Semsar’s experience in technological development and infrastructure will allow her to make significant contributions in the field of technological ethics to the McCourt Institute, according to Frank McCourt (CAS ’75), who funded the Institute’s partnership with Sciences Po.
“We are thrilled to welcome Shéhérazade to the McCourt Institute and grateful for the expertise, enthusiasm, and leadership skills that she brings to her role as our first executive director,” McCourt wrote in a statement. “She understands that, to solve the urgent and systemic problems that today’s tech infrastructure is fueling, we need interdisciplinary thinkers working hand-in-hand with technologists to infuse ethics into technology and creating a workable plan for good digital governance.”
Semsar previously served as the founding CEO of Politico Europe, and will now further the institute’s goal of enhancing digital governance, online tools establishing authority and accountability in an organization, and technological ethics through research and engagement with policymakers and academics.  
Frank McCourt’s March 2021 $100 million donation granted funding to scholarships, financial aid and research. Of these funds, $25 million were directly distributed to support the university’s initiatives with the McCourt Institute. This marks Frank McCourt’s second donation to Georgetown University; in 2013, Frank McCourt donated the same amount to found the McCourt school.
The Institute will work to improve ethics in technology and development and form a framework for the use of technology in government, according to Semsar. 
“Despite technology’s many benefits, it’s clear that today’s tech structure is driving negative outcomes; this is a global problem, not just a U.S. or European problem,” Semsar wrote in the press release. “I look forward to working with great minds across countries and disciplines to create a much-needed governance framework and help put us on this better path.” 
During her work at Politico, Semsar helped launch the organization’s annual Artificial Intelligence Innovation and Governance Summit, which gathers leaders from around the world to discuss AI standards. Semsar continues to serve on the Georgetown School of Foreign Service Advisory Board, and also served on Georgetown’s Board of Directors from 2013 to 2019.
The partnership with Sciences Po was made possible by McCourt’s $100 million donation to the McCourt Institute, according to McCourt School Dean Maria Cancian. 
“One of the key elements of Frank McCourt’s extraordinary second $100 Million investment in the McCourt School was support for our partnership with the McCourt Institute,” Cancian wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Semsar’s extensive background in technology and digital advancement and experience with leadership at Politico will allow her to think interdisciplinarily about the institute’s work, according to Frank McCourt. 
“Shéhérazade’s deep international experience leading industry shifts and tackling big challenges makes her the perfect person to advance the goals of Project Liberty and spearhead the critical work of the institute,” Frank McCourt wrote. 
With Semsar’s appointment, the McCourt School will continue to engage with the institute’s projects and research, according to Cancian. 
“The appointment of Shéhérazade Semsar-de-Boisséson as the inaugural executive director of the Institute is a great step forward,” Cancian wrote. “Semsar is a Georgetown alum and former board member, with a deep appreciation for public policy and a keen understanding of both US and international dynamics. We look forward to engaging with her in the Institute’s important work.”

Following a current pilot program, Georgetown University will introduce a three-week disability ethics module into “Intro to Ethics” course syllabi.
A three-week disability ethics module is being piloted in a bioethics course taught by Margaret Little, philosophy professor and director of Georgetown’s Ethics Lab. The module includes discussion sections and lectures centered on disability studies, as well as readings that focus on the lived experiences of people with disabilities. After Little completes the pilot module, additional professors will introduce the module into their courses. The module was designed through collaboration between the Georgetown University Ethics Lab and the disability studies program. 
The module’s content will engage students in the intersection of disability studies with the fields of justice and philosophy, according to Little.
“It’s a really interesting topic for exploring the human condition in general, how we feel about dependency, vulnerability and difference, and different ways of having bodies and minds in the world, and then also the very real and insistent issues that people with disabilities in this society often face as barriers and what justice asks us to do in the face of that,” Little said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
Jenae Ruesch (LAW ’09) and Matt Ruesch (COL ’02, LAW ’09) also made a $100,000 donation to the module, which helped pilot the module and will assist the university with developing the module for other undergraduate courses. The module will include classroom instruction and breakout group exercises. After it is incorporated into courses, the module will later be redeveloped and expanded across the undergraduate humanities departments as well as into courses at the Georgetown University Law Center.
Jennifer Natalya Fink, director of the disability studies program, wrote that examining disability studies in an ethics course will give students an introduction to exploring the field.
“By exploring the complexities of disability and the ethical issues it entails, this module will help prepare our students to create a more equitable and inclusive society, especially around this crucial vector of difference,” Fink wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The Ethics Lab and disability studies program worked together to select a range of course materials that reflect lived experiences of disabled people, according to Little.
“The readings are a combination of essays from people living with disabilities and across a huge diversity and a huge range of disabilities,” Little said. “This is included together with theories from disability studies, which are often written by theorists who have disabilities or who have close experience with people living with disabilities.”
The university began offering the disability studies minor in 2017. The introduction of the program came after three years of advocacy by the Disability Studies Minor Working Group.
The Ruesch donation will help the Ethics Lab access resources needed to build the module and expand it to a variety of undergraduate courses, according to Little.
“One of the great things that’s come out of the gift is that it helped to support us reaching out to other faculty who teach disability studies, especially in the philosophy department, because it’s a philosophy course,” Little said. 
Georgetown students should learn about barriers that students with disabilities face, according to Matt Ruesch, who is also a current member of the board of regents, a group of advisers that provides financial support and counsel to the university’s leadership. 
“This is the type of philanthropy that I find really exciting because it’s working with very effective people on a very meaningful mission and watching that small seed grow into something much bigger,” Matt Ruesch said in a video Georgetown posted to YouTube.
The Ruesch family previously made a donation in support of the Ethics Lab’s work in fall 2020 that helped create the “Religion and Disability Studies” course, which worked with the Ethics Lab to create a space for students to analyze accessibility in sacred spaces.
While this pilot is the first time that this module will be taught to students, Little says this work will expand to more students and courses in the future.
“The aim is to build something that’s a resource available to other faculty, and we’re also networking with faculty to continue to grow the ecosystem here in really cool ways,” Little said.
