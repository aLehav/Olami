An Israeli flag and a Palestinian flag, both hung in Red Square as part of pro-Palestine group Students for Justice in Palestine’s Israel Apartheid Week, were removed multiple times between April 3 and April 8, culminating in the Georgetown University Police Department apprehending one of the perpetrators who stole the Israeli flag.
GUPD concluded their investigation of the incidents, according to Matt Hill, the university’s media relations manager.
“GUPD has concluded investigations of all incidents reported to GUPD and made appropriate referrals to Student Conduct. The university also received bias-related incident reports which are being reviewed by the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity & Affirmative Action accordingly. We encourage anyone with information about these incidents to contact GUPD at 202-687-4343 or via LiveSafe. GUPD will increase foot patrol and surveillance in areas with planned activity,”” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Israel Apartheid Week is an annual protest on college campuses that aims to raise awareness of the continued Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
A Palestinian flag, hung in Red Square on April 1, was taken down once on April 3 and again on April 6 by unknown individuals, resulting in SJP filing two bias-related incident reports with the university. Members of both SJP and the Georgetown Israel Alliance have called on the university to take a stronger stance on incidents that infringe on the rights of student groups to demonstrate in Red Square.
GIA has filed five incident reports with GUPD regarding the theft of the Israeli flag. GIA President Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20), who is also a member of The Hoya’s editorial board, said the Israeli flag was taken down on five separate occasions on April 3, April 4, April 6 and twice on April 8.
GIA Cultural Chair Andrew Boas (SFS ’20), who witnessed the most recent theft of the Israeli flag, said GUPD may classify the thefts as bias-related incidents through the Division of Student Affairs as GUPD pushes for punishment for the suspect.
GUPD has not identified a suspect for the theft of the Palestinian flag, according to SJP Treasurer Olivia Vita (COL ’19).
GUPD did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment on Boas’ and Vita’s statements as of 1:30 a.m.
SJP President Ahmad Al-Husseini (NHS ’20) and Vita both said the Georgetown Program Board removed both flags to post their flyers for its April 6 spring concert, featuring rapper Waka Flocka Flame.
After the Palestinian flag was hung once more in another location in Red Square, it was torn down along with Israel Apartheid Week fact sheets, according to Al-Husseini.
Al-Husseini said SJP chose to hang the Palestinian flag in a display of solidarity with those injured and killed in recent protests on Gaza’s border with Israel and as part of SJP’s Israel Apartheid Week, which is organized to draw attention to the 70 years of Palestinian popular resistance against the continued conflict in the Israel-Palestine region since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.
“We hung the Palestinian flag on Sunday out of solidarity and support for that weekend’s events in Gaza,” Al-Husseini wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians protested along the Gaza Strip on March 30 against Israel’s and Egypt’s continued blockade of Gaza since 2007, according to the New York Times.
The protests, which involved around 30,000 people, aimed to stage a peaceful sit-in for six weeks before protesters were met with Israeli military force. Health ministry officials from Gaza said 34 Palestinians had been killed in an escalation of violence between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protestors, with thousands more wounded, including 293 by live fire, according to Al-Jazeera.
The United Nations Human Rights Council said it has evidence that Israeli forces used “excessive force” during last week’s crackdown, according to The Independent.
Anti-Palestinian sentiments were posted on the wall near the Palestinian flag and on social media shortly after the Palestinian flag went up, Al-Husseini said.
“Less than two hours later, the GIA put up an Israel flag right next to it with individuals responsible for this writing captions such as ‘clap back season’ and other disrespectful captions on social media,” Al-Husseini wrote.
The Georgetown Israel Alliance hung the Israeli flag beside the Palestinian flag to protest the Israel Apartheid Week, according to Boas.
“GIA put up the Israeli flag in response to Israel Apartheid Week, a week-long series of events planned by SJP with the purpose of denying Israel’s right to exist,” Boas wrote. “We feel that the Israeli flag, along with our banner advocating for two-sided dialogue, was a good way to remind Georgetown that we too are on campus and are always willing to dialogue.”
GIA is a pro-Israel group that supports bilateral dialogue and believes in Israel’s right to exist. Boas said that Israel Apartheid Week is a clear denial of Israel’s right to exist.
“The issue with Israel Apartheid Week is that it’s an absolute one-sided denial of Israel’s right to exist,” Boas wrote. “Students For Justice in Palestine goes to great lengths to explain that it is actually about Palestine and not Israel. It’s not an attack on Israel; it’s a protection of Palestine, when in reality we can tell, even by the name of the event Israel Apartheid Week, that it’s an attack on Israel that has no basis on history or reality.”
Vita said there are instances of personal harassment and other anti-Palestinian acts such as theft of Palestinian flags every year.
Boas said GIA has also faced harassment in the past. Boas referenced an incident in March last year when signs with American support for the existence of Israel were defaced.
“They were just pro-Israel messages of peace and coexistence. They were flyers that had been distributed and torn down and also things were written on them that were offensive,” Boas said.
Al-Husseini called on the university to take a stronger stance against the thefts of the Israeli and Palestinian flags, asking them to release a statement condemning the actions.
“These events have become far too common place and do not attract enough attention, as it goes directly against Georgetown’s free speech rights,” Al-Husseini wrote. “Red Square is such a cherished space because it is central to our campus’s idea of promoting free speech and I hate to see these type of vandalism on all sides, so I hope to see the campus issue a formal response to these far too common-place incidents.”
Boas also called for a statement from the university in response to the thefts.
“The university absolutely should issue a statement saying that discrimination or crimes on the basis of national identity, in this case Israeli identity, are obviously condemned by the university and unacceptable in much the same way that they did a statement when swastikas were drawn in LXR,” Boas said.
Hill said Georgetown remains committed to tolerance and the administration supports free speech on campus.
“As a Catholic and Jesuit university, Georgetown is an inclusive community that supports the free and open exchange of ideas and welcomes people of all faiths and racial and ethnic backgrounds. Georgetown does not tolerate actions, including theft or vandalism, that attempt to silence the speech of our community,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Two sides, one state and no justice says 
April 13, 2018 at 2:15 am
It seems a bit odd for this news story to allow anyone from SJP to comment on  GIA’s assertion that Georgetown SJP doesn’t accept Israel’s right to exist. GIA would have us believe that criticizing Israeli policy is ultimately about denying the right of Israel to exist full stop. If Al-Husseini or Vita actually believe that, let’s hear it. A return to 1967 lines is not denying Israel’s right to exist. Demanding political and economic freedom for Palestinians is not demanding that Israel be pushed into the sea.

A bill that would allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in Washington, D.C. elections for local and federal elections was introduced in the D.C. Council by Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) on Tuesday.
If passed, the bill would allow 16 and 17-year-old D.C. residents to cast ballots not only for local candidates, but for president and the District’s nonvoting representative in Congress. The bill would make D.C. the first municipality in the country to allow this age group to vote in all elections.
Advocates say the bill already has the support of a majority of council members, as it was introduced by seven members of the 13-member council, including Allen and Councilmembers Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Trayon White, Sr. (D-Ward 8), Robert White Jr. (D-At Large), David Grosso (I-At Large), Anita Bonds (D-At Large) and Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7).
Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) has also voiced her support for the bill, according to Allen’s communications director, Erik Salmi.
Allen said it makes sense to give 16-year-olds a voice in the legal process because they already receive several important legal responsibilities by that age, including the ability to drive, work and pay taxes.
“Ironically, they pay fees to get a license plate that reads ‘Taxation Without Representation.’ I think it’s time to change that,” Allen said in an April 10 news release.
Three Maryland cities – Takoma Park, Greenbelt and Hyattsville – already allow 16-year-olds to vote only in local elections. Legislators in Virginia and New York have proposed similar legislation, but neither state has voted on the issue, according to Brandon Klugman, campaign coordinator of Vote16USA, a group that advocates voting rights for minors.
Decreasing the voting age in the District would also increase voter turnout later in life by getting people involved in the political process at a young age, Klugman said in an interview with The Hoya.
“We know that voting is a habit, and 16 is a much better time to establish that habit than 18,” Klugman said. “So if D.C. were to extend voting rights to 16 and 17-year-olds, it would go a long way to make sure that young people in D.C. vote in the first election they’re eligible for, and then establish voting as a habit and become lifelong voters and active citizens.”
In November 2015, Allen introduced a similar bill that failed to pass. This time around, Allen said recent activism among young people, particularly in the gun control movement after February’s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., may push this iteration of the bill to success.
“It’s pretty hard for anyone to watch the events of the last couple of months and not understand the pure power and maturity of incredibly young voices,” Allen said in an April 10 article from The Washington Post.
In addition to support from several councilmembers, the bill has been backed by many local and national organizations including the Young Women’s Project, a D.C. organization working to build youth leadership through civic engagement and education about important issues such as sexual health.
Alik Schier, a 16-year-old youth advocate for the Young Women’s Project and sophomore at Woodrow Wilson High School in Northwest D.C., said granting 16-year-olds voting rights is necessary to ensure the group is properly represented.
“I work in a restaurant so I pay local and income taxes, and the mayor and the D.C. council get to decide not only how to spend that money, but I get to pay those people sitting in office,” Schier said in an interview with The Hoya. “I don’t really think that’s fair. I get to pay them and they get to spend my money, so why don’t I get to vote for who I want to do that?”
Takoma Park, a small town in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, D.C., became the first city in the United States to allow 16-year-olds to vote in local elections in May 2013. Since the law was passed, the city has seen high voter turnout among the youngest demographic, according to Takoma Park Mayor Kate Stewart (I).
“When we look at the percentage of registered voters who actually turn out — people who register to vote and then actually do vote — that our 16 and 17-year-olds actually turn out at higher numbers than older voters,” Stewart said in an interview with The Hoya.
Hyattsville has seen similar success in voter turnout among 16 and 17-year-old voters since granting them suffrage in 2015. In the one election the city has held since granting these rights, the percentage of voter turnout in this age group was double that of previously eligible high school residents, according to Hyattsville Mayor Candace Hollingsworth (D).
“That’s one of the things we were particularly happy about, because they’re registering and they’re voting, which is the most important part,” Hollingsworth said in an interview with The Hoya.
The bill has been referred to the Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety for debate.

Pure stupidity. These kids don’t have a full education let alone mature experiences to refer to. Not allowed to own a firearm, can’t smoke or even drink alcohol yet you want them to vote?! Do these elected officials have a brain anymore. They aren’t qualified to make educated decisions. Is it all that potential of new liberal voters that has DC officials giddy to push this bill through. Why not lower the voting age to 10 or 11!

JoeHoya says 
April 18, 2018 at 1:02 pm
This is a brazen attempt to skew the electorate towards more liberal, younger voters. Why DC would feel the need to do this, with 97% of the district already voting for Democratic candidates in every election anyway, is beyond me.

Reporting on sexual assault and harassment can not only expose predators, but also combat systemic injustice, Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter Megan Twohey (COL ’98) explained at an event in Lohrfink Auditorium on Tuesday.
At an event titled “Breaking Weinstein,” hosted by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, Twohey spoke about her work with The New York Times’ Jodi Kantor reporting the dozens of sexual assault allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein, co-founder of Miramax and the Weinstein Company.
Twohey, who has worked at publications like The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune, has also reported on systemic mishandling of rape kits as evidence in Illinois police departments and the multiple sexual assault allegations against President Donald Trump during the presidential election of 2016.
In October, The New York Times published accountsof nearly three decades of previously undisclosed sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein. Over 80 women, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Rose McGowan, accused Weinstein of harassment and rape in the days following the initial report, which spurred the start of the viral #MeToo movement that highlighted the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, particularly in the workplace.
The phrase “Me Too”was initially employed by Tarana Burke, a civil rights activist who began using it to raise awareness of the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and assault in society. Time named Burke, among a group of other prominent female activists dubbed “the silence breakers,” the Time Person of the Year for 2017.
Twohey said she believes journalism can empower the public to become engaged with issues related to sexual violence.
“I really have found — and it’s one of the reasons I’m so committed to journalism, and the due diligence, and the gathering of the facts and making sure you apply fairness and accuracy to the reporting,” Twohey said, “When you do that, you do bring about change and open people’s eyes and get people to care.”
Twohey said that, though there was doubt about the impact the story would have, she remained determined to continue reporting on it.
“When we started our investigation, Jodi and I heard over and over that even if we succeeded, no one would care. Everyone knows men behave like this in Hollywood and elsewhere. Even if we were able to publish our story, it wouldn’t make a difference. They were wrong,” Twohey said. “Three days after our first story, Weinstein was fired. What’s happened in the past six months, you know, men in a variety of industries were exposed as predators and ejected from their jobs. There was a genuine shift in power, a collective strength in women’s voices.”
Even though Weinstein and his public influence intimidated many of his alleged victims into silence, Twohey said past survivors laid the foundation on which she could build the story.
“The settlement trail and these other internal company records were so significant. They created a safer platform for women to go on the record with their stories of harassment and abuse,” Twohey said. “What happened next is well-known. Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and countless other women shared their stories in the pages of The New York Times, others in The New Yorker. It was remarkable.”
Twohey said the Weinstein investigations led to a flood of new allegations of sexual assault that garnered unprecedented attention.
“What started off as sort of a small group of reporters doing sexual harassment coverage at The New York Times [as] primarily investigative reporters expanded into a whole army of reporters that stretched into our culture department where people who cover Hollywood and the entertainment industry,” Twohey said.
Despite the public reaction against Weinstein and the emergence of the #MeToo movement in response, Twohey said that the biggest implications of the Weinstein story still require attention.
“The moral horror of the Weinstein story was that he was able to allegedly pray on countless women year after year for four decades and that other individuals and institutions enabled his behavior,” Twohey said.
Weinstein succeeded in avoiding prosecution because of systemic complicity, which included that of his brother, the board and human resources department of the Weinstein company, talent agents and journalists who sought to use his public influence, Twohey said.
“Some aided his actions without realizing what he was doing. Many knew something or detected hints, though few understood the scale of his sexual misconduct. Almost everyone had incentives to look the other way,” Twohey said.
Other prominent figures in the media industry have fallen from grace, as accusations of sexual misconduct circulated in the aftermath of the #MeToo movement. Matt Lauer, co-host of NBC’s “Today,” was fired after allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior in November, and television host Charlie Rose was fired by CBS after allegations of sexual harassment and lewd phone calls in November.
Twohey said though bringing the actions of predators to public attention is important, she hopes in the coming year, reporting will shift to focus on the systems that allow for sexual misconduct in the first place.
“It’s so important, especially when you’re doing investigative journalism, to move beyond the individual predator to the institution and the individuals who enabled that to happen,” Twohey said. “As we’re learning more about that — the failed HR departments and these flawed settlements that locked women into silence so they could never, ever say what happened to them — I think that we’re starting to see some of the systemic failures that occurred.”
Twohey said that she is dedicated to reporting on sexual misconduct because she believes that journalism can inspire people to care about the issue.
“You can be sure that I’m going to continue to be reporting on it, with a belief that people — if you do respect the facts — that people will care,” Twohey said.

President Donald Trump’s unconventional governing style has led to conflicts within his administration but ultimately contributed to his success, former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said at an event hosted Tuesday evening by Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service.
At the event, Priebus acknowledged his attempt to maintain order as the chief of staff in Trump’s White House was often thwarted by Trump’s loose managerial style.
“He likes to stay loose and see what happens and make decisions by putting people around him on a particular subject that don’t agree with each other,” Priebus said. “He wants the smartest people to fight it out, and then he makes a decision. And I think the decisions have been good.”
Priebus spoke on Trump’s political philosophy and unorthodox governing style in an event in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room. The event was moderated by GU Politics Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) and former Trump White House Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh Shields, a GU Politics fellow.
Priebus cited Trump’s accomplishments, which appeal to his Republican base, as evidence his unconventional leadership style has not impeded his success.
“You have the tax cuts, you’ve got the Supreme Court and you have a total deregulation and a dismantling of almost everything that Obama did by executive order,” Priebus said. “Those, if you’re a Republican, are great things. The decisions that he’s made have made him a pretty historic president in only a year.”
Priebus acknowledged Trump is, in some ways, not like any other Republican president. Trump is “extremely unique” in his personal style, Priebus said, and his campaign themes refocused the Republican Party on a populist message.
“President Trump’s been very good for the party in the sense that it’s returned to the idea that the American workers are worth fighting for. That we’re not about Wall Street — we’re about people that are making tools and working with their hands and have been forgotten,” Priebus said.
However, Priebus also said the president’s actions in office fall in line with the conventional Republican Party ideals of restraining the federal government.
“Look at what the president did in the first few weeks through executive order, forcing every department to look at itself and cut out wasteful regulations and wasteful spending, to reduce its size, to have a hiring freeze,” Priebus said. “That’s the type of care and feeding that someone like me would actually see as caring for big institutions.”
Discussing Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election, Priebus said the campaign won in part by reaching out to minority communities and staying faithful to the Republican Party’s traditional base.
“The president and the campaign funded an operation on the ground in Hispanic, black and Asian communities for not just a six-month period before the election, but for four straight years,” Priebus said. “It’s just a fact of life that you cannot grow a party by subtracting people out the door.”
Trump performed slightly better with minority voters than the last Republican nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, did in the 2012 election. However, Trump also received widespread condemnation for inflammatory rhetoric concerning immigrants, saying of Mexican immigrants in a June 2015 speech launching his campaign: “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”
But despite all that is different about Trump, Priebus said not much is different about the Republican Party or the country than before Trump landed in the political arena. He said much of the media narrative about Trump is overstated.
The Trump administration will not redefine the political positions of the Republican Party permanently, Priebus said.
“I think post-Trump, the party returns to its traditional role and its traditional platform. It’s a Trump brand and he owns it and he has a way of protecting it,” Priebus said.

Please, Mr. Priebus, don’t insult us. Your con is no more persuasive than that of Trump’s.

Georgetown University Right to Life, a student group that advocates on issues of human life including opposition to abortion and the death penalty, celebrated its annual Life Week April 8 to 14 to encourage discourse on pro-life issues ranging from the death penalty to abortion.
The student group hosted six events throughout the week, each focusing on a different aspect of what it means to be “pro-life.” The events included a talk on ableism; a bake sale to raise funds for the Northwest Center, a center founded by Georgetown alumni to support mothers and pregnant women in need to preserve the dignity of human life; and a screening of “I Lived on Parker Avenue,” a pro-adoption movie.
GU Right to Life President Havens Clark (COL ’20) said the diversity of issues discussed during Life Week go far beyond the anti-abortion stance the group is often associated with.
“During Life Week, we try to focus on a number of the aspects of the pro-life movement that our club supports, but we usually aren’t known for,” Clark wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Life Week has featured a bake sale to benefit a pregnancy center every year since it was established. However, the film screening, discussion events, diaper drive and Flag Day —  which used a visual display to depict the magnitude of abortion in the United States — differed from previous years’ programming.
In a talk titled “What is Ableism?” Dawn Parkot, a speaker and disability rights advocate, spoke about the connections between the pro-life movement and disability. Parkot was born with cerebral palsy, a neural condition that affects motor function. Parkot studied computer science and mathematics at the University of Notre Dame.
The talk focused on the ways the disabled community is discriminated against in the United States, the high abortion rate of fetuses with genetic disorders and Parkot’s own story of living a full, meaningful life.
Life Week typically features a film screening, but the movie and its theme vary each year. This year, the group showed “I Lived on Parker Avenue,” a documentary that depicts the reunion between an adopted man and his biological parents and promotes adoption.
A signature Life Week event, Flag Day incorporated a visual display to showcase the frequency of abortion. The group placed 2,537 flags on Copley Lawn to represent the number of abortions that take place each day in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank.
Nicholas Cote, who sits on the board of directors for Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, discussed the conservative case against the death penalty on Wednesday evening’s talk.
Melvin Thomas (COL ’18), vice president of Right to Life, said the talk offered a different narrative concerning conservatives’ opinions about the death penalty.
“Typically, people think of conservatives as pro-death penalty, so we thought it’d be interesting to have a conservative speak against it,” Thomas said.
Though the first half of the week spotlighted discussion of pro-life issues, the second half of the week was centered on action, according to Clark.
“Life Week also has a large service component to it,” Clark wrote.
The group is also running a diaper drive on Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. to benefit HOPE, a pregnancy resource center in northern Virginia. Right to Life members plan to go to Safeway and ask customers to purchase diapers and baby formula to donate to the campaign.
The diversity of topics covered in Life Week 2018 reflect Thomas and Clark’s goals for Right to Life. Thomas said the pair have tried to explore a wider range of pro-life issues.
“Our theme for this year was basically centered around overcoming or dispelling misconceptions about the pro-life movement,” Thomas said.
As Life Week comes to a close, Thomas said he was pleased with the diversity of the week’s events.
“It’s a really great time especially as the year ends for members to see the full plethora of things we do as a club, between our service events, our speaker events, and our social events,” Thomas said. “It’s a great time for people just to see everything we do.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the number of flags placed on Copley Lawn and Clark’s school.

An unused streetcar bridge in Glover-Archbold Park in danger of collapse may be demolished by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, raising concerns from local historical preservation advocates.
The streetcar line that the bridge supports used to service an amusement park in the area until Washington, D.C.’s streetcar service was halted in the 1960s. Since then, the bridge has fallen into disrepair; WMATA, which opens the bridge, worries it may soon collapse, endangering pedestrians who use the footpath below.
Concern over the soundness of the bridge prompted inspections that found “several structural deficiencies,” leading WMATA to plan for demolition, according to WMATA spokeswoman Sherri Ly.
The bridge, called the Foundry Branch Trolley Trestle, is one of just two bridges left standing from the old trolley line that linked the Georgetown neighborhood and Glen Echo, Md., according to the D.C. Preservation League website. The organization describes the structure as “one of the few remaining early transportation bridges in the city.”
The D.C. Preservation League, a group that advocates for the maintenance and restoration of historical sites in the District, has voiced concerns over the expected demolition. D.C. Preservation League Executive Director Rebecca Miller said in an interview with The Hoya that the bridge’s condition amounts to “demolition by neglect,” after WMATA made little effort to stabilize the bridge since acquiring it in the 1990s.
The District Department of Transportation has offered to conduct a study on possible methods to stabilize the trestle without destroying it. However, WMATA filed an application for demolition without waiting for the results of the study.
“DDOT has offered to do a study on keeping the trestle and [assessing] its current condition, and WMATA’s response to that was to file this application for demolition,” Miller said in an April 5 WTOP article. “So, we don’t see that as working in good faith with the other parties involved.”
However, Ly said WMATA has made efforts in the past to save the bridge by transferring the property, but no other group has taken it on.
“Over the past several years, WMATA has explored many options to transfer the bridge to other parties, without success,” Ly wrote in an email to The Hoya.
WMATA has other more pressing budgetary concerns and has done what it can to try to save the bridge, according to Ly; now it is up to other groups or agencies to save the bridge if they choose.
“WMATA’s highest priority is repairing its own system that is facing a $15 billion backlog of construction and maintenance needs as a result of deferred maintenance,” Ly wrote. “Repairing the WMATA system is critical to ensure safety for those who ride us every day.”
WMATA may face legal challenge regarding the expedited push for demolition, according to Miller.
“Also, under the [D.C. Historic] Preservation Act, there is a requirement to show alternatives to demolition, and obviously WMATA has not looked at that, given that DDOT hasn’t had the opportunity to do their study yet,” Miller said in the April 5 WTOP article.
The bridge sits within the Glover-Archbold Park Historic Area, making the Preservation Act applicable, according to Miller. The park contains an expansive trail system, into which preservation advocates say the trestle could be incorporated as an alternative to simply tearing it down.
“We recognize that WMATA has other priorities with regard to the rail system,” Miller said in an interview with The Hoya. “However, they do have this piece of infrastructure that could be incorporated and made into a very interesting piece of history for the city.”
While WMATA has filed for a permit for the demolition, that permit has not yet been granted. Despite the filing, DDOT still plans to carry out the study on the feasibility of alternatives.
A public hearing on the issue with the Historic Preservation Review Board is scheduled for May 24.

The dismantling of social safety net programs and federal agencies under President Donald Trump’s administration has disproportionately harmed working-class women, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said at an event hosted Tuesday evening by Georgetown University’s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor.
DeLauro, the U.S. Representative for Connecticut’s third district since 1991 and a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, expressed her concerns over the Trump administration’s dismantling of the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Department of Agriculture.
“We are witnessing the hollowing out of our federal agencies,” DeLauro said. “In my view, this is a fundamental failure to govern.”
The congresswoman also warned that the administration is specifically targeting social safety net programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, social security and unemployment compensation.
“Social safety net programs make sure that children are not punished for their parents’ poverty and that they do not go hungry,” DeLauro said at the event.
The event was cosponsored by the Georgetown College Democrats, the Georgetown Women’s Alliance, the Georgetown Solidarity Committee and the Georgetown University Office of Federal Relations.
DeLauro’s office released a congressional report in March arguing that regulations withdrawn during Trump’s presidency are “destroying government programs and policies critical to protecting and advancing women’s economic security, health care, education and quality of life.” DeLauro cites regulations that decreased nursing home protections for seniors, decreased overtime pay for minimum-wage workers and limited women’s access to anti-hunger programs.
For DeLauro, the rollbacks of the social safety programs put vulnerable American populations at risk as they will not receive any assistance or care from the government.
“I cannot overstate the chilling effect this will have on the American public,” DeLauro said. “It’s crippling the ability of government to serve people and families.”
DeLauro noted that although social safety net programs have been threatened in the past, the Trump administration and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) are putting such programs at particularly high risk.
“It is, today — with President Trump and Speaker Ryan — the most massive assault on the social safety net that we have seen,” DeLauro said.
Support for social safety net programs was not always partisan as it is today, DeLauro said. She cited bipartisan support after World War II for programs to help Americans who had fallen on tough times.
“When it came to these programs, real leaders on both sides of the aisle put people in need before politics,” DeLauro said. “There were men and women who understood why they were elected to the United States Congress.”
Following the election of former president Ronald Reagan in 1980, however, tax cuts created a deficit that laid the groundwork for the current administration’s stance on social safety net programs, according to DeLauro.
“Today, the tax bill that was passed sets the stage for Speaker Ryan and President Trump to slash the very social safety net programs that were once met with bipartisan support,” DeLauro said.
DeLauro said that the Republican tax reform bill signed into law by Trump last December, which lowered the corporate income tax by 14 percent and the top individual income tax rate by 2.6 percent, prioritizes the wealthy over social programs.
“This is the ugly truth of the Republican tax law — giving money to the wealthy through tax cuts — and they’re going to gut the programs that help hardworking Americans,” DeLauro said.
Rather than looking for ways to decrease the gender wage gap or increase protections for working-class families, the Trump administration is looking to make it more difficult for the working class to access services that could help them, DeLauro said.
“Destroying government programs and policies is about playing fast and loose with people’s economic security, healthcare, education, quality of life,” DeLauro said.
Instead of harming women and the working class, DeLauro said, Congress should be hoisting them up.
“We are fighting for the soul of this country, and everyone who is a part of this country is worth that fight,” she said.

The criminal justice system must be reformed at the state level through increased education programming for prisoners and less harsh penalties for minor crimes, a panel of conservative criminal justice advocates said at an event Tuesday evening.
The panel, hosted by the Prisons and Justice Initiative, featured Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform; Gerard Robinson, executive director of the Center for Advancing Opportunity; Shon Hopwood, associate professor at Georgetown University Law Center; Heather Rice-Minus, vice president of government affairs at Prison Fellowship; and Marc Levin, vice president of criminal justice policy at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.
The event was moderated by Georgetown University government professor and Director of the Prisons and Justice Initiative Marc Howard and featured a discussion on the role of bipartisan coalitions in reforming the U.S. prison system.
Panelists at the event discussed prison system reforms that would reduce prison populations and recidivism, including reforming mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines. Hogwood said mandatory minimums, which require judges to impose sentences of a set length for crimes that may be minor, lead to a vicious cycle of imprisonment.
“Mandatory minimums are not going to solve any problems with crime,” Hopwood said. “You can reduce the number of people in prison, and crime will still go down. We can’t solve crime by just locking up more people.”
Hopwood emphasized the need to address recidivism, the tendency of convicted criminals to reoffend after leaving prison, which he said often occurs as a result of mandatory minimums.
“On the one hand, we say we put people in corrections,” Hopwood said. “On the other hand, our recidivism rate now ranges from 40 percent up to 75 percent. How many government programs do you know where they fail three out of four times, and they just keep plugging along?”
Norquist echoed Hopwood’s point, saying that after people are sent to prison for minor offenses or offenses they may not have committed, they are more likely they stay in the prison system for years after.
“The more innocent people you send to prison, the more nonthreatening people you send to prison, the less likely they are to come back,” Norquist said. “They didn’t want to commit another crime anyway — because they either didn’t commit the crime or they did something that they’re not going to do again.”
To address the recidivism cycle, the panelists advocated for increased education and social programs within prisons, led primarily by the private sector. These reforms transcend partisan lines, according to Robinson, as they are aimed at trying to assist all individuals in the prison system and are not directed at a particular group.
“I am equally committed to the idea that education makes sense for criminal justice reform,” Robinson said. “It’s not the left wing or the right wing; what we’re trying to do is give people wings to fly away from situations that do not work and land in situations that do. The government should have a role, but there is surely a need for private-sector and for faith-based communities to come in place.”
Rice-Minus works with Prison Fellowship, a Christian nonprofit that includes educating prisoners through a program called “The Academy.” Implemented in 78 prisons and 26 states, the program provides prisoners with financial literacy tutoring and parenting skills.
“Our graduates from our programs have shown drastic drops in recidivism rates,” Rice-Minus said. “We want a more constructive prison culture; we want people to reflect the social norms that we want to see when they get out.”
To refocus the purpose of the criminal justice system to assist prisoners and increase social programs, Levin and Rice-Minus both proposed integrating restorative justice approaches within prisons, which emphasize reforming prisoners rather than punishing them. They noted the importance of imprisoning people who pose a threat to society, but also the need to reduce arbitrary or unnecessary arrests.
“We have to lock up the people we’re afraid of, not the ones that we’re mad at,” Levin said. “We have incarcerated so many people for low-level drug offenses in which people could pay restitution. One of the things we support is restorative justice approach, as a form of mediation.”
Rice-Minus explained the potential opportunity for mediation between the victim and the offender as a way to address the root cause of conflicts.
“Crime, at the heart of it, is about the breaking of relationships, not the breaking of the law,” Rice-Minus said. “It’s about what happens between the person who was harmed and the person who was responsible, and the community it impacted.”
Despite the potential for reform, the panelists expressed little faith in the ability of the federal government to seriously change the criminal justice system because of a lack of resources and incentive.
“I would love to see meaningful federal prison reform happen, but I don’t see it happening,” Hopwood said. “The core of [the proposed reform] is right: The core of it is to rehabilitate people and incentivize them by getting them out of prison early — the problem is the implementation.”
