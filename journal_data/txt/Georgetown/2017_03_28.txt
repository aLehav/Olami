The Black Lives Matter movement often excludes women and girls, according to the #BlackLivesMatter panel at the second annual BRAVE Summit in Lohrfink Auditorium on Saturday.
The panel featured Erika Totten, leader in the Black Lives Matter movement in the D.C. area, Johnetta Elzie, activist and creator of Campaign Zero, a campaign to end police violence, and Michelle Jawando, vice president for legal progress at the progressive think-tank Center for American Progress. History professor Marcia Chatelain moderated the panel.
The Black Lives Matter movement developed in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Trayvon Martin in 2012, and concerns over police brutality against African Americans. Elzie said she joined the Black Lives Matter movement to correct the growing stereotypes around victims of police violence.
“In February of 2014, St. Louis City Police killed one my best friends, Stefan,” Elzie said. “I remember reading online comments from all of these faceless, fake-named random, racist white people calling my friend a thug, and a felon — just slandering him. And that’s not the Stefan I knew.”
Elzie said as a black woman she has struggled to have her voice heard and to be taken seriously by others in the Black Lives Matter movement.
“Since before I knew what my power was, or who it was that I was in this movement, there were honest tries to discredit me,” Elzie said.
Jawando said women are often not included in legal decision-making within the movement.
“In the midst of Trayvon Martin, I was the only chief counsel who was a black woman, for all 100 Senators,” Jawando said. “If you took me out of the conversation you have every single member of Congress discussing Ferguson, Mo., on the Senate side who were making decisions without my voice.”
According to Jawando, black women have been at the core of the movement since its start but have received minimal recognition for their contributions.
“Our visibility is still not there, but our work has been the center of the movement,” Jawando said.
News of violence or other stories concerning black women and girls often go unreported by mainstream media, according to Totten.
“Black women and girls are not reported when we go missing,” Totten said. “The media and the D.C. Police Department have been trying to paint them as runaways, and that is code for dismissing them.”
Jawando said black women and girls must be prepared to fight for their rights and recognition for their work.
“The reason these women are here on this panel today pouring ourselves into you is because we want you to know who you are,” Jawando said. “There are so many systems that are set up to attack and degrade who you are, and you have to be ready for the fight.”

Increased political engagement from underrepresented communities is necessary to create change, according to panelists at the A Seat at the Political Table panel at the second annual BRAVE Summit in Lohrfink Auditorium on Saturday.
The panel featured political advocacy organization IMPACT Director Nina Smith, Google Public Policy Partner Chanelle Hardy and Maryland Councilwoman Marsha Dixon (COL ’02, LAW ’05). Taylor Griffin (COL ’14), deputy press secretary for Nancy Pelosi, moderated the panel.
According to Smith, it is especially important for minorities to get involved in politics.
“People don’t like politics. They talk about it, but they avoid it,” Smith said. “But it affects you, it touches you and that’s why it’s so important and critical that you pay attention, to know what’s happening. Because we’re talking about being at the table; I had a mentor that used to tell me, ‘If you’re not at the table you’re on the menu.’”
Dixon said having a seat at the policymaking table is the best way for ignored voices to be heard.
“I’m going to have a seat at the table because no one listens to the people back here. They’re not at the table. Attached to a political seat, I have a seat at the table, I am heard,” Dixon said. “If you don’t like something, pick up a clipboard, get some signatures and run for office. Have a seat at the table and have voice.”
Griffin said if people aren’t invited to discussions that concern them, they should fight to be included.
“As the great Shirley Chisholm said, ‘If they don’t give you a seat, bring a folding chair,’” Griffin said.
Dixon said she initially got involved in politics because she wanted to prevent violence, specifically police brutality, toward black men.
“I wanted to make sure that when people saw my little boy, they said, before they put him in handcuffs or thought that he did something wrong, they said, ‘No, that’s Councilwoman Dixon’s son,’ that perhaps with that little smidgeon of knowing who I was, that my power, my network could potentially protect him,” Dixon said.
Smith emphasized the importance of maintaining one’s sense of authenticity even within predominantly white and male spaces.
“I’m always focusing on being as authentic as possible and being present. It’s funny because we talk about that a lot outside of professional spaces, but it’s something that I think has helped me navigate a number of tricky situations,” Smith said. “I can then show up and I won’t worry about what else is going on in the room.”
Dixon said it is important for women to know who they are to convince others that their voice matters.
 
“Everyone in this room has a brand,” Dixon said. “I have a brand. I decide who I am and even as I’m sitting here, whatever thoughts that you guys are formulating about me, is because I am projecting to you what I believe my brand is and some of you guys may get it and some may not. You control your narrative.”
Hardy said black women must ensure they do not lose their individuality when they are part of a larger movement to create change.
“There is space for all of us and so if your heart says that’s not for you, please, please don’t conform,” Hardy said. “If your heart tells you that you have identified a space where you believe that you can make a difference at that table, and you have to navigate certain things, like having certain credentials or having a certain outfit in order to be there, then do what you need to do to be there and let’s all recognize that each part is absolutely critical.”
Hardy urged the attendees to embody the conference theme and be brave in pursuit of their goals.
“I guess the word would be ‘courage’ or ‘brave’ because I find that the biggest impediment to having a seat at the table is fear,” Hardy said. “Fear of saying something stupid or fear of not being heard or fear of the consequences of your voice and so in order to be powerful, you have to be willing to say, I’m going to be brave I’m going to be bold.”

The Heed the Call initiative, a student-led effort to encourage the university to house a refugee family on campus, gained new ground last week when it received endorsements from five student groups.
Max Rosner (COL ’18), who heads the movement, laid out plans for overcoming the logistical hurdles of the project from the podium of the Georgetown University Muslim Student Association’s spring formal event on March 17.
According to Rosner, several administrators and staff at Georgetown had informed him that the initiative would likely be impossible. Nevertheless, Rosner detailed his practical vision for the funding, coordination and long-term sustainability of his project.
The university could defray costs by offering the family existing on-campus housing, according to Rosner. Rosner also said necessary supplies could be secured for the family via a hybrid fundraising strategy of seeking monetary donations and holding supply drives.
“I am often asked if this is plausible at a campus in the middle of Washington, D.C. The simple answer is yes, but it will require work from our entire community,” Rosner said. “Heed the Call is promoting a hybrid fundraising system: one that relies on both drives as well as donations from the university and the university community. As a community of thousands, we are well-equipped to meet such a need.”
Multiple student organizations have endorsed Heed the Call since its launch, including the Georgetown University College Democrats, Georgetown University College Republicans, Georgetown University Knights of Columbus, Catholic Women at Georgetown and Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition.
Outgoing GUMSA president Khadija Mohamud (SFS ’17) said their executive board is still deliberating on whether to endorse the Heed the Call initiative.
“As of right now I can’t speak individually for the entire board, but having Max with us this evening is indicative that we are seeking ways in which we can encourage Georgetown to do more as an institution, and truly living out its Jesuit values,” Mohamud said. “If that means helping an initiative like this, and unanimously we all decide, then so be it.”
The initiative partners with “Every Campus a Refuge,” a program started at Guilford College in North Carolina. Both programs grew out of Pope Francis’ statement from September 2015 in which he called on “every religious community, every monastery, every shrine” to house one refugee family.
Of the more than 400 students who signed Heed the Call’s corresponding petition since its launch Feb. 21, over 200 have expressed interest in joining a task force to support the initiative, according to Rosner.
Patricia Maloof, program director of migration and refugee services for Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Arlington, said Georgetown can play an important role in addressing the refugee crisis. According to the United Nations, 13.5 million people in Syria require humanitarian assistance as a result of the Syrian Civil War.
“The refugees who arrive here are part of a larger global crisis of 65 million who are displaced because of war and conflict,” Maloof said. “It’s a huge number, and 21 million of those are recognized as refugees.”
Nine colleges across the United States, including Guilford College, have sponsored refugee families thus far. The Holy Trinity Catholic Church, located at 36th and N Street NW, also took in a refugee family this year, committing $70,000 to support the family.
“I believe that the Georgetown community can mirror this example of generosity,” Rosner said.
Rosner said the initiative is sustainable in the long-term. Lutheran Social Services, a 100-year-old organization that provides support for refugees and other vulnerable populations, follows a 12-month timeline for resettling refugees.
Citing the consensus between the Catholic and Muslim faiths to support refugees, Rosner called for action.
“Let us spark a movement of support and compassion, and a movement of welcoming every person, especially those fleeing conflict, like family,” Rosner said.
Correction: This article previously stated Rosner spoke at the Georgetown University Muslim Student Association formal last Friday; the formal was held March 17. This article also previously stated Wake Forest University has taken in a refugee family; they have only agreed to take a refugee family in but have not yet taken one.

Journalists and the administration of President Donald Trump must improve their relationship, according to four journalists in a panel discussion hosted in the Intercultural Center on Wednesday.
The panel, hosted by John Kirby, former spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State, included Yamiche Alcindor (COL ’09), a national reporter for The New York Times, Justin Green, the Newsdesk editor for Axios, Sarah Harvard, a staff writer for Mic.com and Lewis Wallace, a freelance writer and reporter.
The event was part of the Georgetown journalism program’s Salim El-Lozi Lecture Series, which aims to educate the Georgetown community on the value of a free press.
According to Green, one of the challenges of reporting on the Trump administration is the lack of communication from government sources to address questions. Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer barred journalists from publications including The New York Times and the BBC from a press briefing Feb. 24.
Green said those in government need to work more with journalists before a story is published to ensure its authenticity instead of simply attacking them afterwards for it. The Trump administration has called a number of publications — including CNN and The New York Times —  “fake news,” in disputes over the content of their articles.
“Oftentimes for reporters, you will say, ‘Hello, DHS? I want a comment on this, or I have this thing, can you confirm or deny it? You’ll get nothing back,” Green said. “So you’ll publish a story, and you turn around and there’s [disputes] incoming. That has been a challenge.”
Green said those covering the White House also struggle with a relative lack of experience. According to Green, many of those working in news organizations during administrations prior to President Barack Obama’s or President George W. Bush’s have moved on to other jobs in the private sector.
“There are not a lot of mid-level editors, there are not a lot of mid-level reporters,” Green said. “As legacy organizations keep shedding people, those people in their thirties and forties now work in PR and their expertise and institutional memory seems to be fading away.”
According to Harvard, journalists must be careful about what they publish in an era of hyper partisanship. Harvard published an email where a woman alleged a Caucasian male harassed her because she was a Native American woman. After Harvard published the e-mail on her Twitter feed, she was accused of sending out ‘fake news’ by reporters from the Daily Caller and Fox News because she did not verify the woman’s story.
“Next thing I know, I got an e-mail from Tucker Carlson on Fox News who wants me to go on air and discuss the left wing mainstream media putting out fake news about Donald Trump,” Harvard said. “The whole time I thought, I’m going to get fired.”
Alcindor said remaining objective must extend to the sourcing process. Whatever their personal views, Alcindor said, journalists must push back against interviewees if they have pre-judged the journalist’s perspective.
“I think you have to push back. People will assume you are too much on their side,” Alcindor said. “Even if it is helping your story, you are getting access, I think it has served me very well to remind people that I am not an activist.”
Alcindor said an understanding of past events is important for journalists. She praised her Georgetown education as something she can use every day at her job for The New York Times due to the pertinence of historical facts in contextualizing the news.
“To me, while the college gets this rub of being a place where people who didn’t know what to do with their lives go to ponder themselves for four years, the degree that I got from college is literally put to work all the time,” Alcindor said.

The second annual BRAVE Summit, hosted on Saturday, offered black women a space to promote dialogue on issues of feminism with a series of panels and a keynote by Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D).
BRAVE — Black. Resilient. Artistic. Vigilant. Enough. — was organized by 14 undergraduate female students and saw a 40 percent increase in attendance from last year, with about 350 attendees.
“I really think the momentum from the inaugural conference carried through to this year in terms of interest,” BRAVE Board Co-chair Ashlie Williams (MSB ’17) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
BRAVE was founded last year to specifically address issues affecting black women in the United States, which are often excluded from discussions of feminism, according to Williams.
“BRAVE’s purpose is to create an environment to celebrate and educate,” Williams wrote. “Many of the topics that were discussed are often left out of the mainstream narrative and I hope that attendees felt fulfilled from participating in dialogues that they may not normally be able to.”
Over 30 speakers presented at the summit, including Erika Totten, a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement in Washington, D.C.
This year’s conference featured two panels and six breakout sessions. Breakout session topics ranged from black female sexuality to the representation of black history in Washington, D.C.’s public education system.
The morning panel, “#BlackLivesMatter,” focused on how black women are often excluded from conversations around police violence and the role they are playing in the movement, while the afternoon panel A Seat at the Political Table advocated black women’s involvement in politics.
The District faces a series of challenges as it becomes gentrified, Bowser said in her keynote address, which was sponsored by GU Women of Color and the Lecture Fund.
“People often ask me, ‘Why is it important?’ or, ‘What do you see as your role as mayor right now?’ and I think I have a special role in Washington right now because I stand in the middle of the Washington that I grew up in and the Washington that our city is becoming,” Bowser said.
Bowser said the District must make a concerted effort to ensure the city addresses inequality as it modernizes.
“If we’re going to be a city like the one that I grew up with, and was richly diverse, the government has to be intentional and focused on how we can maintain our diversity,” Bowser said. “We have been focused on affordable housing, for example, investing $100 million each and every year in government funding to create more affordable housing units. We’ve been focused on ending homelessness in the District of Columbia as well.”
Donald Trump’s presidency poses a threat to women, Bowser said in reference to the tape of Trump’s remarks about his treatment of women that was leaked during the campaign against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“Women in a lot of ways felt threatened or attacked following those days,” Bowser said. “First of all, you had a woman who almost became president, and many of us were concerned with Secretary Clinton’s loss that women would see the negativity in the campaign, they would see how tough the press is with female candidates, they would see that she had to almost be perfect and they would stop aspiring to office.”
Bowser said women are held to a higher standard than men when running for elected office.
“I know and I’ve always recognized in my five campaigns, and certainly it was on display in the most recent presidential election, that women are more often, more wrongly and more harshly criticized for the work that they do in office — by men and by women,” Bowser said.

Republicans in Congress introduced a bill this month to weaken gun control laws in Washington, D.C., sparking criticism from District officials concerned with federal meddling in local policies.
Freshman Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.) introduced legislation on the floor of the House of Representatives to weaken D.C.’s gun regulations March 15. Currently, the District prohibits assault weapons and high-capacity magazine clips.
The bill, titled the Second Amendment Enforcement Act of 2017, would do away with this ban, as well as make it easier to obtain a concealed carry permit. Additionally, the legislation would prohibit the District from passing any future local gun laws.
Garrett’s legislation is the House counterpart to legislation introduced in the Senate by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in January of this year.
In Virginia, Garrett’s home state, open carry is allowed for anyone over the age of 18, and concealed carry is allowed for those with permits. Neither high-capacity magazines nor assault weapons are prohibited.
In an email to The Hoya, Garrett’s Communications Director Andrew Griffin explained that the legislation was inspired by FBI data showing a higher rate of violent crime and murders in the District compared to Virginia, even though D.C. has stricter gun regulations and fewer gun owners.
Griffin also wrote that several constituents in Virginia with legally owned firearms and concealed carry permits complain about feeling unsafe and unable to defend themselves when visiting D.C. According to The Washington Post, there were 105 fatal shootings in the District compared to 26 in northern Virginia last year.
D.C. is classified as a federal district by law, allowing Congress to constitutionally void District laws and manage the use of local tax dollars.
Various D.C. leaders voiced their concern over the legislation, including Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) in an interview with The Hoya.
“Congressman Garrett is pretty wrong in thinking that putting semi-automatic weapons and large magazine clips and conceal carry weapons would somehow make D.C. safe. It will do the exact opposite,” Allen said. “But more importantly, I’m pretty sure that the voters of Virginia did not send him to Congress to be working on local issues in Washington, D.C., but to be working on the issues for Virginia.”
Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), who represents D.C. as a nonvoting delegate in Congress, criticized Garrett for his proposal the day after it was introduced.
“Wherever his constituents stand on guns, it is hard to believe that they would prefer their representative, who has only introduced three prior bills, devote time to interfering with another Member’s district, rather than focus on their needs,” Norton wrote in a March 16 press release.
When asked about tensions between congressional members and District leaders, Allen recalled the recent increase in proposed legislation pertaining to D.C., health care and homeland security.
In February, the House’s Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued a formal markup of disapproval of D.C.’s Death With Dignity Act, the fourth time Congress has voted down a D.C. law since the passing of the Home Rule Act of 1973. Despite this, the bill became law because neither a full House nor Senate voted down the act within the allotted 30-day review period.
In response, Allen launched the Hands Off D.C. initiative, which organizes District residents and leaders to resist federal intervention in District policies.
“Our message to him is the same as it is to any member of Congress wanting to try to write our local laws, and that is they should keep their hands off D.C. and focus on their own districts,” Allen said.
Allen added that a possible solution would be to grant the District statehood. Holmes Norton introduced legislation in the House on March 1 to make D.C. the 51st state.
“It can be resolved,” Allen said. “The most straightforward way would be for the District to become a state. If we had statehood, then we would have representation in Congress, and members of Congress from whether it’s Virginia, Utah, Florida or wherever wouldn’t be trying to interfere with local legislation and local budgets.”
According to Allen, hundreds of D.C. citizens plan on marching to the Capitol this Friday in a demonstration to send a message to members of Congress to not get involved in local legislation.

Former Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) entered office 373 days ago on a campaign platform of creating a more inclusive GUSA, reforming dining and completing the 2036 campus plan.
The Khan-Fisk administration had the largest GUSA executive in recent history, with over 200 members, after restructuring the executive in March to create policy teams, which advocate on issue areas in conjunction with the senate.
The term saw a series of successes in dining and campus planning. In September, the university, residents and GUSA signed a 20-year campus plan that pledged renovations to campus residence halls, and in November, the university signed a new 10-year dining contract with Aramark.
A week after leaving office, Khan and Fisk discussed their proudest accomplishments, the path to creating a more diverse and inclusive GUSA and what they took away from their experience.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
What are you most proud of from your term, as a collective administration and as individuals?
Khan: What I am personally most proud of our term is the fact that the new way that we chose to run our administration allowed for different people, who traditionally would not be involved in GUSA, to play a part and be able to be in the room and make important policy changes. That is something I am really proud of, that this long list of accomplishments is reflective of a different way of engagement of administration and our being able to work with students from across campus and bring them in the room. That has a lot to do with restructuring, but also our trying to reach out to students: ‘We feel like this is your issue area, we want you in the room to speak on behalf of it.’
Fisk: The biggest personal takeaway is understanding what really constitutes leadership. That’s supporting and empowering and respecting people, because if that’s what you’re building — relationships — then everyone has room to be themselves and succeed versus kind of fighting for the limelight or power, so supporting and empowering people as the definition of leadership for me has been the biggest personal takeaway for me.
What are your biggest regrets from your term, as a collective administration and as individuals?
Khan: We would both agree that our shortcoming was something every GUSA administration has struggled with: communicating to the student body, because the general student doesn’t recognize that all this great work happened this year, and people associate GUSA with self-serving individuals who just talk but don’t actually get anything done. But this was really a year, and I am not even talking about me and Chris. There were individuals who genuinely were working day and night to make real changes happen that the student body does not associate with GUSA. There are great things happening that are impacting their daily lives, but they don’t know it was because of GUSA. That’s a struggle, because obviously we wish we communicated it better, but on the other hand, it’s tough to balance why you are doing this work in a way that’s not to make yourself look better and say look what we did, and balancing that with genuinely wanting people’s days to be better even if people don’t know we did it.
What do you see as your legacy?
Khan: Food might be associated with our administration just because it is something that GUSA did not focus on as much as it could have in past years. When it comes to smaller, under-represented communities like undocumented students, Muslim students, students of color, LGBTQ students, students in [Georgetown Scholarship Program] for example, they are communities that are not traditionally heard. I hope they will associate our administration as one that vouched for them after years of not being vouched for.
What were your biggest surprises during your term? How do you think you handled them?
Khan: November’s election was the biggest surprise, because when we ran there were obviously issues that were connected to things that we have advocated for before November, but not to the extent we have since November. We didn’t foresee the impact of federal action on students on our campus. We realized that, shoot, this does change a lot of what we have to work on this year, and suddenly we found ourselves diving even more into those issues of inclusivity. How do we make sure our marginalized populations and vulnerable and literally unsafe populations are getting the resources that they need and beyond a, ‘You can come into this room and talk to this person,’ but rather ‘OK, this person needs legal services. Are you going to provide them for free? Are you going to provide housing if they can’t go home?’
These are all things we did behind closed doors, because the nature of this is something that should not be on Breitbart but rather things that we recognize should be internal conversations. We could protect those students before anything else. That is something that again we had to give up the communication part to make sure that people were literally safe.
How would you define your success in your campaign pillars of dining, campus planning and inclusivity?
Fisk: It is an objective fact for us to say that because of GUSA’s work this year, Georgetown is a more accessible and easier place to navigate for students from different socio-economic backgrounds, specifically students from under-privilleged backgrounds. From winter-break housing and shuttles to laundry conversations that are happening right now to printing agreements with UIS to establishing an advisory board for affordability and access that will have over 40 students and administrators and faculty members that are tackling these issues going forward. There is just so much in that portfolio and you can look at it in the final report as well that contributes in pretty traceable amounts of money in a number of them to providing a benefit to students from less privelleged socio-economic backgrounds. I think it was  a huge priority for us and something that at the end of the day we can say was a pretty darn big success.
What is the biggest challenge GUSA President Kamar Mack and Vice President Jessica Andino face entering office and the biggest thing they have working in their favor?
Khan: One advantage is the structure. They’ve inherited a structure that clearly worked, if you ask us, and based on how the senate voted, they tended to agree with that. They’re inheriting a really good structure that will allow for this to be continued. It has institutionalized other voices being in the room, which is why we’re really happy with the structure that we have. They will inherit relationships that GUSA has built and strengthened over this past year that either did not exist before or were very weak in the past.
Jessica was a member of the cabinet, and has experience working through an issue area that succeeded. Her having an understanding of the structure also helps there. In terms of things that they will have to struggle with and work through, it’s a bigger GUSA now, having to work with more people and having to be patient because there are going to be different opinions and there are going to be clashing opinions. We had a positive relationship with the senate, but because the senate is still trying to figure out what they are and what their purpose is on campus, I could foresee there being some tension, similar to how there was in past years.
You had one of the largest GUSA executive branches in recent memory with the new policy teams. Did they prove effective? What is the right way to create a more inclusive and diverse GUSA?
Fisk: When we were underclassmen, GUSA was an exclusive nebulous group of people. You didn’t know what they did, and you were pretty darn sure there were like 10 people in there. If you weren’t friends with someone who was in GUSA, you had a hard time participating in that process. By making it so that any student can contribute, offer their thoughts and ideas, it becomes a more effective body, and it becomes a body that is better able to advocate for students, because it has a more streamlined process of getting their feedback and getting their contributions. We are maybe biased, but by making it easier for students to contribute, you’re making a more diversified GUSA. You’re making a GUSA that advocates on behalf of the most students of very different backgrounds.
What are your plans for after Georgetown?
Khan: So I am hopefully going to be in New York at Goldman Sachs. I’ve switched over to the investment banking side from merchant banking, which is where I was this summer.
Fisk: I’ll be doing Teach for America in Miami-Dade, in the community that was so important in getting me here. I’ll be working on getting a master’s at the same time.
How has GUSA influenced you personally over the last year?
Khan: I’ve learned what it means to be a leader and to be empathetic, especially this year, having to be in the position that I was, learning about what the needs of others are with no prejudgment, with no personal stake, with no, ‘This is what I think you want so therefore this is what you should want.’ But being sensitive to people’s issues and taking them as seriously as they feel they are, and really feeling their pains and frustrations, and using that as fuel to get things done.
In the process, I learned about empathy and understanding other people’s experiences that maybe don’t apply to me, but recognizing that they are just as valid. Empathy has been a big part of it. On the leadership side, I learned what it means to be a woman in leadership and how my gender has influenced my own style of leadership, and how I’ve tried to change certain things and recognizing the gender factor, the color factor, all of that. To all of that, I’ve personally learned that empowering other people is an incredibly effective way of leadership and being humble and recognizing that you don’t know everything is crucial to outcome.
Fisk: One, leadership isn’t a zero sum game, and by that I mean if someone knows more than you, if someone is better at something than you are, that doesn’t mean that you’re deficient, it means that it’s an opportunity for you to allow them to step up and take the lead on something.

Georgetown should provide students with greater access to contraceptives, Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12), a reproductive justice advocate, said at an address in Healy Hall yesterday.
The university’s insurance plan for students currently covers students’ access to contraception, though the student health center does not provide contraceptives for non-medical purposes. According to Fluke, the university should not prevent students from accessing a resource that they pay for.
“The university is putting restrictions on what your insurance can cover, even though they don’t even pay for it,” Fluke said.
Fluke has advocated for students’ reproductive coverage in various capacities as a student and an alumna, most notably appearing before Democratic Congressional representatives in February 2012 to advocate for increased student contraceptive coverage.
After the appearance, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh called Fluke a “slut” and criticized her promotion of birth control coverage. Fluke said she could have argued against Limbaugh’s comment, but decided not to do so in order to defend all women.
“It doesn’t matter who you’ve been with or how long you’ve been with a person, you don’t get to be called a slut in the public press because you talked about birth control policy,” Fluke said. “We wanted to make sure that we were standing up for all women, no matter their circumstances, rather than litigating this about my own personal life, because it’s not relevant.”
The event, the first in H*yas for Choice’s annual Choice Week, was co-sponsored by Lecture Fund, Georgetown University College Democrats, feminist advocacy group United Feminists and the Georgetown University Student Association.
According to Fluke, reproductive justice encompasses not only legal barriers, but also economic barriers.
“That means that our reproductive health issues are addressed, so that there is not some sort of challenge that means that we’re not able to have children physically, that there are not legal barriers saying that since you’re a gay couple you are not allowed to, that there are not economic barriers so that you cannot afford to have an abortion,” Fluke said.
Fluke said reproductive health is an issue that affects people from a diverse array of backgrounds.
“We tried to use a reproductive justice framework as we made those decisions. One of the reasons that I believe in and I am so committed to the reproductive justice framework is because it actually allows us to broaden our tent and bring more people into the movement,” Fluke said.
Fluke said she aims to apply the concept of intersectionality to bring the interests of groups such as Latinas for Reproductive Justice and Black Women for Wellness into the discussion of reproductive rights.
“I also try to think about who is playing the role of the spokesperson in various settings, and we need to make sure it’s not all white wealthy women who are the ones who are in the press, because that is the perception that a lot of America has,” Fluke said.
Fluke said the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama’s health care legislation that protects women’s access to birth control, is the best path to providing effective health care for women. On Friday, the Republican Party failed in its attempt to repeal and replace the ACA with a new health care program that would have no longer guaranteed access to birth control.
“What I am certain of is that we are very much under a threat of legislation through Congress signed by the president that would expand on the concept of religious liberty for a whole host of things, and that would cover things like insurance for reproductive health care,” Fluke said. “The best path forward is through the ACA.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the university’s insurance plan does not cover contraceptives.

Metro fare will increase July 1 following the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board of directors’ approval of fare hikes and reduced services last Thursday.
In an effort to avoid a $1.1 billion budget deficit by 2020, Metro will increase rush hour Metrorail fares by 10 cents, making the one-way minimum fare $2.25 and the new maximum $6. Non-rush hour fares will rise 25 cents to $2.
Metrobus fares will also increase by 25 cents. Airport bus fees will increase to $7.50.
This marks Metro’s first fare increases to its rail system in three years amid declining ridership.
In addition to the fare hikes, WMATA’s 2018 fiscal year budget of $3.1 billion proposes eliminating 14 low-traffic Metrobus lines, reducing service hours, cutting nearly 1,000 jobs and requesting additional funding from the local governments of the District, Virginia and Maryland.
Trains running during rush hour will now be scheduled to run every eight minutes at the end of the line instead of the current six minutes.
Additionally, Metro plans to cut hours of operation every day of the week starting in July, with train stations open from 5 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday, open from 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday and operating from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sunday. Currently, the Metro begins services at 5 a.m. on weekdays and 7 a.m. on weekends, closing at midnight every day.
The 2017-18 fiscal year was marked by declining ridership revenue from Metrorail and Metrobus, which makes up over 89 percent of total revenue.
Total Metrorail ridership is projected to reach 177.1 million trips in 2017-18, a 13 percent  decrease from the 2016-17 projection of 203.5 million trips. Total Metrobus ridership is projected to reach 115.2 million trips, down 15 percent from 135.6 million trips in 2016-17.
According to WMATA General Manager Paul Wiedefeld, these projections demonstrate customer dissatisfaction. Wiedefeld attributed the decline in ridership to the system’s “safety surges,” scheduled outages on the rail system during intense maintenance. WMATA plans to complete three years’ worth of renovations in one year.
The series of safety-related incidents on Metrorail is also a reason for declining ridership, according to Widefeld. Specifically, WMATA has recorded an uptick in crimes committed on trains, with a security report presented to the Metro board Dec. 1, recording 5.4 crimes for every million riders, in addition to delays and malfunctions caused by old tracks or train cars over the past few years.
At a press conference last Thursday, Wiedefeld explained that the financial situation he inherited has made repairs and renovations difficult.
“When I came on board, my focus was on service and the safety issues and that’s what I was doing,” Wiedefeld said. “This is a very large system. It hasn’t been invested in at the level we should have been investing over the years.”
The decision has been met with resistance from local businesses and pro-growth organizations, which focus on walkable and transit-oriented cities, concerned that the Metro board’s decision will further reduce ridership and ultimately drive the utility out of business. The Metro board defends the changes as necessary to sustain WMATA in the long-run and avoid a nearly $300 million budget shortfall for this year alone.
The Coalition for Smarter Growth, a pro-growth group, argues for a more Metro funding from the local governments that rely on WMATA, such the District of Columbia, Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax County, Fairfax City and Falls Church.
According to Coalition for Smarter Growth Deputy Director Aimee Custis, since the budget is not decided by elected officials, WMATA has competing obligations to both Metro riders and the board members’ individual jurisdictions.
Custis said the leading alternative to funding Metro could be a regional sales tax.
Still, Wiedefeld said this approach is necessary for long-run stability in Washington and the surrounding metropolitan region.
“What this system means to the region into the future is huge,” Wiedefeld said March 23. “A lot of the focus has been on the here and now and we have to continue to do that, but we also have to think about what this system means for this region and the economy and the mobility of this region.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Kamar Mack (COL ’19) said many students rely on WMATA being an affordable resource and GUSA is working on efforts to maintain accessibility.
“When students do use public transportation, they primarily utilize the routes that are closer to downtown D.C., which are less likely to be cut due to high ridership,” Mack wrote in an email to The Hoya. “GUSA, in conjunction with the university, has recently added Saturday GUTS routes, and we are also in talks with WMATA to push for a weekend student pass on the Metro, as well as looking into further GUTS improvements.”
[…] Metro faced criticism this year from rider advocacy groups, D.C. officials and former board members after its board of directors voted in March to raise Metrorail fares, cut service hours and eliminate bus routes to cut costs. […]

The next governor of Virginia must protect the state’s local values and resist President Donald Trump’s federal policies when necessary, argued Tom Perriello, a Democratic Party candidate for Virginia’s governorship Monday night.
Speaking at an event sponsored by the McCourt School of Public Policy’s Institute of Politics and Public Service in Old North last night, Perriello explained his campaign platform and the political climate.
Perriello stressed the importance of maintaining Virginia’s values in the face of the new administration.
“There rests a moral and constitutional obligation on the governor to look at the legal means available for noncompliance,” Perriello said.
Virginia is one of only two states that will hold off-year elections, taking place in 2017. Perriello, who is the former U.S. Representative for Virginia’s 5th district, is currently running a primary campaign against Democrat Ralph Northam, the lieutenant governor of Virginia.
“Virginia is often seen as a very important state that is a bellwether for getting a sense of what the broader electorate thinks a year into the president’s term,” Perriello said. “It is a way that we can sort of sense where things are going, or are likely to go, in the midterm elections in 2018.”
Michael Shear, The New York Times’ White House correspondent who moderated the discussion, said Perriello faces some opposition from other members of the Democratic Party.
“You want to be the next Democratic governor of Virginia, the current Democratic governor wants someone else, the former Democratic governor of Virginia wants someone else, the one before that wants someone else, all the state delegates and state senators of Virginia want someone else,” Shear said.
Perriello said he would have potentially received more support if former Secretary of  State Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election in 2016.
However, Perriello said he now feels he has a strong chance for Virginia’s Democrats to win the gubernatorial seat.
“As someone who cares a great deal about Virginia politics, I wasn’t going to look at an election that determined the next 10 years or generation of politics in Virginia and allow Democrats to have less than the best chance we could,” Perriello said. “I am very confident that the campaign we have put together would give Democrats the best chance to win.”
According to Perriello, establishment Democrats were slow to realize Trump’s chances of winning the election. He said he can bring a more nuanced view of the Trump administration’s policies.
“This was a much bigger deal in our country than some change to Ds to Rs, this is an actual threat to our deepest values and institutions in a way that has become clear in the way President Trump is governing,” Perriello said.
Perriello said the country continues to face an unemployment problem and persistent racism.
“Trump is not the creator of those dynamics, he is the result of those dynamics,” Perriello said. “I believe that my state of Virginia is actually the forefront of pushing against this and I believe that if we run the type of campaign that is bold about that, we can think bigger than just winning a governor’s seat.”
After House Republicans halted a repeal of the Affordable Care Act last Friday because of a lack of support, Perriello said Democrats have an opportunity to cooperate with Republicans at the state level. This is because Republican plans in the federal government have mostly sought to shift the burden of health care from the federal government to state and local governments.
“One of the several divisions that developed in this was the realization of many Republicans at the state level that Republicans in Congress were going to throw them under the bus,” Perriello said. “It is pretty clear that they were shifting the tough decisions to Richmond and other capitals around the country.”
Perriello said if Democrats are able to cultivate the desire for change that can be seen in social movements taking place against the Trump administration in their political campaigns, they may be able to regain majorities in a significant manner.
“The movement that has responded to the Trump administration is a genuinely diverse, pluralistic and progressive movement in a way that I haven’t seen in my lifetime,” Perriello said. “If we can combine that with campaigns that actually understand this moment, we will actually see transformations and breakthroughs over the next two years that will put us in a position to see Trump’s election not as the beginning of an unraveling, but as the last gasp of a dying, racist ideology.”

Foreign correspondents have a greater responsibility in light of President Donald Trump’s administration and growing conflict around the world, said Anne Garrels, former senior foreign correspondent at NPR, and Mary Jordan (COL ’83), a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The Washington Post, in a panel discussion at the Mortara Center for International Studies on Monday.
“When the president of the United States stands up and says that we are the enemy of the people, it energizes you in a different way. It’s a particularly important time for foreign news,” Jordan said. “I think people get that there’s an appetite for global news. Worldwide, people are hungry for more information.”
Ned Price (SFS ’05), who was the special assistant to former President Barack Obama, moderated the panel. The panel was hosted by the Lecture Fund and co-sponsored by The Hoya.
According to Garrels, increasing numbers of long-term military commitments, such as the Iraq War, conflicts in the Middle East and tensions between Russia and Ukraine, have raised the stakes for foreign correspondents.
“When I covered Central America, we walked around with T-shirts on that said, ‘Don’t shoot, I’m a journalist,’ with some confidence that actually that would work,” Garrels said. “It has become much more dangerous around the world for foreign correspondents.”
Garrels, who is a member of the nonprofit journalist advocacy group Committee to Protect Journalists, said Trump’s administration poses a threat to journalists. The Trump administration barred several media outlets, including The New York Times and the BBC, from a press conference Feb. 24.
“I’m also on the Committee to Protect Journalists, we are really worried about the fate of journalists,” Garrels said. “Apart from creating an animosity against the mainstream press, I’m concerned that they’re going to go after leakers and journalists.”
Garrels said the role of a foreign correspondent has evolved as a result of the internet.
“We are no longer needed as an impartial witness by both sides because they can go online and they can do their own public relations. That’s what we’ve seen with ISIS,” Garrels said.  “We are really more valuable now either as a source of income because we’ve been kidnapped, or dead.”
Jordan, who also served as a foreign correspondent for 14 years, said it is imperative now more than ever that foreign correspondents relay the truth about the news as it is unfolding on the ground, given the rise of sources such as Twitter that can have unverified information.
“I think being a foreign correspondent is arguably more important now than ever,” Jordan said. “There’s no substitute for eyes on the ground, there’s no substitute for smart minds on the ground, especially in the era where there’s skewed news, fake news or just misinformation.”
According to Price, in the age of the internet, news organizations must make a concerted effort to separate fake or biased stories from the real news.
“We need to be cognizant that not everything that is labeled as fake news truly is,” Price said. “Lately we’ve seen a trend where, especially from this administration, fake news is the moniker they apply to everything they disagree with. I think we have to be careful to differentiate what is actual fake news and what the far left or the far right is pushing out intentionally to mislead the public.”
Jordan said technology has allowed foreign correspondents to expand their coverage, especially in zones traditionally not journalist-friendly.
“Our person in North Korea got in and had tens of thousands of people on Facebook Live; people hungry for a look at North Korea,” Jordan said. “Technology I think is fantastic. It is expanding exponentially the numbers of people and the kinds of people we are reaching. In the older days, you’d bring a camera into a difficult place and it was easy to spot. But now, the phone is just bringing you places.”
Garrels warned that technology, while beneficial, opens up a new series of challenges.
“There’s a downside to this, I think, now in terms of 24-hour news we can get access to everybody. You can have an awful lot of blah-blah that is deceptive,” Garrels said. “It just makes it all much easier to have fake news too.”

H*yas for Choice began its fifth annual Choice Week yesterday, aiming to cultivate a sex-positive culture on campus through a series of discussions throughout the week.
The events for this week include talks from women’s rights attorney and Georgetown Law graduate Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12), who testified to House Oversight Committee Democrats in 2012 on the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act.
Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C., Inc. CEO Laura Meyers will speak on the impact of President Donald Trump’s election on the organization Tuesday, while Casa Latina is hosting an event on reproductive justice in the Latinx community.
“This year more than ever, we feel having events that destigmatize abortion, emphasize the intersecting identities of Georgetown community members, and create optimism in the face of virulently anti-choice politics and state-sanctioned hatred is imperative to creating supportive, compassionate, and inspired communities,” HFC said in a statement sent to The Hoya.
While the speakers and larger themes vary from year to year, according to H*yas for Choice Co-President Emily Stephens (SFS ’17), the Abortion Story Share-Out has been a foundational component of Choice Week since its inception. In the share-out, HFC members read stories of experiences with abortion submitted anonymously by members of the Georgetown community.
According to Stephens, the event is inspired by the 1 in 3 Campaign, in reference to the statistic that one in three women has an abortion at some point in her life.
“The only way to reduce the stigma surrounding abortion is to talk about it openly, and we hope reading these stories will empower other students to speak up about their own experiences, and inspire everyone to continue advocating for safe, legal, and accessible abortion,” Stephens wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Stephens said Choice Week events are designed to create a comfortable and inclusive environment.
“Our abortion story share is typically a more intimate affair, and our event on Thursday is also deliberately small, to hold space for people in the Latinx community who wrestle with their Catholic/Christian identity and reproductive justice issues, to share their views in a small, community setting,” Stephens wrote.
Stephens said Choice Week allows students to participate in dialogue around issues often overlooked by the university administration.
“If these events are not put on by students, they will not happen at all,” Stephens said. “That’s disappointing and unfortunate, because the vast majority of students on campus are pro-choice and pro-reproductive justice, and their views are not represented by the Georgetown administration. We fill in that gap.”
Kate Toner (NHS ’20), who is a member of H*yas for Choice, said the week is an opportunity for students to increase their awareness on the dialogue surrounding health issues.
“Choice Week is integral in destigmatizing a lot of issues that are becoming increasingly more relevant and important, especially in the context of our newly elected government,” Toner said. “As of now there is a lot of public contempt toward abortion, but I think if people hear the personal reasoning behind why a woman chooses to get an abortion, it could create a more supportive culture and decrease those negative feelings.”

Did we recently have a Jesuit heritage week?  Interesting, I didn’t see any coverage about it in the Hoya.
So much for fair, impartial, and objective reporting.

The alternative facts are strong wth ths post, especially the completely bogus claim 1/3 women have an abortion.

Some objective, humble advice for the wise:  Abortion (Choice is a smokescreen) kills human life (scientifically proven) and is a Mortal Sin, which deeply and seriously offends God, and cuts one off from union with Him! 
Is GU still a Catholic University?  The Magisterium (teaching authority of the Church) always trumps whatever the Jesuits may condone on campus.  Is there no belief in morality and grievous sin on campus anymore?  Being a faithful Christian is an all or nothing proposition.  Jesus said He would spit out those who are lukewarm.
I realize GU has a diverse campus, however the fundamentals of the natural moral law, the infallible Bible (which came from the Catholic Church), and the infallible teachings of the Catholic Church in faith and morals must be actively taught on/off campus to establish a solid foundation for young minds, whose most important goal in life needs to be a holy relationship with God (our Creator, Redeemer, & Lover). 
What I write is Truth for the salvation of souls.  Here are some enlightening articles for understanding truth (which is never relative like in relativism), and the evils of abortion.

Twelve new clubs launched this semester, with the Council of Advisory Boards approving fewer than 50 percent of the 34 student groups that applied this semester for university recognition.
The clubs, including the Hong Kong Student Association, Lebanese Student Association and Hoya Teahouse, join over 300 student groups on campus. These groups now enter into the new club development process, which provides them with a budget, and the ability to use the Georgetown name and to book physical space on campus.
In previous semesters, the application process was similarly competitive. Of the 26 applicants last spring, only 11 were accepted. Last fall, 29 clubs applied and 16 were accepted.
In order to apply for recognition as a new student organization, members must attend one of three information sessions offered by the Council of Advisory Boards.
According to Council of Advisory Boards Chair Janhvi Bhojwani (SFS ’18), CAB’s application review process is extensive. There are three possible outcomes after a weekend of application review. The applicant can be approved, rejected or receive a request for a presentation.
Bhojwani said a presentation is simply CAB requesting more information, meaning the applicant will meet with CAB leadership to discuss their organization or address any questions.
Groups that are rejected can also appeal the decision to CAB.
Despite existing for more than a year and a half, raising thousands of dollars and having plans to expand to 10 different college campuses by the end of the month, Unsung Heroes lacks the status necessary to be officially recognized by Georgetown University.
The initiative was denied recognition by CAB, even after a subsequent appeal. Febin Bellamy (MSB ’17), who founded Unsung Heroes in Spring 2015 to highlight the stories and voices of Georgetown employees, has found himself featured in The Washington Post, CNN and NBC News for his efforts.
Bellamy said he had hoped to get club status to facilitate the creation of chapters in other universities across the country.
“We want to do this because that is how we can create chapters, but also because it allows us to get funding and to have access to other benefits on campus,” Bellamy said. “It also allows to create a longer lasting impression on the campus.”
One of the recently accepted groups, the Hong Kong Student Association, had to go through the appeal process not once, but twice.
Hong Kong Student Association founder Joanne Lai (MSB ’19) said the club had to thoroughly convince CAB that they would cater to enough of the student population on campus.
“They were concerned there was not a large enough audience, and the sustainability of our club, so we had really had to show that there is a lot of interest about Hong Kong on campus,” Lai said. “We showed them that there is a good amount of people from the Hong Kong area, and the MSB program in Hong Kong has almost doubled in size over the past three years.”
When the Lebanese Student Association applied to become a new club, Co-President Tala Anchassi (SFS ’18) said they had to highlight that no current student group was catering to their needs.
“There is another cultural club that might represent the Arab culture, but we saw that the way the university academics is set up, it really fosters this stereotypical view of the Middle East,” Anchassi said. “You don’t really see the differences of cultures broken down, so because of that we really wanted to break this view and provide our interest and perspective to the people who are interested.”
Bhojwani said duplicity is the main obstacle new groups often face when trying to become officially recognized by the university.
“As a school that already has many different organizations, oftentimes we have clubs that are already doing whatever a new student is trying to propose — maybe not in the same scale or structure that the student is proposing, but it already exists on campus,” Bhojwani said. “We are unable to accept these groups into the new club development process because these spaces already exist and are active on campus.”
Co-President of LSA Layla Najjar (SFS ’18) said the process of creating a new student club is more complex and involved than the group originally thought.
“It was much more of a bureaucratic process than we thought,” Najjar said. “Georgetown is very much initially open to having you start your organizations, but you really have to work for it.”
Hoya Teahouse Founder Alison Hsu (MSB ’19) said the purpose of the club is to bring students from different cultures together through a shared appreciation of tea.
“I came to Georgetown as an international student expecting there to be a really diverse student body, and after coming here I saw all the presence of student cultural groups, but I didn’t really see a platform for all of the students from different cultural backgrounds to interact with each other,” Hsu said. “My vision is to have people interact with each other through tea. It is something that every culture shares, but ended up being developed into a very different culture in each culture’s perspective.”
To showcase international cultures and traditions, Hsu said Hoya Teahouse plans to host traditional tea performances in the future.
“We are planning to have our first tea performance in April. Just like a dance performance where people dance and show the move, tea performance is where people pour tea and show the move too,” Hsu said. “It is combination of tea-ism and zen: basically letting go of a lot unnecessary trouble, a lot of doubt in your life, but you are focusing on that cup of tea and drinking it.”
While this semester will conclude with Unsung Heroes still lacking the official recognition that provides clubs with funding to operate, Bellamy said rejection has not prevented Unsung Heroes from thriving on campus.
“It doesn’t really inhibit us from doing anything on campus, because we have never been in a club on campus until now — it has always been a student initiative,” Bellamy said “It is huge to have that recognition on campus, but we have been fortunate enough to be able to operate without it.”
Correction: This article previously stated the Student Activities Commission is responsible for recognizing new clubs; the Council of Advisory Boards is responsible for this.

Twenty-one graduate students are participating in a new “Hacking for Defense” course this semester to find solutions to the country’s national security problems using hands-on approaches.
The course, which is the first of its kind at Georgetown, allows groups of three-to-five students to tackle projects such as adapting facial recognition software to identify terrorists in crowds. It is sponsored by MD5, a public-private partnership between the Department of Defense and research universities launched October 2016 to facilitate defense education.
“Hacking for Defense” is modeled after programs at other universities, including Stanford University and the University of Pittsburgh. It uses Lean Launchpad Method, an interdisciplinary approach merging business, entrepreneurship and security concepts to address current issues within the U.S. military, government and private organizations.
School of Foreign Service Center for Security Studies Director Bruce Hoffman praised the course as cutting-edge and innovative.
“It completely embodies the theory and practice ethos that is at the heart of the School of Foreign Service’s mission and perfectly encapsulates the Security Studies Program’s mission of producing a new generation of analysts, policymakers and scholars fully knowledgeable about the range of international and national security problems and foreign policy issues of the 21st century,” Hoffman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Two-time defense industry CEO Chris Taylor and the U.S. Army Cyber Command Deputy Director of Strategic Initiatives Matt Zais serve as co-instructors of “Hacking for Defense.” Also contributing to the teaching team are military liaisons, mentors, advisers and research assistants.
Paige Tsiumis (GRD ’17), a master’s candidate in the SFS Security Studies Program and a research assistant for the course, said students are responsible for watching lectures online before attending classes on Monday nights. The classes are also live streamed on Facebook for the public.
Students present on their weekly accomplishments, including the results of their minimum 10 weekly interviews conducted to contribute to their projects.
“The class is structured in a way to provide students with a simulated experience of working within the chaos of the startup culture, but gearing entrepreneurship skills towards finding solutions for problems facing the U.S. Government,” Tsiumis said. “The class is set up in a flipped style, where much of the student learning is done outside of the classroom.”
Donna Artusy (GRD ’17), a graduate student in the Security Studies Program and another research assistant for the course, said students play a large role in how the class is designed.
“Students have a great deal of input into the course. Their weekly presentations bring up constructive feedback from the professors, Christopher Taylor and Matt Zais, who are able to lend both insight and suggestions into what students may or may not need to work on in order to improve their presentations to outside sponsors and mentors,” Artusy said.
The course requires an application process, in which applicants indicate what projects they are interested in working on. Alexander Kravets (GRD ’18), a student in the Security Studies Program, is working on a project on neutralizing Group 1 Unmanned Aerial Systems.
Kravets said he decided to take H4D to get a crash course in defense innovation.
“The experience has been extremely positive,” Kravetz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The most compelling aspect of the course has been getting to meet and work with people throughout DoD, at all levels, who are dedicated to solving critical problems in pursuit of making America stronger and safer.”
