The Georgetown University Graduate Student Government (GradGov) Senate approved two new areas of their spring semester budget supporting child care grants for the first time and monthly donations to combat food insecurity on campus. 
In the new budget proposal, which was approved by the GradGov Executive Committee on Passing a Budget on Feb. 3, $18,000 will be allocated toward funding for childcare grants that will be distributed to graduate student parents to help meet their childcare needs. 
GradGov also plans to donate $500 each month, beginning this month and operating through June, to support the Hoya Hub, a student-run food pantry on campus. 
GradGov looks to support graduate student parents, who are an important but often overlooked group within the Georgetown community, according to GradGov Senator Bess Grasswick (MSB ’22), who proposed the addition of childcare grants to the budget.
“Childcare expenses are a recognized educational expense,” Grasswick said in an interview with The Hoya. “Graduate students can include that in their request for financial aid from the financial aid office, but we all know that that doesn’t always cover everything. We’re hoping to fill in opportunities and figure out ways to meaningfully disperse that aid.”
The childcare grant will be administered to graduate student parents through the Graduate Financial Aid Advisory Board (GFAAB), the senate committee that approves budgets within GradGov, as well as the university financial aid office, according to Grasswick. 
It can be challenging to simultaneously parent a child and attend classes, even when classes are remote, according to Catherine Hulford (GRD ’22).
“As a parent, a graduate student and a full-time employee, my attention is split in multiple directions. I know the help of additional child care support will allow future graduate students an opportunity to focus on their studies knowing their kids are cared for,” Hulford wrote to The Hoya.
While the budent has been approved the process for applying for grants is still being finalized, Grasswick said. 
“At this time, it appears that the FAFSA will determine eligibility. This is because the FAFSA collects the reported dependents and income for each student,” Grasswick wrote to The Hoya. 
The childcare additions to the budget will support barriers that graduate student parents face in their studies, according to Jonah Klempner (GRD ’22, LAW ’22), GradGov president.
“This grant is for parents living on a budget whose parental obligations would prevent them from fulfilling their academic responsibilities and capturing the greatest value from their graduate student experience,” Klempner wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Childcare grants will support the specific needs of student parents, according to Grasswick.
“It’s important because the graduate student body is a diverse student body, and part of that diversity comes from students who are parents and are coming to school and really investing in themselves and their futures,” Grasswick said.
GradGov has also committed to reducing food insecurity within the Georgetown community, according to Grasswick. In addition to their $500 monthly donation to the Hoya Hub, GradGov senators who attend meetings virtually will have the option to donate their portion of the food typically provided at the in-person meeting, to the food pantry, Grasswick said. 
Georgetown supports GradGov’s additions to the budget on these issues, according to a university spokesperson.
“We appreciate GradGov’s efforts to support members of the Georgetown community through these important services,” a university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya.
César Salgado Portillo, GradGov’s director of programming and member of the executive board, proposed the monthly donations to the Hoya Hub. Portillo said it is vital to address food insecurity on campus. 
“Something as basic as having three meals per day is a right that every student should have,” Portillo said in an interview with The Hoya. “Having this will help them focus more on their studies and worry a little less about what they’re going to eat.”
These budget additions represent the best of GradGov, according to Grasswick.
“I thought this was something that really demonstrated a lot about where the heart is for us who were working on that budget and GradGov in general,” Grasswick said.

Women’s engagement in the transition towards renewable energy is crucial to combating the climate crisis and promoting economic development, panelists said at a March 22 virtual event.
During the event, titled “Advancing an Inclusive Transition to Renewable Energy,” climate experts discussed the importance of involving women, thereby advancing gender equality while combating climate change. The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and the Permanent Mission of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to the United Nations hosted the event, which consisted of a panel moderated by Ambassador Melanne Verveer, executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS).
Women have fewer opportunities to join work regarding climate and security despite experiencing the issues of the climate crisis firsthand, according to Gillian Caldwell, deputy assistant administrator for climate and energy at the United States Agency for International Development, a government agency that administers development assistance internationally.
“They are very much on the front lines and don’t have the same resources that men have,” Caldwell said. “So, women are both more likely to find themselves in the crosshairs of the climate crisis and are the ones that are best situated to understand and advance the solutions. Even in cases where women and girls are not formally empowered to lead, they are leading.”
Women make up 80% of people displaced by climate change. Despite being disproportionately affected by the issue, women’s organizations receive only 0.2% of donations to environmental causes, according to a 2018 report published by the ​​Global Greengrants Fund, a charitable foundation that makes small grants to grassroots environmental causes around the world.
Gender diversity fosters innovation and should be a central component in the fight for a more sustainable society, according to Dr. Nawal Al-Hosany, representative of the UAE to the International Renewable Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organization supporting countries in their transition to sustainable energy.
“Women must have a seat at the table where the decisions about the long-term future of our planet are made,” Al-Hosany said. “To do this, we must integrate more women into the fields and sectors that will fuel and shape the world in the years to come. If we can do this, we can unlock the full potential of humanity and not just half of it.” 
In a review of 17 international studies, the inclusion of women in conservation and natural resource management efforts resulted in stricter and more sustainable extraction rules, greater compliance, more transparency, accountability and better conflict resolution.
Public policy that supports women innovating in the climate space is a necessary step toward combating the climate crisis, according to Olasimbo Sojinrin, country director of Solar Sister Nigeria, an organization devoted to investing in women-owned clean energy businesses in rural Africa.
“We’re working to see how we can enhance policy,” Sojinrin said. “So for us, one of the most pressing things that we’re working on is ensuring that we can amplify the voices of our women entrepreneurs so that their efforts and their challenges can get to the ears of policy makers. That needs to change. So last year, we hosted a national roundtable in Nigeria and Tanzania to enable policymakers and market environments to support women entrepreneurs.”
Women can also be empowered in the private sector through training and entrepreneurship programs, according to Sojinrin.
“To share specifically our assistance approach, we’re an organization that provides economic opportunity, training, technology and support to distribute a range of clean energy products in underserved communities,” Sojinrin says. “We do this by helping women launch clean energy businesses, and of course they are making an income.”
Actors in both the public and private sectors must involve women in climate action in order to best tackle the climate crisis, according to Verveer.
“If we’re going to address climate change with the urgency that is upon us, we really need to do more to accelerate the transition to renewable energy inclusively, where women can fully participate and move strongly in that direction,” Verveer said. “There’s clearly much work that needs to be done.”

Eight large-scale photographs are set up around the Georgetown neighborhood as an offshoot of the Kennedy Center’s documentary photography exhibition “COAL + ICE,” combining environmental activism, art and technology.
The Georgetown Business Improvement District (BID) worked alongside Dysturb and Magnum Foundation, a photography non-profit that serves as COAL + ICE’s art partners, to construct the photographs around M Street in the Georgetown neighborhood. 
The campaign, called #ReframeClimate, features photographs of the impact of climate change alongside interactive prompts and a QR code for the viewer to hear the image’s story from a mobile device. 
The #ReframeClimate exhibit will be visible from March 15 to April 22 in conjunction with the Kennedy Center’s “COAL + ICE” exhibit, bringing together the work of photographers and video artists from around the world to visualize the causes and consequences of the climate crisis.
Dysturb and Magnum Foundation have collaborated on the #ReframeClimate exhibition since its conception at the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, which featured 25 images adhered to public facing buildings and facades throughout Paris, according to Susan Meiselas of Magnum Foundation and Benjamin Petit, co-founder and chief operating officer of Dysturb.
“In unison with informative facts, we have been leveraging the voices of photographers — the people with eyes constantly on our world,” Meiselas and Petit wrote to The Hoya. “Both Dysturb and Magnum Foundation believe deeply in making photography accessible.”
While the original exhibition in Paris prompted viewers to send a text message and receive a phone call featuring the voice of the image’s photographer, the D.C. iteration of the exhibition shifted to use QR codes, given their increased use during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since many District residents may be unable to visit the Kennedy Center exhibition, the creators decided to construct the exhibition in the Georgetown neighborhood, where many people gather to shop and study, according to Meiselas and Petit.
“The goal of our collaborative activation remains the same: to challenge the notions of what climate change imagery looks like and spark dialogue amongst passersby through art with an innovative approach,” Meiselas and Petit wrote. 
The exhibit aligns with Georgetown BID’s goals of promoting public art and encouraging the exchange of ideas and thoughts, according to Nancy Miyahira, Vice President and Director of Marketing for the Georgetown BID.
“The Georgetown BID strives to make Georgetown a welcoming and inclusive place for visitors, illuminating the neighborhood’s unexpected experiences, places and people,” Miyahira wrote to The Hoya. “Georgetown’s history has always included the exchange of ideas and the promotion of arts and culture.”
Researchers from the Yale School of the Environment helped develop statements and statistics alongside each photograph intended to make passersby stop and reflect on the exhibit, according to Miselas and Petit.
Meiselas and Petit said visual reminders of the impact of the climate crisis are often more powerful than simply reading about it, thus underlining the importance of the #ReframeClimate photographs.
“We all read headlines about climate crisis, but these images can challenge stereotypes and expand conversations,” Meiselas and Petit wrote. “We want to encourage interactions between the people most impacted by environmental injustice with those who are distant, but have the potential to help more.”
Meiselas and Petit hope viewers of the exhibit will be reminded of the impact of climate change on humans, and the power to unite against the dangers it poses.
“With #ReframeClimate, we chose to focus our curation on the climate crisis impact on human communities,” Meiselas and Petit wrote. “We selected images by photographers from around the world which together remind us of how powerful we are together. All of us, along with our ideas, technologies, and cultural expressions, are intending to bring more focus to collective solutions and inspire more engagement with the issues our planet is facing.”

The future of Ukraine’s sovereignty is inextricably linked to United States foreign policy, panelists said at a March 22 event. 
The event, titled “War in Ukraine: What Next?”, featured international affairs experts, who discussed potential outcomes of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and how other countries can promote peace. 
Georgetown University’s department of government and Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice hosted the event as a part of this year’s Lannan Symposium, “Beyond Identity: Reimagining the American Narrative.”
While the conclusion of the conflict remains far off and uncertain, Russia’s inability to lessen financial restrictions supports the likelihood that Ukraine will maintain its sovereignty, according to José María Argueta, former ambassador and permanent representative of Guatemala to the Organization of American States (OAS). 
OAS is an international organization that was founded in 1948 to promote solidarity and security among its member states in the Americas. 
“In my mind, there are three scenarios: Putin wins, Ukraine wins, or there is a frozen long-term war,” Argueta said at the event. “However, ​​I do not believe that Russia has the economic capacity to support a long stalemate. Time is on the side of the Ukranians. If I were to choose one of three potential scenarios, I would go with Ukraine winning.”
Russian president Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, prompting the biggest military conflict in Europe since World War II. Since the invasion, 6.5 million Ukrainians have been displaced inside Ukraine, and 3.6 million Ukrainians have fled the country altogether. 
Western nations and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members must decide between interventionist or isolationist foreign policies, according to Mark Muller, senior mediation advisor to the United Nations (UN) Department of Political Affairs and UN special envoy to Syria.
“The fundamental question for European policymakers is whether or not you build a peace process around a Yalta-type solution, which is a recognition of spheres of influence, or whether you build it around the Helsinki Act-type approach of 1975, in which you recognize that every state is a sovereign state with the right to determine its own future and policy arrangements,” Muller said. “I don’t believe at this stage that the West has fundamentally answered this question.”
The Yalta Conference was a February 1945 meeting of the leaders of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union to discuss the post-World War II reorganization of Germany and broader Europe. 
The Helsinki Final Act was an agreement that 35 nations signed in August 1975, recognizing all borders in Central and Eastern Europe established since World War II.
The American value of democracy must be reevaluated and solidified to inform foreign policy, according to Tim Phillips, founder and CEO of Beyond Conflict, an international nonprofit organization that works toward conflict resolution and reconciliation around the world.
“Negotiation — this could happen between Russia and Ukraine, or Russia and the West,” Phillips said. “But there should be another negotiation within the United States about what we mean by democracy. What is it to have a democracy that represents the diversity of this nation? This is not the democracy of when the Cold War began or ended. If we are going to defend democracy, the negotiation has to start at home and not just in Europe.” 
Currently, 32% of Americans say the United States is providing about the right amount of support to Ukraine, while 42% say the United States should provide more support to Ukraine, according to a March Pew Research Center survey. 
Putin and his actions do not fully represent the Russian people, according to Argueta.
“This is Putin’s aggression. This is Putin’s invasion,” Argueta said. “Dictators do not reason from the national interest perspective; they reason from their personal interest perspective and from that of their enablers. Do not refer to what you are seeing as Russian aggression. Russian people are not the enemy. Putin and his enablers are the enemy.”
Putin has led Russia for 16 years and signed legislation allowing him to potentially stay in power until 2036. His public support rests on falsehoods propagated by state-controlled media and fear of the oppressive government. 
People around the world should consider their role in supporting Ukraine and realize the impact of various possible outcomes, according to Argueta. 
“Regarding the three potential outcomes of Putin winning, Ukraine winning, or a frozen war, I want professors and students to start thinking of what are the implications of each of those outcomes in each of their regions of expertise,” Argueta said. “What does it mean for Asia, Africa, Latin America?”

The Corp and the Georgetown University Asian American Student Association (AASA) launched a fundraiser to raise money for a local Asian and Pacific Islander (AAPI) LGBTQ group.  
All proceeds from The Corp’s sale of the Rainbow Fish drink, a flavored iced green tea, will go toward the Asian and Pacific Islander Queers United for Action (AQUA DC), a Washington, D.C.-based volunteer advocacy organization that supports queer and transgender members of the AAPI community through coalition building and support events. The fundraiser will run from March 16 to 31. 
Sales generated from the fundraiser will go toward AQUA DC’s operational expenses.
The Corp’s affinity group CorporAsian, a community space within the organization that supports The Corp’s AAPI members, helped organize the fundraiser. 
The frequent underrepresentation of AAPI LGBTQ community members in society was the primary motivation for the fundraiser, according to AASA co-president Keven Zhang (SFS ’22). 
“The LGBTQ experience is not something that’s usually super talked about in Asian American circles as much,” Zhang said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is choosing to look at a group that doesn’t always have the best representation. I think it’s going to just make people more aware of the whole thing.” 
AQUA DC supports increasing AAPI LGBTQ representation, Zhang said.  
The Corp and AASA decided on donating their proceeds to AQUA DC because of its focus on mental health issues, according to AASA co-head Emeline Ahn (COL ’23).  
“I think generally, mental health — there’s a huge stigma against that, but especially in the Asian community with generational problems,” Ahn said in an interview with The Hoya. “And also AQUA DC is a more local organization so we thought that our contributions, whatever we ended up giving to them, would be more impactful.” 
Representation of AAPI LGBTQ community members has often been overlooked in favor of the representation of non-white LGBTQ community members. Additionally, while LGBTQ and AAPI students often face unique challenges, little research has been done about the intersectional challenges LGBTQ AAPI students experience in their day-to-day lives. 
The Corp’s Vice President of People Operations Taotao Li (SFS ’22) said LGBTQ members of the AAPI community often feel stigmatized and struggle to find community. 
“Non-straight identities are very stigmatized, and are very stigmatized within the AAPI community and they often struggle to express their true selves or find a community within the AAPI community,” Li said in an interview with The Hoya.  
Li said the fundraiser supports The Corp’s values. 
“This is in line with The Corp’s mission of ‘students serving students,’ but also giving back to the Georgetown and D.C. community in ways that we can,” Li said.
In the past, AQUA DC has organized community programming events including hiking trips, book clubs, game nights, support groups and speaker engagement events. 
The Rainbow Fish drink was chosen for the fundraiser because it best captured the goals of the event, according to Ahn.  
“It was symbolic of the organization that we’re supporting. But also that the weather’s getting warmer, we knew when around the timeline we wanted to roll this out and so we thought to boost proceeds, it would be a good iced tea drink,” Ahn said. 
Li recognizes that in the past The Corp has received criticism for neglecting to reach out to student groups beyond hiring outreach events. 
“A very valid criticism that we’ve gotten in the past is, ‘You kind of reach out to groups to do hiring outreach events, and then that’s kind of it,’” Li said. “So we’re hoping that this, in some form, constitutes a meaningful follow-up to more durable relationships with campus groups.” 
AQUA DC did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment in time for publication. 
Although The Corp and AASA have not worked with AQUA DC before, the groups look forward to strengthening their relationship with the organization in the future, according to Zhang. 
“We knew that they were super active and we could see where exactly money would be going towards, which we really liked,” Zhang said. “We’re hoping to keep doing stuff with them in the future.”

Richard Garzola (LAW ’23) will become the 56th national chair of the National Black Law Students Association (NBLSA), a national organization founded to support Black and minority attorneys across the United States. 
Garzola, who currently serves as the vice chair of NBLSA, will begin his one-year term as national chair April 1 where he will lead the National Chapter of NBLSA. Garzola is currently a student at the Georgetown University Law Center (GULC).
Throughout his time as an undergraduate student at Florida State University, Garzola advocated for minority students’ rights, spearheading protests against the white supremacist organization League of the South and participating in rallies in support of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. In 2018, Garzola ran for public office for the Tallahassee City Commission Seat 3. He later lost the election. 
Garzola said his experience with activism has prepared him for the national chair role. 
“All those experiences have prepared me for moments like being at Georgetown when we face a lack of support from our administration at times in regards to our arguments being met or not as Black law students, but also understanding that we just want to be heard,” Garzola said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Earlier this year, Garzola assisted students in the protests against Ilya Shapiro, an incoming GULC administrator who was put under investigation following his racist and sexist tweets related to President Biden’s announcement that he would nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court. 
Garzola said he plans to hold Georgetown administrators accountable for their response to student concerns about Shapiro. 
“We just haven’t heard anything since when there was, for lack of better words, noise around the situation, once things kind of calmed down and spring break. There really hasn’t been a lot of communication from administration down,” Garzola said.
Current NBLSA National Chair Simone Yhap said Garzola is the best option for the role because of his ability to expand the organization. 
“As the people’s chair, Richard will reinvigorate our membership by providing a number of strategic programs that not only provide exposure to different legal sectors, but opportunities for personal and professional growth through mentorship,” Yhap wrote to The Hoya. 
NBLSA, which was founded in 1968, currently has over 6,000 active-member law students and holds over 200 chapters for students in law schools nationally. 
Garzola’s success within the NBLSA, single-handedly raising over $100,000 for the organization this year and advancing scholarship opportunities within the organization, is inspiring, according to Yhap. 
The Georgetown community is proud of Garzola’s work and looks forward to seeing what he does in his new role, GULC Dean William Treanor said. 
“This is a wonderful and very fitting recognition of Richard and his many accomplishments as a rising leader in the national law student community,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He already is an important voice in the Black community and an accomplished champion for equity, opportunity, and inclusion. We are very proud he will be representing Georgetown Law and Black law students nationwide.”
In his role as national chair, Garzola plans to create a national mentorship program to help first-generation students.
“A lot of our members are first-generation students, so that’s something that I saw as a gap that I want to fill,” Garzola said. “This would be a national mentorship program where it’s a structured program monthly where they would talk about different topics, but also provide opportunities remotely, because the space we’re in both socially one time a year to meet in person.” 
One of his goals is to expand pre-law scholarships for first-generation students as well as to pay for Law School Admission Test prep and bar exam prep, according to Garzola. He also hopes to host the first in-person NBLSA National Convention in three years so the group can come together again. 
As national chair, Garzola said he will make the voices of Black GULC students heard. 
“If someone’s not being remorseful for a racist action, that shows that they don’t apologize for anything, and they think that they’re going to get away with this behavior, and it’ll be repeated,” Garzola said. “As a national figurehead, I have to step into most situations and assist the students and make sure they’re being heard.”
