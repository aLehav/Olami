Nicolo Ferretti (SFS ’21) and Bryce Badger (MSB ’21) were elected as the 2020-21 Georgetown University Student Association president and vice president alongside the passage of three referenda Feb. 6.
Ferretti and Badger finished ahead of student activists Arisaid Gonzalez Porras (COL ’21) and Anahi Figueroa-Flores (COL ’21) and GUSA Senator Joshua Marin-Mora (SFS ’21) by a majority in the first round. The referenda for Georgetown University’s divestment from fossil fuels, a Blue Campus designation and the Student Empowerment Fund all received more than two-thirds votes in favor, according to the GUSA Election Commission.
Ferretti and Badger were the only eligible ticket on the ballot when the campaign season started before three more campaigns joined the race by petition. Over the course of the cycle, executive candidates Julio Salmeron-Perla (SFS ’22) and Gabby Elliott Brault (SFS ’21) withdrew their ticket and Isbel Deleon (COL ’21), Marin-Mora’s running mate, dropped out Feb. 3.
Ferretti expressed high hopes and a desire to fulfill his campaign’s promises to the student body in an interview with The Hoya minutes after results were released.
“I think you’re about to see a GUSA that’s really getting stuff done and trying to bring as many people in as possible, and that excites the hell out of me,” Ferretti said.
The pair of GUSA veterans focused their campaign on issues of sustainability, sexual assault prevention and inclusivity. Among their first priorities while in office is communicating with sexual assault survivors, particularly in the Black and queer communities, to address their concerns, Badger said in an interview with The Hoya.
During the campaign, the team touted their extensive GUSA experience and stressed their commitment to communicating with and advocating for the student body.
Days before the election, 47.7% of students polled by The Hoya indicated they would cast their first-choice vote for Ferretti and Badger. This year, 5.9% of students indicated strong trust in GUSA, marking an increase from 2% in 2019.
Ferretti and Badger both work under the Francis-Olvera administration. Ferretti serves as director of university affairs. During his tenure, Ferretti helped facilitate the Capital Bikeshare student membership program and coordinated with the university to refashion the university website.
Badger works as chief of staff for the Francis-Olvera administration. Previously, Badger worked as student engagement director for former GUSA President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19), who resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct.
Gonzalez Porras and Figueroa-Flores hoped to use their experience in activism to enhance overlooked student perspectives and bridge a gap in trust between GUSA and the student body.
Gonzalez Porras expressed excitement for Ferretti and Badger and hopes to contribute to their administration.
“I’m excited for Nico and Bryce. I think they are going to do a great job and hopefully they reach out to us with the activism summit because I think we would be a great addition to it,” Gonzalez Porras said. “I never thought I would be running for GUSA and here I am, and now I have something to share if I ever have children.”
In his campaign, Marin-Mora emphasized the importance of socioeconomic inclusivity and mental health resources, issues he believes are often overlooked by GUSA.
Marin-Mora is confident that the Ferretti-Badger administration will effectively advocate for students.
“I think that they are both very dedicated,” Marin-Mora said in an interview to The Hoya. “I think that they are both going to fight for students, and I have no doubt that we’ll be seeing change in the upcoming year.”
Ferretti announced his ticket’s support of all three referenda in the presidential debates Feb. 3.
A referendum attached to the executive election to encourage the university to divest from fossil fuel investments, pushed by student activist group GU Fossil Free, passed with 90.65% of the vote. The victory comes after the university announced that the board of directors had voted to begin the divestment process.
A large margin of victory demonstrates the strength of student enthusiasm for the issue, according to Victoria Boatwright (COL ’22), a member of GUFF.
“I think that the turnout and overwhelming support was representative of how many people care about the issue of the climate crisis and socially responsible investing but also more importantly of how hard our team campaigned and how many people became engaged with the initiative,” Boatwright wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “The results of the referendum and the outcome of the Board of Directors meeting together have totally blown me away.” 
A second referendum to promote greater university commitment to environmental sustainability and protection of ocean habitats by designating Georgetown as a Blue Campus also passed with 93.72% of the vote.
The passage of the Blue Campus referendum is an important step in demanding greater university action and accountability regarding environmental issues, according to GUSA Sustainability Chair Rowlie Flores (COL ’22).
“I think protecting our oceans start with realizing that our university plays a significant role in climate change through our policies and practices,” Flores wrote in an email to The Hoya. “And the student body did just that! With more than 93% of the vote, students have shown that they do care about the environment and they demand more institutional changes.”
A third referendum asked students about the creation of a fund to bankroll large student projects on campus. The fund would allocate approximately $50,000 from the $1.09 million collected by the student activities fee every year to a student-run endowment.
The passage of the referendum will help the GUSA Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee better manage Student Activity Fee funds and support student initiatives on campus, Senator Eric Bazail Eimil (SFS ’23) wrote in a message to The Hoya.
“This referendum passing is a huge step for the Georgetown student body,” Bazail wrote. “It’ll help us more effectively spend the revenues from the Student Activity Fee and it’ll help magnify student voices so we can be even bigger stakeholders in the future and evolution of the Hilltop.”

We won’t be able to afford any once your outrageously expensive policies are imposed on the student body.

This article directly references content that is potentially upsetting. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The Georgetown University Graduate Student Government has initiated the process to impeach current Vice President Heerak Kim after the surfacing of tweets the organization deemed unacceptable.
GradGov received a complaint from a graduate student Jan. 18, which alerted the organization to a number of homophobic, antisemitic, Islamophobic and racist tweets posted to Kim’s public Twitter account, according to second-year graduate student in the School of Foreign Service and GradGov President Lewis May. The GradGov executive board then released a statement to the GradGov Senate on Feb. 1 unanimously condemning the tweets and calling for Kim’s impeachment.
The executive board attached to the statement a complete Excel sheet download of all of Kim’s tweets should the tweets be deleted or the account be made private. The statement also directly included several screenshots of posts from Kim’s Twitter account, such as the following Jan. 1 and Jan. 6 tweets.  
“Will God give cancer to politicians at local, state, and federal levels who aggressively push gay marriage, trying to lead Americans away from Bible Ethics condemning gay marriage as evil? God can mutate any cell in human body to become cancerous. Choice,” a Jan 1. tweet read.
“What may happen if Iran attacks USA? Democrats and Republicans can be united in declaring War on Iran and putting Muslim Americans in concentration camps as they did during World War 2,” a Jan. 6 tweet read. “It is a good idea for Muslim Americans to invest in projecting the image of USA patriotism.”
While the GradGov Constitution does not explicitly stipulate what constitutes inappropriate conduct, Kim’s tweets stand in direct opposition to GradGov’s overarching mission of creating a safe and welcoming campus environment, according to May.
“This is not appropriate for a member of the board, and that this absolutely has the potential to undermine GradGov’s broader reputational integrity,” May said in an interview with The Hoya. “While we respect his freedom of speech as an individual, as a student leader, regardless of whether it’s on or off campus, this is a serious breach of conduct.”
Kim, a second-year master’s student in the School of Nursing and Health Studies, avoided repeated requests for a meeting to discuss his tweets during the week of Jan. 20, according to May. When Kim attended the Jan. 30 GradGov Senate meeting, May said he pulled Kim aside and confronted him with the allegations.
“I said, ‘You committed hate speech, and you’ve hurt and scared a lot of people in here, and you need to leave,’” May said. “‘I cannot have you in this senate meeting.’”
In response, Kim denied wrongdoing, claiming that none of his tweets qualified as hate speech, according to May.
On Jan. 31, Kim called for a public apology from May for his conduct at the meeting the day before in an email sent to the GradGov executive board. May’s conduct at the meeting was physically aggressive, shocking and humiliating, Kim wrote in the email obtained by The Hoya. 
“When I arrived at the GradGov Meeting for January 2020, and walked to the podium area, and greeted you and shook your hand, you pushed me across the room and out of the room,” Kim wrote. “In the hallway, you spoke very loudly, even yelling at times, saying, ‘You engaged in hate speech!’, an accusation which I denied to you verbally.  But you kept saying this over and over again loudly, in the hearing range of GradGov Senators.”
May blocked the entrance to the meeting room, not allowing Kim to enter the senate meeting, according to Kim.
“The fact that you tried to block a legitimately elected Vice President of Graduate Student Government (GradGov) from attending GradGov Senate Meeting is an unacceptable behavior,” Kim wrote. “Acting with physical aggression and verbal aggression are conducts that are not in keeping with what is expected of students at Georgetown University, let alone a GradGov President.”
Kim is referencing an instance in which May poked him in the chest, according to May. 
“Apparently at one point in the conversation I, like, booped him in the chest, sort of for emphasis, and he was like, ‘Oh, you physically assaulted me,’ and then called for my resignation,” May said.
Shortly after Kim sent out his email, the GradGov executive board sent a letter to Kim requesting his resignation. The timing of the two events proves that May requested Kim’s resignation as revenge, Kim wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The demand for resignation was emailed to me on Saturday, February 1, 2020, and represents retaliation for my having reported GradGov Lewis May for physical assault of me,” Kim wrote. “GradGov President Lewis May is angry and his violence is motivated by his bias against my conservative evangelical Christian faith and values.”
Kim has since filed a police report against May, alleging physical assault.
After Kim denied the request for his resignation, the GradGov executive board decided to move forward with soliciting a petition from GradGov senators to push for Kim’s impeachment, the executive board wrote in the Feb. 1 statement.
“The Executive Board of the Graduate Student Government unanimously condemns the statements and has called for him to resign. Mr. Kim has refused to do so, citing baseless claims of political and personal persecution,” the statement read. “We plan to take every necessary measure to assure that GradGov fulfills its mandate as an inclusive, supportive, and welcoming organization that represents the diversity of Georgetown students.”
To begin impeachment proceedings, a written petition signed by two-thirds of GradGov senators must be submitted to the chair of the Internal Affairs Committee, according to the GradGov Constitution. The chair would then hold an impeachment hearing at the next senate meeting, at which the officer facing impeachment would have an opportunity to rebut all claims against them. A simple majority of those present can vote to remove the officer from his post.
The petition was sent out Feb. 3 and has garnered 54 out of the 60 needed signatures as of Thursday night, according to GradGov Director of Advocacy Henry Watson, a first-year doctoral student in the department of government, who was appointed by May to manage the impeachment process.
Kim’s comments on his Twitter have made him unfit to serve as a student leader, according to Watson.
“We hope that this will be taken care of expeditiously, but I wouldn’t want to set a definite timeline,” Watson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It all depends on getting to 60 signatures, which we remain short of.”
Kim, who ran unopposed, was elected as vice president in 2019. Kim also serves as president of the Georgetown Collaborative Diplomacy Initiative, a diplomacy-focused graduate student organization, and is running for U.S. Congress in Virginia’s 8th District.
Other graduate organizations have also denounced Kim’s Twitter activity, according to third-year doctoral student in the department of linguistics and GradPride President Nick Mararac.
“GradPride and Spectra Alliance stand with GradGov in condemning the racist, homophobic, antimuslim, and anisemitic tweets by Heerak Kim and support any initatives to impeach him,” Mararac wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We don’t believe such views align with the Jesuit principle of cura personalis nor with our expectations of the Georgetown University community.”
Kim cannot remain as vice president for an inclusive organization that is dedicated to celebrating diversity, May said. 
“We as GradGov, this is not our values,” May said. “We are an inclusive organization that’s working to promoting students in a way that’s absolutely anathema to the messages Heerak wrote on his Twitter.”
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia has since dropped all criminal charges against May. Read our coverage here.

A person with such a misguided moral compass should not be in the school of nursing, where respecting all people is a mandatory job skill, much less leading this student group.  I agree with the principle of free speech, but not when hate is involved.  Remove this person from a leadership role.   This is no way to lead and represent all constituents.

Unfortunately, Kim made unacceptable comments about the alleged behavior of international students coming from certain countries during the 2019 international students orientation. Very sad! I would also state that his “Christian” values go against the very Christian values of this institution. Social justice, respect, and many other Jesuit values that he is apparently not fond of.

Kim is a hero for not letting these hateful loons push him around.  Too bad he’ll be dealing with DC area courts.

Georgetown University’s board of directors approved a policy to divest the university’s endowment from fossil fuel investments within 10 years, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) announced in a Feb. 6 campuswide email.
As well as divesting from fossil fuel investments, the policy encourages new investments in renewable energy and prohibits any future investments in fossil fuel companies. Direct investment in public fossil fuel assets will be phased out within the next five years, while direct private fossil fuel investments will be phased out within the next 10 years. The university’s decision comes after an eight-year campaign from GU Fossil Free, a student group that advocated for the university to divest from fossil fuels.
The board’s decision comes on the same day as the Georgetown University Student Association referendum on whether to support the university’s divestment from fossil fuel companies by 2024. The referendum passed by an overwhelming 90.7%.
Georgetown’s decision to divest from fossil fuel investments is an encouraging outcome for the entire Georgetown community, according to Lucy Chatfield (COL ’22), a member of GUFF. 
“The whole process of campaigning for the referendum has gotten the student body engaged in thinking about divestment and we’ve gotten to reach a lot more people,” Chatfield said. “I think that this announcement from Georgetown will mean a lot more to people now that we’ve been going through this process and having this dialogue on campus.”
GUFF had submitted a proposal Jan. 17, 2019, to Georgetown’s Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, a group of university representatives in charge of amending Georgetown’s investment practices, that called on Georgetown to not directly invest in fossil fuels in the future and to divest the endowment from fossil fuels by Jan. 1, 2024. 
The board’s decision to divest is a testament to GUFF’s persistent and effective activism, according to Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environment Network President Noelle Gignoux (SFS ’22).
‘It’s absolutely incredible that the university has finally committed to fully divesting from fossil fuels,” Gignoux said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s incredible that they have finally taken that leap, to make this move, which is good for the university and good for the planet.”
Currently, less than 5% of the $1.9 billion university endowment is invested in fossil fuel companies, according to a Georgetown University Official.
Despite the university’s commitment to divest from fossil fuel investments within 10 years, the policy allows some of Georgetown’s investments to maintain links to fossil fuels. The policy states that the university can review investments that are not direct, which can include large funds with very diversified investments across industries, on a case-by-case basis. 
GUFF included a similar provision in its proposal to the university in January 2019, according to GUFF member Victoria Boatwright (COL ’22).
“There are many companies that are invested in fossil fuels and are engaged in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, but are trying to move to a more renewable future,” Boatwright said in an interview with The Hoya. “In some cases it is more important to evaluate the fund as a whole and just see that it is moving in the right direction.”
Georgetown has assessed its endowment’s holdings in the past, as it previously divested from coal in 2015 and from tar sand extraction in 2018. Additionally, the university’s 2017 Socially Responsible Investment policy ensures that Georgetown’s investments are in line with its commitment to the planet and social justice. The policy instructs Georgetown to avoid investments in companies whose practices have significantly harmful effects on the environment.
The decision to divest from fossil fuels aligns with the university’s Jesuit values and informs the pressing conversation surrounding climate change, according to DeGioia.
“The work of understanding and responding to the demands of climate change is urgent and complex,” DeGioia wrote in the email. “We all share in the responsibility to be caring stewards of the environment and to engage the resources of our tradition and the strengths of our communities in our pursuit of the common good.”
Advocating for socially responsible investments by Georgetown and making Georgetown’s board of directors aware of pressing climate issues demonstrated how much students care about both their community and the climate, according to Boatwright.
“It’s been so exciting to watch this whole process and see how many students care about this and are engaged with it and have given us positive feedback and responses,” Boatwright said. “It’s really encouraging to see a student body that can be really well aligned and become advocates.”
GUFF will advocate for Georgetown to maintain its commitment to divestment in a transparent way, according to Olivia Torbert (SFS ’20).
“This isn’t the end for GU Fossil Free — we’re now super excited to begin working with the administration to make sure how this is implemented is in a really great and efficient way,” Torbert said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’re excited to not end right now, but to start.”

Georgetown University revoked the room reservation for an abortion education workshop planned by pro-abortion rights student group H*yas for Choice on Jan. 21, forcing the event to take place off campus.
HFC received an email from the university saying that the room reservation had been retracted Jan. 20. President of HFC Talia Parker (COL ’20) then attempted to rebook the room, but received another email from the Center of Student Engagement asking to meet. At this meeting, Parker and Vice President of HFC Chad Gasman (COL ’20) were told that the workshop could not be held on campus.
After the university’s revocation of HFC’s room reservation, HFC decided to host the workshop at a downtown Washington, D.C., location instead and offered to cover transportation costs for students who still wished to attend, according to a Jan. 21 Facebook post from HFC announcing the location change.
As a Jesuit institution, Georgetown does not allow abortion demonstrations on campus, according to a university spokesperson.
“Consistent with our Catholic and Jesuit identity, Georgetown University does not support or allow for the demonstration or training of abortion procedures in any classroom or reservable space on our campus,” the university spokesperson said. “The student organizers of a planned event were notified that the ‘Papaya Workshop’ was not permitted to take place in reservable campus spaces.”
Student groups that directly and substantially advocate positions inconsistent with Roman Catholic moral tradition are not eligible to receive university funding or reserve university spaces, according to Georgetown’s Access to Benefits policy, which identifies benefits granted to student organizations in addition to stipulating criteria that student organizations must meet to be granted these benefits.
Although HFC is an unrecognized student group, it should still receive equal protection under Georgetown’s Speech and Expression Policy, which promotes the ideal of free discourse, according to Parker.
“I believe that in cancelling our room reservation based on the content of our event, Georgetown undoubtedly violated the free speech policy,” Parker wrote. “The free speech policy is meant to protect students and faculty from censorship based on Catholic values. If everything that happened on Georgetown’s campus had to comply with Catholic doctrine, we would not have GU Pride or the LGBTQ Center, for example.”
GU Right to Life, a student organization which works to protect human life from conception to natural death, expressed support for the university’s decision to cancel the workshop in a statement on Facebook on Jan. 22. The cancellation of the workshop demonstrates the university’s continued dedication to the anti-abortion cause, according to President of Right to Life Flo Martinez Addiego (COL ’20).
“The attempt to host the ‘Papaya Workshop’ on campus was incredibly disheartening given that it aimed to dehumanize and normalize the killing of the pre-born,” Etscorn wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We commend the University for their commitment to the defense of the dignity of human life by preventing this workshop from occurring on campus.”
Last year, the university prevented another unrecognized graduate student group, Medical Students for Choice, from hosting a “Papaya Workshop” at the School for Medicine.
The university’s decision to revoke the room reservation for the workshop adheres to the Catholic values that the university has always upheld, according to Etscorn.
“The decision the University made was consistent with their response on the medical campus when med students in 2019 tried to have a similar event and Dean Mitchell cancelled it,” Etscorn wrote. “We do not believe that this infringes on HFCs free speech ability because Georgetown is Catholic, Jesuit institution and as a result upholds teachings that are consistent with its identity.”
HFC has hosted many events on campus in the past, and the university has not previously prohibited the group from reserving rooms for any event, according to Parker. The university’s decision to stop the event from taking place on campus was unacceptable, according to Parker.
“Since I have been a part of H*yas for Choice (for the past 4 years), I don’t think Georgetown has ever cancelled one of our room reservations like this,” Parker wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While H*yas for Choice is an unrecognized organization, we have rights as students that are supposed to protect us from what the university did.”
This article has been updated to correctly attribute a quotation and clarify the mission of GURTL.

The National Science Foundation has renamed a major new observatory after Georgetown University graduate and astrophysicist Vera Rubin (GRD ’54), making it the first national U.S. observatory to be named after a female astronomer.
The observatory, formerly known as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, will now be called the NSF Vera C. Rubin Observatory to recognize the contributions Rubin made in providing evidence of the existence of dark matter, according to a Jan. 7 news release from the NSF. 
Renaming the observatory after Rubin is a great way to memorialize her achievements in the field of astronomy, according to the Chair of the Georgetown University physics department, Jeff Urbach.
“Her research really laid the groundwork for the realization that visible matter didn’t make up the majority of what’s out there,” Urban said in an interview with The Hoya. “Now the community understands the importance of what she has done, and this was a way to recognize that.”
The observatory, which is located on Cerro Pachón in Chile, will begin operations in 2022, according to the Jan. 7 news release. The observatory will help complete the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, a 10-year survey of the visible sky, and will aim to advance what is known about dark energy and dark matter.
A national observatory named after a female astronomer exemplifies the capabilities of women in STEM, NSF director France Córdova wrote in a news release on the NSF website.
“The Rubin name will have yet another way to inspire women and men eager to investigate,” Córdova wrote. “Named after an astronomer who provided important evidence of the existence of dark matter, the NSF Vera C. Rubin Observatory seems destined to make science history with its extraordinary capabilities that will come to bear in the next few years.”
As part of her research, Rubin studied the behavior of spiral galaxies, according to NPR. Under previous assumptions that all matter is visible, celestial bodies farther away from the center of the galaxy should travel slower. However, Rubin observed certain bodies moving faster than expected, suggesting that there must be unseeable matter, otherwise known as dark matter, influencing these planetary speeds.
Rubin’s accomplishments in the field of astronomy make her the perfect individual to name the observatory after, according to Sarah Jiang (COL ’21), a student researcher in the Georgetown physics department.
“It makes sense that someone who was so instrumental in the field of astrophysics would have an observatory named after her. It’s just surprising that it took this long,” Jiang said in an interview with The Hoya. 
After receiving her Ph.D. from Georgetown in 1954, Rubin returned to the university and served as a professor and a researcher. In June 2019, three years after Rubin’s death, Georgetown hosted the Vera Rubin Symposium to bring together leading astrophysicists to celebrate Rubin’s legacy in the field. 
Scientific organizations should celebrate the successes of women, especially women in fields of study where they are historically underrepresented, according to Georgetown University Astronomical Society President Laura Caron (SFS ’20). 
“I think the NSF and other scientific institutions have a duty to recognize all people who have made significant scientific contributions,” Caron wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Women and other disadvantaged groups should be recognized for their contributions as well as for the challenges they have faced in the field.”
Honoring Rubin’s impact is an important step in recognizing the contributions of women to various academic fields, according to C.C. Borzilleri (COL ’19), who led efforts to memorialize Georgetown graduates in a 2019 exhibit in Hoya Court. (Full disclosure: Borzilleri formerly served on the editorial board for The Hoya.)“Bringing women out of historical obscurity is an important step towards making sure that they can be seen and admired for all that they have done,” Borzilleri wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The physical memorialization of women, on Georgetown’s campus and throughout the world, is a mission far from complete, but the progress of the Dr. Rubin Observatory is an important step forward.”

Georgetown University and many of its study abroad partner programs in China have worked to coordinate new spring semester plans for students affected by program cancellations after rising concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
The university suspended all Chinese study abroad programs and university-related travel to China on Jan. 28 after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of State raised their travel advisories Jan. 27 to recommend travelers avoid nonessential travel and reconsider travel to China. Seven Georgetown students were affected by the program cancellations, according to study abroad adviser for Chinese programs Philip Kafalas.
After the sudden and unexpected cancellation of study abroad programs, Georgetown hopes to support students through this transition period, according to a university spokesperson.
“The university is working with all students affected by this travel moratorium individually to coordinate appropriate alternate plans and ensure academic continuity,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The university has been helpful in its efforts to reintegrate students who wish to return to Georgetown for the remainder of the spring semester, according to Andrew Kaplan (SFS ’21), who had originally planned on studying at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing through The Beijing Center program.
“Georgetown has actually been fantastic about the transition, and I was a little bit surprised because I knew that they didn’t have a specific policy already in place and that this was a pretty unusual situation,” Kaplan said. “Once I got back to the U.S., I flew straight to D.C. and I met with my dean, I think it was the next day, and I started picking out classes with him. He was able to email each of the professors for the courses I was interested in taking and all of them individually approved me to join their class three to four weeks late.”
Many of Georgetown’s study abroad partner programs in China have also been working closely with students, prioritizing their safety and well-being, according to Associate Director of Marketing for TBC John Sember.
“The Beijing Center helped to facilitate students’ departure from China, made transportation arrangements from campus to the airport, provided masks, water and snacks, shared information and updates on the illness, and encouraged students to take a 14-day self-quarantine upon returning home,” Sember wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The swift decision to cancel was necessary in order to safely get all the students back home before the coronavirus infections spiked in numbers.”
Programs such as TBC and the Council of International Educational Exchange have been providing students with alternate options for the remainder of their spring semester, according to Sember.
“Many partner universities of The Beijing Center have been working closely with students to provide them with some options in this unique, emergency situation,” Sember wrote. “For example, joining another exchange program, enrolling late into courses at their home university and catching up on missed work, or taking this spring semester off and resuming studies next semester.”
The option to attend other programs ensures academic continuity for students, according to Chloe Tan (MSB ’21). Tan, who was originally enrolled in the CIEE Shanghai program, will now be attending a CIEE program in London.
“Overall, my alternative program will be the same dates and under the same itinerary as the original Shanghai program, so luckily there’s not too many changes to my semester schedule,” Tan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I do not have any significant changes to my class schedule and I’ll be able to graduate on time.”
Despite the suspension of Chinese study abroad programs for the semester, programs for future semesters remain unaffected for now as research into the coronavirus epidemic continues, according to Sember.
“TBC is very sorry that this unexpected event has impacted the spring 2020 program and we hope to welcome the students again in the future once the coronavirus is resolved,” Sember wrote. “We still plan to run our summer and fall 2020 programs, but we will continue to monitor the coronavirus situation closely.”

The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service held its first-ever trip to a caucus, bringing select students to Des Moines, Iowa, on Feb. 3 to observe the Iowa caucus.
Over the course of the four-day trip, the six students with GU Politics had opportunities to meet with campaign staff, according to Kira Macauley (COL ’20), one of the students chosen through an application process to attend the caucus. Students met with Lis Smith, the senior communications advisor for former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s campaign, and Symone Sanders, senior advisor for former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign.
At the Iowa caucus, voters at designated precincts select their preferred candidate in two caucus rounds. A candidate must obtain at least 15% of the total precinct ground to receive delegates.
GU Politics organized the trip to allow students to get a glimpse into Iowa’s distinctive primary process, according to GU Politics Chief of Staff Carly Henry.
“We considered all of the four early primary states when we decided to plan an experiential trip and felt that Iowa was really the one we wanted to focus on because of its unique caucus experience,” Henry said in an interview with The Hoya. 
This year, Iowa Democratic Party officials decided to report caucus results through a new online app in an effort to simplify reporting precinct results across the state. After technical issues including WiFi shortages and overcrowded phone lines, this new reporting method caused extreme delays, according to CNN. 
Watching the system fall apart after four years of planning a process to streamline reporting results was frustrating, Macauley wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“It was great to see that the new rules and procedures allowed the caucus to be more accessible and have a physical paper trail, but the incompetency of the Iowa Democratic Party to collect and verify the results quickly may affect their ability to one, go first next cycle, and two, make more changes to improve the caucus next cycle,” Macauley wrote. 
Eight students enrolled in a spring 2020 government course also attended the Iowa caucus. The course, titled “Presidential Nominations Lab,” gives accepted students the opportunity to visit early contest states to study the U.S. presidential nomination system.
Over the course of their five-day field trip, the students attended conferences and candidate events and recorded data at the caucus site itself, according to Adam Ginsburg (COL ’21), a student enrolled in the class.
“The trip was exceptional,” Ginsburg wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We got the opportunity to observe presentations from top scholars in political science, see seven major presidential candidates at rallies, and attend actual precinct caucuses. The fact that we were able to marry the academic with the practical made for an illuminating experience.”
As of Thursday night, Buttigieg led in the polls with 59 counties and 26.2% of total district and state delegates, according to the New York Times. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) trailed second with 19 counties and 26.1% of delegates, with 99% of precincts reporting.
Buttigieg’s confidence was evident both leading up to the vote and in his speech waiting for the results, according to Grace Xu (SFS ’23), who attended the caucus with GU Politics. 
“I think the way that he really had his victory speech planned out was very effective,” Xu said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think by having the confidence and kind of projecting hope was really effective for his campaign and his supporters because it was really just celebrating the moment of having so much support in that room.”
Prior to the caucus, students traveling to Iowa published their predictions in an article with On The Record, a publication sponsored by GU Politics, about which candidates they felt would first achieve viability among caucus attendees.
Both Xu and Grace Shevchenko (SFS ’22) ranked candidates with Sanders in the lead, followed by Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), according to the article published by On The Record. 
Although she did not predict Buttigieg would come out of the caucus in the lead, Shevchenko said she was impressed with his campaign efforts. 
“The people who were canvassing for him were so dedicated and he really made the campaign about them in his speeches rather than making it about himself which was really powerful for his campaign,” Shevchenko said.
In addition to hearing from many of the candidate’s campaigns, students also attended a reelection campaign rally for President Donald Trump, according to Macauley. 
While the focus of the trip to Iowa was on the Democratic nominees, it was important to recognize both sides of the election, Macauley wrote. 
“GU Politics believes that you can’t tell the whole story without seeing both sides, and this was one way to show it,” Macauley wrote. “We also spoke to many Iowans who said they weren’t caucusing because they were Trump supporters, hearing why they would support the President in the next election helped give us context for what’s really going on in Iowa, and understand the power of incumbency when it comes to elections.”
Beyond attending the Trump rally, students heard from the people of Iowa themselves, whether they were staunch supporters of a particular candidate or someone trying to make a decision 48 hours before they went to caucus, Henry said. 
“You can see through the photos and everything they’ve posted that they’ve met some incredible people and had some real off-the-record conversations with senior political officials,” Henry said. “But what we also wanted them to get out of the trip was understanding what was going on in the sentiment of voters.”

Students voted on whether to create a Student Empowerment Fund on Feb. 6 after the Georgetown University Student Association passed the referendum proposal at their weekly meeting Feb. 2.
The fund would be used by future classes of Georgetown University students to bankroll large campus projects and events. The GUSA Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee would annually allocate $50,000 from the approximately $1.3 million Student Activity Fee budget to create the fund at the beginning of the 2021 fiscal year and continue adding funds for the next 15 years. 
The referendum results were not available at the time of publication. 
The fund would be expected to grow to $1.3 million by 2036 with regular mandated allotments at an approximate interest rate of 3%, according to FinApp Committee member Peter Hamilton (COL ’20). The senate will not be able to withdraw funds from the endowment until 2036, when the university begins a new cycle of campus construction plans, according to the referendum proposal. 
The referendum appeared on the ballot of the GUSA Executive elections Feb. 6, alongside two more referenda addressing divestment from fossil fuels and ocean preservation practices. 
The FinApp Committee originally circulated a petition through social media two weeks ago to gauge student support for the fund. FinApp members decided to propose a referendum to further advertise the idea to the student body, according to FinApp Committee Chair and Senator Juliana Arias (SFS ’20).
“It was a good way of putting it out there so that students could see what we’re doing right now,” Arias said in an interview with The Hoya. “It is mostly a way to publicize it.”
Twenty senators voted in favor of the referendum proposal, with only one senator voting against. Eleven senators, including GUSA presidential candidate Joshua Marin-Mora (SFS ’21), collaborated to introduce the referendum.  
GUSA began setting aside funds from the Student Activity Fee in 2001 to sustain club funding over the long term. In 2010, GUSA transformed the fund into an endowment to bankroll campus projects. Students decided to use the fund to help finance the establishment of the Healey Family Student Center in 2011. 
The fund would offer students a valuable mechanism to influence important campus projects and advocate for student interests on an institutional level, according to the resolution proposal. 
“The student body showed its commitment to campus improvement and had a measurable impact through our financial buy-in to the project. In the future, if we seek to replicate the success of the HFSC, we must be willing to make a similar financial investment,” the resolution read. “As demonstrated by the university and the student body, both win when students are given agency in campus planning. The SEF will grant us such agency.”
The fund would enable GUSA to streamline its finances to projects that will have the most direct, positive impact on students, according to GUSA Senator Eric Bazail-Eimil (SFS ’23).
“Student money is being wasted by inefficiencies across the system and the loss of these funds hurts students in the long-run,” Bazail-Eimil wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “Money speaks on this campus and if we want improvements to student life and student resources on campus, it will only come when we can properly invest and spend that money. This is why I joined the other members of the Finance and Appropriations Committee in this project to create the Student Empowerment Fund.” 
The GUSA Senate may face obstacles sustaining interest in the fund over the course of 15 years, according to Senator Leo Arnett (SFS ’22).  
“Fifteen years is a long time,” Arnett said at the Feb. 2 GUSA meeting. “I hope that you all have thought of a way to be able to continue the same energy that you all have behind this and the same very well-intentioned spirit, to where the FinApp Committee 15 years down the line has the same.”
To address this issue, Arias would propose to initiate the fund for two years, she said. If the fund proves successful and garners enough support from the student body at the end of the two-year trial period, the FinApp Committee will create a referendum to determine whether the fund will be codified in the GUSA Constitution. 
“The idea is to create this fund, implement it next year and then test it for two fiscal years starting next year, and if it is effective and if it is supported by the student body, then my idea is that it is pushed through a referendum to be a constitutional change,” Arias said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The university has not officially opposed or supported the initiative, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Georgetown has not taken a position on the Student Empowerment Fund,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
University officials have pushed back against the fund because they believe the FinApp Committee has overstepped its role on campus, according to Arias.
“They believe that GUSA shouldn’t do this because they think that students should stay with student affairs,” Arias said at the GUSA meeting Feb. 2. 
Bazail-Eimil is also concerned that administrators will be unwilling to collaborate on the fund, he said. 
“The reality is that our only concern is the university stonewalling us because they don’t want this project, even though we’ve had it in the past and it was a measurable impact on the student community,” Bazail-Eimil said at the GUSA meeting Feb. 2.

Capital Bikeshare installed a new docking station in Burleith at the beginning of January, expanding transportation options within the neighborhood. 
Capital Bikeshare, Washington, D.C.’s citywide bikeshare and rental transportation service, announced the new station in a Jan. 2 tweet. The station docks 19 bikes and is located on 38th Street and Reservoir Road across the street from the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital. 
The station sits directly next to a stop for the D6 bus service, which runs from upper Northwest D.C. to the Capitol Building. The station’s strategic location will improve commuter access to the city, according to Advisory Neighborhood 2E Commissioner Kishan Putta.
“People can take the bus there, and then get on a bike, and go into the neighborhood or vice versa; they can go from the neighborhood to the bus stop and then they can get on the bus,” Putta said in an interview with The Hoya. “You get these connections that never existed before. That’s really nice and working out well.”
The ANC has been focused on providing input to the District Department of Transportation on the docking station’s location and addressing concerns from residents, according to ANC 2E Commissioner Matias Burdman (COL ’21). (Full disclosure: Burdman previously served on the editorial board of The Hoya.)
“We had been in contact with DDOT regarding the installation of the new Capital Bikeshare station at 38th and Reservoir Road since its conception,” Burdman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There were some concerns regarding its exact location due to the impact it could have on vehicular traffic (especially during routine maintenance) and on accessibility.” 
In 2017, over 100 Burleith residents signed a petition sent to DDOT requesting a Capital Bikeshare station in Burleith, according to a May 2019 ANC resolution detailing the proposed Burleith Capital Bikeshare Station. In 2018, Burleith residents answered a transportation survey distributed by the Burleith Citizens Association and indicated strong support for a bikeshare station in Burleith. 
In late 2018, DDOT and the ANC worked to propose a location for the docking station on the 1600 block of 36th Street NW, according to the May 2019 resolution. Following concerns about accessibility, however, DDOT changed the station’s planned location to the northwest corner of 38th Street and Reservoir Road.
Georgetown students are eligible for a discounted annual bike membership of $25, in partnership with Capital Bikeshare Universities Program, according to a Nov. 18 schoolwide email from Ben Kuo, vice president of the Office of Planning and Facilities Management. 
“As a designated Bicycle Friendly University, Georgetown University is excited for our students to have access to the discounted membership,” Kuo wrote. “We hope you will take advantage of the membership to commute and explore the city on two wheels.”  
The station will be beneficial for students, providing a cheaper transportation alternative in an underserved area, according to Burdman. 
“Capital Bikeshare stations, coupled with bike friendly infrastructure such as bike lanes, give students the means to get around the city cheaply and efficiently,” Burdman wrote. “The addition of the new station is especially relevant since students now have the option to purchase a new yearly membership—available exclusively to them—for only $25 dollars. This should help students bike to places that are otherwise inadequately served by public transportation.”
As of August 2019, D.C. was ranked as the U.S. city with the third-highest level of traffic congestion, following only Los Angeles and the San Francisco-Oakland region, according to a report released by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute. 
In order to bring down congestion levels, which plays a role in the city’s impact on the climate, residents must be able to take advantage of city transportation, according to Putta. 
“We need to be giving people many more incentives to not drive,” Putta said. “Our city’s congestion is only going to get worse if we do not. We have to think boldly and act boldly in this climate crisis. We all have to do our part and public transportation is a great way to do that.”
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s December draft budget report for the 2021 fiscal year proposed the cancellation of bus routes that service the Georgetown, Burleith and Glover Park neighborhoods. 
Considering these neighborhoods’ lack of access to Metro stations, coupled with the possible elimination of essential bus routes, the new Capital Bikeshare Station, while important, is not a complete solution, according to Putta. 
“It is a welcome addition to have that bikeshare option because whatever happens with the buses, at least you would have the option of biking down to Georgetown and connecting to other buses or biking to Dupont Circle,” Putta said. “But nobody should say that that means we should reduce bus services. That’s absolutely not true.”

Metropolitan Police Department officers armed with assault rifles and a battering ram executed a search warrant at the CBD pop-up shop Mr. Nice Guys D.C. at 1660 33rd St. NW at 1:30 p.m. Jan. 30, according to a public incident report.
The most recent raid was the second in three months. Mr. Nice Guys D.C. was temporarily shut down after MPD executed a raid Dec. 3 due to allegations that the business was selling marijuana. CBD products are federally legal to sell as long as they contain no more than 0.3% THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana, according to PBS.
In addition to CBD, Mr. Nice Guys D.C. purportedly sells marijuana through the gifting loophole provided for in Initiative 71, according to The Georgetowner. The loophole allows customers to purchase a separate product at a higher-than-normal price and receive up to one ounce of marijuana as a “gift.”
The only cannabis-derived products in stock are CBD, according to co-owner Damion West.
“Every time they raid us, they take all of our CBD products, and CBD is legal, federally. And I don’t understand how they don’t know this,” West said in an interview with The Hoya. “If we were a lab and we tested everything that came through our door, then we could differentiate between products that have high THC levels.”
West argued this could cause MPD lab tests to return false positives for marijuana. However, Mr. Nice Guys D.C. identifies itself as an Initiative 71-compliant business on its website; the website also implies Mr. Nice Guys D.C. makes use of the gifting loophole.
The shop owners were not charged with distribution of marijuana, according to West.
“If we would’ve sold marijuana, don’t you think they would have charged us with distribution of marijuana?” West said. “They’re playing this little cat and mouse game with us. They’re bullying us.”
The interests of Georgetown’s residents should be weighed alongside business interests, according to Advisory Neighborhood 2E02 Commissioner Joe Gibbons.
“Georgetown is a mixed-use zone for business and residential, so even in the best of circumstances when something goes well, it’s being mindful of how this impacts the neighborhood,” Gibbons said in an interview with The Hoya. “We just don’t want illegal narcotic activity as so determined by the police.”
Gibbons said he is not against CBD but argued that Mr. Nice Guys D.C. caused problems for the neighborhood.
“The people who were coming there were parking the wrong way down 33rd, going down the one-way, congregating, and were using some of the product outside, which of course is not legal in D.C.,” Gibbons said.
Increased discussion and understanding between Mr. Nice Guys D.C. and its critics is key to a resolution, according to Gibbons. 
“I think there has to be more communication,” Gibbons said. “We need to understand their goals, have to understand what they want out of being there, and they have to understand what we want. They’re sinking their hard-earned money, their dreams into this business, but this is where people come home after a hard day’s work and want to have dinner with their kids and go to sleep and raise a family.”
Gibbons said he invited the two owners of Mr. Nice Guys D.C. as well as the owner of Used Books, who leased the space to the pop-up shop, to speak at the most recent Advisory Neighborhood Commission meeting Monday. However, the owners could not make it, he said. 
Used Books owner Hamid Savojbolaghi has sold secondhand books out of the property’s basement for over 20 years and used to live above his shop, according to The Washington Post. The renters told Savojbolaghi they planned to sell cigarettes, hats and T-shirts when he originally leased the space above his shop to them in November 2019.
Savojbolaghi has now been forced to retain a lawyer in an effort to terminate Mr. Nice Guys D.C.’s lease, he said in an interview with The Washington Post.
“I’ve been here all these years without a problem,” Savojbolaghi said to The Washington Post. “I don’t want anything to do with that type of business.”

The U.S. and Australian governments must reassess and adjust their alliance to accommodate changes in the global political sphere, Australian National University senior lecturer Andrew Carr said at an event Thursday. 
As the U.S. and Australian alliance approaches its 70th anniversary in 2021, Carr explained that the two nations must reassess their strategic interests and acknowledge their differences. Although an alliance between the U.S. and Australia remains popular, it may become invisible if politicians do not account for the countries’ diverging policies, Carr said at the Feb. 6 event titled “The Ally’s Burden — What does Australia owe America in 2020 and beyond?”
The alliance was signed in 1951 with a mutual understanding that Australia would offer the U.S. trade, public political support and private intelligence sharing. In return, the U.S. would provide security to protect the Australian continent, Carr said. The terms of the current alliance, however, are outdated in today’s international political climate. 
“America needs more than just a small but loyal friend. As Australia faces its own economic decline, its political weight and economic influence is waning,” Carr said. “Australia cannot just rely on an unspoken promise of security anymore. The alarm bells are ringing, and we need to think about not just worst-case scenarios but a handful of quite plausible conflicts in our near neighborhood.” 
The United States and Australia have evolved politically since the the start of their alliance, leading to diverging strategic interests around the world, according to Carr. In 2020, the two countries have varying policies and perspectives around U.S. power in Asia, infrastructure developments in China, defending Taiwan and the role of Australian troops around the globe, Carr said. 
Many politicians and journalists have falsely argued that the nations’ diverging interests have been caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s diplomatic approach or Chinese interference in Australia, according to Carr. 
“These differences are due to underlying strategic differences and strategic interests and not due, as sometimes claimed, to the bombastic style of President Trump, nor as evidence of Chinese coercion, bribery and other influence campaigns by the CCP,” Carr said. 
A 2019 poll showed that 72% of Australian citizens consider their country’s alliance with the U.S. very important or fairly important for Australian security, according to the Lowy Institute, which conducts an annual poll of Australian attitudes toward the United States. For the alliance to remain viable in the future, however, the nations must consider a new arrangement, according to Carr. 
“If we are to remain mates, a new approach to our relationship is going to have to face up to what I see as a diverging series of strategic interests,” Carr said. “It will have to take a form that meets these challenges and differences and offers greater value to both parties.”
Carr works in the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at Australian National University. He is an expert in strategy, time, middle powers and Australian defense policy and has published books with Oxford University Press and Georgetown University Press, as well as numerous academic journal articles on the subject. Carr spoke at the discussion, hosted by the Walsh School of Foreign Service in the McGhee Library in the Intercultural Center on Feb. 6. 
At the event, Carr said political actors from the United States and Australia must reconsider their shared strategic missions and the value of their continued alliance so that the nations can productively pursue their goals. 
“At times of uncertainty such as this moment, I believe that questions of presence must give way to deeper questions of purpose,” Carr said. “Only if we have clear ideas about what both of our nations seek and how we want to achieve those goals can the questions of material cooperation and material allocation make sense.” 
Although the United States has aided Australia militarily and politically in many instances throughout the nation’s history, Australia needs to reprioritize its own strategic interests, according to Carr. 
“What does Australia owe the United States in 2020? The answer remains a great deal,” Carr said. “I do not expect America acts purely in self-sacrifice, and I do not believe we can be asked to do so likewise. Our mateship, if it is to endure, needs to be based on a firm understanding of our underlying strategic interests. As these are evolving, so must the nature of our relationship.”

Climate change should unite all people regardless of race or ethnicity, multimedia artist and author Paul Miller, commonly known as DJ Spooky, said at a performance and discussion event Tuesday.
Miller, whose multimedia art strives to immerse audiences in a blend of genres, global culture and environmental and social issues, has previously worked on large-scale performances. His work includes a 2009 piece, “Terra Nova: Sinfonia Antarctica,” an acoustic portrait of the rapidly changing Antarctic continent. An excerpt of “Terra Nova” was featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City for the 2012-13 season, among other works by Miller.
Miller highlighted the importance of recognizing climate change’s universal impact during the event.
“Whether you’re black, white, Asian, Latino, any particular ethnic group, it’s hard to argue with a storm that just smashed your house, or for that matter, a swarm of fires that burned your entire country,” Miller said. “These are issues that face all of us, and that’s something I’m gonna be kind of returning to throughout the course of this conversation.”
Humans struggle to comprehend the scale of climate change and its repercussions, which may explain why they continue to contribute to the global crisis, according to Miller.
“We’ve had experience with climate change as a species, but we’ve actually never made it ourselves in such a way that we are doing now,” Miller said. “We can’t necessarily think outside of the human cognitive frame, and that’s probably the problem with climate change because it’s such a large-scale structure that the human scalability of it is beyond everyday experience.”
Science and data can help artists accurately portray issues like climate change, according to Miller. “Terra Nova,” which included photographs and field recordings from a portable studio, exemplifies such a collaboration, he said. 
“This project went to the Metropolitan Museum in New York and became a series of gallery shows and museum exhibitions, where I worked with climate scientists to look at how artists can use data to make a better portrait of this kind of changing process,” Miller said.
Miller’s recent project “QUANTOPIA,” which first premiered in January 2019, builds off of the idea of utilizing science, data and mathematics in art. “QUANTOPIA,” defined as the utopia of quantification, recognizes the free speech and creative expression involved in our daily media consumption, according to Miller. Combining music with data visualization, “QUANTOPIA” strives to create a new perspective on the 50-year revolution of information technology.
Music can also benefit from a greater connection with science and mathematics, as many forms of music can be understood as patterns of notes, according to Miller.
“If you can think about music as a pattern, anything goes: hip-hop, techno, dubstep, jazz, classical,” Miller said. “It’s about patterns, and the rest is about pattern recognition.”
The event, titled “QUANTOPIA Lecture-Demonstration,” was sponsored by the Georgetown University departments of performing arts and African American studies, as well as the Racial Justice Institute. The event is part of the Racial Justice: Art(s) and Activism lecture series, which honors Georgetown’s recent initiative to highlight art, activism and racial justice in the continued struggle to produce new forms of racial freedom.
“QUANTOPIA” is a relevant project to discuss in the Racial Justice lecture series because of the program’s focus on great wealth inequalities created by the internet, according to Miller.
“The internet, one could argue, has been one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history,” Miller said. “Most billionaires who are coming out of the information age are kind of dealing with that, and if we look at rising inequality throughout most American cities, California’s a good example. Berkeley or San Francisco, people are paying like $3000 to live in a box in somebody’s living room.”

School of Nursing and Health Studies Ethics professor Carol Taylor will receive the Ethics of Caring Nursing Ethics Leadership Award, the NHS announced across social media platforms Jan. 31.
Taylor will accept the award from the Ethics of Caring and the National Nursing Ethics Conference, organizations that seek to promote ethical discussion in nursing. She will accept the award at the seventh annual conference in Los Angeles on March 26.
Taylor currently teaches ethics to post-graduate and doctoral nursing students in the NHS, and she serves as a Senior Clinical Scholar with Georgetown’s Kennedy Institute of Ethics, a center founded in 1971 to promote the ethics of health, the environment and emerging technology. 
Taylor has long embodied the mission of the conference and has devoted her work to promoting ethics in nursing through education, according to Ethics of Caring Co-Founder and President Katherine Brown-Saltzman. 
“Carol is the spirit of nursing ethics,” Brown-Saltzman said in an interview with The Hoya. “She’s one of the most humble, dedicated people I know, in getting the message out of how important it is that we educate nurses in order for them to really be able to step up in their nursing ethics obligations.”
As a founding member of the KIE, Taylor has written and lectured on a variety of issues related to healthcare ethics, according to the KIE’s website. Her work at the institute supports her nomination for the award, according to KIE Director Daniel Sulmasy.
“Dr. Taylor is not only immensely intellectually gifted and has made substantial contributions to bioethics, particularly in nursing, but she is an extremely caring person,” Sulmasy said in an interview with The Hoya. “An award seems perfectly suited for her. We’re very proud of her.”
For the past four years, the conference has given the award to someone who demonstrates a history of exemplary performance in at least two of the following categories: ethical practice in nursing care, empirical research relative to ethics and nursing practice, ethics education, ethics and professionalism in clinical practice, and evidence-based practice relevant to ethics and nursing, according to Brown-Saltzman. 
The conference was founded over 25 years ago as a local collaborative conference. Taylor spoke at one of the first conferences and has served on the award-nominating committee, which initially sparked some controversy over presenting her the award, according to Brown-Saltzman.
“I just want to say, I mean truly, that Carol probably might’ve been nominated as our first winner, but it took us a while to think about nominating someone from within,” Brown-Saltzman said. “That wouldn’t be okay if we weren’t able to nominate from people on this planning committee, that would be an injustice.”
Taylor said she was flattered to receive the award, especially from Ethics of Caring, where she serves as a member of their National Planning Committee, according to their website. 
“It always means more if it’s an award from your peers,” Taylor said. “These are the people that know you, and would also like to receive the award. It was very nice.”
Taylor initially came to Georgetown in 1987 to earn her Ph.D. in philosophy with a bioethics concentration after receiving a medical-surgical nursing degree. Three years later, she was chosen by Dr. Edmund Pellegrino to help start the Center for Clinical Bioethics, of which she was director for 10 years.
Receiving the award for her work on bioethics in nursing validates her commitment to the university’s values, Taylor said.
“We talk about at Georgetown being men and women for others,” Taylor said. “I always thought that part of the Jesuit tradition was inviting all of us to know our gifts and to know our gifts could be used for others. This was simply a nice affirmation of that, because it gives the energy to pick up a new day’s challenge.”

This article describes racist and sexist content. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Shelves of books in the Reynolds and McCarthy libraries featuring racist and sexist content were removed by university officials last week after students reported the books to Georgetown University Residential Living staff.
News of the books’ removal was first reported in an article written by Jacob Adams (SFS ’23) and Justin Drewer (COL ’23), editors-in-chief of The Georgetown Review, a student news organization that bills itself as an independent journal of politics and world affairs, according to its website. Student members of “The Hilltop Show,” an online political comedy group, first noticed the content of the books after a group meeting in the McCarthy library Jan. 22. 
While walking out of a meeting Jan. 22, one student noticed a book entitled “Cherokee” on a bookshelf, Alexandra Bowman (COL ’22), a cartoonist for The Georgetown Review and member of “The Hilltop Show,” said. The cover of the book, a 1958 novel published by Don Tracy, features an illustration of a young Native American woman in distress with blood on her clothes. The group then decided to investigate the books remaining on the shelves, according to Bowman.
“Upon looking further at the collection of books in the library, we noticed other serialized books, most published in the mid-20th century, with similar pornographic, racially derogatory themes,” Bowman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Ultimately, the removal of the books was what we expected to come as a result of our inquiry.”
The content of many of the other books included pornographic references and sexist depictions of women, as well as racist themes and slurs, according to Bowman.
“While some were simply raucous crime noir murder mysteries representative of the literary and cultural time in which they were written, other books included extremely problematic and damaging elements, including the glamorization of rape, including that of underage girls,” Bowman wrote. “Completely naked women of all races were frequently featured on these books’ covers. Further, many books fetishized young nonwhite women.” 
Bowman then decided to help research the story, later published by The Georgetown Review. (Full disclosure: Bowman previously served as a Hoya Staff Writer and cartoonist for The Hoya.)
A separate staff member of “The Hilltop Show” found similarly offensive books in the library in Reynolds Hall over the course of their investigation, according to Bowman.
Both libraries were created on the first floor of Reynolds and McCarthy in 2003 when the Southwest Quadrangle opened. The libraries began with a book donation and is donor-funded, according to a university spokesperson. There is no formal checkout or cataloging system in place at either library. Instead, students are allowed to borrow and leave books for others on a regular basis. The books had not been monitored, the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The university led an investigation into the content of both libraries’ collections after receiving email inquiries from Bowman and the team of researchers, a university spokesperson wrote. 
“When we received messages in the past few weeks regarding the nature of the books that had been left, members of our Residential Life team investigated the bookshelves and discovered books had been left with titles, topics, and images that raised concerns for students and staff. The decision was made to remove these books from the public space,” the spokesperson wrote.
The books with explicit content and offensive content were ultimately removed Jan. 31, leaving only various textbooks and board games on the shelves, according to Bowman.
While removing the books may be considered a form of censorship, the university needed to provide the historical context behind the books, Adams and Drewer wrote in The Georgetown Review article. 
“To be clear, The Georgetown Review does not support censorship in any form, since history is only useful if we learn from it, and learn from it all, unrestricted,” the article said. “However, when providing access to historical texts—written during a different time in American history, during times of different moral and social standards—providing context is equally critical to the learning experience.”
Though the decision to remove the books was ultimately the correct decision, the university’s process regarding the removal could have been more transparent, according to Bowman. 
“While I believe they went about it the wrong way, I believe the university was right to remove the books,” Bowman wrote. “The university could also have placed the books in a location that put the books in their cultural context.”

Removing books due to the deranged worries of some snowflake loser resembles the actions taken by the Nazis during WWII. Will these books now be burned on the front lawn of the library? This is a shameful moment for Georgetown University.

I have now read two articles about this and I’m frankly still not clear if this is satire or a real event.  (If it’s satire, I’m embarrassed to not have caught it; if it’s real, well, the Georgetown community ought to be ashamed.)

May I have them?
Seriously, if the library and the “students” don’t want them, I would love to have them. I read all of those authors while I was growing up and have very fond memories of them. (This is a serious request — I’ll happily pay shipping.)
Please let me know.

Reproductive healthcare is in crisis as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to implement policies detrimental to public health, former President of Planned Parenthood Leana Wen said at an event Thursday.
The event, titled “Depoliticizing Women’s Health and the Future of Healthcare in America,” was hosted by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and took place in the Lohrfink Auditorium.
At the event, Wen, who previously served as the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore, discussed her experiences as a physician and how they have influenced her perspective on women’s healthcare. 
The politicization of reproductive healthcare damages broader conversations about U.S. healthcare reform, according to Wen.
“When was the last time you saw a title about depoliticizing men’s health? We don’t talk about it this way, and, frankly, none of these aspects of healthcare should be politicized,” Wen said.
Wen only served eight months in her position as the president of Planned Parenthood, as she was ousted by the board of directors in July 2019 because of disagreements over her desire to reorient the group’s focus from administering abortions toward its role as a women’s health provider, according to The New York Times.
Various Trump administration policies have deterred or prevented Americans from accessing basic healthcare services, Wen said. She referenced the administration’s public charge rule, a regulation that prevents some immigrants who use public services like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program from achieving permanent legal status.
“The Trump administration’s public charge rule, I think is a good example of a policy that amplifies fear and deters people also from seeking life-saving care,” Wen said. “When I was growing up, we depended on Medicaid and food stamps. For us, these programs were not entitlements, they were literally our survival, and I can’t imagine where our family would be now if we were forced to make some unthinkable choices.”
Such policies have compromised reproductive healthcare across the country, impeding civilian participation in vital health programs, according to Wen.
“I think there should be no question that reproductive healthcare is another area that is in a state of emergency,” Wen said. “You have the Trump administration issuing a gag rule for Title X that would make it harder for low-income people to receive cancer screenings, birth control and STI tests.”
Title X is a federal program that provides birth control and other reproductive health services to four million Americans, according to Planned Parenthood. In May 2019, the Trump administration introduced changes to Title X law that would prevent family planning providers from receiving federal funding for providing or recommending abortions, according to WAMC, a public radio station. 
The Trump administration’s obstructive policies pose the greatest threat to minorities and other marginalized communities, according to Wen.
“We know that those who are hurt the most by these types of policies are those who already bear the greatest brunt on disparities,” Wen said. “It’s going to be people of color, immigrants, families already struggling to make ends meet, it’s LGBTQ people, it’s the patients in communities that we serve.”
Such disparities in healthcare among minorities can immensely impact someone’s lifespan, which is why it is so crucial to call out these disparities and reduce them, according to Wen.
“It’s been said that the currency of inequality is years of life,” Wen said. “A child born today, depending on literally what zip code they’re born into, could be expected to live 85 years or 65 years.”
The next generation of voters must choose to depoliticize healthcare and push for greater accessibility to reproductive health resources, Wen added.
“We’re fighting for a world where the next generation has better health and more rights than we do,” Wen said. “I truly believe that it’s up to each of us to take action now, to focus on what we can do, to always aim for health equity, to stop the siloed and politicizing of healthcare.”
