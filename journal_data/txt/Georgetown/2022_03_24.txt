Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) hosted their annual Israeli Apartheid Week to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine and raise awareness about the human rights abuses they face.
The event, which was held from March 14 to 18, featured events regarding advocacy for the people of Palestine, beginning with an Apartheid Week launch in Red Square. Other events included a tile painting event and a panel discussion on March 17. There was also a Palestine Gala on March 18, which featured music, food, art, dabka — a Palestinian dance style — and other performances.  
Israel has systematically discriminated against Palestinians who live under Israel’s rule in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), according to a report by human rights group Amnesty International. Israel has also forcibly displaced Palestinians through coercive measures, including home demolitions. 
Georgetown SJP planned Apartheid Week in partnership with the Georgetown Muslim Students Association (MSA), Stand with Kashmir, Gender Justice Initiative (GJI), Black Student Alliance, Black Graduate Student Alliance and Alliance of Graduate Employees. 
Last month, Amnesty International named Israel an apartheid state due to its treatment of Palestinians. Apartheid is a crime against humanity under international law. In the report, Amnesty said Israel has enacted laws that create a system of control over Palestinians.  
SJP planned Apartheid Week to increase awareness about the Palestinian freedom struggle, according to an anonymous member of MSA and SJP, who requested their name be withheld due to safety concerns.  
“We’re just hoping to change the views that people have and get more people educated about what’s really going on over there,” the MSA and SJP member told The Hoya. 
Georgetown SJP operates under Students for Justice in Palestine, a worldwide network of college activism organizations. 
GJI Director Melyssa Haffaf said that GJI chose to partner with SJP to host the event to raise awareness about what is happening in Palestine.  
“We believe it was a great educational forum for those who are not necessarily familiar with the history of this ongoing struggle and bring visibility to other movements striving for advancing justice and equity,” Haffaf wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
A SJP representative, who asked to remain anonymous due to fear of the risks of public Palestinian advocacy, said the involvement of many student clubs in the week of events signals a shift in perspectives on the issue. 
“So many organizations showed support, and that would have been unimaginable a few years ago — it really shows growth in this movement and the way that people are looking at Palestine as a smaller part of a bigger, interconnected problem that we need to solve,” the SJP representative said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Khury Petersen-Smith, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and an expert on the Middle East, spoke at the Apartheid Week panel. 
He and other panelists framed the issue in an innovative way, Petersen-Smith said. 
“In the panel, we worked to lay out why we understand this as a struggle for justice not only in terms of justice for Palestinians, but in the context of various struggles around the world,” Petersen-Smith said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Petersen-Smith’s panel, titled “Interconnected Liberation,” focused on the links between Palestinian liberation struggles and justice and liberation struggles in the United States and elsewhere. 
Idun Hauge (GRD ’24), decided to join SJP last week after hearing about Apartheid Week from a friend on the SJP board. 
“There’s very little awareness in the U.S. about crimes against Palestinians, the really kind of horrible conditions that people live under,” Hauge said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Last week Georgetown SJP circulated posters promoting the week of events around campus, according to the MSA and SJP member, which were subsequently removed from Red Square by unknown individuals. 
“That was definitely the most unsettling thing that happened in our week, having our advertising and pretty much our freedom of speech restricted by certain students on campus,” the MSA and SJP member said.
Georgetown is committed to free and open inquiry on campus through verbal and nonverbal expression. Some areas on campus, including Red Square, are considered “public squares,” spaces available for student expression without registration requirements. 
After the investigation of the Georgetown University Police Department into the ripping down of posters, SJP was able to identify one student who ripped down posters, but the organization chose not to disclose their identity to The Hoya. 
On March 15, Interim Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Jeanne F. Lord sent an email to all students reemphasizing university free speech policy.
“On our Hilltop campus, Red Square is uniquely located as a public forum expressly designed for the impromptu and ongoing expression of ideas and viewpoints by members of our campus community,” the email reads. 
Georgetown Israel Alliance (GIA) President Daniel Rogov (COL ’23) said he and GIA condemn the removal of SJP’s posters.
“As Georgetown students, it is essential that we support and actively defend each other’s right to free speech,” Rogov wrote to The Hoya. 
Still, GIA stands against the actual messaging of Apartheid Week, according to Rogov.
“Classifying Israel as an apartheid state is not only incorrect, but dangerously misinformed,” Rogov wrote. “This misinformation is counterproductive to promoting genuine reforms in Israel, and has the potential to harm Israeli citizens of all religions and ethnicities in undermining the nation’s legitimacy.”
The MSA and SJP member said the event was a success due to high student engagement.
“We definitely did have a few people who passed by who clearly expressed some disagreement, some people secretly recording us, but for the most part it was positive responses,” the MSA and SJP member said. 
UPDATE: This article was updated March 30 to retract the identity of the source now referred to as the “MSA and SJP member.” The source requested anonymity on March 29 due to the fear of safety risks surrounding public Palestinian advocacy.

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate unanimously passed a resolution making changes to GUSA election rules regarding payment structures at a March 20 meeting. 
The changes include providing monetary compensation to members of the GUSA Election Commission (EC), which assists in running and overseeing GUSA elections, publicizing a list of candidates to the entire student body and ensuring candidates inform their supporters of possible campaign violations. 
The controversy surrounding the recent GUSA executive election and the need to improve future elections prompted the changes, according to GUSA Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’23), who introduced the resolution.
“Our goal was one, give people more time to get on the ballot; two, pay the EC more; and three, find a way that also doesn’t lead to a proliferation of joke candidates on the ballot,” Gordon said in an interview with The Hoya. “I figured it would probably support the elections better in the future.”
The EC previously recommended against certifying Kole Wolfe (SFS ’24) and Zeke Ume-Ukeje (COL ’24) as the next GUSA executive president and vice president, citing allegations that the Wolfe-Ume campaign bribed students for their votes in exchange for alcohol, which were ultimately proved inconclusive. 
The EC issued a formal warning to the campaign and cut the then-candidates’ speaking time at the town halls as a result of their alleged rule violations.
The resolution addressed the long-standing problem of the lack of support for the EC, which is usually understaffed and overworked, according to EC Chair Owen Posnett (COL ’24).
“Paying the EC, to me, the best thing about it would be that it will encourage people to sign up for the EC in the first place,” Posnett said in an interview with The Hoya. “More people want to sign up for the EC than the president, and the members of the EC would then vet those people to make sure that they actually want and are able to do the work and aren’t just in it for the money.”
Megan Skinner (SFS ’24), one of the three incoming election commissioners, said that it is important that the EC is adequately staffed and paid so that GUSA elections run smoothly and fairly. 
“During the last election, I saw the importance and impact of the Election Commission’s work, and with that, their need for additional staffing,” Skinner wrote. “In this role, I hope to further develop trust and transparency in GUSA’s electoral process.” 
Members of the EC will be paid in accordance with Washington, D.C. law, according to the resolution. 
“All members of the Election Commission, consisting of no more than five members, shall be paid no less than the hourly minimum wage in the District of Columbia using funds given to GUSA — from the student activity fee (SAF) — by the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee,” the resolution reads. 
Directly after the GUSA executive election marked a productive time to make changes to election rules, according to Gordon. 
“Part of the issue is you can’t do the changes like two days before the election without obviously being controversial, because the thing is, if you change any election rules, obviously you’re gonna favor one side or another,” Gordon said. “But if you’re not doing it before an election, there’s no established strategy yet, so people have time to adjust. You’re not really favoring anyone.”
The EC experienced staffing shortages, with only Posnett and Jessica Fiadomor (COL ’24) serving on the EC during the latest GUSA Executive election, which hindered its capacity to function well, according to Posnett. 
“The ultimate logistical problem was advertising,” Posnett said. “With only two members of the EC and then three members when the campaign started, there was no physical capacity for us to advertise to the extent that we want to and also to the extent that is constitutionally required. We want to prevent that from ever happening again, because it was constitutionally illegal to have so few EC members doing so much work, and that’s why the work didn’t get finished.”
The EC should receive greater attention and support because of its importance in student body elections, according to Posnett. 
“The EC should be appreciated more in the sense that GUSA should be more appreciated, understood and supported, and more at least in terms of voting, because who you vote for does materially affect other members of the student body, just like your vote in a federal or state election would,” Posnett said.

A few days before the start of the spring 2022 semester, Madeleine Albright, the first female U.S. secretary of state and a longtime Georgetown University professor, called Joel Hellman, the dean of the Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS). She told him that due to her illness, she would not be able to teach her beloved course that semester. 
She waited until right before the semester began because the last thing she wanted to give up was her presence in the classroom with her students, her colleagues said. She wanted to teach her students, and she held onto that hope until she didn’t have a choice. 
On March 23, Albright died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 84. The cause was cancer, according to her family. 
“She was surrounded by family and friends,” a statement from her family said. “We have lost a loving mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend.” 
Albright was a core figure in the Clinton administration, first serving as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1993 to 1997. In 1997, she became the first female U.S. secretary of state, a post that she held until 2001. 
Albright began teaching at the SFS in 1982. She taught at Georgetown every year since then, with the exception of the years she served as U.N. ambassador and secretary of state.
Her foreign policy achievements included championing NATO expansion into Eastern European countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, encouraging intervention to combat mass atrocities in Eastern Europe and working to decrease the spread of nuclear weapons. 
Her leadership was characterized by a blend of pragmatism and idealism, accompanied by her generous spirit and legendary, disarming humor, according to colleagues.
She also advanced the role of women in foreign policy, according to longtime friend and colleague Melanne Verveer (SLL ’66, GRAD ’69). Verveer, who now serves as executive director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, worked closely with Albright during the Clinton administration, including in preparation for the 1995 United Nations Fourth Conference on Women in Beijing. 
“She will be remembered as a tremendous force for the values we share and for the good of the world,” Verveer told The Hoya. 
As a young girl, Albright, born Marie Jana Korbelová, fled then-Czechoslovakia shortly after the Nazi invasion. She and her family moved to the United States in 1948 as refugees, and her identity as a refugee remained central to her outlook on the world, Verveer said. 
She later graduated from Wellesley College in 1959 before earning her Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1975. 
Albright received the Presidential Medal of Freedom — the nation’s highest civilian honor — in 2012 from former President Barack Obama for being a female trailblazer in diplomacy and helping bring peace to the Balkans. 
For the past several years, Albright taught her famous diplomacy course “America’s National Security Tool Box” at Georgetown each semester. The class was notoriously difficult to get a spot in due to Albright’s popularity among students. 
“She had always talked to me about how fulfilling and rewarding being a professor was for her at Georgetown, and she loved the students. She loved her class,” Verveer said. “It was sacrosanct.” 
Students who took Albright’s course recall her humor and mentorship. Every semester, Albright hosted lunches to get to know each student and would attend the final simulation dressed in character by wearing a commander jacket, they recalled. 
Julie Antão (SFS ’20, GRD ’23), a student in Albright’s class in spring 2020, recalls Albright’s grace and empathy, adding that Albright was incredibly grounded and invested in her students.
“She would never in a million years use her title. She made us call her ‘professor,’” Antão told The Hoya. “It really shows how humble and how special someone like that can be.”
Albright engaged with her students as peers, her colleagues and former students said. She wanted to teach her students about how the world operates, but she believed she could learn from her students, too. 
One of the highlights of learning from Albright was listening to her tell stories about her career in diplomacy, Antão said.
“She would make you laugh, unlike any other person,” Antão said. “She would tell you these most absurd stories, and you wouldn’t even believe that they were true. They obviously were.”
Alexis Tercero-Chacón (GRD ’19), a teaching assistant in Albright’s spring 2019 course, said Albright made a point to mentor her students. 
“She truly cared about seeing her students and not just in the classroom, but also in a more informal setting,” Tercero-Chacón said. “Making sure that the lessons learned were passed onto future generations — I think that’s her biggest impact.”
Georgetown government professor Anthony Arend remembers Albright for her humanity and humility. Arend and Albright were neighbors in Georgetown. 
“As great and as iconic a leader as she was, she was a human being that could interact with people on a human level,” Arend said. 
In a March 24 statement, Albright’s last graduate student cohort expressed gratitude for the opportunity to learn from her, as well as for the indelible mark she left on them. 
“We reaffirm our commitment to promote a more just, fair, and prosperous world in her memory. Secretary Albright championed democracy and the power of multilateralism relentlessly — and we must do the same,” the students wrote. “She also never stopped advocating for women’s rights, human rights, and the right of all people to live free from violence and discrimination. It is our duty to carry on this legacy.”

Americans must fight for their right to imagine a better future, Ta-Nehisi Coates said at a March 22 event in Gaston Hall. 
The event, titled “A Conversation with Ta-Nehisi Coates,” featured a reading by the award-winning journalist and author, a conversation with Angelyn Mitchell, a Georgetown University English and African American studies professor and a question and answer session with the audience. The Georgetown University Lecture Fund, a student-run organization that brings speakers to discuss a wide variety of topics, hosted the event.
Coates also discussed his work on the script of an upcoming Superman reboot, which will feature a Black Superman, as well as his previous books “Between the World and Me” and “We Were Eight Years in Power.” 
Throughout the course of his career, Coates has worked to write truthfully and emphatically about the deep flaws in the United States he experiences as a Black man.
Coates said that he finds community and empowerment in the tradition of Black writing, which is tied to Black liberation.
“When you are in the tradition of Black writing, you’re in a tradition of people who have always tied that feeling to the idea of liberation, when those two things can’t be separated,” Coates said at the event. “And so there’s a feeling of you’re not just writing to introduce something beautiful in the world, but you’re writing because you believe that beautiful thing. And sometimes even don’t believe that beautiful thing depending on where you are, where you sit in the tradition, but that it has some sort of impact on the liberation of a group of people who sit at one of the bottom rungs of society.”
White supremacy has been an integral part of U.S. institutions, and recent movements are an attempt to uphold that power structure, according to Coates. 
“What these people are trying to do is erect an entire safe space for white straight men in this country,” Coates said. “Education is never safe. Imagination is never safe. And if we lose the right to imagine a future, or if we ignore the fact that we’re losing the right to imagine the future, and we focus simply on preserving our main vote, we will look up and we will very quickly find that we actually have nothing to vote for.”
The Jan. 6 insurrection, which was embedded with racist and bigoted rhetoric, marked a direct assault on the U.S. democratic process. Meanwhile, in the past year, widespread political efforts attempted to ban critical race theory from U.S. classrooms. 
At the core, the legacy of slavery deeply affects all aspects of American life, which is a difficult but important message to get across to audiences, according to Coates. 
“The crime of enslavement is at the root that extends through the branch and out into the branches and into the leaves of this country, and you cannot get away from it. You think you can, you can’t,” Coates said. 
When asked about the importance of writing to express emotions, Coates said that storytelling is a way to find peace in deeply troubling, angering times.
“What I’m always trying to do is channel that anger into some sort of productive thing,” Coates said, “And the thing that gives me probably most relief, or most sense of safety, or most sense of peace, is if I can explain to you in the most specific, haunting and precise way possible what I’m pissed about. And that’s really kind of all I’m trying to do in various forms.”
Coates called on the audience to find their voice and commit to working toward a more just society. 
“And I always tell people that you have to find the thing you love first and think you would be doing anyway,” said Coates, “And you got to figure out how to do that in a way that brings more justice into the world.”

Trust between public and private institutions and socially conscious business practices are key to successful public-private collaboration on developmental projects in Latin America, panelists said at a March 18 event. 
Global business leaders at the 2022 Latin American Business Club (LABC) Conference discussed the best practices to create shared values among companies and communities and foster public-private partnerships (PPP) — collaborative projects among government agencies and private sector firms — for the advancement of Latin American economies. The LABC, a Georgetown University student-led club that strives to promote Latin American business across campus, hosted the event with the support of Georgetown University’s Latin American Leadership Program (LALP). 
PPPs are critical to the economic development of Latin American countries because they support crucial infrastructure, according to Manuel J. Balbontin, Chairman of Georgetown University’s Latin American Board and Partner and founder of Compass Group, one of the leading independent investment advising firms in Latin America.
“If the countries do not invest in infrastructure, the countries don’t grow,” Balbontin said. “You don’t have roads, you don’t have ports, you don’t have airports, you don’t have hospitals, you don’t have schools, you don’t have water, or sewage facilities. So all those are infrastructure projects that improve the quality of life, improve the mobility of the population and improve the competitiveness of all these countries. That is critical in the discussion.”
PPPs are a popular tool for economic development in Latin America with the largest number of PPP projects in the world since 1990 being developed in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to a January 2020 study by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the largest source of development financing for Latin America and the Caribbean.
PPPs are difficult to implement because of distrust between sectors, according to Myriam Guadalupe De la Vega, Managing Director and CEO of Almacenes Distribuidores de la Frontera, a private company which owns and operates a chain of stores in northern Mexico.
“We’re in a difficult position, we distrust each other,” De la Vega said. “I think we need to find a way to work this out so we can have our PPPs work, and it can be done. We just have to have a common goal and really want our projects and have really good leadership for it to work.”
The private sector tends to distrust that governments have their best interests in mind, which hurts investment and productivity, according to a January 2022 survey by the IDB. The report recommends that governments increase accountability and oversight organizations to rebuild trust in partnerships.
Ricardo Ernst, professor at the McDonough School of Business (MSB) and Executive Director of LALP, moderated the panel and presented his new book “From Me to We: How Shared Value Can Turn Companies Into Engines of Change”.
The key to fostering PPPs is creating value for all stakeholders of a company — not only the shareholders who own company stocks — which Generation Z is particularly poised to do, according to Ernst. 
“You need to change the view from shareholder into stakeholder,” Ernst said. “How do you change ‘what’s in it for me?’ into ‘what’s in it for us?’ And actually, what is very fascinating, I have found that that is a concept that your generation embraces more significantly than my generation.”
Generation Z can contribute to creating shared value and support developmental projects in Latin America, according to Isabela Legaspi (COL ’22), founder and president of the LABC. 
“Not everyone is going to jump into the public sector in Latin America, that’s a huge feat,” Legaspi told The Hoya. “But I think that learning as much as you can, and if you end up working at a large corporation or if your family plays a large part in the private sector and any country in Latin America, to implement that and to implement the ‘Me to We’ mentality and to take a leap of faith and to maybe participate in a project.”
Ernst said that shared values are crucial for a mutually beneficial relationship between businesses and society. 
“When you put a business model, you need to make it sustainable, and that is the important thing about it,” Ernst said. “So what exactly is shared value? Well, it’s the intersection between corporate performance and the society. That is what shared value is all about. it’s not enough to just consider what is good for the company, but what simultaneously serves society as well.”

A Georgetown University professor is conducting research on urban agricultural farming and social entrepreneurship in the food industry in an effort to promote environmental justice and food security in Washington, D.C. 
Yuki Kato, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, is both a scholar and an activist as she examines access to resources for urban farming, which is the process of growing and distributing food in cities and is often divided along lines of race, class and age. 
Kato said that her research and project explores the intersections of gentrification and food insecurity, as each of these issues impact larger economic and societal systems like commerce, housing and transportation. 
Access to grocery stores and the composition of foodscapes — locations where individuals buy,  obtain, prepare and eat food — is a consequence of gentrification, according to Kato. 
“It’s not just about whether or not grocery stores exist in certain neighborhoods, but what kind of grocery stores open, what kind of restaurants are opening, which businesses are closing and those actually are a very important signifier and sometimes enable gentrification,” Kato said in an interview with The Hoya. “I would love for us to start to think more broadly about both causes and processes and consequences of gentrification beyond just housing.”
Food insecurity, the lack of reliable access to food, affected 400,000 D.C. residents before the COVID-19 pandemic and an additional 250,000 residents after the pandemic began. 
Brianna Rodgers (COL ’22), a research assistant involved in Kato’s current project, said that another focus of the research includes analyzing the composition of land ownership in the District. 
“We’re looking at how they’ve been able to access land, how they’ve been able to maintain that land, like access to land, in order to sustain their projects,” Rodgers said in an interview with The Hoya. “Then there’s also an archival component that’s looking at the history of land dispossession of African American and Black populations in D.C., specifically related to urban agriculture and arable land.”
Kato said that her current project focuses on environmental justice and how it pertains to social justice. 
“A key difference between environmental justice and environmentalism is that environmental justice really comes out of the civil rights movement,” Kato said. “The fundamental concern is not about protecting the environment, per se, but it’s really about how the environment is a place and manifestation of social, particularly racial and economic, injustices.” 
Kato is also working on another project about social entrepreneurship within the food industry. For this work, Kato and her undergraduate research assistant, Dana Choi (COL ’23), analyze Instagram posts of social entrepreneurs to see how they market their missions. 
Kato and Choi’s research on social entrepreneurship could suggest that organizations selectively adapt their messages to consumers to appear more ethical, according to Choi.
“We hope that our findings demonstrate the heterogeneity of how the term “social enterprise” is constantly being reconstructed, revived, and co-opted in today’s marketplace to create the perception of an ethical enterprise,” Choi wrote to The Hoya.
These new projects on urban farming and social entrepreneurship come after Kato’s recent research exploring how COVID-19 impacted community gardens and urban farms in D.C., Virginia and Maryland communities. This project, conducted in collaboration with Caroline Boules, professor at the University of Maryland, is now in the process of analysis and publication, according to Kato.
Kato said that the ultimate goal of her research is to demonstrate the broader intersection between gentrification, the economy and the environment. 
“I think what my research would hopefully remind people who are not just scholars and students but also the general public is to think about gentrification as changes in social and economic system at large,” Kato said.

Philanthropists must shift strategies to address the root causes of inequalities in the United States, panelists said at a March 22 event. 
The event, titled “Philanthropy and America’s Racial Reckoning,” featured a conversation between Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, and Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) on the responsibility of philanthropists when addressing systemic inequity. The McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Public and Nonprofit Leadership hosted the virtual event.
Walker said that philanthropy aimed at systemic change is uncomfortable because it requires dismantling the institutions that made philanthropists successful in the first place. 
“I think for many Americans, especially people who are successful in our economic social system, to have them engage in the hard work acknowledging the bias and the failures of our system is a difficult experience,” Walker said at the event. “It’s difficult because for those people — and I count myself as a successful person in this system — the system has worked for us.” 
A 2020 working paper by researchers at Texas A&M University found that Americans tend to donate more relatively with a higher income. Most households gave around 1.5% of their income, while those taking home between $5 million and $10 million a year donated 4.3% of their income, on average. Those making at least $10 million a year donated 8.6%.
Walker discussed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s belief that some philanthropists make donations without questioning the system that allowed them to garner an extreme level of wealth. 
“Philanthropy, yes, can be about charity and generosity, but philanthropy should also be about dignity and justice,” Walker said. “And that is a different kind of engagement for the philanthropist. It does require the philanthropist to, when looking at a problem and assessing the solutions, to understand the systems that have benefitted the very philanthropists who have committed to solving the problem.”
Individuals must examine their own power and change unfair institutions, according to Walker.
“In our communities, we are not helpless,” Walker said. “We are not hopeless. We are not without any resilience or agency. So what are the things happening in our community, where we have an obligation and accountability? We cannot simply say it’s because of the system.”
Walker said that improving philanthropy to promote equity is critical to protecting democracy.
“If we want to achieve a stronger democracy, we must address issues of inequality, because the correlation of inequality, growing inequality, correlates with growing hopelessness in a society,” Walker said. “And the oxygen of democracy is hope. The oxygen of the American narrative, the American dream, if you will, is this idea that we are all naturally hopeful, optimistic, forward-looking people. Inequality undermines that. Inequality asphyxiates hope.”
In places like Hungary and Turkey, inequality has sparked the growth of xenophobic, nationalist, populist and right-wing movements, according to Walker. 
“Look at what has happened to these countries where wedges have been pushed between citizens over issues like religion and culture, at the expense of looking at the real problems of the economic systems that generate the inequality in the first place,” Walker said. “Any of us who believe in democracy, who believe in capitalism, we ought to be worried, because for the first time in our lifetime, there are fewer democracies.” 
Higher levels of income inequality decrease political interest, the frequency of political discussion, and participation in elections among all but the most affluent citizens, providing compelling evidence that greater economic inequality yields greater political inequality, according to a 2008 report. 
Philanthropists must push for systemic change and against inequality, according to Walker.
“We’ve got work to do,” Walker said. “And that work has to do with really getting at the systemic reasons why there’s inequality, not the faux reasons that allow politicians to benefit from inequality, because that’s what’s happening.”

A program on gender equity and leadership between the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business (MSB) will graduate its fourth cohort of students later this year.
The Gender Equity Executive Leadership Program (GEELP) — which works with partner organizations in the male-dominated energy and water sectors to administer a 12-month course about gender equality initiatives — launched as a partnership between USAID’s Engendering Industries Program and the MSB in 2017. The course teaches leaders at businesses such as Eko Electricity Distribution Company in Nigeria and Kosovo’s Transmission System and Market Operator how to identify and fix gender equality gaps within their companies. 
This program is an example of the MSB partnering with other organizations to help advance gender equity globally, according to Michael O’Leary, senior associate dean of Custom Executive Education at the MSB.
“The GEELP program has had clear, objective, well-measured outcomes for the individuals and organizations involved,” O’Leary wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There has been progress in terms of gender equity, but progress has been slower in some industries than others. That’s where GEELP has focused — the industries where progress has been slower.”
GEELP aids individuals working in developing countries by increasing economic opportunities for women and supporting gender equality practices in the workplace at various companies.
Each annual cohort consists of 10 to 12 companies that are recruited from a GEELP government subcontractor, Tetra Tech, to participate in the program, according to Imke Simpson (GRD ’15), GEELP program leader.
“The participants are really considered to be what the MSB calls change agents,” Simpson said in an interview with The Hoya. “We want them to be empowered to bring back the learning to their organizations and actually implement it, which is why the capstone project is so important.” 
Assa Felipe Fumo, a graduate of the GEELP program from a course she took at her company Electricity of Mozambique, said that her company joined the program because they had the goal of achieving 40% representation of women by 2030 and they had only 18% when they decided to participate.
“For me it was a life experience,” Fumo wrote in an email with The Hoya. “I have learned many things for my personal life and professional life too. The way that the program was designed I believe that it allowed it to be very assertive and pragmatic. Many initiatives including gender strategy were developing today at EDM because of the opportunity that we had to participate in the program.”
Currently, the program is administered in the energy and water sectors, but the team hopes to expand to other industries that also impact women in the future, according to Brooks Holtom, academic director of GEELP.
“While we started with the electric generation and distribution sector, we have since expanded to other utility providers,” Holtom wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Because women experience similar challenges in other male-dominated industries like mining or oil and gas, it is relatively easy to expand into and be relevant in those sectors.”
Among 41 participating companies since the program’s conception, 6,105 women employees have trained to develop skills that they can use to advance their careers. Out of these participants, nearly 1,000 have been promoted into technical and leadership roles. 
Since the start of the program, 57 policies related to gender equality, such as employee satisfaction surveys and salary gap analyses, were created at partner organizations.
GEELP was created to advance gender equality in organizations through a business-driven approach, according to Simpson. 
“Typically we don’t necessarily work directly with the government on these types of programs,” Simpson said. “I think that USAID saw the value of working with a business school and an education partner, because one thing that they really wanted to do was make the business case for gender equity generally.”
The foundation of the core curriculum is based within the energy sector, but the Engendering Industries Program connects shared experiences across sectors, according to Jessica Manon, Engendering Industries program manager at Tetra Tech, which is the implementing partner for USAID.
“When we expanded from energy utilities we first began working with water utilities and held design sessions with water experts,” Menon wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We realized in the curriculum review that the curriculum is quite relevant to any sector broadly, and what is helpful to tailor are case studies and examples so that people from a certain sector can connect and relate to the material.”
GEELP launched a program last year that expanded the reach of this curriculum through training for partner organizations to administer the courses to others, according to Holtom.
“We have already seen a very successful spin-off of the program,” Holtom wrote. “We launched a ‘Train the Trainer’ program last year with partner institutions on 3 continents. They are now leveraging the materials and training we provided to teach these principles of intentional inclusion in their regions impacting hundreds of organizations.”
The program provided strong networking and instructional elements, according to Fumo.
“We struggled to adjust the methodology because of COVID19,” Fumo wrote. “But in the end we did. The program is great. The blended methodology, the way it was designed…Definitely high level program.”

A Georgetown professor will serve on the Board of Chancellors for the Academy of American Poets, an organization that supports poets and their contemporary audiences. 
Carolyn Forché, professor in the English department, will start this year as an artistic advisor during her six-year term before becoming a chancellor emeritus. The Academy of American Poets, founded in 1934, promotes poetry on a national level by publicizing National Poetry Month, producing the site Poets.org and providing financial support for poets. 
Forché works in the field of literature and poetry through writing, teaching and advocacy. 
“I have always been devoted to poetry, and more recently to the writing of prose memoir and the work of translating poets from other languages into American English,” Forché wrote to The Hoya. “I will continue with all of that, and with my second and no less important vocation: teaching. I will join with my colleagues in the academy to support literary art, and the study of the arts and humanities, which also happen to be vital to the health of our democracy.”
Forché currently teaches a seminar class for the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice,  which is involved in critical literary analysis of contemporary works, and where she previously served as director. 
Only 120 poets have been named chancellors since the creation of the academy, and Forché is a talented addition to the Board, according to Jen Benka, executive director of media for the academy. 
“From collections of her own poetry to her groundbreaking anthology “Against Forgetting: Twentieth Century Poetry of Witness,” to her leadership at the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice, Carolyn Forché is a poet who has helped us understand, among other things, that some of history is only found in poems,” Benka wrote to The Hoya. “We’re deeply grateful to have her join us as a Chancellor.”
Forché has an extensive career in poetry and advocacy which includes five volumes of poetry, two anthologies and one memoir. “Gathering the Tribes,” her debut poetry publication, won the 1975 Yale Series of Younger Poets Award, and her later publication  “The Country Between Us” is a collection of poems based on Forché’s experiences during the Salvadoran Civil War. 
Forché said that she will continue to tie advocacy to her work in the position of chancellor. 
“I’m deeply committed to work on behalf of human rights and social justice, and to the
strengthening of democracy and the institutions of civil society,” Forché wrote. “I will bring that to bear on my work for the Academy, where I hope to advocate for supporting poets throughout the world who suffer imprisonment, censorship and exile because of their literary work or reasons of conscience. I will also continue the Academy’s important efforts toward greater inclusivity in this country, and in the Academy itself.”
According to David Gewanter, a professor in the department of English, Forché’s ability to empathize with individuals facing injustice makes her work special. 
“Unique among poets, she carries this empathy into the classroom and the boardroom, working to make institutions morally responsible for their actions,” Gewanter wrote to The Hoya. “She has sent back frontline reports to Amnesty International, and worked with others to make Georgetown accountable for its sale of slaves. The Academy will benefit from having such an accomplished poet and moral agent join its leadership.”
Duncan Wu, another professor in the English department, said that Forché undeniably deserves the position of chancellor, an honor he describes as nearly commensurate with the Nobel Prize for Literature.
“She is unquestionably one of the top two or three poets in this country at the moment,” Wu said in an interview with The Hoya. “We are astonishingly lucky to have her at this university. I mean, someone of her stature would normally be at Yale or Harvard. She’s at Georgetown, because she loves this place.”

Georgetown students are working as teaching assistants for a course on domestic and international affairs at Theodore Roosevelt High School, located in the Petworth neighborhood of Washington, D.C. 
Through the School of Foreign Service Academic Council (SFSAC), Chae Park (SFS ’22) and Aryaman Sharma (SFS ’24) visit Theodore Roosevelt High School every Friday to engage with students on topics like inclusion and racism. Most recently, Park and Sharma conducted a lesson regarding the relationship between Native American governments and the United States Constitution in a class titled “Principles of Government and Public Administration.”
Sharma said that through these lessons, the SFSAC is advancing its goals of teaching the next generation about racism on the domestic and international stage. 
“There are certain facts and events that many individuals are not aware of,” Sharma said in an interview with The Hoya. “So we use Native American government as an example in that many instances, facts of their own government were actually applied to the U.S. Constitution, and there was a clause that was agreed upon which identified this. But many individuals are just not aware of this.”
Park, who has been teaching at Theodore Roosevelt High School since her sophomore year at Georgetown, said engaging potential students leads to increased diversity in the campus and broader D.C. community. 
“I think this initiative really plays a critical part in our emphasis and in our way moving forward, how to promote that diversity in our student body,” Park said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think engaging directly with potential students is really important, and I think our initiative with Roosevelt is one direct way in which we can do that.”
The class also examines gender and race in the U.S. Constitution as well as the modern repercussions of its language, according to Sharma. 
“Our unit also discussed how we can be more inclusive with others around us and be more anti-racist, because the U.S. Constitution, when it uses the pronouns when referencing the President, is often excluding women running for presidency,” Sharma said. “And in addition to that, when it comes to different clauses like the three-fifths clause, although they are no longer in law, simply just having them in the Constitution itself kind of informs the racism that we’ve encountered and how we need to make that better.”
According to Chae, the two students also include a question-and-answer portion at the end of every lesson, which gives students at Theodore Roosevelt High School the opportunity to ask questions about the class as well as life at Georgetown. 
The SFSAC works to promote education and inclusivity not just at Georgetown, but in the D.C. community as a whole. 
“The SFSAC remains dedicated to our engagement with D.C., beyond the gates of Georgetown University,” the SFSAC wrote to The Hoya. “The SFS prepares students to become global leaders in the future and equips them with an international perspective, but we cannot ignore our friends and partners in the D.C. area. It is a fundamental part of our commitment to public service.”
Sharma hopes he can promote inclusivity and an analytical approach to U.S. history through his teaching.  
“I feel that as a Georgetown student and specifically in the School of Foreign Service, I’m incredibly privileged to learn about these topics actively through my courses and professors,” Sharma said. “And for me, it’s a great way of not only researching the topics myself and learning something that I didn’t know before, but also spreading the wealth and giving back to the community through Roosevelt High School.”

Georgetown University recognized Martin “Marty” Tankleff, an exoneree and defense attorney, with the Peter P. Mullen Distinguished Visiting Professorship in the department of government. Tankleff will be honored as the new Mullen professor on March 28. 
The award honors prominent lawyers with the opportunity to lead a series of workshops and lectures. Tankleff’s career in the legal field began after he was coerced into an unsigned confession and wrongfully convicted in 1990 at the age of 19 of his parents’ murder. Although he was charged in 1988, when he was 17, and sentenced to 50 years to life, Tankleff’s supporters, including his childhood friend Georgetown Government professor Marc Howard, zealously fought for his freedom. Tankleff was released from prison in 2007 after a private investigator discovered new evidence in the case that cleared Tankleff. 
Following Tankleff’s release from prison, he obtained his bachelors and juris law degrees. After being admitted to the New York State Bar in 2020, Tankleff was sworn into the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
Tankleff and Howard currently teach an undergraduate course titled “Making an Exoneree,” where students learn how to free innocent people through advocacy and storytelling. 
Tankleff said his background prepares him for the position in the government department. 
“My unique and diverse background, life experiences and professional experiences have prepared me for this distinguished position, which I am honored that Georgetown has bestowed upon me,” Tankleff wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Tankleff follows a long line of prominent public officials, lawyers and diplomats that have served in this distinguished professorship. Most recently, the position was held by current White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain (CAS ’83).
Howard, who grew up with Tankleff in Long Island, N.Y., said Tankleff’s passion and values make him the perfect fit for the position.
“Marty is a perfect fit for the Mullen Distinguished Visiting Professorship at Georgetown. He is a true leader and role model, and he absolutely loves teaching at Georgetown,” Howard wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Marty embodies Georgetown’s value of ‘Hoyas for others’ and he inspires his students to pursue justice not only in his class, but in their lives.” 
Tankleff said his course, “Making an Exoneree,” combines criminal justice with storytelling and online advocacy to help advocate for wrongfully convicted citizens. 
“Our students learn about criminal justice, sociology, psychology, interpersonal relationships, time management, interviewing, traveling, and so much more. Our students face real world challenges that no other class offers and with those challenges comes the opportunity to have a direct impact on someone’s life, the possibility of freedom,” Tankleff wrote. 
The 15-student course incorporates numerous cases by using video documentaries and media campaigns to reinvestigate and bring light to possible injustices, according to Howard. The course also filmed a Hulu documentary in 2019 on the Christina Boyer case, which is scheduled to air by the end of 2022, Tankleff said. 
Boyer was wrongfully convicted for failing to seek proper medical attention for her daughter, which purportedly led to her death, despite Boyer having an alibi, hospital emergency room records and the medical examiner for consultation in the case. 
The pair also created the Robert Katzmann Fellowship, which funds a year-long teaching and research assistant position in their “Making an Exoneree” course, to further support students interested in investigating wrongful conviction cases. 
Nell Haney (COL ’22), the first Katzmann Fellow and a teaching assistant in the “Making an Exoneree” course, was a student in the 2021 course and worked on the wrongful conviction case of Raymond Allan Warren, who was sentenced to 18 years of prison on drug charges when he was only 16 years old. 
“Getting to work with Allan has brought so much meaning to my life, which was what motivated me to accept the Robert Katzmann Fellowship and continue my involvement as the MAE TA,” Haney wrote to The Hoya. “My main goal for this year is to support the current students in their endeavors such that they can create similarly impactful relationships.” 
Haney said Tankleff’s influence is one of the reasons why the course promotes Georgetown’s values of service and being men and women for others. 
“Marty has shown such a commitment to Georgetown, its students and the community at large, and I’m so glad that he is being recognized in this way. Marty is, in many ways, beyond words,” Haney wrote.  
This article was updated on March 25 to correct the date Tankleff was convicted and charged and to correct the age he was convicted.

The Georgetown University McDonough School of Business (MSB) Master in Business Administration (MBA) Program selected 50 students to participate in the 2022 Leadership Fellows Program. 
The selective program chooses students who hope to coach and develop their peers in leadership positions. Fellows are chosen through a competitive process each fall and then trained through a rigorous coaching program, so they can challenge first-year MBA students to do their best work. 
Fellows participate in three experimental coaching programs during the 2022 spring semester, taking classes on topics like leadership communications, coaching high performance teams and individuals and advanced coaching skills. Fellows also have the opportunity to work alongside faculty. 
Leadership fellows work to coach first-year MBA students through a required “Leadership Communications” course which culminates in a final challenge — a day-long competition which simulates the day in the life of a senior leader testing students on their leadership, communication and relationship-building skills. The class began on March 21. 
Nicholas Mastas (GRD ’22), a fellow in the program, said “Leadership Communications” was one of the most impactful classes he took as a first-year MBA student. 
“Despite being virtual, my leadership coach pushed me and my team to be better communicators and improve ourselves during our weekly speeches and case challenges. By the end of the course, our team had made so much growth on both an individual and group level and finished strong during the capstone executive challenge,” Mastas wrote to The Hoya. 
The class is a valuable part of the MBA program’s curriculum due to its group focus, according to Bridget Greaney (GRD ’22), a leadership fellow who took the Leadership Communications course last year as a first year MBA student.  
“That class is such a valuable aspect of the core curriculum because it focuses on group dynamics as well as individual learning objectives within presentations and cases. I really enjoyed taking Leadership Communications last year and hope to add to the first years’ experience as they gear up for the Executive Challenge!” Greaney wrote to The Hoya. 
Mastas hopes his first year students will be able to use the skills they gain from the program after they graduate. 
“I knew I wanted to apply to the leadership fellows program and be able to give the first years a similar experience to my own in hopes that they can take these skills into their internships and beyond,” Mastas wrote. 
The opportunity to create a community within a group of first year MBA students is rewarding, Martin Winter (GRD ’22), a leadership fellow said.  
“What I’m really, really excited about is actually the ability to go into a completely blank canvas with no really pre-installed culture in this group,” Winter said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’ll all be starting this journey right at the exact same time and so it’s a really unique opportunity to have.”  
Christine Peters (MBA ’23), a first-year MBA student in the leadership class, said that she hopes the class allows her to learn how to approach management in job settings post-graduation.
“I am hoping for practice in identifying strengths and weaknesses in a new group and learning how to approach each person in a way that will help them improve,” Peters wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is especially relevant to me because I will immediately be managing people in my role after MSB.”
MSB Professor Evelyn Williams said the program represents Georgetown’s Jesuit values.  
“The Leadership Fellows definitely represent our Jesuit tradition of women and men serving others. They give tirelessly to the development of the first-year MBA class during the last six weeks of the Spring semester,” Williams wrote to The Hoya. 
Williams appreciates the opportunity to work with students selected for the fellowship program who often stay involved in the MSB.   
“I feel very blessed and honored to get to work with such a tremendously talented group of some of our very best McDonough students every year in the Leadership Fellow program,” Williams wrote. “What’s particularly wonderful is I don’t really have to say goodbye at graduation because they tend to stay very involved with the School even after graduation.” 
Mastas hopes he can use the experience to grow his leadership skills outside of the classroom. 
“I will be joining Capital One in a leadership program after graduation and feel that these skills will help me transition smoothly into my new role,” Mastas wrote. “I would love to build an alumni network around the fellowship program that can connect alumni and continue their leadership development beyond the MBA program.”

Visitors lined the National Mall and Tidal Basin this week to celebrate spring in Washington, D.C., and gathered for the first in-person National Cherry Blossom Festival in three years.
The National Cherry Blossom Festival and the Japan Foundation hosted a sold-out opening ceremony at Warner Theatre March 20 to kick off this year’s festival. The festival features multiple events, including a run, music and art displays. Before its April 17 conclusion, it will also hold the Blossom Kite Festival on March 26 and the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade on April 9. The festivities come as the cherry blossom trees reached peak bloom March 21, 10 days ahead of average, with 70% of the Tidal Basin’s Yoshino cherry trees blooming. 
This year’s festival  — which featured performers like Japanese percussionist Toshihiro Yuta and samurai artist KAMUI — marks a return of the iconic springtime celebration after the  2020 and 2021 events had to be held virtually, canceled or scaled down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Diana Mayhew, President and CEO of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, in a March 1 press release.  
“We’ve brought a number of talented artists together for a unique, one-time-only performance,” Mayhew wrote in the press release. “We look forward to an unforgettable celebration of Japanese culture and the cherry blossoms that starts at the stage and extends worldwide.”
In addition to the performances, Japanese Ambassador Koji Tomita offered remarks to the audience in the opening ceremony, highlighting the strength of Japanese-American relations and how the cherry blossoms serve as an annual reminder of the alliance.
“One hundred ten years ago, as a gift of friendship, the mayor of Tokyo donated about 3,000 cherry blossom trees to the people of the United States,” Tomita said at the ceremony. “That gift has blossomed into an amazing celebration that we are opening today.”
First lady Jill Biden, who serves as an honorary chair of the festival, addressed the theater through a pre-recorded video, where she said the resurgence of the cherry blossoms offers hope amid times of turmoil.
“When their flowers blanket our sidewalks and river trails, we are reminded of the harmony, constancy and renewal that can be found in nature. The world keeps moving forward, and even the coldest winter can’t last forever,” Biden said at the ceremony. “The President and I wish you warm days and bright skies, friendships that deepen with time and the renewed hope that comes this spring.”
More than 1.5 million people visit the Cherry Blossom Festival every year, including Isabel Mu (SFS ’24), who said she was excited for the return of the festival following two years of closure.
“The festival symbolizes a return to normalcy, where I can resume my day-to-day activities,” Mu wrote to The Hoya. “For instance, visiting the cherry blossoms is only an activity I can do if I live on campus in D.C. Especially since peak blossom week is the same time as Georgetown making masks optional, I think the festival is a closer step towards the end of the pandemic.”
Eric Canady, a tourist from Portland, Ore., said the cherry blossoms offer an opportunity to see many of the District’s landmarks in a unique way while celebrating the spring weather.
“We rented some bikes and we’re cruising around the National Mall checking out the monuments,” Canady said in an interview with The Hoya. “We went by the White House, the World War II memorial, we’re here at the Lincoln Memorial and next we’re off to the Jefferson.” 
According to D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), the festival serves as the grand reopening of the District to the rest of the nation amid waning COVID-19 cases and precautionary measures. 
“We want D.C. to be the face of spring for the nation,” Bowser said in a March 1 press conference. “Let me say, without equivocation, that D.C. is open.”
The cherry blossom festival offers another opportunity for Georgetown students to visit many of the District’s famous sights, Mu said.
“The festival represents another opportunity for me to explore the city with my friends, since the cherry blossoms are special to D.C.,” Mu wrote. “They remind me of sunny weather and the happy memories I associated with visiting D.C. as a kid.”

The Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program (GAAP) student ambassadors welcomed prospective students and parents to campus with signs, balloons and cheers during the first in-person admitted students weekend since 2019. 
After two years of canceled GAAP weekends as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, students who were admitted to Georgetown University in the early action cycle had the opportunity to visit campus March 18-19. 
GAAP weekend gave accepted students the opportunity to experience life at Georgetown through campus and neighborhood tours, department open houses, icebreaker sessions, faculty showcases, student panels, residence hall tours and a campus activities fair. 
GAAP is a student-run organization that aims to help prospective and admitted students familiarize themselves with Georgetown through outreach programs, winter receptions, high school visits, phone calls and GAAP weekends.
The GAAP board had to be innovative in planning the weekend, since many of them had not personally experienced the program due to the pandemic, according to Zehra Mirza (COL ’24), director of communications for GAAP. 
“This was our first one in three years. Just preparing for it, we relied a lot on talking to alumni board members,” Mirza said in an interview with The Hoya. “A few of our alumni board actually came to help us set up for the first weekend, which is really sweet. But I think we all worked really well together. It went pretty smoothly.”
Elliot Landolt (MSB ’25), a GAAP student ambassador, said the GAAP program provides a unique opportunity for prospective students to get to know one another and discover what it is like to be a Georgetown student.
“I feel like all these guys are learning so much information. Especially this morning, we had icebreaker sessions that are just super great for everybody to kind of meet each other,” Landolt told The Hoya. “You get opportunities to talk to new people, and you get to hear from Georgetown students in a sort of unfiltered manner. It just makes making the decision easier.”
Seth Edwards, an accepted student from Spencerport, N.Y., said GAAP weekend differed from his previous visit to Georgetown during the pandemic and made him feel welcomed on campus. 
“I’m learning about aspects that you can’t see on the website and stuff like that. I liked just seeing the campus again because I was here in August, and being able to go into buildings this time, because COVID shut down everything, and having professors actually talk to you was great,” Edwards said in an interview with The Hoya. “I’m really looking forward to coming back because I already committed, so I’m super excited to actually experience Georgetown.” 
Georgetown and the GAAP board will host two additional accepted students weekends April 8-9 and April 22-23 for prospective students who applied during the regular decision application cycle, were deferred in the early action application cycle or could not attend the first GAAP weekend. 
The university is excited to have future Georgetown students on campus, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Experiences like GAAP weekends help prospective students gain greater insight into the Georgetown experience and ultimately choose to become Hoyas,” the university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “We look forward to welcoming our future Hoyas to the hilltop in the coming weeks.”
Mirza said that accepted students and their families gave the GAAP board positive feedback about their experiences throughout the duration of GAAP weekend.
“We actually had a parent text us on our Instagram that her undecided daughter now wants to commit,” Mirza said. “Everyone has just had a really positive experience just because they had so much interaction with faculty, with current students, and just being able to see all parts of campus.”
Dylan Becker, an accepted student from Brookhaven, Mo., said he enjoyed his GAAP weekend experience because he thought Georgetown’s community seemed inclusive and accepting. 
“The best thing I’ve seen is that the Georgetown community itself seems to be really united and open to all of us,” Becker said in an interview with The Hoya. “That has been consistent throughout the weekend, so that’s a really great thing about this program.”

An 18-year-old high school senior entered the race for Ward 3’s seat on the D.C. Council on March 9 and is one of several candidates seeking to replace incumbent Mary Cheh, who announced she would not seek reelection in February.
Henry Cohen, a student at Jackson-Reed High School, previously known as Woodrow Wilson High School, is the youngest candidate in this year’s Council elections. If elected, Cohen would become the youngest elected Councilmember in D.C. history. Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto (LAW ’17) currently holds that distinction after having been elected at the age of 28 in 2020.
The Hoya sat down with Cohen on March 22 to discuss the significance of his campaign, his hopes if elected and the importance of younger voices in politics.
Cohen decided to run for Ward 3 Councilmember to show the District that student voices matter and should receive more attention and value.
“Coming of age, especially in the Trump era, has shown me that there’s a lot of momentum for change in younger people, yet that momentum has yet to translate to the halls of power,” Cohen said in an interview with The Hoya. “For so long in this city, students, especially, are voices that have been ignored. It doesn’t have to be that way. We can change it.”
In order to be eligible to run in the June 21 Democratic primary, candidates had to submit 250 signatures from eligible registered Democrats residing in Ward 3 by March 23. Cohen garnered 451 signatures, 50 of which came from students. According to Cohen, some of those signatures may be invalidated through the challenge process, but he has enough excess signatures to appear on the ballot.
Cohen was inspired to run for office after the roof of his high school started leaking, prompting his friends to urge him to run for D.C. Council to fix the leaky roof. 
“I got so much support from students, people who I’m friends with, and people who I’m not, people I don’t really know, who wanted to have this kind of voice, or thought it would be a cool thing for someone running for council at Jackson-Reed,” Cohen said. “I think that Jackson-Reed is excited to have a voice of its own. It’s been an honor to see the public support from the Wilson community.”
While Cohen understands that many voters may consider him unqualified given his age, he believes his campaign is a success in and of itself for younger voices.
“The point of this campaign for me was really to make some noise for a lot of these issues,” Cohen said. “Whether or not we win the most votes, I think that this campaign is won or lost in the change that we actually get. I’m incredibly optimistic that a lot of these things are going to get done because we’ve been seeing for the first time in this city this level of support from students.”
While Cohen said he expected negative responses to his campaign because of his age, he was surprised by the discouraging response he received from Mayor Muriel Bowser (D).
“The first words out of her mouth were, ‘Why aren’t you running for ANC?’” Cohen said. “Then she said, ‘You need to be taking this seriously.’ She didn’t think that an 18-year-old could really run a campaign like this. To have the mayor say that to a young kid trying to get involved in politics is really fascinating to me. I’m not going to back down from that fight.”
Bowser declined The Hoya’s request for comment. 
According to Cohen, many of his friends and classmates registered to vote as a result of his candidacy and advocacy.
Annabelle Harbold, another senior at Jackson-Reed, said Cohen’s campaign exemplifies the influence teenagers in the District can have.
“Henry has really shown us that youth in D.C. do have a voice, it’s often easy to think that there isn’t much you can do as a young person to impact your community but he has demonstrated to us what is possible,” Harbold wrote to The Hoya. “He has really mobilized the students at Wilson to get involved in our democracy. I’m confident that regardless of the results of the Council election student voter turnout will skyrocket due to his efforts.”
Despite the pushback he received, Cohen said he is determined to continue fighting for youth participation in politics.
“As far as I know, I’m the first high school student to run for office in D.C., but I’m not going to be the last, and I shouldn’t be the last,” Cohen said. “I hope that somebody is watching right now thinking ‘that is going to be me in a few years.’ I think that we’ve shown that it’s possible.”
