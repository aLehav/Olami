Graduating seniors’ artwork is on display in the Maria and Alberto de la Cruz Gallery to celebrate their skills and accomplishments. 
The 2022 Senior Art Majors Exhibition, organized by the Georgetown University department of art and art history, opened April 21 and is on display through their graduation in late May. The display features artwork from the program’s three graduating seniors: Alexandra Bowman (COL ’22), Tyler McConville (COL ’22) and Daimon Squier (COL ’22).
The Senior Art Majors Exhibition began in 1960 as a collection of solo shows for graduating seniors in the program. While the showcase was initially hosted in the basement of Healy Hall, it has since moved to the Maria and Alberto de la Cruz Gallery, located in the Edmund A. Walsh Memorial Building, which has hosted the exhibition since 2019. 
The showcase provides a special opportunity to see some of the artwork created by art majors on campus, according to Al Miner, founding director and chief curator of the Georgetown University Art Galleries and associate professor of the practice in museum studies.
“During most of the academic year, the GU Art Galleries bring work by highly acclaimed professional artists to campus,” Miner wrote to The Hoya. “The annual Senior Art Majors Exhibition is when we shift focus to highlight creative achievements by students.”
Alexandra Bowman, one of the featured artists, said she hopes her audience will use her political cartoons to examine political symbols and unpack complex, high-stakes contemporary issues.
“While focusing on American politics and environmental subjects, I criticize those in power and illustrate the human impact of their misdeeds,” Bowman wrote to The Hoya. “To illustrate my points, I use humor and express compassionate empathy for those abused by demagogues who exploit their power. I work to leave room for nuance, keeping cartoons civil by avoiding ad hominems and instead attacking substance and calling out concrete wrongdoing.”
Full Disclosure: Bowman is a former staff member of The Hoya. 
One of Bowman’s works, titled “The Serpent Eating Democracy,” resembles the famous “Join, or Die” cartoon by Benjamin Franklin to present recent voting policy changes as a threat to democracy in the United States. 
Tyler McConville specializes in photography and emphasizes composition, contrast and color to bring attention to the subject of the piece.
“Evidence,” “Possessions” and “Trash” are a series of photographs commenting on the abundance and consequences of overconsumption. According to McConville, their pieces aim to evoke discomfort and reflection from the audience and prompt thinking about major societal issues.
“Generally, my artwork communicates a critical perspective of the society and structures in which I live,” McConville wrote to The Hoya.
McConville said having their artwork displayed in a gallery is a special moment to commemorate the culmination of art students’ work.
“This is my first time having my work exhibited in a gallery,” McConville wrot. “It has been such an exciting and validating experience. My dad, stepmom, brothers, and grandparents all came down for the opening reception which was really special.”
Daimon Squier uses oil on canvas as his primary medium for his works, saying he prefers painting and drawing so as to display the strokes, marks and lines that compose an image.
“For the content of my work, I focus more on the suggestions of meaning and aesthetic qualities rather than a premeditated message,” Squier wrote to The Hoya. “For this series, I was drawn to the parallels between human, animal, and plant biology, but also wanted to instill an ‘divine’ or ‘otherworldly’ atmosphere.”
Miner said while each artist has their own techniques and styles, they all showcased their individuality through their artwork at the showcase.“Each has collaborated closely with their faculty advisor to select the pieces that best represent their signature style, the themes that are meaningful to them, and the techniques they’ve mastered over four productive years,” Miner wrote. “Seeing their work displayed side by side, both their uniqueness and what they’ve shared as a cohort is visible.”

The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History announced plans to open an exhibition dedicated to American pop culture, becoming the first-ever permanent exhibit to focus on the history of entertainment in the museum.
The bilingual exhibition, titled “Entertainment Nation”/“Nación del espectáculo,” celebrates the power of entertainment over the past 150 years in the United States and how entertainment has enabled important national conversations. The exhibition is set to open December 2022. Curators incorporated the museum’s extensive collection of nearly 1.8 million objects and artifacts from theater, movies, sports and television, including ruby slippers from “The Wizard of Oz,” Prince’s yellow “Cloud” guitar and Muhammad Ali’s boxing robe.
The exhibit will allow museum visitors to browse a diverse collection of artifacts from significant pop culture moments throughout American history in one location, according to Museum Curator Krystal Klingenberg.
“The museum has had a really fascinating and multifaceted collection of entertainment materials,” Klingenberg said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s a fantastic time to pull all these things together so the public can see the treasures the museum has had — all in one place.”
Visitors will be able to move through pop culture moments through a series of interactive exhibits, utilizing immersive sound systems to amplify visitors’ experience as they are transported through the world of film.
Carefully designing the exhibition’s objects and themes was a difficult task for museum staff who tried to emphasize the importance of entertainment throughout history on visitors, according to Eric Jentsch, an entertainment and sports curator at the museum.
“We wanted to show that entertainment not only can reflect, but also participate in, our national history, and is a way in which people around the world engage in broader social and historical issues,” Jentsch wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While entertainment is often overlooked as an avenue to view American history, the exhibition seeks to highlight the influence of pop culture on public opinion and conversations surrounding American history, according to Klingenberg.
“Sometimes, entertainment is looked at with less weight. Music, movies, TV, sports, theater — all of these domains can push the conversation forward,” Klingenberg said. “Not only for expressions of who we are, but also for who we want to be.” 
More than 200 objects will be displayed in the multimedia exhibition, according to the Smithsonian’s latest press release. The exhibit seeks to highlight the contributions of all genres of entertainment in conversations surrounding history and national identity moving forward. 
“There are some real treasures that are going to be out that people will want to see for themselves,” Klingenberg said. “We have worked really hard to hone these ideas, these scripts, these objects to bring together something that we feel really does tell what we want to the public.”
John Troutman, who serves as the project director and lead curator of the “Entertainment Nation”/“Nación del espectáculo” exhibition, said he hopes the values that connect Americans will be expressed through the exhibit’s objects.
“I hope that we can help illuminate that our national entertainments — beyond spaces for escape from the daily grind (which we all need!) — have also, always been fundamental spaces for working out, for better and sometimes for worse, the degree to which the country at any given time can meet its ideals of democracy and justice, who can be included (and then, who has been excluded), and how those foundational tenets are experienced by everyone,” Troutman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Jentsch said the exhibition creators anticipate that viewers will gain a greater understanding of the complex interaction between entertainment and American history.
“Our visitors will leave the exhibition thinking more of the influence Entertainment has had in their engagement with social and historical issues, as well as reflect on how they have used their own entertainment interests to navigate their own identities,” Jentsch wrote.

Georgetown University biology professor Maryna Baydyuk (MED ’10) is working to provide humanitarian relief to Ukrainians through her rapidly expanding nonprofit organization, United Help Ukraine. 
Baydyuk founded United Help Ukraine following Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea. After Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, donations to United Help Ukraine have skyrocketed, according to Baydyuk, who said the organization has raised over $22 million and spent nearly $15 million supplying humanitarian aid and medical supplies to Ukraine.
Baydyuk also said the organization has gained more volunteers both in the United States and Ukraine. 
“We grew pretty large — in the past two months, we’ve also increased the number of our volunteers here in the U.S., but also in Poland and Ukraine,” Baydyuk told The Hoya. 
Baydyuk was born in Ukraine and lived there with her family until she moved to the United States to finish her undergraduate studies in 1998. Though her mother and sister evacuated their family home after Russia began its invasion, her father remains in Kyiv. 
Baydyuk said she continues to hear about the deaths of her friends and loved ones in Ukraine. 
“My family home is outside of Kyiv, and part of it was destroyed,” Baydyuk said. “A very good friend of ours who we let stay in our house — a young man who just proposed to his fiancee not long ago — a rocket or grenade hit the house, and he died.”
Russian missile and air strikes have led to a total of 5,264 Ukrainian civilian casualties, according to an April 21 report by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet.
Since the invasion began, the Georgetown community has rallied in support of Ukraine by providing medical aid and training to Ukrainians abroad, organizing protests and demonstrations in support of Ukraine and inviting speakers to raise awareness for the ongoing crisis. 
Ukrainian students have been grateful to receive support from the Georgetown community, according to Andrii Sendziuk (MSB ’24), a Ukrainian student and organizer for student activism group Stand With Ukraine GU.
“When we are organizing, we are expecting a specific response, and in all cases, we’ve seen the response is better than we expected,” Sendziuk told The Hoya. “Beginning from tabling and rallies, people would come up, people would ask questions. What I also really liked is that people would spark conversation.”
However, Ukrainian Hoyas have found that conversation on the crisis has died down over the past two months, according to Sendziuk. 
“With previous wars, and other things that have happened in the past, the trend is, when it’s happening, people pay attention,” Sendziuk said. “People talk about it, but then it usually really dies down within like a month or so. And that’s what we’ve seen with Ukraine.”
To keep the momentum going, Sendziuk said Ukrainian Hoyas are continuing to spread the word about ways non-Ukrainian members of the Georgetown community can get involved. 
“Stand With Ukraine GU posts regular updates in terms of rallies, in terms of tabling — stuff like that — and you can always get involved,” Sendziuk said. “Second thing you can very tangibly do is reach out to your representatives. And, most importantly, I would just say stay on top of what’s going on because it’s very easy to get drawn behind.”
Baydyuk spoke at the rally Stand With Ukraine GU put on March 2 and said she appreciates the support she has gotten from students. 
“The rally was well organized by some of the Ukrainian students, but also others who wanted to support Ukraine,” Baydyuk said. “Students have been really supportive all this time in understanding the situation.”
Fellow Ukrainian student Inna Cherniak (SFS-Q ’23) said the most important thing non-Ukrainians can do is listen to Ukrainian voices in the conversation about the ongoing crisis.
“I really appreciate centering Ukrainian voices and just letting them be heard, because people who’ve been affected by war can speak from their own perspective. It’s been beneficial for us, but it’s also beneficial for those who listen because they can get a wider outlook,” Cherniak told The Hoya. “It is our responsibility — the responsibility that we didn’t ask for, the responsibility that we just assume as Ukrainians — to keep the word going.” 
Beyond the solidarity demonstrated by Americans in the wake of the invasion, Baydyuk said the community can do more.
“Yes, the American government has supported Ukraine tremendously, and I know Ukrainian people are very grateful for that,” Baydyuk said. “But, can we do more as a community? Can we do more as a country? As a Ukrainian ally? Absolutely, yes.”

A Georgetown University professor wrote a book titled “Invisible Weapons: Infiltrating Resistance and Defeating Movements,” which focuses on how oppressive systems encourage anti-radicalism in order to stifle marginalized individuals’ participation in radical politics and advocacy. 
The book, written by Marcus Board, assistant professor in the department of African American studies, will be published June 29. In the book, Board discusses his research of police shootings of different demographic groups in various cities, provides in-depth interviews with food stamp recipients in Chicago and analyzes national survey data. Board utilizes this research to determine the root of the relationship in the United States between radicalism and the governmental status quo.
Board said his research reveals that anti-radical politics aid oppressive systems and hinder social justice movements, such as what he identified as the “Movement for Black Lives.”
“Oppressed groups are being coerced and co-opted and pushed to believing that anti-radical politics — capitalism, anti-intellectualism, individualism, and more — are the only way to be safe and survive,” Board wrote to The Hoya. “And I believe getting to the root of this lie is important not only for understanding how this oppressive government and many other institutions work, but also for helping recover those people who have bent and been broken under the weight of oppressive power.”
According to Board, his work is rooted in a commitment to justice and finding ways of practicing tangible forms of resistance. 
“To be honest, my inspiration is justice,” Board wrote. “I never wanted my education to be about my own successes; rather, I went to school and learned how to conduct research because radicalism dictates that we get to the root of problems and I needed better tools than what I had. And so, this project is in many ways a culmination of those pursuits and my commitment to revolution as a daily practice.”
Readers in the Georgetown community will benefit from Board’s work in engaging with social movements, according to Andrew Sobanet, professor and vice dean of faculty in Georgetown College.
“We are eagerly awaiting the release of Professor Board’s book Invisible Weapons,” Sobanet wrote to The Hoya. “Professor Board is doing vital research in his field by expanding knowledge about the Movement for Black Lives. His deep engagement with important sociopolitical matters is of great benefit to our students, the university, and the broader community.”
Katie Cunningham (COL ’25), who took Board’s Ignatius seminar titled “Blackness and the Foundations of Power” in the fall 2021 semester, said that Board will continue to inspire readers to refocus American narratives around radicalism and social justice.
“Professor Board changed the way I think about American politics and social justice,” Cunningham wrote to The Hoya. “I’m so grateful for all that I learned from him about Black political theory and how to appreciate social movements from an academic lens. I’m sure that he will continue to inspire people in his new book.”
Board said he hopes that viewers realize the importance of creating change and working to expose and deconstruct the roots of social injustice and oppression.
“Getting to the bottom of things is hard work, challenging, thankless, and oftentimes painful,” Board wrote. “And as the old proverb says, if you want to go fast then go alone, but if you want to go far then go together. So In this quest to unpack, deconstruct, and ideally dismantle oppressive systems, I know that this work can be a bridge too far for many people — and I think that’s ok.”
Board says he hopes to emphasize the feasibility of creating social change and seeking to discover the root of societal injustice through his book.
“What I hope more than anything folks take away from this book is that everyday resistance, everyday community, everyday life is enough of a contribution,” Board wrote. “All we need is for people to believe and know that they have a choice. And from there, we’ll find our people and make it out together.”

Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine is due to the Russian president’s dangerously obsessive motivations, former United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (GRD ’74) said at an April 25 event. 
The event, which featured a discussion between Gates and Georgetown University president John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95), took place in Gaston Hall as part of this year’s Tanous Family Endowed Lecture. Gates spoke on the prospects for the future of Russia’s invasion on Ukraine, Putin’s motivations in the crisis and the effects on the lives of Americans.  
Gates is the only Secretary of Defense to have remained in office under two presidents, serving under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Gates previously served as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1991 to 1993. Prior to his work in government, Gates received his Ph.D. in Russian and Soviet history from Georgetown.
Gates said Putin’s motivations are rooted in an obsession with rebuilding the Russian Empire.
“Putin has become obsessed,” Gates said at the event. “This has nothing to do with trying to recreate the Soviet Union. This is about recreating the Russian Empire, and specifically the Slavic core: Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. He believes that these are all one people and they all belong to one entity.” 
Much of Putin’s motivation in the Ukrainian invasion comes as a result of Putin’s Russian imperialist belief that Russia and Ukraine are one country, bound by a shared origin. Putin believes that the only way for Russia to become itself is through the annihilation of Ukraine, denying Ukraine’s independent history and national identity.
Gates said that Putin views Ukraine as a way to regain Russian supremacy in Eastern Europe, a frightening reminder of the strength of authoritarianism at this time. 
“In a way, he has reached back to the mid-19th century from Russia,” Gates said. “We thought in the early ’90s, democracy would prevail, that democracy has become stronger than authoritarian governments, but clearly we had just convinced ourselves of that.” 
In opposition of Putin’s nationalist determination, Gates said American politicians have united to sanction Russia, which may provide a glimpse into further cooperation between opposing political parties.
“Putin has accomplished what no living being has accomplished, bringing the Democrats and Republicans together,” Gates said. “Truth is from left to right, you have really strong bipartisan support for the United States in doing what’s best, and maybe I’m just a bit optimistic — but this may lead to broader bipartisan cooperation on other issues of national security.” 
Lawmakers from across the aisle have shown support for Ukraine both Republican and Democrats pushing to provide more military assistance to the country. 
According to Gates, the U.S. government’s ability to unite global leaders in retaliation against Russia and support Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has shown the strength of international institutions.
“I think they’ve done a really good job, with the way they get the NATO coalition to unite and deliver these severe sanctions is an extraordinary thing,” Gates said. 
Gates also said the invasion of Ukraine will have negative effects on the U.S economy, including on the price of food. 
“Guess what? Ukraine and Russia produce 30% of the grains, corn, barley and wheat in the world, so if the price goes way up in the rest of the world — it’s going to go up in the United States,” Gates said. “It’s important that our leaders are helping Americans understand what we’re doing on the global stage and why it matters for our economy.” 
The ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a strain on global wheat supplies causing a spike in the global prices of goods such as cereal and bread that rely on Easteran European grain exports. This has also caused the prices of food in the U.S. to rise.
According to Gates, Putin has further ambitions of capturing more autonomous land in Eastern Europe and it is imperative that leaders fight against Putin’s attempted annexations.
“I think he wants not only to gain land in Eastern Europe, but in the Southeast as well,” Gates said. “Using the area around the Black Sea as a land bridge to Crimea, I think he wants to leave Ukraine a landlocked country. He’s not done with Eastern Europe, he wants to change Eastern Europe, and Zelenskyy cannot give up.”

H*yas for Choice (HFC) celebrated 30 years of advocacy work fighting for reproductive justice and sex positivity on campus with a week of events and fundraising efforts.
The organization, a pro-abortion rights student group, hosted a series of events beginning April 25 to celebrate the group’s work throughout the past three decades. Celebrations included an event recounting the history of the club, a birth control panel featuring an obstetrician-gynecologist and a tabling event where HFC members distributed condoms with slogans riffing on classic Georgetown phrases, such as “H*YA SEX~A” and “MEN AND WOMEN FOR OTHERS’ PLEASURE.” 
James Moran (COL ’25) tabled for HFC this week and said he has appreciated getting to learn about the group’s past.
“I enjoy the history — we’re able to read and understand the importance of what we do and we feel appreciated, and I think that’s really nice,” Moran told The Hoya.
Since it’s founding in 1991, HFC has pushed to expand access to quality reproductive and sexual health services on campus, according to HFC President Chloe Kekedjian (COL ’22).
“In the past 30 years, we have provided condoms to the student body through tabling and delivery,” Kekedjian wrote to The Hoya. “We have also pushed the University to continue to cover birth control on University health insurance, and not take the religious exemption under Obamacare. We have delivered free emergency contraceptives to students on campus for 5 years now.” 
As a Jesuit university, Georgetown does not provide many sexual health resources to students, including condoms and other contraceptives. As a result, HFC is one of the only sources for students to access condoms, lube and Plan B.
HFC Co-Director of Organization and Advocacy Lauryn Ping (COL ’23) said the week of celebrations are meant to both advocate for sex positivity and continue the fight for reproductive justice. 
HFC hosted a vibrator raffle for students, which raised funds for abortions in states that have passed restrictive anti-abortion bans, according to Ping. The organizations that the funds will go towards include the Midwest Access Coalition, Fund Texas Choice and the Florida Access Network. 
Ping said throughout the week, students can stop by the HFC tables for fun sexual health activities and Georgetown Day-themed condoms. According to Emmie Meisel (COL ’25), who helps table for HFC, promoting sexual positivity in this way enables the organization to reach a wider audience.
“Specialty condoms get people excited about safe sex and draw people to the h*yas for choice tables, which further exposes them to all of the other things we have to offer,” Meisel wrote to The Hoya. “It can be a bit awkward to go up to the table and take condoms normally, so the special ones make it more approachable.”
HFC communications director Serena Barish (COL ’25) said she attended the birth control panel to learn more about how the drug can affect her body. 
“I think that it is often very difficult to learn sufficient information about birth control because it is rarely discussed openly in our society,” Barish wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As someone who has tried multiple forms of birth control, I was hoping to both learn more and potentially help others to learn from my experience.”
Kekedjian said HFC has also worked to improve menstrual equity and advance women’s rights on campus throughout the past 30 years, with this year’s festivities serving as a moment to recognize such efforts. 
“We have worked with the university and the maintenance department to expand access to sanitary products on campus to ensure menstrual equity, and have committed the university to converting the Women and Gender Studies program into a department,” Kekedjian wrote.
Students have raised concerns in the past about the lack of access to menstruation products on campus, with a 2019 report from the Office of Planning of Facilities Management to HFC revealing that only 15 of Georgetown’s 43 academic buildings provide menstrual products in bathrooms. The Expanding Student Access to Period Products Act of 2021, passed by the D.C. Council on Jan. 4, now requires that all schools provide free period products in women’s and gender-neutral bathrooms.
HFC, which was founded by Kelli McTaggart (COL ’92) and Julie McKenna (COL ’92), was originally named GU Choice as the university prohibited the word “for” in their name. While the group was given $135 of funding per semester in Feb. 1991 on the basis of the university’s free speech policies, the university took away its funding in April 1992, citing the organization’s pro-choice advocacy as being against the university’s Catholic values and arguing the group was not a place for discussion, but rather a pro-choice advocacy group.
In 2016, HFC co-sponsored an event hosted by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund in which Cecile Richards, who was the president of Planned Parenthood at the time, spoke about abortion rights and access to contraceptives. 
While HFC has accomplished many things in its time as an organization, Kekedjian said there is still important work to be done to fight for reproductive rights and sex positivity on campus.
“We want to expand access to services on campus and continue to push Georgetown to be a better place,” Kekedjian wrote. “We want to work with the student health center to reinstitute STI testing and work on making Georgetown more accomodating for gender non-conforming students on campus. We are also working on expanding our harm reduction services with our Narcan trainings and potentially getting drug testing kits for clubs to check out for parties.” 
Barish said that the week of events both honored the history of HFC’s work on campus while acknowledging the murky future of reproductive justice and bodily autonomy in the United States.
“Celebrating the work of this student group means focusing on all of those complicated elements of reproductive justice, with an eye toward a future in which my body remains something I control, regardless of the identities I hold,” Barish wrote.

Celebrating the slaughter of millions of innocent babies!  Hardly a Catholic university anymore.

Climate change is accelerating the refugee crisis and posing global, demographic and political disruptions, a panelist said at an April 25 event. 
The event, titled “State of Disaster: How Climate Migration Will Reshape U.S. Immigration Policy” featured María Cristina García (COL ’82), author and Cornell University professor of immigration and refugee history. At the event García highlighted various case studies to examine how U.S. policy handles climate-driven refugees. The American Studies Program hosted the event as part of the Richardson American Studies Lecture Series, which invites leading scholars to discuss history, politics and culture. 
Examining historical instances in which climate change has disrupted communities and led to climate-driven migration is important when considering how the global community must react to future refugee waves, García said. 
“The study of history offers us many examples of how environmental disasters have disrupted lives and livelihoods and how they have had political and demographic consequences. It’s part of the human story,” García said at the event. “We are now living in an era of accelerated climate change. At no other time in human history have we had eight billion people living on the planet all contributing in some way to the behaviors that are accelerating changes that in the deep past occurred over thousands of years rather than decades.” 
García spoke on various climate-driven natural disasters, including Hurricane Katrina, which displaced over one million people in the Gulf Coast in 2005, and Hurricane Mitch, which caused the deaths of 15,000 people in Central America and left one million Hondurans without homes after it struck the coast in 1998. 
Currently, the impacts of climate change, such as rising temperatures and rising sea levels, have caused 20 million people to leave their homes every year. By 2050, the World Bank estimates there will be 143 million more climate migrants from Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia alone. 
These changes could exacerbate existing non-climate related conflicts like food security, according to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’ December 2021 remarks to the UN Security Council.
García said climate-driven natural disasters disproportionately impact those living in poverty. 
“Hurricane Mitch was both a natural disaster and a policy-driven disaster,” García said. “The poor endured the most significant consequences. As one Honduran scholar noted, ‘The rains fell on all of Honduras, but not everyone got wet.’” 
U.S. immigration policy separates individuals coming to the country into three groups: those looking for economic opportunity, those wishing to reunite with family members already in the U.S. and those seeking political asylum, according to García.
By grouping migrants into specific boxes, the U.S. ignores the complex nature of migration, García said. 
“These distinct tracks for admission fail to recognize that more often than not, migration is multicausal, produced by a wide and complex range of intersecting drivers that often make it impossible to pinpoint a sole cause for migration,” García said. 
It is critical to listen to the voices of immigrants, which can include climate-driven refugees, to better understand their experiences, García said. 
“The environmental drivers of migration are often obscured in the importance of the immigration bureaucracy. It’s only when scholars interview immigrants that they have identified the role that environmental drivers play. It’s in the stories that immigrants tell that these environmental drivers become visible,” García said. 
The U.S. currently offers Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to individuals who are in the U.S. when their home country receives TPS designation due to an ongoing armed conflict, environmental disaster or extraordinary and temporary conditions. 
According to García, while TPS designations are helpful to some extent, the U.S. must focus on the root cause of immigration rather than put a band-aid solution over the larger problem. 
“Nations must address the reasons why people migrate in the first place, and that requires difficult conversations about the economic policies that have accelerated climate change, indebted nations, driven more and more people into poverty and made it impossible for people to exercise the right to stay home,” García said. “It’s only when we address these issues that we can begin to help populations adapt to the challenges of today and tomorrow.” 
The only way to prevent the climate-driven refugee crisis from worsening and displacing more people from their homes is to take significant steps toward combating climate change immediately, García said. 
“So much depends on how we respond to climate change moving forward. Climate change is a fast-moving train,” García said. “No matter how dramatic the steps you take at this moment are, it’s going to take a while to stop that train and perhaps reverse some of the effects that we are seeing today.”

Four Georgetown University School of Medicine students’ proposal to address the opioid crisis in Washington, D.C. won the 2022 Georgetown Public Policy Challenge.
The annual competition, which is hosted by the McCourt School of Public Policy, invites graduate students to submit policy proposals that offer a solution to a local issue of their choice. The winning team, whose proposal was named “Within Reach: Ending Opioid-Related Deaths in the District,” proposed increasing access to naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug, by installing opioid rescue kits at bus stops in Wards 5, 7 and 8. 
The “Within Reach” team, comprised of Kira Chandran (GRD ’23), Pei-Ying Kobres (GRD ’23), Chloe Wang (GRD ’23) and Ruth Watson (GRD ’23), received a $3,000 grand prize for placing first in the competition while the other four finalists were awarded $1,500 scholarships. Over 50 teams submitted proposals for the competition.
The four students have all been involved in the Hoya Drug Overdose Prevention & Education (DOPE) Project, an initiative that provides training for recognizing and treating opioid overdoses, since their first year of medical school.
The team’s work with DOPE helped develop their shared passion for solving the District’s opioid crisis, according to Chandran. 
“As one of the leaders of the Hoya DOPE (Drug Overdose Prevention & Education) Project, I have worked with many community organizations within DC to educate people about opioid overdoses and distribute naloxone,” Chandran wrote to The Hoya. “Through this work, I have realized some of the barriers to obtaining naloxone. This was part of the inspiration for our project.”
The team says it is important to help ongoing efforts to raise awareness for the prevention of opioid-related deaths. 
“We believe that community access to naloxone and overdose education are important parts of reducing opioid-related morbidity and mortality in DC,” the team wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “There are many people who have put a lot of work into reducing opioid-related deaths in DC, and we hope that our small contribution helps make DC a healthier community.”
The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 75,673 people died from opioid overdoses between April 2020 and April 2021, a 34.98% increase from the 56,064 opioid-related deaths recorded during the same period the year before.
As health practitioners in training, members of the team say their clinical work with patients has made them intimately aware of the suffering opioids cause among patients and the urgency in finding a solution.
“We are extremely proud to have taken an issue (opioid overdoses) that we witness every single day in the hospital, and engineer a harm-reduction policy that aims to decrease opioid-related deaths in our community,” the team wrote. 
The practicality and efficacy of the team’s proposal ultimately convinced the judges to vote for them among stiff competition, according to Jaclyn Clevenger, Director of the Public Policy Challenge.
“The level of competition at this year’s Georgetown Policy Challenge Finals was incredibly high, with teams presenting ideas focused on vertical farming opportunities, youth employment programs, and housing affordability and sustainability,” Clevenger wrote in an email to The Hoya. “However, the ‘Within Reach: Ending Opioid-Related Deaths in the District’ team stood out for their proposal’s potential to make a significant and immediate impact across Washington, DC.”
The “Within Reach” team will now work with the Public Policy Challenge’s leadership to implement their proposal with their prize money. Georgetown Associate Vice President for Local Government and Community Engagement Heidi Tseu is helping connect Challenge teams with policymakers in D.C. to finalize their proposal and develop an advocacy strategy. 
According to Tseu, the District’s government provides opportunities for students to create change in their communities through the legislative process.
“DC’s local government community has an open and dynamic process, which allows for great opportunities to have student voices heard,” Tseu wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “In the past we’ve had the opportunity to support student advocates who’ve succeeded in achieving local policy changes, such as funding to support immigrant legal services and DC’s DACA students.”
The team said their participation in the challenge has informed their other responsibilities.
“Working with this initiative has been an important part of our medical school experience,” the team wrote. “As we have entered our clinical rotations, we’ve seen first hand just how important opioid issues are to the DC community.”

When masks became optional for riders and employees on Washington, D.C. public transport, Marianne Savane (COL ’25) said she immediately became concerned, rushing to secure sanitizing materials before riding. 
“I’m not super happy, and frankly kind of surprised that they went with this decision,” Savane wrote to The Hoya. “I bring a hand sanitizer spray bottle on trains and buses to clean public surfaces and always make sure I’m wearing a mask.” 
On April 18, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit (WMATA) announced a mask-optional policy for riders and employees on Metrorail, Metrobus and MetroAccess services. The decision has prompted backlash from riders like Savane, as well as from local advocates like Marie Cohen, who serves on the Citizen Review Panel for the D.C. Child and Family Services Agency, and Phil Posner, Metro’s Accessibility Advisory Committee Chair. 
Updated federal guidelines led to WMATA’s decision to suspend its masking requirement, according to Paul Wiedefeld, WMATA general manager and chief executive officer, in a recent press release.
“Our mask mandate has been based on federal guidance,” Wiedefeld said. “We will continue to monitor this situation as it unfolds, but masks will be optional on Metro property until further notice.”  
Wiedefeld was referring to a federal judge who struck down the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) mask mandate for transportation services including planes and trains April 18. The ruling claims that the CDC did not follow necessary protocols when instating mask mandates for travelers.
Despite the federal judge’s ruling, the CDC still recommends that public transit users continue to wear masks. In addition, the Biden administration plans to appeal the ruling if public health officials deem it necessary.
The announcement comes despite a recent uptick in reported COVID-19 cases in D.C. due to the new omicron BA.2 subvariant. The 14-day average of COVID-19 cases in the District has increased by 223% in the past month.
WMATA will continue to utilize cleaning and safety measures to lower the spread of COVID-19 throughout the Metro system, according to WMATA Media Relations Manager Ian Janetta.
“Metro’s cleaning and air circulation protocols meet or exceed industry standards. Metro upgraded air filtration in stations, on trains, and on buses in response to the pandemic,” Jannetta wrote to The Hoya. “We continue to provide free masks in stations and on buses, and have observed a relatively high rate of mask usage even since the mandate was lifted.”
Despite these efforts, Savane said that she feels that the choice is inconsiderate of the safety of many riders, especially those with high-risk health conditions.
“I don’t think that they made the right choice at all,” Savane wrote.“Lots of elderly individuals and children take the Metro. Pregnant women who can’t drive take the Metro. A big portion of Metro riders are minorities too, so this move puts both immunocompromised and marginalized communities at risk.”
In response to the sudden decision to suspend the mask mandate, disability activists in the region, such as Cohen and Posner, have also been frustrated by WMATA’s decision. 
Posner recently urged Metro and its users to show sympathy for riders with disabilities, who may be at increased risk of infection or hospitalization from COVID-19. Posner said that while the federal ruling prevents WMATA from requiring masks, WMATA can and should recommend that riders wear masks on its trains and buses.
Savane said she worries about WMATA’s decision having harsh consequences on public health in Georgetown and throughout the District.
“I’m honestly concerned that more people are going to get sick and that more people are going to die,” Savane wrote. “Georgetown students are at risk too since many of them ride the Metro, so this move might even worsen an already worsening situation on campus.”

Activists advocated for the Biden Administration to take more action to combat climate change at a strike in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House. 
At the April 22 event, which was organized by Fridays for Future, a global climate change advocacy movement launched by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg in 2018, hundreds of students and community members gathered to demand President Joe Biden officially declare a climate emergency. 
If he does, the declaration will give Biden the executive ability to ban oil exports, suspend offshore drilling and boost funding for renewables, according to a Feb. 23 press release from the Center for Biological Diversity. 
Protesters marched in the streets near the White House chanting and holding signs reading “Climate Action Now” and “THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS HERE.”
Students from the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN), a campus organization promoting environmental activism, and other students traveled to the protest as a part of GREEN’s programming for GU Earth Week, a student-led collaboration between student organizations and professors to promote sustainability on campus. 
GREEN’s Environmental Justice Team co-lead Grace Jensen (COL ’24), said it is crucial to participate in the fight against climate change.
“Taking action into our hands is really important — even very small actions like recycling,” Jensen said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think that advocating for a better, cleaner, greener environment in our society is super important and we need to hold politicians accountable.”
Adriane Longhurst (COL ’25), who attended the protest, said the dangers of climate change will affect everyone. 
“Climate change is an existential threat that has already displaced millions of people and will continue to displace and harm millions more people,” Longhurst told The Hoya. “Climate change affects and threatens almost every aspect of life. No amount of money will allow you to run away from that — it is inevitable.” 
By the end of 2018, more refugees were displaced globally by climate disasters than war, according to the International Organisation for Migration’s 2020 World Migration Report.
Mayra Rios, a junior at James Madison High School in Vienna, Va. spoke at the event and said her family’s history with environmental injustice inspired her activism. 
“As a first generation Latina, I not only have the privilege but responsibility to speak out against the environmental injustices I have watched my family experience right in the heart of our nation’s capital,” Rios said at the strike.
Rios, who is the executive director of the Virginia Youth Climate Coalition, a youth-led movement pushing for climate justice, said temperatures in Columbia Heights are 20 degrees higher than other neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. because of the large amounts of concrete and asphalt from large buildings, roads and sidewalks, which absorb heat.
“While my people are breaking their backs under the scorching sun, the corporate elite are sitting in their comfortable, air-conditioned offices, signing more and more fossil fuel initiatives,” Rios said. “They profit off of the destruction of our ecosystems, the ravishing of our countries and the exploitation of the people who lack power.” 
In the past few years, D.C. has experienced record-breaking heat waves and snowstorms, higher tides due to rising sea levels, heavy rains and flooding, warmer average temperatures and two to three times as many dangerously hot days, according to the website for Sustainable DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser’s initiative for addressing climate change. 
Lynetta Cho, a sophomore at the National Cathedral School, a high school in the District, said discussions on climate change and its impact must be held in schools.  
Cho gave a speech at the protest and said she first learned of the implications of a climate disaster after her second grade teacher had her class watch a documentary on climate change.  
“I remember entire cities being flooded, homes being burnt to a crisp, species ceasing to exist and just being so confused. For a seven year old, it was a lot all at once,” Cho said at the protest. “I was comforted by others when they said ‘this isn’t happening now and we’re okay.’ It was good to hear at the time, but if we’re being honest, it was never okay eight years ago, and it definitely isn’t okay right now.” 
Jensen said it was thrilling to be around so many dedicated and proactive protesters.
“It is always really powerful to see so many young people come together to protest and fight for what they are passionate about,” Jensen said. “I thought it was a really good turn out, especially on earth day — always good to celebrate our earth and our communities as we continue to fight for them and for environmental justice and justice for all people.”

It is encouraging to see how well versed and passionate people are about climate change and the personal impact it has had on their lives.  I find it ironic that as one student said Washington DC’s temperature is 20 degrees higher than surrounding areas because of all the cement and asphalt covering the ground.
Climate change is all around our elected officials and still they cater to the fossil fuel industry. The time has come to listen to the young people who are going to inherit this problem, and start taking action to reverse the damage to the environment.

Georgetown University School of Medicine students shared stories about their identity and wellbeing at this year’s “I, Too, Am Georgetown Medicine” event, which highlighted how identity and background impacted medical students’ experiences throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
The annual event was first hosted in 2017 to discuss the ways in which students’ identities, backgrounds and experiences affect their time at medical school. This year’s event, held April 7, had the theme “Out of Our Element: Vulnerability, Fatigue and Misinformation — Caring for Yourself and Your Community in Isolating Times” and focused on students’ shared experiences, highlighting the importance of wellbeing throughout the pandemic, according to Lead Organizer Naveen Gupta (MED ’23).
“This event is important to connect people of all different stages in their medical career to the same spot and discuss topics that are shared experiences between all groups,” Gupta wrote to The Hoya. “In a sense, this event takes away feelings of isolation on any level and instead empowers through feeling part of a diverse community that can empathize and remind us that we are not alone here.”
The virtual event offered participants various breakout rooms that focused on wellness and identity topics ranging from mindfulness to antiracism advocacy. Gupta was a facilitator for the racial justice breakout room, which centered on racial biases in medicine, and said she was moved by the intimacy of the discussion.
“The most memorable part for me was near the end of my breakout room, when I took a step back and realized that everyone in the room had shared an experience that was troubling to them,” Gupta wrote. “They felt supported enough by the community to share and sympathize with others’ situations as well.”
The event also featured a conversation on America’s multicultural identity with keynote speaker Wajahat Ali, author of the memoir “Go Back to Where You Came From: And Other Helpful Recommendations on How to Become American,” and Dean for Medical Education Lee Jones. 
Ali’s discussion reaffirmed the experiences that many students of color face at Georgetown, according to Jones. 
“His book is powerful, poignant, and funny, highlighting the experiences of many in our community,” Jones wrote to The Hoya. “Waj answered our questions with complete honesty, insight, and support of our journeys; it was an incredible conversation.”
The American Medical Association found that approximately 51% of physicians experienced stress related to COVID-19, with multiracial and Black physicians reporting the highest levels of burnout. The event sought to educate students on symptoms of burnout and strategies for stress prevention. 
Jake Whitney (MED ’24) said he was inspired to lead the breakout room “Identity and meaning: finding our new normal during pandemic and burnout” after noticing a common struggle among peers to maintain both professional and social obligations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Don’t get me wrong, I feel called to practice medicine and am happy I am where I am,” Whitney wrote to The Hoya. “However, the idea of ‘work life balance’ or how people choose to spend their limited time is something I hear other students struggling with all the time.” 
Whitney said the pandemic has forced many students to explore new avenues to find meaning in their lives and foster connections with those around them, with many people reprioritizing their own well-being after realizing its importance. 
“The pandemic has made life very difficult, yes, but when we really think about it, most people can see particular identities that have become more salient than others over the last few years for the better,” Whitney wrote. “For me, I have chosen to prioritize spending time with family and loved ones even more so than in the past in order to avoid isolation and burnout.”
According to Gupta, the event was successful in bringing students together and providing them with an opportunity to unpack the difficulties experienced throughout the pandemic and find solace in shared experiences. 
“I would also say that this event is about finding your space in our community, and appreciating our similarities and differences as people,” Gupta said. “We should always make time to celebrate our community and each other.”

A team of researchers at the Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center published a study on factors that may indicate whether a woman is at risk for redeveloping breast cancer.
The report, titled “Characterization of transcriptome diversity and in vitro behavior of primary human high-risk breast cells,” was published April 22 and details a new way to analyze RNA from epithelial cells, a layer of cells that constitute the glands responsible for lactation, and detect sequences that might signal the recurrence of breast cancer. 
Priscilla Furth, an author of the study and professor of oncology and medicine at the cancer center said her passion for studying breast cancer detection guided the report.
“The goal of the study was to see whether or not we could actually look at the genes active [in the RNA] and judge whether a woman is at high or low risk for breast cancer,” Furth told The Hoya. “I’ve always been interested in developing better means of giving women better information about their risk of breast cancer.”
The study was also co-authored by Sahar Alothman (MED ’18), Keunsoo Kang, Xuefeng Liu, Ewa Krawczyk, Redha Azhar, Rong Hu, David Goerlitz and Bhaskar Kallakury.
Alothman said the study was motivated by the fact that many cancer patients live in fear that they will redevelop cancer while in remission.
“If you’ve ever sat down with a cancer patient you know that remission isn’t always the end of their journey, and the fear of cancer coming back remains,” Alothman wrote to The Hoya. “So what if instead of just thinking about the cure, we could prevent it altogether.”
The breakthrough in the team’s research was achieved through the use of conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRC), an innovative technique that involves the study of isolated epithelial cells and was invented and patented at Georgetown, Furth said.
“Some years ago, one of our laboratories here developed a system in which they could take cells selectively to grow in a medium and expand them,” Furth said. “This was, to me, very exciting and just what we needed.”
Furth said she is hopeful that her work will lay the foundation for predicting first-time tumors in the future.
“We do believe the results might be generalizable even to women prior to their first cancer,” Furth said. “That’s how science works, you have to take little tiny steps.”
Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Director Louis Weiner said scientists like Furth and her team are driving progress in cancer research.
“The research described by Dr. Furth and her colleagues is important as we seek to discover ways of keeping cancer at bay after the initial successful treatment,” Weiner wrote to The Hoya. “For Georgetown, this finding is also important because the scientists were able to leverage a powerful technology developed here in our labs, which has become a critical tool for researchers around the world.”
Alothman said the team’s research is just the tip of the iceberg, and that advancements like the one they made could come faster in the future.
“We are in an exciting time in science where we’re only scratching the surface with what we can do with RNA,” Alothman wrote. “In the next 10 to 20 years with more advancements in technology, I believe we’ll be able to learn more in a shorter amount of time and with less resources.”
Undertaking a project as ambitious as the gene sequencing of cancerous breast tissue is only possible through the collaboration of multiple researchers, according to Alothman. 
“When you’re thinking of a big research idea it’s not always clear how far you can go with it,” Alothman wrote. “But we had a great team that worked together like a fine tuned orchestra that made this big idea come to life.”
Alothman said the accomplishments of the study have made her optimistic about the future of cancer research.
“Something I’ve learned along the way is to always think outside the box,” Alothman said. “If you can dream of it, you can achieve it. I hope we can dream of a world where we’ll be cancer free.”

Roberta Waite, the incoming dean at Georgetown University’s newly established School of Nursing, received Modern Healthcare magazine’s Excellence in Governance Award.
The award, presented by the medical industry’s leading source of health care news, recognizes influential individuals who serve on a board of directors for a health care organization and aid in advancements in culture, mission and performance in the health care industry. Waite was recognized April 16 for her longtime service on the board of Trinity Health, one of the largest non-profit Catholic health care systems in the United States, which operates 92 hospitals in 22 states.
Waite was named the incoming dean of the Georgetown School of Nursing on Dec. 15, following an announcement in 2020 that the Georgetown University School of Nursing & Health Studies would be split into two new undergraduate schools. Following this change, the Georgetown School of Health will accompany the nursing program.
Waite’s acceptance of this award comes just a few months before she assumes the position at the School of Nursing when the school officially opens July 1.
According to Waite, the award serves as recognition of the important work she was able to accomplish at Trinity Health to make healthcare more equitable and oriented toward social justice. At Trinity Health, Waite worked to expand community health and well-being programs, as well as assisting with the non-profit’s diversity, equity and inclusion hiring initiatives.
“It really highlights the work, really our focus that we’ve been striving to address, particularly with our focus on health equity and social justice, and living the values of our Catholic organization, which is serving those who are poor, serving those that are in need of help, and to promote health equity,” Waite said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Advocating for just health policies and humanizing health care practices will be important lessons to be imparted on students in the School of Nursing, according to Waite.
“My work around diversity, equity, inclusion, anti-racism and anti-oppressive practices, those are things that are really important for students to understand how they show up in practice, how they show up in our interactions, and how that we can work more effectively with others, so that they can thrive in their lives and be as healthy as they can be,” Waite said. “So it’s not just a matter of providing health care, but we also have to understand the cultural context of our society.” 
The award highlights Georgetown University medical leaders’ confidence in Waite’s ability to utilize her experience at Trinity Health working for gains in health equity to reflect Georgetown’s values, according to Edward Healton, executive vice president of health sciences and executive dean of the School of Medicine.
“Dr. Waite’s accomplishments provide tangible examples of real-world, impactful leadership that exemplify the Jesuit values of Georgetown,” Healton wrote to The Hoya. “We have much to learn from Dr. Waite and are so pleased she’ll be joining us for the launch of a critically important new school responsible for training members of our health care workforce who will carry forward the spirit of Georgetown.”
Waite said she hopes to connect with the Georgetown community and see how she can translate her work for health care equity into the classroom as she transitions into her new position.
“I’m very excited about the transition, getting to know people more both the faculty, the staff, the students, connecting with alumni, as well as engaging with the community,” Waite said. “So those are really important things. And really just getting acclimated to Georgetown. I’m thrilled. I want folks to get to know me, as well as me getting to know Georgetown, and really engaging in meeting people.”
Julia Ferrante (NHS ’24) said she looks forward to continuing her nursing education under Waite’s leadership, given Waite’s accomplishments in the healthcare field.
“I am so excited for the School of Nursing to launch and to study under Dean Waite, whose leadership in health care is incredibly inspiring for those of us pursuing careers in medicine,” Ferrante wrote to The Hoya.
Nursing education goes beyond the scientific basics, but rather requires a complex understanding of the sociocultural aspect of health care and the root of health disparities in society.
“So much of the work we’re talking about with nursing is about improving the health of individuals, families and communities,” Waite said. “Understanding a lot about community, population health policy, those are really key and important components of nursing education experience, as well as improving sort of the contextual understanding of people’s lives.”

From plastic surgery to feminist philosophy, Olivia D’Angelo (COL ’24) and Anya Caraiani (SFS ’24) discuss it all in their candid weekly podcast, “Outrageous Acts.” 
Every Friday night, D’Angelo and Caraiani share their experiences as young female college students with their dozens of weekly listeners in a spoof of “Call Her Daddy,” a popular advice and comedy podcast that rose to fame because of the raunchy, candid nature of the hosts’ conversations on sex and relationships. Since they launched “Outrageous Acts” last fall, the pair has covered topics like spring break trips to Florida, modern hookup culture and getting cheated on. 
D’Angelo said the podcast gives her a space to share her college experiences, reflecting on the relationships she’s made in an unconventional way.
“A lot of what we talk about is inspired by our own experiences, so we’ll often take a situation that has happened during the week and debate it more broadly,” D’Angelo wrote to The Hoya. “For example, a couple weeks ago Anya was getting some suggestive texts from a boy she was talking to, so on the show we talked about sexting, how we feel about it, and the risks.”
Caraiani said the pair decided to create the podcast to show women in college that they are not alone in their experiences. 
“We were inspired by our little sisters and our experiences living in D.C. during Covid spring because we wanted to provide a resource for our friends/college girls to know they are not alone, and we are all going through it together,” Caraiani wrote to The Hoya. 
In their first episode, titled “The [Real] Sex Lives of College Girls,” the pair reviews the TV show that is the episode’s namesake and discusses dissociation feminism, Slavoj Žižek’s philosophy on the difference between men and women, and tips on how to sneak into nightclubs.
While the pair originally focused on sharing stories they thought people would find entertaining, “Outrageous Acts” has shifted to discuss topics related to college life, D’Angelo said.
“When we first started the podcast, it was really focused on our own lives,” D’Angelo wrote. “As we’ve gotten deeper into it we’ve made a point to talk about topics that will be relatable to more people and not just entertaining.”
The first few episodes of the podcast feature personal stories, including one where D’Angelo talks about the time her high school boyfriend cheated on her, while more recent episodes cover advice on topics like the talking stage of dating. 
Caraiani and D’Angelo record the podcast live during their 6 p.m. show every Friday on WGTB, Georgetown’s student-run radio station, uploading it to Spotify after their producer, Rachel Kerr (COL ’24), edits it.
Kerr said working on the podcast has opened her eyes to a potential career path in the media and production industry. 
“I’m the number one fan of the show, so I love working on it — and it’s also been really cool to get hands-on experience of something I might do as a career,” Kerr wrote to The Hoya.
Kerr said she appreciates how Caraiani and D’Angelo explore serious topics like social media footprints and the intersection of feminism and capitalism in a light-hearted manner. 
“Anya and Olivia have a way of noticing something that’s going on in the world and making it funny,” Kerr wrote. “What really makes the show special is how entertaining it is even when we do take on serious issues.”
Caraiani said the podcast has forced her and D’Angelo to learn how to balance discussing intimate subjects with sharing personal details of their lives online. 
“Something that we’ve struggled with is finding a balance between sharing meaningful experiences in our lives and maintaining privacy,” D’Angelo wrote. “It can be a challenge to remember that this isn’t actually therapy when we’re talking about emotional topics — being cheated on, consent, and mental health, to name a few.”
D’Angelo said “Outrageous Acts” has been an opportunity for her to fulfill her dream to share her life and experiences with others. 
“I’m a big reality TV fan and always have had this dream of being able to share my life in a public way,” D’Angelo wrote. “If I’m telling a story about a night out, or a boy I’m talking to, or something like that, it forces me to reflect on the situation — it’s sort of therapeutic.”

The number of individuals experiencing homelessness in Washington, D.C. has hit a 17-year low, with a 13.7% decrease from last year.
District Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced the results of the 2022 Point in Time count (PIT) April 21, an annual census conducted by the Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness that measures the amount of individuals experiencing homelessness in the District. This year, the PIT results show that 4,410 persons are currently experiencing homelessness, and that chronic homelessness has declined 26% among families and 22% for single adults. 
Mayor Bowser said the decline in individuals experiencing homelessness can be attributed to the implementation of Homeward D.C., a program designed to end long-term homelessness in the District, according to an April 21 press release. 
The program aims to transform the service system for families experiencing homelessness, which has now declined 78% since the District government implemented the program. After closing the D.C. General homeless shelter in 2018, the program helped to open several short-term family housing shelters with a wider array of services across D.C. 
The decrease in reported individuals experiencing homelessness is also due in great part to the work of local homeless outreach programs, such as Pathways to Housing D.C., according to Bowser. Pathways to Housing helps serve over 3,500 unhoused individuals overcoming mental illness, substance abuse or other serious health issues every year. 
The 2022 PIT count demonstrates that investments in the right programs and advocacy groups can help make homelessness a solvable problem, according to Monica Harrington, the director of institutional advancement at Pathways to Housing D.C. 
“The most significant success was the 22 percent decrease in chronic homelessness, especially after years of seeing this number increase,” Harrington wrote to The Hoya. “It is the most telling sign that the work and resources are making a difference.”
One of Bowser’s main focuses throughout her last term has been fighting to end homelessness. While the closure of D.C. General and opening of family shelters was met by praise following continued calls from homeless advocates for its cessation, other programs created during her administration have drawn criticism. Residents in the rapid rehousing program, which provides subsidized housing for 12 to 18 months to individuals experiencing homelessness, have said that the program has left many facing eviction after their subsidy runs out. 
Other local advocates questioned the accuracy of the PIT count, saying that the official measurement only includes those living on the streets or in the sheltered system for one set day, failing to include people who live in their car, couch surf, or are in a “doubled-up” crowded household.
Mayor Bowser’s proposed FY23 budget will focus on investing in solutions that will combat the current issues in programs for unhoused individuals, according to D.C. Department of Human Services Director Laura Green Zeilinger. This will include $31 million to end chronic homelessness and $114.6 million to modernize and renovate existing homeless shelters.
Zeilinger said one of the most important parts of combating homelessness in the District is to treat unhoused residents with dignity and respect.
“While I am proud of the work we do to connect District residents to affordable housing, I am especially proud of the system by which we welcome people home – it’s a system consistent with our District values in that it is centered in human dignity,” Zeilinger said in a press release. “Our residents are deserving of a safe and stable place to call home and we are dedicated to making that vision a reality.” 
Despite the decline in reported individuals experiencing homelessness, Harrington said there is still work to eliminate homelessness in D.C.
“We need to acknowledge where there are still cracks in the system, especially for veterans where we saw a rare spike in homelessness (up 11%), aging populations, returning citizens, and for those who are experiencing mental health and substance use challenges,” Harrington wrote.
Other local advocacy groups include the D.C. Coalition for the Homeless, which seeks to provide temporary housing, food, employment placement and substance abuse counseling to at-risk individuals, and Thrive D.C., which offers services such as meals, computer access, employment assistance and transitional housing.
Local leaders are relying on the 2022 PIT count to highlight which demographic groups are disproportionately impacted by homelessness, according to Harrington.
“We need to continue to embed race equity across all D.C. efforts to ensure that housing is affordable and accessible, especially to generations of native Washingtonians,” Harrington explained. “We need to repair the harm and trauma of homelessness that disproportionately impacts people of color. We need to make sure that homelessness is rare.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate unanimously passed an amendment to the senate bylaws aiming to more strictly enforce attendance at meetings.
At the April 24 GUSA meeting senators voted in favor for the new amendment which strips senators who have three or more unexcused absences of their voting power at GUSA Senate meetings. Senators who meet this threshold will be required to meet with the GUSA Senate’s Ethics and Oversight Committee, which aims to investigate and discipline GUSA officials on issues such as attendance and decorum, to discuss their attendance before further action is taken.
The new protocol will take effect beginning next senate term in the fall.
Ethics and Oversight Committee Chair Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’23), who helped to co-author the amendment, said low attendance from senators has prevented the senate from carrying out its duties. 
For every senator who loses their voting privileges, the voting quorum will decrease by one, so a senator’s failure to attend will not affect GUSA’s ability to enact legislation, Gordon said. 
On average, only 80% of senators attend weekly GUSA meetings, further decreasing the number of senators required to block a bill from passing, according to Gordon.
“The bigger issue is that a lot of our business still requires quorum,” Gordon said. “Even if we get about 80% or 90% of senators, we still need a two-thirds majority of all senators to change the bylaws, put a constitutional amendment up, or certify the results of an election. If the number of senators present gets down to, say 23, then only a few senators are needed to block something from passing, which is incredibly frustrating.” 
People have taken advantage of the senate’s current lenient attendance policies, Gordan said. 
“There’s a few people in there who really took advantage of this situation and kind of abused it,” Gordon said in an interview with The Hoya. “But it’s also very hard because it’s kind of confusing on how to deal with this issue in our bylaws.”
Gordon said low involvement from senators has contributed to GUSA’s inefficiency when it comes to enacting change.
“A lot of times, what I find is some of the senators that always whine the most about GUSA not doing the most are the people that do the least,” Gordon said. “We waste so much time when people just skip meetings because they don’t want to vote on something, or they are mad about something.” 
Gordon believes that by threatening to suspend voting privileges senators will be compelled to regularly attend meetings. 
“A lot of people who like to miss meetings still like to vote on important issues and just miss other meetings they don’t care about,” Gordon said. “I figure, if we can punish them by taking away their vote on issues they do care about, then they’d be incentivized to vote on issues that everybody else is working on, so they don’t skip meetings.”
John DiPierri (SFS ’25), who co-sponsored the amendment, said the resolution aims to introduce an alternative method of holding senators accountable for their attendance other than impeachment.
“While I don’t know of any Senators who have been impeached recently due to attendance, technically, a Senator can be impeached if they have three unexcused absences, a quota which many Senators have already reached,” DiPierri wrote to The Hoya. “I think losing the right to vote is a good first step to allow Senators to discuss their situation with the Ethics and Oversight Committee, as to prevent high turnover within the Senate.”
Ethics and Oversight Committee Vice Chair Joshua Bernard-Pearl (SFS ’25), who co-authored the resolution, l said it will be an effective tool to deter senators from skipping meetings in future terms.
“The hope is that by passing this at the end of this senate term we can go into the next term with a culture of responsibility around attendance. In regards to whether losing the right to vote will be effective, I think it will be,” Bernard-Pearl wrote to The Hoya. “For those senators who want to remain in the senate, it is a warning and a message that their absences do matter.”
DiPierri said student leaders must be held accountable for their attendance in order to adequately represent the student body.
“Simply put, it’s a shame that we have to create a rule to force people to be part of a club that they campaigned for,” DiPierri wrote. “However, this is exactly why I cosponsored this bill, because the Senate needs all 29 members to ensure student voices are being heard, and so meaningful activism can be accomplished.”
