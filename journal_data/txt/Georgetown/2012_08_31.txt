Though he did not obtain enough signatures to get his name on the ballot for this November’s ANC election, Craig Cassey (COL ’15) announced his intent to run a write-in campaign for a seat on the commission late last month. The recent redistricting of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E’s jurisdictional area allots two seats to single member districts entirely occupied by students. Thus the commission could potentially seat more than one student representative for the first time in 10 years. Cassey is running to represent SMD 2E 04, while Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14) will run for SMD 2E 08. If elected, both students will serve on the commission for two years. The Hoya sat down with Cassey to talk about his goals for the campaign.
Why did you decide to run for ANC
commissioner?
As a freshman, I was involved in College Democrats and [the student advocacy group] D.C. Students Speak, and both of those experiences gave me insight into what … problems … the Georgetown community was facing … and what the Georgetown community needs from an ANC commissioner in these next few years.
What are some of those problems?
In the past years we witnessed a lot of friction due to the [2010] Campus Plan debates, and I believe that, going forward, student inclusion in the entire process is essential. Another issue we face is the noise ordinance, which still reads as an unfair ordinance against students and would not have come about if we … had more students and student-friendly commissioners on the ANC board. We need to increase voter registration across the university, getting students involved in the conversation pertaining to local politics as well as giving them opportunities to get involved so their voices may be heard and something like [the noise ordinance] will never be passed in the future.
What are the key tenets of your platform?
Fostering community, empowering students and engaging with the student body at large. Having proceeded through the Campus Plan hearings, we are at an opportune moment to build a community that is both cohesive and positive in all their interactions. I want toreduce friction that was created the past few years, and I believe firmly that now is the time. If we can do that in the next Campus Plan hearings in 2017, it may go much more smoothly.
I hope to empower students not just through reaching out and getting their opinions and speaking to those on the ANC board but also providing them with other opportunities to get involved. Several boards and commissions in the District pertaining to green construction, LGBTQ issues, safety — everything you can possibly imagine — have unfilled seats. As an ANC commissioner, I will be able to reach out to more students and hopefully get them to apply to these seats.
[Current ANC 2E student commissioner] Jake Sticka (COL ’13) did a great job of engaging students, and I want to continue that tradition … by making use of social media and being present in [my] district — not just having hall meetings but going to dorms to get firsthand opinions of what [students] feel is going on and what they don’t support, and keeping all students in the loop, because they deserve to be.
What was your reaction to the ultimate outcome of the 2010 Campus Plan, and how do you hope to address it going forward?
Some of the changes are positive, such as the addition of food trucks, the removal of restrictions regarding party planning as well as proposals for the New South Student Center. Having said that, I feel that students were shafted in some ways, but due to the finality of the Campus Plan, I believe we should press ahead, move forward on things we have control over and make sure the [New South Student Center] is a viable option for on-campus student activity. If it is going to be a pub or a bar, we have to make sure it is an appealing option. This is a process that will be taking place over the next few years and will be a main focus in this ANC term.
Also, the Georgetown Community Partnership was a body created as part of the Campus Plan agreement that will meet frequently to help all parties stick to the tenets outlined in the Campus Plan. There will be a main student committee that will have a student chair. While that is essential, I feel we still need more student representation in the sub-committees that will be part of the partnership. I would like to push for more inclusion in that specific area. I think there’s a lot of potential for the Georgetown Community Partnership to be effective. I think time will tell, and it will be made more effective if more students are included in the process, and hopefully it will help reduce the stigma currently surrounding both students and residents. That is the greatest gain we can make as a community if we are trying to create one Georgetown. I think that needs to be the first step.
Is there anything you would like to change about the ANC 2E?
Like any student commissioner, I would like to have more students on the ANC to begin with. I also would like to see a change in the location of meetings. It would be good for the university and the community if we alternated meetings between the Georgetown campus and the current location [at Georgetown Visitation School]. That would be a very strong, small gesture of the progress and teamwork we hope to see in the next five years and into the future.
What are your plans for getting students out to vote?
I’d like to continue registering students to vote. I will inform students of the logistics of where to vote and same-day registration, which D.C. allows, and how to go about writing in a candidate. That means information flyers, making information available by social media, going door to door and getting to know the potential constituents.
Have you had any form of dialogue with other ANC 2E commissioners about possibilities for cooperation after the election?
I’ve met Jeff Jones, commissioner for district 2E 03, and we’ve spoken about the potential for Georgetown to exist as one community. We were encouraged not just by what this means for the ANC but also about how we can increase student engagement across the board in various D.C. political ventures.
What is your professional relationship with Prindiville, and how do you envision cooperating if you are both elected?
Peter and I are running for different seats, so we’re not running against each other. There’s no opposition, and we’re cooperating. My district, 2E 04, includes Village C West, Village A, New South, the Southwest Quad and the Jesuit Residence. Peter and I are different people and operate in different ways, but I feel the combination of our varying skill sets while on the ANC when fighting for student rights will be very effective.
Single Member District 2E 03 is made up of both students and permanent residents. Do you think there is potential for a student to occupy that district’s seat, thus meaning that Georgetown would have three representatives on ANC 2E?
I do think there’s hope that that seat will go to a Georgetown student. This year when we were talking about potential candidates for that district, there seemed to be a lot of interest, but not enough student interest yet to make it a viable campaign. I see it as a … possibility that someone will run and potentially win in that district. If that were the case, we could get more students engaged, because with three more students on the board, we’ll have a lot more ability to stand up for student rights.
The Hoya interviewed Cassey’s fellow candidate Prindiville in the Apr. 27 issue. Read it online at thehoya.com.

Washington Harbour’s central water fountain will be retrofitted to feature a 12,000-square-foot ice rink in November as part of a $20 million renovation to the waterfront area that began this spring.
The fountain was upgraded to shoot water 60 feet in the air during the non-winter months and is now accompanied by a multicolored light show. According to a press release from MRP Realty, which owns the space, the construction for the rink will begin this fall, after a Sept. 12 opening event for the newly upgraded plaza. The rink will be operative throughout the winter months.
Other upgrades to the area include an exterior redesign of the storefronts on both the upper and lower levels of the facility. The restaurants Tony and Joe’s Seafood Place and Nick’s Riverside Grille will be reopening with revamped interiors as well as new plaza furniture. Nick’s will expand into part of the space that was previously occupied by Cabanas, and an unconfirmed restaurant will move into the remainder of that space.
Farmers & Fishers will be reopening as Farmers Fishers Bakers in October. The restaurant is a new concept from the creators of Founding Farmers, featuring a bakery in addition to their farmland-inspired menu.
This opportunity for upgrades and renovations came after the
plaza incurred millions of dollars in damages in the wake of extensive flooding in the area. The changes faced minimal resistance from neighborhood groups.
“We are good to go with all these plans and have all approvals,” Julie Chase, public relations representative for MRP Realty, wrote in an email.
MRP is hopeful that the new changes will enliven the area and draw people to it.
“The Harbour will be much more of a year-round destination and more family friendly with improved restaurants, the lively fountains and the ice skating rink,” Chase wrote.

Linda Greenan, vice president for external relations and Georgetown’s public face in the 2010 Campus Plan negotiations, will retire at the end of September.
Concurrent with Greenan’s departure, the university is establishing a new Office of Community Engagement and will appoint Lauralyn Lee the Associate Vice President of Community Engagement and Strategic Initiatives.
Greenan’s retirement and the creation of the new office were announced in an Aug. 24 email from President John J. DeGioia to participants in the ongoing dialogues between the university and its neighbors.
According to email, the new office will oversee institutional planning and help develop the 2017 Campus Plan in addition to serving as the main point of contact for the Georgetown Community Partnership. The GCP, which was created as part of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement in June, aims to provide a forum for discussing and resolving town-gown issues.
Lee has worked at Georgetown for more than a decade and currently serves as associate vice president for strategic initiatives and planning.
“Lauralyn will bring the same level of skill and commitment to this new role that she has brought to her work in the Counsel’s Office and the Office of Public Affairs,” DeGioia wrote in the email.
DeGioia also thanked Greenan for her years at the university.
“During her tenure, Linda played a critical role in numerous projects that will have an enduring impact on the University’s future,” he wrote. “I am deeply grateful to Linda for her unwavering commitment and service to Georgetown University, our neighbors and our entire city.”

A new Zipcar fleet is stationed outside McDonough Arena this semester, but only a fraction of the student body is eligible to drive them.
Under the university’s current agreement with Zipcar, a short-term car rental service, drivers must be at least 21 years old, have a driving record with no more than two moving violations or accidents in the past three years and have no history of alcohol- or drug-related violations.
The new program was announced in an Aug. 23 email from Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and is part of a larger effort on the part of the university to better accommodate student transportation needs.
“Although our campus offers many services and is easily accessed by public transportation and university shuttles, we recognize that students may at times have a need for their own vehicles,” Olson wrote in the email. “We hope this service will be useful to those who need a vehicle for short periods of time.”
The fleet of Zipcars initially available to Georgetown students includes five vehicles, ranging from a Ford Focus to a Honda CR-V, with rental rates starting at $9 an hour or $74 a day.
Zipcar’s university program website states that age constraints may be set at either 18 or 21 depending on the location. Campuses in an urban setting, like Georgetown, pose a greater insurance liability than rural campuses. However, university spokesperson Stacy Kerr said that the university hopes to be able to negotiate a lower age requirement in order to allow a greater number of students to participate in the program.
Zipcar officials declined to comment on the status of age restriction negotiations but confirmed that those discussions are ongoing.
Scott Hall, D.C. Zipcar’s general manager, expressed enthusiasm about the launch of the service.
“We know it can be difficult and expensive to bring cars to campus, so we hope the Zipcar program will help our Georgetown members run errands, attend job interviews and internships or get away for the weekend on a pay-as-you-go basis,” he wrote in an email.

For those who find their weekdays weighed down by economics textbooks and bland lectures in the ICC basement, Georgetown’s fall course catalog includes more than a few classes that will spice up any schedule.
A NEW VIEW OF HISTORY
Multiple history offerings this term approach old material in novel ways.
Taught by April Yoder, the class “Sports in the Americas” explores how sports influence race relations, political movements and modernization in Latin America.
Yoder’s inspiration for the class arose from her dissertation, which she is writing on the intersection between baseball and politics in the Dominican Republic during the Cold War.
Her original thesis topic stemmed from her belief that the history of sports in Latin America mirrors the region’s history.
“I knew that I was interested in popular culture and politics, and looking at popular culture is a way to understand the political history of a place,” she said.
Yoder said she hopes the class’s unique premise will persuade students to take a history class.
“Focusing on sports is a good way to get people who are not otherwise interested in history into history class … [and] make a history class something someone with a business major will actually enjoy,” Yoder said.
The class’s angle attracted student athletes and sports fanatics this semester.
“I’ve played sports almost my whole life, and I’m also doing research about Latin America, so [that’s] two really cool things I’m interested in combined in one class,” Katie Farias (COL ’13) said.
“History of Rock” may sound like the perfect class for music junkies and concert-goers, but according to assistant professor Benjamin Harbert and Lauinger Library’s Head of Research and Instruction Will Wheeler, rock history is more complicated than simply listening to a couple Beatles songs.
Harbert, who began teaching the course three years ago, said that the class has existed for several years under different instructors. While Harbert taught the class last year, Wheeler took over this semester.
Wheeler said he hopes to use his experience with ethnomusicology and jazz elements to bolster the course material. His main goal is to improve students’ knowledge of how rock and roll shaped cultural, social and political events in the 20th century.
In the past, Harbert’s syllabus featured an array of artists including Led Zeppelin, The Supremes andSleater-Kinney, and this year, Eric Johnson of The Shins and Fruit Bats and Ian MacKaye of Fugaziand Minor Threat will both appear as guest lecturers.
Harbert characterized the class as a cultural studies and history course that enables students to examine the role of music in society.
“I say this to students right at the beginning: I don’t care if you like this music,” he said. “I want you to understand this music and how this music allows you to understand other issues.”
Students praised the course’s multidisciplinary and eye-opening nature.
“I cannot suggest taking this class more,” Sonia Kikeri (SFS ’13) said. “I liked that it was a different way of learning [that] incorporates different materials. It was an awesome way to get a new perspective.”
TREKKIE PHILOSOPHY
In the same vein of melding academics with popular culture, for the past decade, professor Linda Wetzel has taught “Philosophy and ‘Star Trek,’” which employs elements from the famed television show to spark philosophical discussions.
A self-proclaimed fan but adamantly not a “Trekkie,” Wetzel said she first became interested in “Star Trek” as a child.
“Sometimes I would see an episode and say, ‘That’s the mind-body issue!’” she said.
The class has no tests, and grades are determined primarily by papers so that students have the opportunity to articulate and defend their positions, according to Wetzel.
While Wetzel said students have criticized the class for being weird or easy, she emphasized that the course is intended to engage rigorous philosophical inquiry in addition to being fun and informational.
Students read works by Aristotle, Isaac Newton and David Hume and discuss topics ranging from metaphysics to issues of free will.
“[I want to give my students] a way of looking at things and asking questions and … evaluating answers to these deep questions [so] they can apply to their life, the burning questions everyone has to decide,” she said. “These are all questions which are philosophical, and I hope to give [my students] the means to tackle those questions and anything else they come across.”
OCCUPY THE STAGE
While Wetzel’s class concentrates on a fictional world, the theater department’s new class, “Real Things Onstage: War & Witness,” directs students’ focus in the opposite direction to real-world current events.
“It’s an analytical and critical look at documentary theater,” professor Christine Evans said. “It’s really about what happens in the theater when stories and facts and objects that come from outside the theater are staged,” she said.
Students will study nonfiction plays and then write and perform their own productions using modern-day political and social issues, such as the Occupy movement, for inspiration.
Evans said that the course straddles the line between news and fictional theater, combining the disciplines to enable students to apply their studies to real-world situations.
“All stories have to be shaped to be performed in some ways,” she said. “One of the key differences is in the contract with the audience; the expectation that something is made from [true] testimony or materials creates a different contract with the audience than something [that] everyone knows is fictional.”
As a new professor, Evans said she is excited for the course and believes students will appreciate studying a genre that may be entirely new to them.
“I’m really thrilled to be at Georgetown and [to] have the opportunity to try out this course with a brave band of students,” she said. “It’s an incredibly rich topic, and it’s also one that can change a lot, depending on the interest of the class.”

Georgetown’s department of philosophy debuted a new minor in philosophy and bioethics this fall.
The Class of 2014 will be the first class allowed to pursue the minor, which requires six classes — “Ethical Theory,” two general education philosophy courses, a philosophy of science class and two other classes that explore bioethical issues. Students in the program must reach outside the philosophy department for two of these courses.
Georgetown College Dean Chester Gillis is enthusiastic about the new minor, which was approved last spring by the departments of philosophy and theology.
According to Gillis, bioethics — an area of study that focuses on ethical issues regarding health, medicine and the environment and the implications of new technologies — is a cutting-edge issue that would benefit undergraduates as its own minor.
“[The minor] will enhance the curriculum and give our students new opportunities,” he said.
The department of philosophy will collaborate with Georgetown’s Kennedy Institue of Ethics — abioethics think tank where most of the senior research scholars are also philosophers — to teach and advise new philosophy and bioethics minor students, according to Matthew Burstein, academic program officer for instruction and new media at the Kennedy Institute.
“The philosophy department is ranked high in applied ethics, so the combination of philosophy andbioethics comes quite naturally,” Burstein said.
Burstein assisted in organizing the introduction of the minor and choosing the required coursework. He will also help advise interested students.
“There were a few inspirations for the minor: first, to fulfill the growing demand for bioethics education among undergraduates, and second, to ensure that undergraduates were able to access the world-class resources available in bioethics,” Burstein said.
He added that the minor aims to promote and facilitate interdisciplinary studies at the undergraduate level.
“The main goal of the minor is to bring together students from across campus who have a shared intellectual pursuit but who otherwise might not be in contact, and to do so in a way that develops both the depth and breadth of their ethical vision and reasoning skills,” Burstein said.
Undergraduate Bioethics Society Co-President Sam Dowling (COL ’13) also emphasized the minor’s appeal. He was optimistic about the prospect of fostering a cohesive relationship between the society and philosophy and bioethics minor students.
“A lot of our [members] have taken bioethics courses,” he said. “They’d be interested in picking up that minor.”
Dowling added that the minor would provide students with a new way of approaching philosophy.
“Bioethics is relevant to a variety of topics and career paths,” Dowling said. “I’m interested in oncology, [and] that experience will be informed by my experience with bioethics.”
Burstein echoed  Dowling’s optimism.
“Any student with career interests in health care, biotechnology or the environment could benefit from the opportunity to think carefully about these issues,” he said. “Bioethics, as a field, is marked by its grounding in real-world problems, and so anyone who will confront these issues — let alone try to solve them — will be better equipped to do so.”
According to Burstein, establishing the philosophy and bioethics minor required writing a detailed proposal, which was followed by numerous conversations with the College deans to solidify the course requirements.

This fall, Georgetown will hold its first-ever independently organized event as a fully licensed TED member.
TED, which stands for technology, entertainment and design, is a nonprofit organization that invites speakers to give 18-minute lectures and then posts video recordings online. Operating under the slogan “Ideas worth spreading,” the program aims to provide a forum for sharing information between countries and across disciplines.
Georgetown’s event, which is designated TEDx because it is independently organized, is planned for Sept. 28 and will feature lectures on the theme “Power 2020.”
Lecturers include TIME Magazine Editor-At-Large Bobby Ghosh, violinist Tai Murray and MoisésNaím, chief international columnist for Spain’s largest newspaper, El País.
“We were really looking for speakers from all fields,” TEDx Chair Jamie Sharp (MSB ’15) said. “Anyone can give a TEDx talk, and the topic, ‘Power,’ is broad enough that … [speakers must be] capable of giving a really high-quality speech in a short space of time that conveys a specific idea.”
According to Sharp, Georgetown applied for a TED license for the first time in 2010, but each individual event must be relicensed.
“TEDx is happy to give you the license, as long as you are prepared to stick to their rules and regulations, such as no branding and no speaker fees,” Sharp said.
Ceyda Erten (SFS’13) organized an unofficial TEDx conference, “Netcetera, Internet and Everything Else,” in March 2011.
At the conference, Georgetown students and professors spoke about the Internet’s impact on society. The participants’ speeches were filmed and posted on the organization’s website.
Erten tapped members of Georgetown University Lecture Fund to help organize the first event, which occurred last March.
While TEDx is an independent organization, many committee members overlap with Lecture Fund leadership.
Both Erten and Sharp are Lecture Fund members, but Sharp emphasized that the two organizations are run independent of one another.
“TED rules state that TEDx must be an independent event,” he said. “Some TEDx leaders are from Lecture Fund and some aren’t, but TEDx gets speakers by itself and Lecture Fund advises us.”
Sharp said he looks forward to organizing more TEDx events at Georgetown.
“It’s been a long road, yet a fun and exciting one, so I don’t see [any reason not to] make this a yearly event,”he said.
Kamran Haris (SFS ’15), who is unaffiliated with the event, said he believes TEDx programs will provide a refreshing variety of speaker events to the university.
“It’s one thing to read about a potential topic and hear snippets from news articles. It’s another thing entirely to see someone in live flesh talk about it,” Haris said. “I think that a TEDx talk … will finally bring to light some of those unique stories that have brought us here together at Georgetown.”

Building on momentum from the summer, Georgetown’s Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis has set lofty goals for the current semester.
Since she became CIO in February, Davis has overseen the university’s inaugural Innovation Summit, the launch of Georgetown’s mobile application, the expansion of on-campus wireless coverage and the integration of Georgetown’s email system onto Google Apps.
Over the summer, University Information Services transferred 50,000 students and alumni onto HoyaWorks, an email and calendar system that is merged with Google, increasing the total users from the previous 10,000 original faculty and staff.
“Everyone is now on a single integrated platform for email and calendar, allowing greatly increased efficiency and communication among all members of the Georgetown community,” Davis said.
HoyaWorks increased the efficiency of communication across campus by enabling the sharing of documents and calendars.
According to Chief Innovation Officer Michael Wang (MSB ’07), the new system reduced past space management problems.
“The confusion between students and faculty in regards to booking spaces for events will be drastically reduced by having a single system in place that allows for the sharing of resources such as Google Docs,” Wang said.
Now students and faculty can use this feature to reserve lounges and spaces throughout the semester.
This summer, Davis was able to cross another goal off her list: expanding wireless coverage on the university’s SaxaNet server to encompass the entire main campus.
Nearly 300 old wireless devices were replaced to improve coverage and connect the entire campus to a single high-performance network, we largely improved wireless security for students and staff and increased usage efficiency,” Davis said.
According to Davis, the next step is to increase wireless coverage for New South and the Southwest Quad residence halls by placing new devices in weak Wi-Fi locations.
She also plans to test the current status of Wi-Fi coverage on campus during the fall semester in order to identify any network gaps that remain after the initial overhaul.
Also on the agenda is a second Innovation Summit, to be held in mid-November. This time, Davis said, she hopes to involve alumni in discussions about ways to improve technology on campus.
Davis added that she intends to use the two months before the second summit to identify specific issues that need to be addressed.
“We have more time to leverage and target problem sets,” she said.
In the meantime, a working group is forming to determine the university’s next technology-related project, according to Wang. The group will explore the possibility of using Modo Labs, a service that integrates and transforms data and content from any source for use on any mobile device, to exchange information and applications with other universities who have similar data integration systems, such as Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
This year, Davis wants to add Georgetown’s mobile application to the Apple Store in order to facilitate downloading the software onto mobile devices.
Davis and her team are also collaborating with the Georgetown University Student Association and newly appointed Chief of Police Jay Gruber to investigate how to use technology to increase student safety.
“As we modernize the infrastructure and systems of technology at Georgetown, we are looking to create programs based on the needs of students,” Davis said. “Safety is certainly one of those needs, and we are planning to collaborate with the Department of Public Safety to address these wishes.”
GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) want to equip the mobile app with an “emergency” section.
Sources under the emergency heading would include police department contact information and GPS-tracking technology for university emergency response groups and service shuttles.
“These changes are dependent on the development of an ecosystem in which we build dialogue and develop programs and applications based on the needs of students, faculty and staff,” Davis said.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly denoted Michael Wang’s school and year as (COL ’14). He actually graduated from the McDonough School of Business in 2007. The corrected version was posted at 1:41 p.m. on Aug. 31.

While most students spent the beginning of this week fine-tuning their course schedules and lugging their storage boxes across campus, Chair of the Georgetown University College Republicans Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) and 19 other representatives from Georgetown joined the nearly 20,000-strong crowd at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla.
“[It] was amazing,” Cleary said. “This was a tremendous opportunity, certainly not one that everyone gets, and we’re lucky to get this while we’re at Georgetown.”
The trip to the convention, which was held from Aug. 28 to Aug. 30, was sponsored by the School of Continuing Studies. The SCS will also be sending a delegation to the Democratic National Convention, beginning Sept. 4 in Charlotte, NC.
According to SCS Senior Associate Dean James Parenti, planning for the trip began six months ago, when the school was evaluating its “Semester in Washington D.C.” program, which allows college students from universities outside of D.C. to take classes at Georgetown while interning in the District. Parenti realized that the SCS was missing out on an opportunity to collaborate more with Georgetown undergraduates, and decided to arrange a delegation of Georgetown students and faculty to attend each of the conventions.
“It’s very much in line with what SCS does in all of our programs,” Parenti said. “We provide opportunities for students to have rich and engaging classroom experiences that every student looks forward to when they attend Georgetown, but we also provide them [with] opportunities where they can take the theory that they’re studying and learning about in the classroom environment and actually see how that theory is applied in the real world.”
According to Parenti, the organization process was long and complicated, but Georgetown’s political connections — SCS faculty member and former Deputy Assistant to President George W. Bush Bradley Blakemen as well as Georgetown Public Policy Institute Professor and former Counselor to President Clinton Paul Begala — helped make the program possible.
Once details of the trips were finalized, the SCS contacted GUCR and the Georgetown University College Democrats to encourage interested members to apply.
Blakemen and Parenti accompanied the 20 members of the Georgetown delegation to Tampa. All participants were selected by a lottery and include undergraduate, graduate and SCS students.
“For individuals who have never attended a political convention, this has been a very eye-opening experience for them,” Parenti said. “What you see behind the scenes and what takes place at the convention and surrounding the convention are experiences not typically covered by the media, and they’re not typically experienced by the average American, so they have an opportunity to have a truly unique behind-the-scenes experience.”
Cleary, who is also the head of the Washington D.C. chapter of Students for Romney, said she was surprised by some aspects of the convention.
“Sometimes, when you think convention, you don’t think policy talks as much as you think of rallies and cheering,” she said. “[But] it was very intellectual,” she said.
Cleary said she attended policy discussions, met reporters from Bloomberg and Politico and attended some of the convention’s biggest speeches at night.
Speakers included New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Ann Romney and Republican primary candidates Rick Santorum and Tim Pawlenty.
“Their speeches were really, really great,” Cleary said of Christie and Romney’s talks. “One of the bigger purposes of the convention is to get people excited and … I think they both did that very successfully.”

Students eating at O’Donovan Hall will notice more than a few changes this semester.
The cafeteria’s new layout includes more tables on the lower level, more cutlery stations and tweaks to several food stations, while Grab ’n’ Go has begun offering a hot food option.
The changes came about as a result of Georgetown University Dining Services’ “We Hear You” campaign, which used feedback from student petitions, suggestions and surveys to revamp the dining experience on campus.
The campaign aims to improve the variety and quality of food served in O’Donovan Hall.
“I’m excited that Leo’s is actually listening to student input and providing more options,” HannahMuldavin (COL ’15) said.
Over the summer, diner-style booths were removed from the lower level and replaced with additional tables to combat meal-hour rushes. Extra cups, plates and silverware were also added to both levels of the building to end the scramble for utensils and improve traffic flow between the multiple food stations.
New ingredients — pecans, sunflower seeds, dried cranberries and goldfish — complement the mixed greens and vegetables at the salad stations on both levels, while the stir-fry station, now called the Wok, began “Sushi Wednesdays” and added a rotating meat specialty and vegetarian dishes. Meanwhile, The Bistro now features new pizza stuffers, homemade bread and frozen yogurt.
Grab ’n’ Go will also include coffee during breakfast in addition to the hot food option during lunch and dinner.
“The better quality of Grab ’n’ Go will definitely make going to class easier,” Muldavin said.
To encourage students to take advantage of the broader array of dining options available on campus, students are now equipped with a “dining passport” upon entering Leo’s, which sends them to Grab ’n’ Go locations, Starbucks, Cosi, Einstein Bros. Bagels and Dr. Mug with the promise of a 50 percent discount on their last-stop purchase.
During the restoration, Dining Services placed a strong focus on providing healthier options, and the vegan and vegetarian menu now incorporates more whole grains, protein options and steamed vegetables with less oil, butter and seasonings.
“I’m really happy to hear there will be more whole grains like quinoa available now,” Madeline Curtis (NHS ’14) said.
Despite the new ingredients and more diverse food options, students have still voiced concerns.
“The changes were extremely noticeable, and basically, they are just really bad, to be honest,” Nick Baker (COL ’15) said. “I went in there for lunch … and it seems like all the stations where we were able to put together our own meals have been taken away.”
Baker referenced the stir-fry, pasta and salad stations as having undergone the most changes: Wraps are no longer prepared at the salad bar, and students cannot choose the ingredients to include in their pasta and stir-fry dishes.
