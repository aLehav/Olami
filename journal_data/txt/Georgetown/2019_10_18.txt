Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg stood by his website’s decision to staunchly promote free expression — including by permitting all political advertisements — in a packed Gaston Hall event Oct. 17. 
Zuckerberg’s speech at Georgetown University comes one month after Facebook announced the website would not regulate politicians’ speech or fact-check political advertisements ahead of the 2020 presidential election. 
Zuckerberg defended the policy in his speech, saying that even if such content is false, it is a matter of free speech to allow the advertisements and perspectives on the platform.
“Some people believe giving more people a voice is driving division rather than bringing us together,” Zuckerberg said in his speech. “More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes they think matter is more important than every person having a voice. I think that’s dangerous.”
Facebook was met with criticism from political and business leaders after the Sept. 24 announcement, but Zuckerberg continued to advocate for the policy in his Thursday speech. 
“I don’t think it’s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,” Zuckerberg said. “Abandoning political ads favors whoever the media chooses to cover.” 
Facebook has faced previous critiques for the company’s policy choices on content regulation in recent years. Falsehoods including unverified information about presidential candidate Hillary Clinton circulated on the website during the 2016 presidential election. Further, misinformation has since evolved to include more pervasive forms of manipulated content, such as deepfakes, on the social media platform, according to The Washington Post: A video altered to make House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) appear drunk went viral on Facebook in May 2019. 
Banning politicians’ advertisements from Facebook would also raise questions about prohibiting issue-related advertisements, creating murkier territory, Zuckerberg said at the event. 
If the website allows advertisements pertaining to specific issues such as health care, immigration or women’s empowerment, politicians should also have a voice in social media discourse, according to Zuckerberg.
“Even if we wanted to ban political ads, it’s not even clear where you draw the line,” Zuckerberg said. “I believe when it is not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of greater expression.” 
The event, titled “A Conversation on Free Expression,” was co-sponsored by the Georgetown McCourt School of Public Policy and the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. Zuckerberg’s address kicked off the new GUPolitics initiative “Democracy in the Digital Age,” a series of public conversations with political, technology and media leaders on challenges and opportunities in the digital age. 
The event included a 35-minute speech by Zuckerberg, followed by a Q&A session moderated by Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of GUPolitics. Questions were preselected from student submissions, as has occasionally been the case at past high-profile events, such as the Climate Forum 2020 and an event on free speech featuring former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Zuckerberg’s speech comes at a contentious time for the company, as Facebook is facing criticism not only for its content moderation, but also for its domination of advertising revenue in the sector. Prominent politicians, including presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), have called for the breakup of the company’s power.
Unless content has the potential to incite harm, it should remain on Facebook to effectively uphold free expression, according to Zuckerberg. 
“I believe that we have two responsibilities: to remove content when it can cause real danger as effectively as we can and to fight to uphold as wide of a definition of freedom of expression as possible and to not allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary,” Zuckerberg said.
Social media has the capacity to replace the Fourth Estate of conventional news outlets as a vehicle to facilitate public discourse and inform the general population, according to Zuckerberg. 
“People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world, a fifth estate, alongside the other power structures in our society,” Zuckerberg said. “People no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers and politics in media to make their voices heard.” 
Zuckerberg also addressed Facebook’s role on the global stage, including in China; Facebook, Instagram and other services owned by the company do not operate in the country. Expanding services to China would have aligned with Facebook’s mission of creating a more inclusive and connected society, Zuckerberg said. 
However, Facebook never came to a consensus with the country on operating regulations.
“I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world, and I thought we might help create a more open society,” Zuckerberg said. “I worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in.”
Disregarding personal opinion on the divisiveness of social media, individuals must come together to champion freedom of thought, according to Zuckerberg. 
“The future depends on all of us,” Zuckerberg said. “Whether you like Facebook or not, I think we need to recognize what is at stake and come together to stand for voice and free expression.”

The university announced the appointment of Director of Theater and Performance Studies Soyica Colbert (COL ’01) as a vice dean of faculty in an email to the community Oct. 11. 
Colbert will join a team of four other deans, including two vice deans of faculty, the vice dean of graduate affairs and diversity and inclusion, and the vice dean for undergraduate affairs. While Colbert will begin her new role in the spring, current Vice Dean of Faculty Deborah Phillips will continue working with the office until the end of her term in June 2020. 
Even though Phillips and Colbert will overlap terms in the spring, Colbert will share the role with professor David Edelstein, the other current vice dean of faculty.
Vice dean positions are a two-year commitment with an optional additional year, according to Georgetown College Dean Christopher Celenza. Celenza and his team began their search process last spring in preparation, he said.
“All of us on the team knew that there were going to be some changes going on and so we all talked about it together,” Celenza said in an interview with The Hoya.
While ultimately Celenza’s decision, the choice to add Colbert to the vice dean team was a group effort, according to Phillips. 
“We all sat around and thought about who would be really ideal for this position. It’s a challenging position that really draws on a lot of personal capacities,” Phillips said in an interview with The Hoya. “We all felt that Soyica would be an ideal person and we’re all absolutely thrilled that she has accepted the position.” 
Hamza Atumah (COL ’20), who has taken two courses with Colbert, hopes that her approachability and accessibility to students will continue in her role as vice dean. 
“I think she really goes out of her way to push the limits of what students see in themselves as well as to hold them to higher expectations so they don’t at least lose that within themselves,” Hamza said in an interview with The Hoya. “She’s good at doing that, especially for students who are trying their hardest to take an initiative.” 
Colbert attributes many of her successes to her desire to work across many fields.
“Throughout my career, working collaboratively has been key to my development.” Colbert said in a university news release. “In my new role, I look forward to working with colleagues across the arts and sciences to realize our visions for a justice centered College of the twenty-first century.”
Colbert and the other vice dean of faculty are responsible for overseeing the College’s 16 departments and 12 interdisciplinary programs and managing department hirings throughout the year. Since Colbert will share her role with Phillips until June, their exact responsibilities have not yet been determined, Celenza said. 
Phillips hopes her shared semester with Colbert can be a helpful learning experience for both professors, Phillips said.
“My goal for the spring, as I said, is to make sure she’s fully equipped to hit the ground running when I’m no longer in the office,” Phillips said. “And I feel very, very fortunate that she’s willing to spend a semester working alongside me.” 
One of the many reasons that Celenza wanted Colbert as a part of his team was her experience as chair of the department of performing arts, he said.
“It’s a very diverse department and it’s a very important department and the fact that she chaired it so successfully was really important on that front,” Celenza said. “They combine theater and music, as well as public speaking, and dance, but they also combine a lot of different types of things that are in some ways unusual and helped her flex more muscles as a chair.” 
Because the arts are a central part of the College, Colbert can use her experience to create new collaborative opportunities and develop a joint performance lab with the School of the Foreign Service, according to Celenza. 
“One of the things we really need, and that she would be positioned to do very well, would be a vision for the arts at Georgetown,” Celenza said. “Most of the arts are situated within Georgetown College, and I am convinced that the arts are really good here and they’re better than sometimes that reputation gives us credit for.”

Associate Director for Undocumented Student Services Arelis Palacios will leave her position Jan. 31 to pursue a doctoral degree at the University of Texas at Austin. 
Palacios has worked with the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access since November 2016. After departing her position at Georgetown University, Palacios will work in K-12 educational reform efforts in Austin, Texas, while working toward a doctoral degree. The CMEA will post the job opening in the upcoming weeks and aims to fill the position by January, according to Palacios.
The position of associate director for undocumented student services is responsible for creating programs to help students without documentation achieve success, according to CMEA Director Charlene Brown-McKenzie. 
“This role is responsible for development and implementation, programs and services to engage and support undocumented undergraduate and graduate students, in addition to identifying and collaborating with on- and off- campus resources and partners to help undocumented students find success and well-being,” Brown-McKenzie wrote in an email to The Hoya.
For students without documentation filling out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals application alone and struggling with safety concerns when the Trump administration announced plans to phase out DACA in 2017, Palacios played a crucial adviser role, according to Hoyas For Immigrant Rights President and student without documentation Arisaid Gonzalez Porras (COL ’21).
“Arelis has been there to help me fill out my DACA application since it was the first time I’d done it without my parents’ guidance,” Porras wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In the past two years, Arelis has been there in time of support like when the DACA program was rescinded.”
Due to the safety risks that people without documentation face in the current political climate and the uncertainty surrounding DACA, having an on-campus position dedicated to the interests of students without documentation is essential, according to Palacios. 
“While there are elevated levels of risk and enforcement across our communities, it’s even more urgent for a position like this to exist in universities nationally to provide support and reassurance to undocumented youth in their professional goals and to forge paths of continued educational attainment,” Palacios wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
During her time working at the CMEA, Palacios worked closely with colleagues in the Georgetown Scholars Program, the Center for Social Justice, Research, Teaching and Service, the Undocumented Student Advisory Team and the Office of the President, among other administrative offices at Georgetown. The emphasis that Georgetown places on providing services to students without documentation is rarely found in institutions nationwide, according to Palacios. 
“I have worked at institutions that did not make the same commitment to their undocumented students, and it was very hard to have felt so helpless in those moments, so it’s imperative for folx to understand that these efforts require coordinated responses on behalf of many community members,” Palacios wrote.
In addition to having a position dedicated to students without documentation, Georgetown has representatives from 17 different offices who work to support students without documentation, according to the university’s undocumented student resources page. Georgetown recently signed an amicus brief expressing support for DACA, joining 18 other colleges and universities. 
The position provides support for students without documentation at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Although the role does help a wide range of Georgetown students, there continues to be a lack of support for students without documentation at other universities, Porras wrote.
“This role does a lot of behind the scenes work not just on the undergraduate level but also for graduate, law, and medical students,” Porras wrote. “The fact that this position is not in place for all universities says a lot about the work that needs to be done to continue to create resources for students to succeed.”
Interacting with the community of students without documentation and helping them achieve their professional and academic goals has been a fulfilling part of the job, Palacios said. 
“I have really enjoyed getting to know our undocumented student community and being in a position to provide key support services to our students at various critical moments,” Palacios wrote. “I’m grateful to have witnessed even a small part of their journeys at Georgetown.”

The McDonough School of Business hosted events for faculty and students this week as it celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Rafik B. Hariri Building.  
The building, inaugurated in fall 2009, includes classrooms and auditoriums that have hosted both MSB students and visiting CEOs, politicians and entrepreneurs over the past decade. The anniversary celebrations will continue over the next several weeks. 
The building is named after the late Lebanese prime minister and philanthropist Hariri, whose son, Saad Hariri, graduated from the MSB in 1992. It serves as the first permanent home for the MSB, making it even more significant for the program, according to Chris M. Kormis, associate dean, chief marketing officer and senior advisor to the dean.
The building has played a crucial role in the development of the business school, Kormis wrote. 
“The Hariri Building became the home for the McDonough School of Business and really helped us become the community we are today,” Kormis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our students, faculty, and staff are able to collaborate like never before.”
The business program continues to grow in the new building and is currently ranked 26th in overall full-time MBA programs in the United States by Bloomberg Business, and 15th for its undergraduate program by U.S. News and World Report.
The MSB has organized celebrations like serving District Doughnut at the weekly “Bagels with the Dean” event, creating a social media campaign using the hashtag #10YearsAtHariri and celebrating faculty and staff with Baked and Wired cupcakes. Stephanie Martineau, director of events at the MSB, planned the anniversary events.
In celebration, the school has hung banners throughout the building in an effort to recognize the MSB’s “D.C. Advantage,”“Georgetown Expertise” and “Jesuit Tradition,” the aspects of the school that make it a unique institution, according to a tweet from the MSB.
Fully donor-funded, the Hariri Building has contributed to creating a more prestigious business program at Georgetown, Kormis wrote.
“We are very fortunate that our alumni community stepped up to support the construction of a building for the McDonough School of Business,” Kormis wrote. “The Hariri Building has enabled us to work much more closely together, enriched our faculty research and academic offerings, and provided venues to host prominent speakers – all of which have raised the school in prominence.”
The building has served as an important role in unifying the MSB community, enabling the school to hold major events in the Lohrfink Auditorium and to host prominent business executives in the Fisher Colloquium.
In addition to alumni’s generosity, the building has been greatly supported by the community members who maintain the building, according to Michael O’Leary, faculty chair of the undergraduate business program.
“We are also deeply indebted to the unsung heroes who keep the building clean and well maintained. It is no small accomplishment to keep a 10-year-old building looking as good as it does,” O’Leary wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Everyone from our building manager Rob Johnston to the overnight cleaning crew does a fantastic job ensuring that the space is at its best for learning, research, and a steady stream of phenomenal events.”
The business program continues to lead in its field and the anniversary of the building is an uplifting event for all of those involved in the MSB, according to Kormis.
The building allows for a positive environment that encourages student and faculty interaction, Kormis wrote. 
“The building was designed to bring people together with its open atrium, breakout rooms, student lounges, Lohrfink Auditorium, and Fisher Colloquium,” Kormis wrote. “It’s just a great place to come to work every day.”

Marie Yovanovitch, Georgetown senior state department fellow and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, testified Oct. 11 in a House impeachment inquiry designed to investigate the alleged misconduct of President Donald Trump. 
Yovanovitch, who was appointed by Barack Obama in August 2016, served as ambassador to Ukraine until May when President Trump relieved her of her duties. Yovanovitch testified at the hearing to Congress that she was targeted by Trump administration officials for removal as part of an organized effort to relieve her from her position.
Yovanovitch serves as a senior state department fellow at Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, a branch of the School of Foreign Service. She is currently on personal leave from her role at the institute, according to Barbara Bodine, the director of the ISD. 
Bodine does not expect that Yovanovitch’s testimony or further involvement in the investigation will negatively affect her role at Georgetown.
“We will continue to provide whatever support to her that is appropriate and useful to her,” Bodine wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The inquiry, led by House Democrats, has focused on Trump’s attempts to convince Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden’s son, Hunter, served on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma from 2014 until the beginning of 2019.
After the ambassador learned she was being withdrawn from Ukraine, Yovanovitch met with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who assured her she had done nothing wrong, according to Yovanovitch’s opening statement. Trump had lost confidence in her, however, and began putting pressure on the State Department to remove her in 2018, according to Yovanovitch’s testimony.
The SFS believes Yovanovitch can serve as an important resource for students when she returns because of her experience as a diplomat, according to SFS Dean Joel Hellman.
“We are trying to be fully supportive in the sense that we are excited to have her on campus,” Hellman said in an interview with The Hoya. “We are excited for her to be another resource with other senior diplomats for our students. We think she has a critical role to play in talking about the importance of foreign policy professionals at this moment.”
The SFS also looks forward to Yovanovitch working with students to give her perspective on her career in foreign service, according to Hellman. 
“We are very excited to have her on campus and I think that her long career in the foreign service sort of suggests a kind of integrity and professionalism of foreign service officers in their engagement and service to administrations from both parties,” Hellman said.
Yovanovitch served as an American diplomat for 33 years before Trump fired her from the State Department, according to TIME. She had worked with both former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and current President Zelensky to pursue economic reform and anti-corruption policy. 
Yovanovitch was withdrawn from Ukraine for reasons outside of her diplomatic ability, as she adequately fulfilled her duties as an American ambassador, according to Angela Stent, director of the Georgetown Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies.
“She was doing her job as ambassador to Ukraine, and part of the job was to encourage the previous Ukrainian government and then the new one under Zelensky, and the previous one under Poroshenko, to really pursue an anti-corruption drive because the previous government really hadn’t done it that well,” Stent said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s clear that she was fired for reasons that had nothing to do with her performance.”
Yovanovitch’s efforts to end corruption in the government might have threatened the Trump administration’s alleged efforts to coerce Ukraine into investigating the Biden family ahead of the 2020 election, according to Stent. 
President Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani called for an investigation into Yovanovitch’s background in an Oct. 12 tweet. The call to investigate Yovanovitch illustrates that conducting diplomacy through outsiders without policy experience is problematic, according to Stent.
“I think she’s now become a real symbol of everything that’s wrong in the way the Trump administration is making some of its foreign policy,” Stent said.

The Georgetown University Law Center Student Bar Association called for a universitywide tuition freeze as well as greater transparency in tuition changes in a resolution submitted to Law Center Dean William Treanor on Oct. 15.
The SBA, which represents all Georgetown Law students, works through various subcommittees to enact changes to campus policy. In the resolution, students asked the administration to approve tuition rates for the next academic year that match those from this year adjusted for inflation, as well as spend the year looking into how it can adjust the budget to reduce the cost of tuition. 
Students also advocated for more transparency, calling for the university to notify community members of tuition increases sooner and make more information discussed in SBA Appropriations Committee meetings public.
The Appropriations Committee of the SBA is comprised of students and faculty members who advise the Dean on tuition and budget matters. Before delivering the resolution to Treanor, the SBA voted unanimously to pass the motion Oct. 9, according to committee member Josh Mogil (LAW ’20, SFS ’11). 
Student members of the Appropriations Committee from the 2019-20 and 2018-19 school years drafted the resolution in solidarity with Georgetown undergraduate students, who called for a tuition freeze according to a Feb. 15 editorial in The Hoya.
Students across university campuses stand united in the push for a tuition freeze, according to Mogil. 
“I’m sure you know, students don’t agree on anything,” Mogil said. “These student government meetings are always contentious. But we spoke with one voice and unanimously, there was not one dissenter.”
The resolution was cosponsored by 20 SBA delegates and four student groups, including the Georgetown chapter of the American Constitution Society, a nationwide legal organization that promotes the fundamental values of the U.S. Constitution. 
A tuition freeze would make law school more accessible to people from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, according to committee representative John Heflin (LAW ’20). 
“You’re going to have more and more students from low income backgrounds, from more diverse backgrounds, who don’t have the financial means and resources to get into the system to get a law degree,” Heflin said. “I think that is going to have a very negative impact on the kinds of people who are, in 20 to 30 years, writing and deciding the laws.”
Full-time Georgetown J.D. tuition for the 2019-20 school year is $64,548, and the total estimated cost of attendance is $94,500, according to the resolution. Law school tuition rates in the United States have risen steadily by between 3.5% and 4% per year for the past 20 years, according to the American Bar Association. 
The Appropriations Committee conducted research last year on areas within the law school’s budget to cut back that would justify a smaller tuition increase, aiming for around 2%, according to Mogil. Georgetown Law tuition and fees for full-time J.D. students, however, increased by 3.7%, according to the university website. 
After receiving the resolution, Treanor said he looks forward to further partnership with students in the Georgetown Law community to address the most appropriate ways to keep tuition affordable.
“I am deeply committed to making a Georgetown Law education affordable for students from the broadest array of backgrounds, including our rapidly increasing cohort from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds,” Treanor wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
Treanor will meet with the SBA to discuss a range of topics Oct. 24 and will meet with specifically the Appropriations Committee to begin the annual budget cycle Nov. 1, according to Mogil.
While the university may not agree to a tuition freeze, the resolution will spur a necessary dialogue about the budget, according to law professor Anne Fleming, who served on the Appropriations Committee for the 2018-19 academic year.
“Although an outright tuition freeze may not be feasible, given the financial needs of the school, it will surely help in the Committee’s work to have a clear statement of the SBA’s views as the committee members delve into the details of the budget,” Fleming wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Mogil brought forward a similar resolution last year about rising tuition rates, but the SBA did not pass it, according to Mogil. 
This year’s resolution focused on making demands that could realistically be passed by the administration, according to SBA president Melody Alemansour (LAW ’20).
“We at least want to make sure we’re taking healthy steps to move in the right direction, so this resolution calls for, at least at a baseline, more affordability and transparency,” Alemansour said. “The idea has been discussed since last year, but we had to figure out the right way to bring it forward.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate passed a resolution calling for the university to formally recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day in place of the current mid-semester holiday at their weekly meeting Oct. 14. 
The resolution, which was introduced by recently elected freshman senator Eric Lipka (COL ’23), passed the senate unanimously with two abstentions following 15 minutes of debate between senators. The measure comes months after the Native American Student Council submitted a petition to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) in April 2019 calling for the same action to be taken.
The resolution will ideally encourage the university to take clear steps to recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day, according to Lipka. 
“The message that I hope this will send to the administration is that tangible action needs to be taken. By not doing so, you further diminish this community, you don’t represent all Hoyas on campus,” Lipka said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think this is a good step in the right direction to bring visibility, bring recognition, respect, to this community that has not historically received that.” 
Indigenous Peoples’ Day was first proposed in 1977 during a conference at the United Nations. The indigenous individuals who proposed the change cited Columbus’ links to the genocide of Native Americans and other improprieties as reasons for the replacement of the holiday. Washington, D.C., 10 states and several U.S. cities currently recognize the new form of the celebration. 
Georgetown University formally stopped recognizing Columbus Day two years ago, when the annual holiday was changed to the current mid-semester holiday. The District passed the Indigenous Peoples’ Day Emergency Declaration on Oct. 8 of this year, temporarily changing recognition of the holiday. It is a temporary, emergency declaration made to enable the D.C. Council to enact the declaration without Congressional approval, as is required with typical pieces of D.C. legislation. 
Members of the NASC believes that a name change for the holiday would demonstrate Georgetown’s support of members of the indigenous community on campus, according to the group.
“Although a seemingly small feat, the impact of changing the narrative around Columbus Day into Indigenous Peoples’ Day is critically important to us as Indigenous students at Georgetown University,” the group wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It brings a sense of hope and shows that the Georgetown community recognizes our existence, humanizes our struggles, and keeps us in their thoughts and actions.”
Lipka urged the university to formally recognize the new version of the holiday in a letter obtained by The Hoya that he delivered to DeGioia on Oct. 15.
Monday’s resolution is not the first time the GUSA senate has taken up the topic of Indigenous Peoples’ Day. The current GUSA senate speaker, Juan Martinez (SFS ’20), also introduced a resolution two years ago calling on the university to change recognition of the holiday from Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples’ Day, which passed unanimously, according to Lipka.
Freshman senator Eric Bazail Eimil (SFS ’23) was among a small group of senators who voiced concerns about the implications of the resolution. Columbus Day was originally intended to recognize Italian immigrants, according to NPR. Changing the name would be an erasure of the Italian American experience, Bazail Eimil wrote.  
“My caution was to remind senators that in pushing for the elimination of Columbus Day, we are inherently forgetting and diminishing the suffering of a different group of people,” Bazail Eimil wrote.  
The Georgetown Native American Law Students Association also submitted a resolution to the Student Bar Association, the Law Center’s student advocacy organization, urging the Georgetown University Law Center to recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day, according to NALSA Vice President Kayla Gebeck (LAW ’20).
The resolution passed unanimously among SBA members Oct. 9, and NASLA plans to further petition the Law Center to implement the change, according to Gebeck. 
The GUSA resolution is a positive step toward implementing Indigenous Peoples’ Day across the various Georgetown University campuses, Gebeck wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“The Georgetown Native American Law Students Association (NALSA) is very supportive of and stands with the GUSA Senate,” Gebeck wrote.
Changing the language of Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples’ Day is a positive step towards a more inclusive environment for the indigenous community on campus and elsewhere, according to the NASC.
“Renaming the second Monday of October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day has been a long-time goal of Native American Student Council (NASC), so we believe that this is a step in the right direction,” the NASC wrote. “It shows that the hard work from not only us and our allies in NASC, but from Indigenous students before us and those outside our organization, is starting to make a tangible impact on campus culture.”

D.C., Maryland and Virginia’s health departments have linked at least 33 recent cases of salmonella to hummus served at multiple Moby Dick House of Kabob locations.
Currently, the Maryland Department of Health reports 23 confirmed cases of salmonella, the Virginia Department of Health reports nine cases, and the D.C. Department of Health reports at least one case. The cases have been reported since Sept. 10 in Maryland, according to the MDH. 
After Moby Dick voluntarily suspended hummus sales in September, the MDH cleared the restaurant’s Hyattsville, Md., plant to resume hummus production Oct. 4. 
Moby Dick is a Persian restaurant with a Georgetown location at 1070 31st St. NW, as well as 24 other storefronts across Maryland, Virginia and D.C. The manager of the Georgetown location declined to comment, and the company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The company claims that no evidence supports a direct correlation between its hummus and the cases of salmonella, stating that tests performed by MDH on the hummus looking for the disease came back negative, according to WTOP. 
Eight of the nine initial customers who came down with salmonella reported eating the hummus, MDH said in a Sept. 26 news release. The hummus is still being investigated as a possible cause, according to MDH spokesperson Maureen Regan.
“Maryland Department of Health has not excluded Moby Dick House of Kabob hummus as the source of this salmonella outbreak,” she wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The plant where Moby Dick produces its hummus has been inspected, improved and cleared to resume operations, Regan said. 
“After a thorough inspection and review of food production practices by Moby Dick House of Kabob, and implementation of required corrective actions, the MDH Office of Food Protection approved Moby Dick House of Kabob to resume the manufacture of hummus,” Regan wrote.
The University of Maryland, College Park, has a Moby Dick restaurant located in a campus food court. Since beginning an investigation in late September, the university has confirmed 13 salmonella cases, according to The Diamondback. 
Salmonella is a foodborne illness caused by infection of the salmonella bacterium that can be spread by both eating contaminated food and from person to person contact. Symptoms usually appear within six hours to four days, according to MDH. These symptoms can include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, typically lasting four to seven days. Hospitalization from salmonella is possible among children, the elderly and individuals with weakened immune systems. 
The process for confirming a case of salmonella linked to Moby Dick House of Kabob is thorough, according to Katherine McCombs, foodborne disease epidemiology program coordinator at VDH.
“A confirmed case means someone who certainly became ill with the symptoms of salmonella, who was exposed to the restaurant, and had a stool sample submitted that was tested for salmonella and further tested with a process called whole genome sequencing, and that was also positive and related to the other cases,” McCombs said in an interview with The Hoya.
Other probable cases of salmonella exist in Virginia but have not yet been confirmed by VDH tests.
“There have been a number of probable cases, and those are cases that would have had the symptoms of salmonella and would have had the exposure but probably did not have lab testing completed,” she said. “That number is still fluctuating.” 
McCombs also emphasized that salmonella outbreaks are not distinct to Moby Dick House of Kabob. 
“Every restaurant can have problems and every restaurant has the ability to practice food safety and reduce the possibility of foodborne illness,” she said. “Salmonella is one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. In Virginia we’ll have one to two thousand cases a year.”
The spread of salmonella is preventable, though, and McCombs recommends frequent hand-washing and practicing food safety, especially with chicken and eggs.
“I just really want to reiterate that if you feel sick with the symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, fever, go to the doctor and submit a stool sample.” she said. “Washing your hands is the best way to prevent getting an ill or prevent passing an illness onto someone else.”

Rapper Kanye West made unannounced visits to Howard University and The George Washington University, promoting his long-awaited upcoming album while sparking controversy on Saturday, Oct. 12.
His day began with a gospel rap “Sunday Service” performance at Howard, followed by a screening of his unreleased album documentary “Jesus Is King,” a visual film accompanied by West’s new music, at GW’s Lisner Auditorium. Also at GW, West played draft versions of songs from “Jesus is King,” which he said will be released Oct. 25.
West’s “Sunday Service” at The Yard at Howard was open to the public and drew hundreds of spectators. Some attendees observed there were fewer attendees than had attended Yardfest, Howard’s annual homecoming weekend concert, the day prior, according to DCist. Students reportedly received an email announcing the performance two hours before the show. 
GW emailed its students at midnight the night before about the show and provided 150 free tickets to them as well.
However, word about the screening leaked on Twitter the night before, and users sold tickets to one another, according to attendee Shankar Thiru (COL ’22).
“We literally found tickets from a random Twitter user because everything was so sudden,” Thiru said in an interview with The Hoya. 
West’s presence on Howard’s campus was met with mixed reactions. Some expressed excited about the visit, but others, such as Howard Afro-American Studies Department Chair Gregory Carr, condemned West and his message.
“If @kanyewest is indeed at #HowardU this morning, send him to the third floor of Founder’s Library after he’s done. I have some books for him. #TheMiseducationOfTheNegro,” Carr wrote in a tweet Saturday morning.
West has drawn ire for supporting President Donald Trump, which critics say does more to hurt black Americans than to help them. The rapper recently said at a “Sunday Service” event in Utah that making choices, particularly political ones, on the basis of race is “mental slavery” and has previously argued that slavery was a choice. 
West ended the “Sunday Service” by leading a chant: “13th Amendment, gonna end it,” according to DCist. The 13th Amendment abolished slavery, although is often cited as a contributing factor to mass incarceration, as it states that involuntary servitude is acceptable as punishment for a crime. 
Kim Kardashian West and her and Kanye’s two oldest children, North and Saint, attended the show. Momolu Stewart and Halim Flowers, who were released from the D.C. Jail under the Incarceration Reduction Amendment Act, also spoke at “Sunday Service.” 
Kim Kardashian West wrote a letter in support of Stewart earlier this month that contributed to his release, according to The Washington Post.
Kanye’s visit to Washington, D.C., marks one year since his last time in the District in October 2018. Last year, West met with Trump and gave an impromptu speech on a table at the Georgetown Apple Store.
Attendees of the GW screening, including rapper Pusha T, watched the trailer and the uncut version of West’s IMAX documentary, heard samples off his new album and listened to him speak about his recent conversion to Christianity and read Bible verses. 
Because viewers saw West up close and listened to unreleased samples, it made for a unique but also secretive environment, according to attendee Matthew Joy (NHS ’22).
“The experience felt intimate because it was literally in a relatively small university auditorium,” Joy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The fact that we have to lock our phones in pouches also added on to this experience because it made everyone so involved in the moment, which contrasts how concerts and events run nowadays with everyone on their phones constantly recording everything.”
West continued the gospel theme at GW, according to Joy.
“The film Ye showed was also interesting because it was shot all in a circular lens and had very crisp vocals for all the songs led by the Sunday Service choir,” he wrote. “One of the highlights of the event was a song in which everyone was humming/singing along to this soccer-like chant and clapping along, very interactive and exciting experience for the whole crowd.”
Joy said that he appreciated the West family’s presence.
“I also loved the fact that Pusha T, Kim Kardashian, and all their kids were there,” he wrote. “The kids were also dancing on the stage during the film-screening which was extremely cute.”

The Period Empowerment Project will hold its third reusable menstrual product giveaway event next week featuring the handout of new reusable menstrual products and culminating with a dialogue-focused workshop.
Students, staff and faculty who complete the giveaway interest form by Oct. 18 will be entered to win one of 15 reusable cloth menstrual pads or one of 16 menstrual cups. Winners of the giveaway, which is co-sponsored by the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service, will be announced over email Oct. 22. Recipients will be able to pick up their reusable menstrual product at the PEP Reusable Menstrual Product Workshop on Oct. 29 in St. Mary’s Hall. 
The Reusable Menstrual Product Workshop will teach people about reusable menstrual products and create conversation around the challenges faced by students using these products while at college, including a lack of access to private bathrooms and laundry rooms, according to PEP’s CSJ Student Advisor Maddi Larmore (SFS ’22).  
“I do know that the upcoming event is not merely a giveaway but more so a workshop and an opportunity to foster a dialogue here on campus about reusable menstrual products and the challenges that students wishing to use them on campus may experience in doing so,” Larmore wrote in an email to The Hoya.
This semester’s giveaway also includes different and more colorful reusable menstrual products than previous semesters, according to PEP co-president Lauren Russell (COL ’22).
PEP, which is a chapter of the international organization PERIOD, was created by students three years ago. The chapter held its first reusable menstrual product giveaway through a raffle in Red Square in fall 2018 as a part of PERIOD’s Cup & Cloth campaign. Last semester, PEP started using an online interest form for the product giveaway in an effort to reach a wider audience, according to PEP co-president Kate Freda (COL ’22).
Outside of the giveaway, PEP has worked with HoyaHub, an on-campus food pantry, and Community of Hope, a Washington, D.C-based organization that helps homeless individuals with housing and opportunities, over the last semester to provide packages of pads, tampons and panty liners to each organization.
Observing the waste associated with PEP regularly providing menstrual product packages inspired PEP to give students sustainable menstrual product options, Freda wrote. 
“After seeing the amount of trash produced by assembling 200+ packages every month, we have been motivated to also provide a more sustainable and long-lasting option for Georgetown students,” Freda wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
PEP aims to increase access to free menstrual products on campus through the giveaway while highlighting reusable menstrual products as environmental and less expensive alternatives to traditional menstrual products, according to Freda. 
“The goal of the giveaway specifically is to give the Georgetown community an opportunity to win and learn more about reusable menstrual products as a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional disposable products,” Freda wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The giveaway expands on PEP’s advocacy work around issues of menstrual justice and guaranteeing equal access to affordable menstrual products, according to CSJ Executive Director Andria Wisler. 
“PEP has brought attention to the social justice issue of menstrual equity (also called menstrual justice) from the local ‘tampon tax’ to the global concern of access to safe, reliable, and affordable products,” Wisler wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Moving forward, menstrual justice can further be achieved at Georgetown by providing free access to menstrual products in all-gendered and non-gendered bathrooms on campus and through destigmatizing conversations about menstruation, according to Freda.
“I would love to see a campus with regularly stocked, free sanitary products and disposal bins in bathrooms in academic and residential buildings, including products in every gender neutral bathroom and – at the least – one clearly marked men’s bathroom in every building,” Freda wrote. “I’d also love to see Georgetown get to the point where talking about periods is as normal as talking about how much sleep we are (or aren’t) getting.”
