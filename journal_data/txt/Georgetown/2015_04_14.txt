World Bank Chief Institutional Economist Joel Hellman will be the new dean of the School of Foreign Service, beginning his term on July 1.
University President John J. DeGioia announced Hellman’s selection at 11:30 a.m. today.
Hellman, who received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University and a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Oxford, has worked as a faculty member at both Harvard University and Columbia. For the past fifteen years, he has worked at the World Bank, where he first served as director of the Center  on Conflict, Security and Development and now serves as the organization’s first chief institutional economist, specializing in governance and institutional reform.
“For nearly a century, the talents and vision of our deans, faculty, staff and students have made SFS the premier destination for young people seeking to become compassionate, agile leaders in foreign affairs,” DeGioia wrote in a campus-wide email. “We believe that by building on our foundation, Georgetown can make unique contributions in the context of the increasingly complex and interconnected global landscape that we face. As we imagine our future ahead and seek to engage in ever deeper and more meaningful ways with these issues, we look forward to working with Dr. Hellman to lead the SFS into its next hundred years of excellence.”
Hellman succeeds Interim SFS Dean James Reardon-Anderson, who took over the deanship in November 2013, after former Dean Carol Lancaster stepped down in April 2013 upon being diagnosed with a brain tumor. Lancaster died Oct. 22, 2014, at the age of 72.
In fall 2015, DeGioia appointed a group of 17 professors, students and university officials to an executive search committee to review applications for the deanship, which were due Nov. 20. Professor of government and foreign service Angela Stent, who chaired the SFS dean search in 2010, also led this selection committee.
While at the World Bank, Hellman worked in over 50 countries and led response to global conflicts in Nairobi, Kenya and Aceh, Indonesia, among other locations.
Hellman said that he is eager to lead the SFS into what he believes is the future of foreign service and find solutions for some of the largest problems in the world today.
“I’ve been in development for 15 years now, working on the front lines, and what I see most is that we are currently facing some crises across the world in which the ideas needed to break through these crises are really what we’re lacking,” Hellman said in a video interview on Georgetown’s website. “Georgetown has the strengths to do that, it has a strong faculty, and because of its location in Washington and international reputation, it’s really poised to look at theory, practice and experience in a new way and I think that’s what’s most needed.”
As the SFS prepares to celebrate its centennial in 2019, Hellman said that he believes that the world of international affairs is constantly changing, and that the school must engage in collaboration with other Georgetown schools to best tackle its goals.
“What’s needed now in international affairs is very different than what we needed 100 years ago,” Hellman said in the video. “While still important, the foreign service corps is only a small piece of the puzzle. SFS has the capacity to create a significant impact on the world in partnership with the university’s law school, medical school, McCourt School of Public Policy and McDonough School of Business. These schools combine together areas of technical depth and expertise. This is part of the reason why I’m so excited about coming to Georgetown.”

Around 60 students from both the Latino Leadership Forum and the Last Campaign for Academic Reform staged a sit-in in University President John J. DeGioia’s office Friday.
During the sit-in, they jointly presented a petition for a diversity course requirement and a proposal for the creation of a Casa Latina.
The groups joined together in solidarity after discussing both initiatives at a Black House event, according to LLF Facilitator Naomi Fierro (COL ’15).
“LCAR and LLF hold very similar values and are working toward the same goal: the recognition, elevation and inclusion of diverse student populations,” Fierro wrote in an email to The Hoya. “… We joined together in solidarity to engage the next generation of leaders to carry the torch on these initiatives that our Hilltop community so desperately needs.”
The group gathered in Red Square and passed out signs, then walked to DeGioia’s office, where they sat peacefully and presented both issues to members of DeGioia’s staff, including Office of the President Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara, for 30 minutes.
The group could not meet with DeGioia, as he was in Panama for the Summit of the Americas conference at the time. The group requested that the administration deliver a written response to members of LCAR and the LLF on both issues by April 17. According to LCAR member Dan Zager (COL ’18), the groups staged the sit-in and requested a quick response since the school year is coming to a close in less than a month, leaving little time for student activism in the last few weeks.
“This last month of school is a key time for both the LLF and LCAR,” Zager wrote in an email. “In the coming weeks, both organizations will be hosting more actions to pass their respective initiatives, and we look forward to a continuing partnership between LCAR, LLF and any other organization who fights for the people on and off campus.”
Ferrara, who spoke with many of the students, said that he was supportive of the student action.
“We are always proud and supportive when we see our students engaging, and I think this was a very respectful, peaceful, meaningful student demonstration,” Ferrara said to THE HOYA after the sit-in. “I applaud the students for their engagement on these issues.”
LCAR’s petition, distributed Feb. 23, has received around 1,200 signatures since its inception and remains open. The petition, which students presented at the sit-in Friday, calls for the creation of a two-course “Diversity, Power and Privilege” cross-list requirement.
Classes that LCAR cites meet the requirement will allow students to discuss race, class, sexual identity, gender and gender identity, immigration status and disability and ability. The petition does not propose to add any new classes to Georgetown’s curriculum, since over 200 existing courses fulfill LCAR’s requirement. Group members have been discussing and promoting the requirement since December 2014.
“I think that there are a lot of great courses at Georgetown that touch on different aspects of identity, race, class culture, ability, sexual orientation — diversity in its true sense,” LCAR member Colleen Roberts (COL ’15) said to the crowd assembled in Red Square before the sit-in. “Self-selecting individuals often take this course. What we’re trying to do is to ensure that all Georgetown students will be exposed to the ideas that many of us are exposed to during our undergraduate career.”
LCAR presented their proposal to the Main Campus Executive Faculty, a legislative body of 57 faculty members from each Georgetown school and two student representatives, March 27. The MCEF will vote on the requirement April 24, and if it passes with a minimum of 29 votes, it will be implemented by fall 2016 for the Class of 2020.
“Every Hoya needs to graduate with a fundamental understanding of the basic inequities in our world,” Zager said. “For 25 years, Georgetown students have been demanding a diversity requirement like this, and we are far behind our peer institutions like Duke, UCLA, Cornell, Brown, Princeton, Dartmouth, Fordham, I could go on. It’s about time that we need to do something similar.”
After the sit-in, Ferrara said that the Office of the President is working to consider the proposal.
“One thing I would say is that we have been working with our students on some of these issues to include the diversity requirement,” Ferrara said. “We’re very pleased to be working with them. I know there’s more work to be done, but we applaud the engagement and are very supportive of student engagement.”
The proposal for a Casa Latina, developed by the Latino Leadership Forum, calls for the university to create a permanent space for Latino Georgetown students, alumni and allies. The Latino community currently shares a space with the Black House, founded in 1972. Five students, chosen through an application process, live in the home and host events for the black and Latino communities each year.
Previously, Latino students have organized temporary cultural residences on Magis Row such as El Hogar del Poder Latino and La Casita, but a Casa Latina would be a permanent living space for the Latino community.
“We’re here to stand in solidarity with one another. … We’re here to claim something that has been long, long overdue, and that’s a Casa Latina, a safe space, a place that we can call home on the Hilltop,” Fierro said. “I’m so happy to see us all here, fighting in solidarity so that diversity in all of its roots can be appreciated here on this campus.”
The LLF released a survey in January to gauge interest in the creation of a Casa Latina. The open petition, thus far, has garnered 253 responses, 95 percent of which voiced support for a permanent Casa Latina.
“I feel like it’s a little bit odd to have a Black House but sort of have it include all cultures,” Zager said. “That, in a way, lumps all people of color together, which really isn’t fair. Most of the Ivies have a Casa Latina of some sort, or a residential community where we can appreciate Latino culture, and Georgetown doesn’t have one. We have a house for Jack the Bulldog, but we don’t have one for our vibrant Latino community.”
Ferrara said that the Office of the President is beginning to review the proposal for Casa Latina, but did not provide timelines for the office’s decisions on either initiative.
“That [Casa Latina] proposal has come along a little bit later in this cycle of engagement that we’ve had,” Ferrara said. “We kind of started working with the diversity requirement longer ago, and so it’s kind of farther down this path that we’re going through. Casa Latina is a relatively newer proposal, and we’re starting to have colleagues look at that and engage with that as well.”
Christian Veliz (COL ’14), who now works as a teacher in Harlem, N.Y. and participated in the sit-in support both LCAR and LLF, said he was impressed by the increased momentum in the support of both initiatives.
“This has been something that I think the momentum has been building on, and it’s something that I had conversations about as an undergraduate,” Veliz said. “This group of seniors, particularly, really pushed the initiative forward and was able to get organized in a way that I think previous classes haven’t.”
Georgetown University Student Association President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) also sat-in at the event. In a press release dated April 13, three days after their participation in the sit-in, the pair announced their administration’s support for LCAR’s initiative.
“We were very glad we got to participate in it,” Luther said after the sit-in. “We view both of these initiatives as very important for increasing the vibrancy of Georgetown’s culture and community. … I’m really impressed with the strong showing of people and I really hope the president’s office is receptive to these two initiatives. I look forward to seeing them implemented.”

But what if a student has no interest in focusing on diversity matters?  That is okay… just as okay as a student who is not interested in taking sociology.  Why should a group of students (and faculty?) be able dictate what people learn?  Seems facist.  
Also, why does the effort ignore intellectual/ideological diversity?

The Dude says 
April 14, 2015 at 12:09 pm
The scary thing about this article is that Ferrara says he is supportive of this action.  Great.  Now DeGioia’s CoS is on board with required left-wing brainwashing.
We all know “diversity” requirement isn’t about having diverse ideas presented or allowing for discussions about inequality or race/gender/sexual orientation/class.  All these can be had without the requirement, and do occur in class without the requirement, not to mention the constant mentions in campus press, speakers, NSO, and other programs. 
The reality is this campaign is about pressing upon students politically correct groupthink by forcing them to take courses taught by professors in the grievance industry departments which cater to professional victims, and who otherwise couldn’t fill seats b/c most students are smart enough to realize these courses are not a valuable use of student time or money.
How much money does the typical student pay for one course at GU?  I think it’s about 7.5K.  So now you’re just incurred a bill for 15K and likely a student loan with interest.  So you’ll now be paying that money to sit in a class you don’t want, and do assignments that add no value to your education, and incur the opportunity cost of time lost that you would have to do other things (such as gain new knowledge and develop or improve skills).  Wow.  Just wow.  
You know, let’s have a student vote on this where the entire undergraduate community gets to decide.  Of course, such a vote already occurs by the fact that students choose not to waste time in these courses.
Don’t let the race hustlers hijack the discussion and force this on students by administration fiat.  The diversity requirement people are loud and are active, but they don’t represent the views of the majority of students who should be free to use their time and money as they decide, and in more optimal ways, then being forced to take two courses.
By the way, why haven’t they released the list of “approved” courses?  B/c they’re all taught by left-wing faculty.  So much for honesty, openness, and transparency on the part of the hustlers running “Last Academic Reform” campaign.

The School of Foreign Service Academic Council is set to announce a new program focused on promoting and supporting careers in the public sector.
The program, called the Walsh Scholars Initiative, will be housed in the School of Foreign Service and will be officially rolled out in the coming weeks, according to SFSAC President Megan Murday (SFS ’15). Students in the SFS, excluding seniors, can apply for the yearlong program in the fall, and around five applicants will be selected to participate in the program.
According to data compiled by the Cawley Center’s First Destination Report Poll, only 11 percent of SFS graduates in the SFS Class of 2014 found jobs in nonprofit and public service work, while only 6 percent held positions in government. However, 25 percent of graduates took jobs in consulting services and 15 percent took jobs in the financial sector. Out of 356 total, 269 of SFS graduates responded to the survey.
Murday and SFSAC Senior Representative Annie Kennelly (SFS ’15) developed the idea for the initiative last year after noticing an increasing distance between an SFS education and public service. The SFSAC gave its first formal presentation about the initiative last fall at the SFS Board of Visitor’s meeting.
“We noticed that the SFS focused a lot on careers in consulting and investment banking and the like,” Murday said. “We didn’t see a similar focus on public service.”
The program will encourage students to pursue public service jobs in three ways: providing mentorship from members of the Georgetown community with careers in the field of the student’s choice, institutional support to help students find public service internships for the summer and a stipend for scholars to pursue unpaid public service summer internships. Murday said that the funding for the stipend has not yet been finalized, but that she hopes to work with the SFS Dean’s Office and outside donors to create a fund.
“We created the initiative to encourage students to pursue careers in public service because we think that that is the ethos of our school, and we wanted to build a better support system for that,” Murday said. “That would include matching them with mentors, within the Georgetown community, faculty, alumni, practitioners and then giving them institutional support to find an internship that matches their academic interest.”
As only five student applicants will be selected for the first year of the program, Murday said that the selection committee will seek students with strong interests and passions for public service.
“The application will look at transcripts, resumes, letters of recommendation, to get a sense of both the student’s academic interests, professional interests, what they feel public service is and how they see it relating to their career path,” Murday said.
The Walsh Scholars Initiative’s board, which will help provide mentors and institutional support for scholars, will include SFSAC member, as well as Beeck Center Executive Director Sonal Shah, Center for Peace and Security Studies and Security Studies Program Director Bruce Hoffman, Mortara Center for International Studies Director Kathleen McNamara, Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy Ambassador Robert Gallucci and Landegger Program in International Business Diplomacy Associate Director Rosie O’Neil. Institute for the Study of Diplomacy Director Ambassador Barbara Bodine will serve as the director of the program.
Although the idea and original planning of the initiative were student-run, Murday said that Bodine provided resources and advice during the development of the initiative.
“Dr. Bodine ran a similar program at Princeton called The Scholars in the Nation’s Service Initiative, and she was very excited to help us build something similar at Georgetown,” Murday said.
Bodine said she credits SFSAC students for their work in developing the initiative.
“The WSI is wholly a student initiative,” Bodine wrote in an email. “Megan, Annie et al. conceived of the need for a program to support, encourage and prepare fellow BSFS students for careers in public service, have negotiated the details with the Dean’s Office, worked with fellow students, reached out to potential donors and crafted the various foundational documents.”
Shah said that she is supportive of the initiative and eager to apply ideas from the initiative to the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation.
“The Beeck Center is supporting this initiative because we recognize that along with academic rigor and experience, students need mentoring and support,” Shah wrote in an email to THE HOYA. “The Beeck Center believes that this is a great opportunity for students to combine academia, experiential learning, mentoring and internships. We hope to learn from SFS efforts and connect the SFS team to others that also want to implement similar ideas.”
SFSAC Vice President Anna Hernick (SFS ’16) said that the new initiative will help to increase the value that Georgetown places on public service.
“I think public service is the practical side of that lofty goal that a lot of Georgetown students have of changing the world or improving society through their career,” Hernick said.
Murday said that although very few students year will be selected for the program each year, the goal of the initiative is to change public perception of SFS students and promote public service internships and jobs overall.
“Ideally, this will also benefit all SFS students because it will create a brand for the School of Foreign Service of the particular skillsets that we have that will really benefit any student applying to these organizations,” Murday said. “We hope that these internships will turn into more of a pipeline, where these programs will have spots for Walsh scholars every year.”
 
Correction: Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy Ambassador Robert Gallucci will also serve on the board of the program.
[…] Centennial can promote public service by directing funds to the Walsh Scholars Initiative, founded in 2015 to help SFS undergraduates develop “the professional skillset and network” for public […]

Rajiv Shah served as the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development from January 2010 to February 2015. After leaving the organization, he joined the faculty of Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service on March 1, where he currently serves as a distinguished fellow-in-residence, working primarily with the Global Human Development Program.
As part of his introduction to campus, Shah spoke on March 31 in Lohrfink Auditorium about the role of development in U.S. foreign policy, continuing the semester-long conversation about development on campus led by the Global Futures Initiative.
In an interview with The Hoya, Shah reflected on his term as USAID administrator and underlined the substantive role the university had to play in the global discussion on economic and humanitarian development.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
 
The Hoya: Why did you decide to leave USAID?
Shah: I think I’m the second longest-serving administrator in USAID history at almost five-and-a-half years of service, and I have greatly valued very single day of service, but I have three young kids and it was time to transition. I stayed longer than I had expected because we were in the midst of fighting back Ebola in West Africa and I was playing a key role in leading that effort, so I wanted to see that through. After the numbers got down to a more manageable level and I was confident that a system was in place to win the fight against Ebola, I made my transition.
 
Why did you select Georgetown? What do you hope to achieve here?
I think President [John J.] DeGioia and leaders like [Global Human Development Program Director and former USAID Chief Economist] Steve Radelet have a vision for Georgetown playing a unique and important role in contributing to the policy debate and creating the big new ideas that lead to change in how America projects power around the world. I am most excited about the chance to meet students who are just so excited to change the world and shape the world for good and are committed to that vision, whether it’s ending poverty or preventing conflict or protecting those who are vulnerable. I have found that students here in particular have a unique commitment to that goal and I just enjoy being able to be here and being inspired by being able to meet with them.
 
Do you plan to teach at Georgetown? How will you interact with students, and what do you bring to the university?
I have a series of regular lunches with students they have pulled together for me. I am teaching and guest lecturing in a variety of courses, delivering some larger policy speeches as part of the Global Futures Seminar, which has been an outstanding seminar in bringing in real talent and a really exciting space for thought on campus. I’m also planning on doing some writing while I’m here. We’ll see how long I plan to stay, hopefully a while.
 
The university recently launched the Global Futures program to engage with global issues, focusing this year on the question of development. In line with that, what role can the university play in the development mission?
The university is unique in that you have a phenomenal business school, you have a great School of Foreign Service, you have a large number of undergraduates with a uniquely global worldview in the heart of Washington, D.C. where so much happens in foreign policy and development. I also think the Jesuit nature and founding principles of the school lends itself to the service mission that is represented by development. What I have found by spending much of my career at the Gates Foundation and then USAID and [the U.S. Department of Agriculture], with a focus on helping the most vulnerable people in the world, that’s a very purposeful way to spend your career. It’s as personally rewarding as it is professionally engaging because you feel that your life has a sense of purpose, so I think this is a great purpose for Georgetown. I’d love to see more students commit themselves — whether they’re studying business or science or technology or humanities — to have a chance to touch and make life better for those who suffer around the world. It’s a deeply rewarding experience and I’m hopeful that my time here can make that happen a little bit.
 
How can students engage questions of poverty and inequality, both in the classroom and outside it?
No matter what discipline you are studying, you should know — if you’re a student here at Georgetown — that your work has the potential to improve the quality of life for people who are poor or vulnerable around the world.
As our world comes together and is increasingly interconnected, that gives you the power to shape how that world comes together over the next 10 or 15 years and much longer. I just think that finding opportunities to be exposed to the global fight against extreme poverty is probably one of the most rewarding things you can do as a student on this campus over the course of your tenure here and I hope more and more students will have that opportunity.
 
When you started at USAID, there were questions about the future of the organization, including whether it might be absorbed into the State Department. Now, it seems more stable and established. How did that transition take place?
USAID has an incredible mission, and the mission is to end extreme poverty and promote resilient, democratic society all around the world. Together with President Barack Obama, Secretary [of State Hillary] Clinton and Secretary [of State John] Kerry, we all felt that we should elevate the role of development and of that mission in our foreign policy and that we would best do that by reinvesting in having the world’s best development enterprise in the United States government.
During my tenure, we significantly increased our staffing at USAID, hired in a large number of new foreign service officers. We grew our budgets significantly, and perhaps most importantly, we demanded accountability and results against our core mission. As a result, I think today USAID is on a much stronger footing, has tremendous bipartisan support, and America is poised to continue its leadership in development and humanitarian affairs, which has persisted now for more than six decades.
 
What was the biggest challenge facing USAID when you began, and how did you face it?
My first week on the job was the Haiti earthquake, and so the most immediate challenge we had was that President Obama had asked me to lead a whole of government, civilian and military efforts to help Haiti get back on its feet. In an instant, more than 250,000 people had died and we had to mount the largest and, in many respects, one of the most courageous humanitarian responses ever seen. I think we did so successfully over the course of the next three to four months. So that was my immediate challenge.
In a broader sense, USAID and America’s lead in development had really waned over the course of maybe several decades, and the task of rebuilding, reinvigorating, reestablishing USAID as a global leader of development policy and practice was the bigger task at hand.
 
USAID has a dual role directing humanitarian responses to crises and handling long-term development missions. When faced with crises such as Haiti, Syria, Ebola that were nearly impossible to predict, how did you prevent those immediate crises from distracting from and overwhelming the long-term development mission?
Partly by recognizing that increasingly, the mission is one and the same. There was a big earthquake in Chile right after the big earthquake in Haiti, but it didn’t destroy Chilean society because of preparedness and capacity and a higher income country being better able to respond. Similarly, had Ebola hit countries with more capable health systems, you would not have seen the explosive pandemic threat that emerged in three fragile West African states.
So one of the things we’ve done is bring together humanitarian and development efforts because we recognize that over the next 15 to 20 years, countries that are fragile — that have been characterized by a weak governance and high rates of poverty and human suffering — will likely be the places from which a lot of national security threats and global instability will emerge. We can protect ourselves and build a more prosperous world by investing in ending extreme poverty.
 
You have been focused on ending global poverty, and you have said it now appears possible. How did we get to this point where it is possible?
Extreme human deprivation has actually been with the world population since the beginning of time, and over the last 15 to 20 years, we’ve seen significant reductions in the number of people who die before the age of five and the number of people who live on basically $1.25 a day. So we have had the opportunity now to look forward.
Today there are about 1.1 to 1.2 billion people that live in extreme deprivation, and that number — if we make the right decisions, if we invest in development enterprise with a focus on results and accountability — could be under 200 million in 15 years, which is what most people define as ending extreme poverty.
 
What role does USAID play in the future to achieve this goal?
A central role: setting the goal and working with partners to create large partnerships so people can achieve the goal. America by definition leads on topics like health, food, agriculture, education. Those are all areas where American investment is far higher than any country in the world. As long as we stay determined to end extreme poverty and are willing to work in increasingly tougher environments such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Northern Nigeria and parts of Guatemala, we can be successful.
 
Every government organization seems famous for its bureaucracy and the difficulty of making rapid changes, but your administration seemed to endorse the idea that development requires innovation. How can a government organization be innovative when faced with that substantial bureaucracy?
It takes leadership, it takes a desire to get something done, a willingness to take risks and a team willing to hold hands and do some unique things together. In my case, we created the United States Global Development Lab which Secretary Clinton announced a couple of years ago in order to make sure the global development fight against poverty has a focus on technology, innovation, science and evidence. I think that’s just one of many examples how it is possible to innovate and be creative and be evidence-based and still be in government if you work hard at it and build support.
 
What do you see as the major challenges for USAID in its future?
I think maintaining a strong bipartisan base of support is always difficult in an environment where people will often look to cut foreign aid because it’s easy to scapegoat foreign aid as a large part of our expenditure. The truth is that for less than one percent of our federal budget, we achieve what Republicans such as Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) and Democrats such as Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) will say is often the best investment this country makes in protecting its own strength and security.
The truth is today, for Afghanistan to have an ability to have a safe transition and our ability for our troops to come home would simply not exist if we didn’t have 3.5 million girls in school and if we didn’t build out the road infrastructure and improve the economic environment that exists there. Things are still tough in West Africa, in Afghanistan, in Haiti, but if we had not stopped and fought Ebola, if we had not invested in girls in Afghanistan, if we had not invested in children in Central America, things would be much worse.

Panelists reflected on racial and class-based inequality in the first event in a three-part series titled “Ignite the Dream: Race and Socioeconomic Class in America” held Thursday evening in the Intercultural Center Auditorium. The event was hosted by the Georgetown Lecture Fund, the McDonough School of Business and the Georgetown Scholarship Program.
Ignite the Dream aims to create a platform for discourse on the intersectionality of race and class in the United States as well as the importance of diversity on campus. Thursday’s event “What is Race, What is Class?” focused on inequality, specifically in regard to the unequal economic system and history of racial injustice in America.
The four panelists featured in last week’s event were reporter Jenée Desmond-Harris, former Goldman Sachs Vice President Julissa Arce, Senior Counsel of the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education Saba Bireda and Georgetown student Ryan Wilson (COL ’12, LAW ’15).
Ignite the Dream organizer Corey Stewart (SFS ’15) said in his opening remarks that the panel sought to provide a space to engage in a reflective conversation on these complex issues.
“It’s simple for us to get caught up in the fray of talking heads and political pundits without stopping to contemplate and reflect and really think about these issues,” Stewart said. “This series is intended to serve as a platform for us all to listen, engage, ask questions and ultimately discuss these topics here and after we depart from this building. It starts with us; it starts with the students.”
Marcia Chatelain, a professor in Georgetown’s Department of History, moderated the panel and began by asking the four panelists about the impacts of race and class on their professional and personal experiences.
Desmond-Harris, Vox’s race, law and politics reporter, said that race has been treated as a topic of anxiety both in her personal life and in her work as a writer.
“I grew up in a mostly white community that was very progressive,” Desmond-Harris said. “But there was a lot of anxiety about talking about race. I grew up thinking that mentioning race was a bad thing, that it was taboo. I found that one of my biggest challenges is that I still bump up against it with readers. Every time I write something I find myself anticipating the comments I’ll get, even if the piece isn’t polarizing.”
Bireda focused specifically on the effects of race and socioeconomic status on the educational system.
“In this country, educational inequity happens along race and class lines,” Bireda said. “Education has shifted from thinking about Brown and the Board of Education to a conversation about kids being cut off from education because they are low-income.”
However, Bireda said that optimism could be fostered in the face of these issues, particularly when considering the increasing engagement of the government.
“We are living in an age where our government has entered the conversation around these issues,” Bireda said. “At the Department of Education I can hardly believe that we are openly speaking about the issues we are speaking about, like implicit bias in the classroom. We are really seeing an unprecedented level of government interaction in this conversation.”
Arce was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico before becoming vice president of Goldman Sachs and then director of development at Define American. Arce drew on her experiences as an undocumented individual and the labels she was confronted with after arriving in the United States.
“I didn’t grow up thinking about race because I was Mexican, just like everyone else in my country,” Arce said. “And then I came here. It’s been an interesting journey to come from a place that’s so homogenous to a place that’s very diverse. And I think that’s what’s beautiful about America, but also one of the things that creates conflict.”
Arce spoke about her work at Define American, a media and culture campaign that seeks to shift the conversation around immigration, identity and citizenship in America.
“When you use the word ‘illegal,’ you automatically dehumanize that individual,” Arce said. “A lot of times when people think of undocumented people they are thinking of individuals who clean your houses, or take care of your kids. They’re not thinking about a Pulitzer award-winning journalist; they’re not thinking about the vice president of Goldman Sachs.”
Wilson said that race and class still remain pressing issues for all those engaged in the current discourse.
“For many of us, making a six-figure salary means we made it,” Wilson said. “But it’s still necessary to remind folks that we need to continue to think about and push these issues even when they move into a new environment, to not slip into the thought that you can have a certain level of education or money to exempt yourself from these problems.”
Wilson said he also saw hope in the responses to recent events that revealed the challenges posed by persisting inequalities.
“But seeing young people not willing to accept the status quo — to not only tweet about it, type about it, but to put our bodies on the line — that’s hopeful,” Wilson said.
Jake Robinson (SFS ’16) said that the panel initiated a conversation important to the university community.
“I’m happy that conversations like this are finally happening in these spaces on campus,” Robinson said. “I think that Georgetown should be pushing more aggressively in order to have these conversations.”

One year after President Barack Obama launched My Brother’s Keeper, an initiative promoting education of young men of color, an initial White House report reflecting on the program’s first year concluded little tangible progress has been made but noted that the initiative has sparked conversations around the nation about how to improve the educational system.
On Feb. 27, 2014, Obama signed a memorandum establishing a presidential task force to investigate ways to give young men of color increased educational opportunities. Additionally, it aimed to encourage investment by ordering the federal government, local governments and private sector enterprises to commit ideas and capital to forwarding the program’s progress. Georgetown University’s Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation hosted an event in August to brainstorm solutions as part of the program.
The 57-page report published by the My Brother’s Keeper task force concludes that the main achievement of My Brother’s Keeper has generated conversation about innovation in education, bringing together local governments, federal programs and private companies to discuss solutions for young men of color.
“[My Brother’s Keeper] encouraged candid dialogues around the country and a greater sense of responsibility among community leaders and young people,” Assistant to the President Broderick Johnson, who chairs the task force, wrote in the report.
One notable initiative sparked by My Brother’s Keeper is the Empowering Males of Color initiative launched in D.C. public schools in January by Mayor Muriel Bowser and DCPS Chancellor Kaya Henderson (SFS ’92, GRD ’07), which targets grants to specific District schools to invest in the education of black and Latino males.
Since September 2014, 200 community leaders, including Bowser and Henderson, had accepted the My Brother’s Keeper Community Challenge to review public policy and encourage new ideas about education for their communities. In addition, private businesses have contributed more than $300 million to the program.
The My Brother’s Keeper initiative intends to boost the number of young men of color entering school with an attitude to learn and graduating from high school with a career or education path in mind, while also reducing violence at home. However, the report notes that there have been no noticeable shifts in such measures of young male minority education thus far.
Alberto Morales, assistant director of the Georgetown Scholarship Program, said the program is too new to see any prominent results and expressed optimism about its future.
“Since it’s only in its first year, education leaders are still quantifying the results of the program,” Morales said. “There is excitement across cities around this initiative because, for years, nonprofit leaders have been working tirelessly around this work, and now they have a nationwide movement.”
The federal government has realigned its focus to utilize more data-driven analysis, which has been featured prominently in the design of the initiative.
Although initial analyses record little movement toward the goals of My Brother’s Keeper, the strategy has been translated into events known as data jams, which gather technology experts, innovators and community leaders to design innovative systems of education to reach young men of color more effectively.
In partnership with My Brother’s Keeper, the Beeck Center hosted a Data Jam last August. During the event, 20 teams worked on new approaches to education, with seven of those teams later presenting to the Department of Education.
Beeck Center Director of Engagement Elizabeth Anderson said the Data Jam was a positive step to involve the community.
“[W]ith that Data Jam, it was about including a diverse set of community partners’ voices,” she said. “[We wanted] to see how we could help boys and men of color increase their access to opportunities for education and success.”
Anderson said that the Data Jams, and the My Brother’s Keeper program at large, have been successful because of their local, personalized approach to each community.
“When you’re setting up any kind of national policy, you have to adapt it to the needs of different communities,” Anderson said. “Anything driven from the top down doesn’t work.”
Outside of the Data Jam, Georgetown programs have not been in regular contact with the initiative. However, Morales said that the goals of My Brother’s Keeper mirror the objectives of GSP, which provides support for first-generation college students or students from low-income backgrounds.
“We don’t have an established partnership with My Brother’s Keeper,” Morales said. “[But] as far as our overlapping missions, they both definitely align.”
Obama’s decision to focus first on young men of color instead of young girls has drawn questions, yet Anderson argued that this emphasis is logical.
According to Anderson, much like the rest of the project, the decision to focus on boys was the result of data analytics, which show that young men of color lag behind young girls in metrics such as graduation rates.
“It’s pretty pragmatic because it’s about the data,” she said. “The data says that [boys are] having higher rates of dropouts and that’s why the focus is on boys.”
Morales noted that the idea of focusing on boys first was also centered not only on improving their conditions in the short term, but also on having a long-term conversation about greater issues of inequality, which would eventually lead into related discussions about girls.
“[My Brother’s Keeper] has created a national conversation on the structural barriers that impact men of color and limit them from reaching their full potential,” Morales said. “[It] now has inspired new discussion on the inequity that women of color equally face.”
The focus on young men of color does not mean it leaves out education opportunities for other individuals, according to Morales, who said that My Brother’s Keeper, despite only being in existence for one year, has already begun to provide a roadmap for other underprivileged children.
“We, as a country, are now turning to the experiences of very diverse populations in education,” Morales said. “Now is the time to act … and ensure that as many people as possible are included in the conversation.”

The District Department of Transportation named the intersection of M Street and Wisconsin Avenue one of the top-three most dangerous intersections in the District for 2013 and 2014, as well as one of the top-three pedestrian crash locations, in a report released on April 1.
The judgment was based on the volume of pedestrian and bicycle collisions and traffic-related incidents in intersections across the District, though specific totals for each intersection were not released. Other intersections at the top of these categories include the intersections of U Street NW at both Ninth and 14th avenues.
Two of the four pedestrian fatalities in Georgetown since 2003 — one in 2005 and one in 2010 — occurred at the intersection of the two major streets. The 2005 fatality was that of Metropolitan Police Department Reserve Officer Joseph Pozell, who was killed while directing traffic. He is memorialized at the intersection.
John Townsend, the manager of public and government affairs at the American Automobile Association’s mid-Atlantic Washington office, ascribed the dangerous conditions to the lack of a Metro stop in Georgetown, the sheer volume of traffic in the area and the large number of pedestrians in the community.
“It’s been problematic for a few years going,” Townsend said.
Additionally, in 2010, the city began allowing automobiles travelling eastbound on M Street to take left turns on Wisconsin Avenue, which can cause conflict and near-accidents between cars trying to beat the light and pedestrians crossing the street when they are not supposed to cross.
Alec Kingston (SFS ’18) said this additional turn is especially problematic.
“All the pedestrians think that when the lights change, it’s their turn — even though there is still a left-hand green signal and the pedestrian light is red,” Kingston said. “People assume that they can just go because the other side of the street is going. I have seen so many people cut it close with cars.”
Georgetown Business Improvement District Transportation Director Will Handsfield emphasized that Georgetown is both a popular retail and tourist destination, saying that each crossing features 20 to 120 pedestrians.
“It needs attention and radical rethinking,” Handsfield said. “There are a lot of conflicts at this one point, and the city needs to do a better job at accommodating the pedestrian traffic, especially at the north-south crossing on the east side of the intersection.”
According to Townsend, the District is taking measures to improve safety conditions at the intersection.
“The city is assigning traffic control officers to help direct the traffic to make it safer for pedestrians,” Townsend said. “It is also important to work with the Department of Public Works and the Department of Motor Vehicles to ensure pedestrian safety.”
Handsfield added that the city is addressing timing of lights at the intersection. On average, pedestrians in Georgetown have only 18 seconds to cross the street.
“The city also has to think about signal timing in the short term,” Handsfield said.
The Metropolitan Police Department, in conjunction with the District’s Department of Transportation, is also looking to install automated traffic enforcement systems as a way to ensure compliance from drivers, discouraging them from stalling in the intersection or running red lights.
Although this innovation will not immediately fix issues, Handsfield stressed that the enforcement systems will improve the situation.
“It means that people will not make the violations over and over,” Handsfield said. “We want to make sure that cars aren’t trying to sneak in among all the pedestrians crossing the street. When we are really busy, it’s not good to have cars breaking the rules.”

Why not incorporate an overhead pedestrian walkway, thus eliminating and avoiding contact of those walking into vehicle traffic.

To provide increasingly specialized experiences for its students, the Georgetown University School of Medicine is adding two new tracks focusing on population health and literature to its curriculum in the upcoming academic year.
Specialized tracks allow students the option of focusing on a particular field, eventually leading to a certificate in their interest in addition to the medical degree in their final year. Declared during the first year of medical school, the tracks are not mandated parts of the school’s curriculum.
The two new specializations, called the Population Health Scholar Track and the Literature and Medicine Track, will supplement the School of Medicine’s two existing tracks that debuted in the 2014-2015 academic year, one of which centers on academic research and the other which caters to students with an interest in social justice and health advocacy.
According to Population Health Scholar Track Director Yumi Shitama Jarris, all four tracks will likely enroll less than one-fourth of the school’s students. However, the School of Medicine is moving forward with plans to add more tracks, including one on global health, for students to explore their specialized interests.
Jarris said the Population Health Scholar Track was developed in response to the increased need to be aware of social determinants of health across different groups within the country’s population.
“Normally when you think of a medical education, you think of the individual doctor-patient relationship,” Jarris said. “Population health is an addition to this — we’re helping groups of people, looking at ways to optimize their health. We need to look at whether or not a person lives in poverty, in an environment that’s safe, if they have access to fresh fruit and vegetables. It’s not just looking at the outcomes, but also their distribution and trying to address health disparities.”
The track accepted eight second-year students and will begin on June 1 with an eight-week summer practicum that aims to develop research skills and familiarize students with the use of population health data. Each student will have both a research mentor and a faculty adviser for their projects.
“Some of them will be doing it with a public health agency or association, in a hospital setting, or a practice setting,” Jarris said. “Every senior medical student has to complete an independent study project before graduation, so these students will continue to work on these projects, which will then become their final capstone.”
Accepted student Jack Penner (MED ’18) said that he was interested in connecting individual clinical medicine with the wider issues of population health through the new specialized track.
“A doctor should go beyond just one-on-one patient visits, and try to make an effort to impact populations as a whole, which goes back to Georgetown’s motto of cura personalis,” Penner said. “I’ve always been very interested in preventative medicine and intervention outside the doctor’s office that can impact patients, and this is a really great opportunity for a first-year student.”
Literature and Medicine Track Director Daniel Marchalik has been teaching an elective course on literature in medicine for the past three years. He said the success of the course prompted the initiation of the new track, which explores the intersection of medicine and literature and emphasizes patient backgrounds in medical care.
“It’s been a whopping success, with probably 30 or so students in the class every year,” Marchalik said. “The students have greatly benefited from it, and I think a lot of them have really wanted to get more deeply involved in literature and medicine. A comprehensive track would give them the chance to pursue a literary project while at medical school.”
The three-part structure of the track, which begins the coming academic year, will consist of four years of the Literature and Medicine course, a capstone and narrative medicine seminars. Students will pursue the capstone with a faculty mentor and present it at the end of their fourth year at a research symposium.
Marchalik emphasized the importance of the Literature and Medicine Track in providing an opportunity for students to explore their interests in relation to medicine, particularly focusing on the importance of understanding narratives.
“What literature does is it teaches students to think about stories in a very particular way,” Marchalik said. “This ability to be comfortable with narratives I think translates incredibly well to what medical students have to do as doctors. For people who love literature, that ability to come together, and realize you have this common interest, especially against the pressures of medical school, I think is very important to have.”
Claire McDaniel (COL ’14, MED ’19) highlighted her interest in the Literature and Medicine Track and the balance it would provide in her life as a medical student.
“On the very basic level, it will help me in communications both with my fellow medical students and with my future colleagues,” McDaniel said. “But I also want to just gain a sense of balance in my life, because medical school is all out, all the time, and I love it, but it can get a little overwhelming. It’s nice to balance it with something completely different.”

Four panelists discussed the legacy of former School of Foreign Service dean Carol Lancaster (SFS ’64) Monday afternoon in the Copley Formal Lounge.
Melanne Verveer, executive director of Georgetown’s Institute for Women, Peace and Security, led the discussion with Berkley Center Senior Fellow Katherine Marshall, Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy Donald McHenry and Global Human Development Program Director Steven Radelet.
Lancaster served as SFS Dean from 2010 to 2014. After being diagnosed with a brain tumor in November 2013, she took a leave of absence before ultimately stepping down as dean in April. Lancaster died Oct. 22, 2014 at the age of 72 .
Lancaster, an SFS graduate, joined Georgetown’s faculty in 1981 and served as a professor of politics, the director of the Master of Foreign Service Program and the director of the Mortara Center for International Studies prior to her deanship.
Vice President for Global Engagement and Berkley Center Director Thomas Banchoff opened the panel with a brief introduction paying tribute to Lancaster. The panelists then began their discussion of Lancaster’s scholarship in development, diplomacy and gender, focusing on how her intellectual and policy contributions related to the challenges of today.
McHenry said that Lancaster applied her rich experience in both the public and private sector into her work and cooperated with others in a pragmatic spirit.
“She used that experience, particularly her scholarship, in her own analysis of not only what’s to be done, [but also] how to do it,” McHenry said.
Radelet talked about his first meeting with Lancaster and his trip with her to the Ethiopian Peace Corps that members of Congress also attended. He praised Lancaster’s scholarly work on international aid and said that the GHD program students in the audience were Lancaster’s legacy.
“What she does in [her book] is systematically go through various donor agencies in the United States, Germany, France and Denmark that she looks through in terms of what drives foreign aid in these countries,” Radelet said. “To my knowledge, it’s the only comparative analytical book on foreign aid structures, on the institutions and politics.”
Radelet also commended Lancaster’s character on a personal level.
“She is one of the few people that I have come across to have the courage, the tenacity, the scholarly curiosity and the ability to just welcome everyone and treat everyone with incredible respect,” Radelet said.
Marshall characterized Lancaster as a committed teacher, a great friend and a leader in the research of gender issues.
“She was really an example that women can do almost anything and she would never have accepted that something could not be done,” Marshall said, “She was at the heart of the generation of women who led the thinking about gender issues.”
Marshall also listed out four unfinished items on Lancaster’s agenda: gender issue as a contemporary and continuing challenge, religion and politics of development, failing of weak states and the issues of ethics in development and diplomacy.
Verveer said that Lancaster’s political contributions saved the United States Agency for International Development in the early part of the Clinton administration and reemphasized her focus on the achievements of women.
“She understood the pivotal role that women played in development, not just in history but also as agents of change,” Verveer said.
Verveer then turned the panel discussion to some of the broader issues that interested Lancaster. For instance, Radelet talked about Lancaster’s early awareness of the institutional impact of policies.
“She was concerned not only about the short-term obvious benefits to save lives, which is great, but also what impact does this have on the broader institutions,” Radelet said.
Marshall said that Lancaster’s fusion of idealism and pragmatism in her study of Africa allowed her to forge advancements in her research.
“In order to move forward in a situation of governance challenges, social challenges, you really had to have the core political compromise and agreement that would allow you to be both practical and visionary,” Marshall said.
McHenry said that Lancaster understood the importance of the delivery of policy.
“She was under no illusion about what had to be done in order to create conditions for the development of Africa,” McHenry said.
Toward the end of the event, the panelists discussed Lancaster’s contributions to the Qatar campus and her unfinished administrative work. The panelists ended by each naming one of Lancaster’s major impactful contributions. The accomplishments that the panelists mentioned were Lancaster’s book on international aid, the GHD program, gender studies, ethics studies and the integration of various programs on campus.
GHD student Matthew Ramirez (GRD ’15) said he came to the event to pay his respect for Lancaster and to learn more about her various contributions in life.
“It was a show of gratitude and respect to be here knowing Carol’s role in the formation of this program, which I am very lucky and happy to be a part of,” Ramirez said. “I knew much less about her before I came. I think it’s been really exciting to hear what a large impact she has had on people, the school and institutions like USAID.”

The Georgetown University Student Association held special Senate elections Friday to fill six vacancies that included two seats in Village A, two in Freshman South, one in LXR and one off-campus.
According to election commissioner Graham Willard (SFS ’18), these vacancies are typical following the election of a new GUSA executive staff, as senators move to fill positions in the executive cabinet. Last week GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) appointed 67 students to their cabinet.
The Election Commission, which also includes Alden Fletcher (SFS ’17) and Pavan Rajgopal (SFS ’14), will host special elections whenever seats are open but said that this will be the only round of these elections this year.
Winners of the election include Mitchel Hochberg (SFS ’15) representing Off-Campus, Avi Rajender (COL ’15) representing LXR, Jessica Scoratow (SFS ’18) and Alex Potcovaru (SFS ’18) representing Freshman South and Alex Barnes (SFS ’16) and Kevin Wilson (MSB ’16) representing Village A.
Turnout was low in the election, which is typical in special elections.
144 students voted in Freshman South, 52 voted in Village A, 19 voted in LXR and 79 voted in Off-Campus. Candidates in the LXR and Off-Campus jurisdictions were uncontested.
Winners officially began their terms after the election results were posted and will serve in the Senate for the remainder of the academic year, throughout the summer and into the first few weeks of September before regularly scheduled fall Senate elections.
Hochberg, who is also involved with Alpha Epsilon Pi and WGTB Georgetown Radio, ran a humorous campaign “founded on no serious issues.”
“I ran unopposed, so winning was more of a relief than anything else,” Hochberg said. “It is still inspiring to know that my fellow students think that I am more qualified than Chicken Madness.”
Hochberg said that his goals are to win GUSA assassins and to have his picture taken with Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Rohan.
Rajender said that he will use his experiences as a resident assistant in LXR to better the Georgetown community.
“Georgetown has given me a lot, and I viewed this as my chance to give back with a positive impact before I leave in May,” Rajender said. “I look forward to converting my conversations with leaders of Residential Living and Student Life regarding the campus plan and construction projects to positive results on behalf of my fellow Hoyas.”
Rajender, who was also involved with Global Medical Brigades before going on to co-found the Hoya Water Brigades chapter this year, said that his time at Georgetown motivated him to serve in the GUSA Senate.
“I wanted to help ensure that future Hoyas can have as great an experience as I have had,” he said. “I’m very honored to receive this opportunity.”
Scoratow said that while she initially viewed GUSA as “an elitist organization,” she was motivated to run for a Senate position after working on Abbey McNaughton’s (COL ’16) GUSA presidential campaign.
“Abbey and Will [Simons (COL ’16)] taught me that GUSA truly does important work on campus and that it has the potential to do even more when motivated, excited people are involved,” Scoratow said. “I decided to run because I love Georgetown, and I think that I have the potential to make it even better.”
Scoratow also said that she is looking forward to getting involved with the campus plan process, ensuring access to benefits for underrepresented student groups, reforming mental health on-campus and increasing sexual assault awareness and prevention.
Scoratow, who volunteers at the Women’s Center on-campus, said that sexual assault issues are particularly important to her.
“While there are certainly some programs on campus related to sexual assault prevention, I think that we as a university could do a much better job,” Scoratow said. “GUSA has the potential to implement programs that could lead to a real decrease in sexual assault on our very own campus.”
Potcovaru, who is also the New South Hall council president, said that he ran for Senate to work on issues beyond the halls of the freshman dorm.
“When the two seats opened up, I saw it as a great opportunity to expand this advocacy outward and represent fellow Hoyas on a different level,” Potcoyaru said.
Potcovaru said that Senate redistricting, the Campus Plan and improving Leo’s are all areas of interest, as well as working with administration on issues regarding curriculum and class selection.
“I recognize that this is a brief term, but it’s still important,” Potcovaru said. “The issues worked on now in the closing of the year will still effect [Freshman South] just like everyone else, and it’s important they have an advocate.”
Like Scoratow, Barnes said that until recently he saw GUSA as an elitist institution that catered only to Georgetown students interested in future political careers.
He said that he was motivated to put his name on the ballot after seeing the “detrimental” effects of the widely criticized 2010 campus plan.
“I’ve come to see that GUSA does have the capacity to serve the student body in an advocacy role,” Barnes said. “Dodging fences to visit friends in Henle … motivated me to be a part of that effort to ensure students have more of a say in the development of our University than our neighbors do.”
Barnes also said that he credits his experiences with the Model United Nations team and the International Relations Club for helping him develop the skills he will utilize in the Senate. He is also a writer for the Caravel and serves as the alumni relations chair of the Delta Phi Epsilon Professional Foreign Service Fraternity.
Wilson said that his role as Student Activities Commission commissioner has given him a better understanding of Georgetown students and the passion they have for a wide range of issues and activities.
“I realized that my previous experience on campus and dedication to students’ rights at Georgetown put me in an excellent position to represent my fellow students in GUSA,” Wilson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I hope to bring those connections with student groups to my work in the Senate.”
Like other election winners, Wilson wrote that advocating for students’ rights in respect to the campus plan is one of the most important issues, in addition to protecting free speech and expression.
“I feel honored that my fellow Village A residents chose to elect me, and I’m looking forward to serving them in the coming months,” Wilson wrote. “I’m looking forward to the opportunity of working with my fellow Hoyas.”

The university’s board of directors established a working group on fossil fuel divestment this month, which will discuss divestment with members of GU Fossil Free and the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility over video chat in preparation for the board’s vote on CISR’s proposal in June.
According to the board’s website, the mission of the working group is to “evaluate the CISR proposal and to make recommendations to the finance committee of the board.” The committee will allow members of the board to specialize on this specific issue. Four members of the group were present at the meeting, including Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs founding donor William Berkley, Mador AG’s Maurice B.W. Brenninkmeijer (GSB ’86), Catholic Health Association of the United States President and Chief Executive Officer Carol Keehan and Cristo Rey High School President Joseph P. Parkes, S.J. The other members, who were not present, are The Carlyle Group Managing Director Peter Clare, Potash Corp Senior Advisor William J. Doyle (CAS ’72) and Selectcom Finance President Shéhérazade Semsar-de Boisséson.
Six GU Fossil Free members participated in a videoconference with four available members of the new working group Tuesday to discuss their initial proposal and how to distinguish fossil fuel companies. Conversations must be conducted over video chat because members of the board live across the globe.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said that members of the board of directors will not comment on the discussions or vote until the conclusion of the process.
“As part of this process the working group will hear presentations from GU Fossil Free and CISR, to provide background on their positions and recommendations,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Pugh, other university officials, including Georgetown’s chief investment officer, will analyze CISR’s recommendations and serve as a resource for the working group’s questions and concerns.”
In January, the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility voted against GU Fossil Free’s proposal for the university to divest from the top 200 fossil fuel companies, and recommended an alternative plan to the board of directors, which included targeted divestment, strategic engagement and the creation of a working group to further discussions on divestment.
Since releasing their initial proposal in August 2014, GU Fossil Free has participated in rallies and other forms of protest. Most notably, the group stormed a board of directors meeting in mid-February and stormed the stage during an event featuring World Bank Group President Dr. Kim Yong Kim to increase awareness about their divestment goals.
During the presentation, GU Fossil Free members explained the reasons for divestment from oil and gas, in addition to coal. In their recommendation, CISR recommended the practice of targeted divestment, which would only target coal companies.
GU Fossil Free member Grady Willard (SFS ’18), who presented at the meeting, said that the presentation helped the group clarify the divestment process to the board.
“We talked about common misconceptions about divestment, so this presentation was a little bit more technical,” Willard said.
GU Fossil Free member Elaine Colligan (SFS ’15), who also presented during the video chat, said that the working group agreed that the university should undertake divestment as a course of action.
“They did not doubt climate change, they did not doubt the moral imperative, they did not doubt the Jesuit imperative, they did not express any concerns about fiduciary responsibility impeding this,” Colligan said. “As numerous studies have shown, divestment does not affect endowments, and if it does it’s 0.01 percent. So there was nothing about ‘Is divestment good for the university? Should we do it?’”
Colligan said that the board’s main concern was the process with which GU Fossil Free determined the target fossil fuel companies in their proposal, but that the board members did not question the value of divestment.
“The issue of divestment was not debated,” Colligan said. “What they did ask was why we used the metric of proven carbon to be emitted in fossil fuel companies’ reserves, instead of reserves to production ratio.”
According to Colligan, GU Fossil Free used the common carbon metric in order to predict the amount of carbon burned over time by the company. This metric universalizes carbon measurements to allow for accurate companrisons.
“Fossil Free Indexes use this metric because it represents over time which companies have the most amount of carbon that they will have an incentive to burn,” Colligan said.
However, Colligan said that she was later informed by the Chairman and Founder of Fossil Free Indexes Stuart Braman that the two metrics would produce the same list of the top 200 companies.
Willard said that he was content with the outcome of the meeting.
“It sounded like they had done a lot of research into the topic and they said that our proposal inspired them to look at the bigger picture of how they could be more socially responsible with [their] investments so we’re hopeful and we’ll see in two months,” Willard said.
Willard also said that he expects GU Fossil Free to continue working closely with the working group before the next board meeting in June.
“We are continuing to have meetings with administrators to get more information on ways we can interact and communicate all the research we have gathered, the knowledge we have gathered, over the next two months,” Willard said.
Colligan said that although the board of directors has not communicated directly with GU Fossil Free on the decision-making process, she is confident that they will conduct a vote on divestment during their meeting in June.
“I am very confident that some sort of vote will come up. They have not given us a commitment, which we believe is unjust in the democratic process and not transparent and we’re not happy about that,” Colligan said. “But indications from higher ups have said there might be a vote. … We got word that the board would probably vote … yes on coal [divestment].”
