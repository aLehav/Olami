Increased diversity and denouncing hate speech are the most effective ways to educate those with intolerant and bigoted perspectives, according to three panelists on the “Educate” panel during the OWN IT Summit on Saturday.
Huffington Post Executive Women’s Editor Emma Gray moderated the panel, which included Council on American-Islamic Relations liaison Dr. Zainab Chaudry, National Press Secretary for the Human Rights Campaign Sarah McBride and the third U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith.
The panelists shared their personal stories about their own education as well as shed light on the role of education within society.
McBride, who became the first openly transgender person to address a majority party convention when she spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in July, said minorities often feel ignored in conversations surrounding mainstream issues.
“Whether you’re Muslim, whether you’re trans, whether you’re gay, whether you’re an immigrant, you often feel lost in conversation, and one of the most common threads that exists across the country, whether you voted for Hilary Clinton or you voted for Donald Trump, is this notion or this feeling of being unseen,” McBride said.
According to McBride, simply listening to all sides of an argument could help to combat current social tensions.
“One of the most powerful political statements that people can make right now is to listen and to make clear that you see people and their pain; you see people and their plight,” McBride said.
Chaudry said her upbringing as an immigrant from Pakistan has influenced her activism, which emphasizes education.
“From an early age being a daughter of immigrants, education was so deeply enriched on my brothers and myself,” Chaudry said. “My parents migrated from Pakistan, and one of the reasons why they migrated to the United States is because they wanted to provide their children with better opportunities of education.”
McBride said the atmosphere of an educative environment is what urged her to explore her own identity.
“When I was in college I came out as trans, and it was through my experience in school, in college, through my experience in being in an educational environment that I was able to have the space to self-reflect,” McBride said. “I think that it is incredibly important to make sure you use education as an opportunity to figure out yourself, to figure out who you are before you go out in the world because there is no better time then to do that in college.”
Chaudry said diversity of thought is crucial to educate the whole person.
“A lot of time we tend to gravitate towards people who are familiar, to what we are comfortable with, but we learn the most from people who are different than us,” Chaudry said. “It is really eye-opening to see that we cheat ourselves out of so much diversity and so much enrichment that we can get from exposing ourselves to lots of people through listening to their own personal narratives.”
Smith said that including as many diverse voices as possible helps organizations yield better results in a professional environment.
“If you have lots of people from different generations working together, you can do extraordinary things together,” Smith said. “The more diverse a team is, the better its results. It’s not just about social inclusion, it’s about prosperity.”
McBride highlighted youth voices as significant, cautioning the youth not to keep silent.
“The common identity that often times keeps us quiet is our voices as young people,” McBride said. “The fact of the matter is that we will be the ones to write the history books of tomorrow, and we will be the ones who decide who was right and who was wrong in this moment, and a lot of officials, business leaders and adults, they know that. Make sure that you understand the gravity of your voice, the gravity of your perspective, because it is a powerful tool.”
According to Chaudry, self-awareness is key to preventing the desensitization to hate speech.
“We must be conscientiously aware of not normalizing hatred, not normalizing bigotry, especially living in a society and political climate where we have become so accustomed to hearing so much bigoted rhetoric that it desensitizes us to some degree,” Chaudry said.
McBride said individuals have a responsibility to stand in solidarity with marginalized communities to alleviate intolerance.
“We need to make sure we are not shirking our responsibility of standing in solidarity,” McBride said. “I encourage you when you see hate speech, step up, speak out and react. You want to educate people as to why they need to reevaluate what they are saying.”

Meaningful change can be achieved in many ways, according to the speakers on the “Organize” panel at the OWN IT Summit on Saturday.
The panel, moderated by Jen Psaki, former communications director and senior advisor to President Barack Obama, focused on the ways the panelists organized movements to spread their cause’s messages.
Psaki shared the stage with National Press Secretary for Bernie Sanders Symone Sanders; education advocacy group Champion in the Making Legacy Foundation founder Lucy McBath; MuslimGirl founder and editor-in-chief Amani Al-Khatahtbeh and Director for Youth Programs at gun control group New Yorkers Against Gun Violence Shaina Harrison.
McBath said activism is the result of working on causes that excite individuals. McBath founded Champion in the Making Legacy after her son Jordan Russell Davis was killed in Nov. 2012, when he got in an altercation over the volume of the music he was playing.
“Since the death of my son, I have began to really speak out against gun violence and the culture surrounding it. Slowly, over time, I began aligning my skills and my passions with this work. So depending on what your feeling of change is, align your skills and your talents with what you are passionate about,” McBath said. “For me, it was making sure that no one else in this country will suffer from this senseless gun violence as my son has.”
Harrison, who has been involved with anti-gun violence groups since the age of 14, said future activists should surround themselves with people who share their visions and dreams.
“A lot of times the people that we love and that we are surrounded by can help identify the ways we can speed and shape things. Don’t be afraid to use what you know to make some changes in your communities,” Harrison said.
Al-Khatahtbeh, who founded MuslimGirl, an online magazine, with the intent to create a space for the voices of Muslim women, said the internet has allowed a new generation of women to open up and discuss important issues in unprecedented ways.
“Because of social media and the internet, we are able to create a space to have the conversations that we want to have. By virtue of that, people started coming to us. We started to have a voice,” Khatahtbeh said. “You can be an active agent of change in whatever space you occupy.”
Sanders said while social media can be a great tool for building a coalition and growing awareness for one’s cause, it is only the beginning of creating meaningful change.
“Social media is extremely important. It is driving what is happening. We should embrace social media and use it for what we can, but we have to understand that we have got to be more than just ‘clicktivists,’” Sanders said. “We have to be more than just social media activists.”

A greater awareness of intersectionality and increased participation is necessary in the women’s rights movement, according to panelists during the “Agitate” panel at the OWN IT Summit 2017 on Saturday.
The panel featured Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), Chief of Staff to former first lady Michelle Obama Tina Tchen and Jamia Wilson, a feminist activist and commentator whose writings have appeared in The Washington Post and New York Magazine.
Executive Director of the Georgetown Institute for Women Ambassador Melanne Verveer moderated the panel.
Verveer said women must work to create change to ensure equal rights.
“If we want to see change in the world, we have to be that change,” Verveer said.
According to Wilson, progress toward gender equity must support all women, not just a select few.
“There cannot be liberation for one of us if there is not liberation for all of us,” Wilson said.
Wilson said intersectionality in the ongoing discussion of gender equality is essential.
“Intersectionality recognizes all of the layers of our identities and recognizes that we’re all inexplicably connected, so there cannot be liberation for one of us if there is not liberation for all of us,” Wilson said.
Tchen said change is most effective when it starts at the local, grass-roots level.
“Change doesn’t happen in Washington,” Tchen said. “It really does happen in grass roots. Change happens in people’s living rooms, in people’s schools, on school boards, in state legislatures.”
According to Tchen, both grass-roots movements and political office will require bipartisan cooperation to change pre-existing systems and make progress.
“We’re going to have to make some compromises,” Tchen said. “Compromise is hard to talk about and it’s hard to lead on because it’s so much easier to go to your corners and just stay there. But if everyone’s in their corners, nothing positive is going to happen.”
Murphy said compromise does not mean giving up your voice or opinion.
“Politics is not a zero-sum game.” Murphy said. “If you identify places where you can be bipartisan does not mean that my voice is going to be silenced.”
Murphy said self-care in advocacy efforts is important to ensure success.
“You need to take the time to invest in yourself as well,” Murphy said.
According to Tchen, supporting other women can be an effective form of self-care.
“One of the ways I get a lot of strength and energy back is to be a mentor,” Tchen said.

Georgetown’s values inspire activist efforts, according to three alumni who participated in the “Hoya Visionaries” panel at the OWN IT Summit on Saturday.
The panel featured disability rights advocate Anastasia Somoza (COL ’07), who gave a speech in support of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in July 2016; Madame Gandhi (COL ’11), a musician and activist who promotes feminist ideals and female empowerment and Yamiche Alcindor (COL ’09), a reporter for the New York Times focusing on political and social justice issues.
Alcindor said Georgetown encouraged her to pursue her passions rather than wealth.
“If you love what you’re doing, it shows. The message I got from a professor here was the money will come,” Alcindor said.
Somoza said doing things differently to others is important to find one’s passions.
“My advice is: do the random thing that you don’t expect to connect or to help you with what you actually want to do,” Somoza said. “I was so resistant to that. I was so resistant to taking the path less traveled, but it will help show you where you’re supposed to be.”
According to Gandhi, bravery, too, plays a role in success.
“We always teach perfection, but we don’t teach bravery,” Gandhi said. “You have to be ready to fail forward a little bit, to be okay with the fact that maybe something doesn’t work out quite how you want it to. But in doing it enough, and I should say it’s your fuel. If you’re doing something that you love, it’s going to work.”
The panelists also addressed their roles in the field of activism and how students should become involved in activist efforts.
As a journalist, Alcindor said she focuses on the stories she is telling rather than consciously looking to spread feminism.
“I go into spaces thinking that I deserve to be here, that I am here to tell a story, and that these stories matter,” Alcindor said.
Gandhi said she aims to promote peaceful, educated discourse on women’s issues through her work in the music industry.
“It is really important for us to go to spaces where feminism isn’t welcome or people aren’t thinking about it that much or they’re contributing to the problem and engage in conversation,” Gandhi said. “It’s for us to accept it and deal with it, and then to equip ourselves to engage in conversations peacefully.”
According to Somoza, the issues addressed through her activism and advocacy are innately intersectional.
“I’m a woman, I have a disability, I’m the daughter of immigrants. I care about all of these issues that are being spoken about in politics and in everyday life. I think the way they all intersect,” Somoza said. “I don’t do one thing or the other because I’m a woman or because I’m disabled or because I’m the daughter of immigrants. I don’t think about these things in silos. They all intersect and they all always will.”
Alcindor said despite progress being made in feminist issues, the work is far from over, especially in light of President Donald Trump’s election in November. Trump sparked ire in October when a 2005 recording of him making derogatory remarks about women, including that he could “grab them by the pussy,” was leaked.
“People are starting to recognize after this election that we have a lot more work to do,” Alcindor said.
