This year’s Senior Auction, organized by the Senior Class Committee, at the Grand Hyatt Washington on Feb. 1 raised $190,000 through auction lots, some of which sold for upward of $10,000.
The SCC obtained items sold at the auction by donation.
“Mostly, we contacted people and organizations who have donated in the past.” SCC Fundraising Chair Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) said.
The SCC additionally received donations from parents of the senior class.
“We reached out to faculty staff, who are wonderful and give some great things every year. Parents give some of the most unique items.” SCC Chairman Cody Cowan (SFS ’14) said. “A family of a student generously donated a week’s stay at a gorgeous villa in Mexico, which I think was the evening’s highest bidding item.”
Some of the top-grossing items included the stay at the Mexican villa ($20,000), an open bar party at Rhino Bar and Pumphouse ($17,000) and an African safari package ($11,000). Other high-bid items included a stay at a Brittany Chateau ($15,000), a party on the Esplanade ($10,000) and a party on the lawn of the Georgetown observatory ($7,000).
In addition to the price paid for the lots, winning bidders will have to provide supplemental materials for the parties, themselves.
“The reservations for the Esplanade and Observatory parties are provided by the Office of Campus Activity Facilities (OCAF). The individuals who won those items will provide the materials, catering, equipment, etc. for the events themselves,” Center for Student Engagement Director Erika Cohen Derr said. “The events must comply with all university policies for those spaces, and the staff from OCAF will work with the families who won those items to ensure that they can effectively use the spaces.”
The auction included a number of very unique items, many of which sold very well. A barstool from The Tombs sold for $3,500 and a set of clock hands from Healy clock tower sold for $7,000.
The Healy clock tower hands were procured when the SCC contacted the administration and inquired about their availability for an auction item.
“We ended up contacting an office internally within Georgetown and asked if they could be an item we could auction off and they sold them to us,” Cleary said. “We had someone who was on the Senior Class Committee who had a contact within a different office in the university who contacted them and asked to see if we could auction them off and they said yes that they could order an additional pair and they would be x amount of dollars, so we paid that.”
Some of the items donated by parents included stays at vacation homes and other experiences, amongst other items.
“We actually had two tote bags made by a parent of the senior class that had little bulldogs and the Georgetown logo on them, they went for a couple hundred a piece, which was very cool,” Cowan said. “We also had a set of handmade Adirondack chairs, which were really great.”
A dinner for eight at Wolfington Hall with Fr. Kevin O’Brien S.J., Vice president of Mission and ministry, sold for $10,000.
“I was grateful for the generosity of the bidders to offer such a high price, even more than last year,” O’Brien said. “This is a gift of the Jesuit Community to the senior class to support a very good cause: making Senior Week events, including the Senior Ball, more accessible for students and their families.”
As part of senior parent’s weekend, the event is meant to raise money for senior week events. This year, 810 tickets were sold and around 400 families attended.
The funds from this year will subsidize senior ball tickets in the form of free or discounted tickets for students who cannot afford the regular price.
The high price of items, however, may discourage some from participating in graduation activities.
“I offered something for the senior auction because I hate the idea of a student not participating in graduation activities because of a lack of financial resources,” Professor Marcia Chatelain who offered a culinary tour of D.C., which sold for $80, said. “If sharing my love of D.C. and food history can help, I’m happy to donate my time.”
The exclusive nature of the event causes low accessibility to students and families. On Jan. 31, Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) published a viewpoint in THE HOYA, “Auction Sells Out the Senior Class.”
Tisa called the event “simply unaffordable,” and stated that the event “prices out many of the Hoyas that the SCC exists to serve.”
However, according to Cleary, the auction serves the students of Georgetown.
“The auction is meant to serve the students of Georgetown, and it does that very well by raising large sums of money to help all students to enjoy senior week later in the year,” Cleary said.
Cowan additionally found the gains of the event to outweigh the consequences of its exclusivity.
“Sometimes you have to have a exclusive event in order to raise the funds to have an inclusive event,” Cowan said. “We raised so much money that we could conceivably either give free tickets to everyone who used to get financial aid tickets to senior ball, or we could double the number of financial aid tickets to senior ball.”

In partnership with the Designing the Future of the University initiative, the on-campus h.innovation group is holding the second annual hackathon, SkillHack, on Saturday, Feb. 15 to address the relationship between traditional learning and the acquisition of skills needed for the workplace.
The ideas generated at the hackathon will be presented at a panel at the SXSW Festival entitled “Designing the Future University from the Inside” in Austin, Texas, in March.
“For the university, the biggest challenge is figuring out what makes this place so special and what are the things that need to be replaced to make it more relevant,” Program Manager for Innovation and New Media Strategy Z. Michael Wang (MSB ’07) said.
University administrative and faculty leadership, including Provost Robert Groves, Vice Provost for Education Randy Bass, Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis and Wang, are tasked with ensuring that Georgetown makes the right changes in order to compete and thrive in the coming years.
“We believe that the decisions we as faculty, students and staff make over the next two or three years will determine what Georgetown is going to look like 20 to 30 years from now. We think we’re at one of those juncture points,” Groves said in a statement on the event’s website.
In the past months, students on the leadership team have been working on the logistics for the event, including the processes of designing and schedule planning.
“The bigger part of planning for us, however, is adapting the model that we had last year and fitting it into this initiative,” Managing Director Andrew Hian-Cheong (COL ’15) said.
The event is centered on the discovery and integration of ideas that confront the challenges that the university is facing concerning academics versus work skills.
After analyzing how the first hackathon went, the leaders decided that changes had to be made in order for it to be more effective.
“We realized where we could have improved. First, all of the ideas were too big. It did not have enough structure. Students also had trouble telling the stories and pitching what they were solving,” Wang said.
The prompt this year is more specific and will only focus on ideas related to the integration of learning and workplace skills.
“We thought, rather than having a hackathon that tackles everything, what if we created some structure within it but also allowed students to be creative within those boundaries?” Wang said.
SkillHack is meant to act as the second event in a series, following the Storytelling Summit that took place last fall.
The Storytelling Summit was created to address the challenges students faced at the first hackathon in expressing their ideas.
SkillHack participant Dan Silkman (COL ’15) did not attend last year’s hackathon, but did attend the Storytelling Summit.
“I expect to re-envision how we interact with the university community and redefine what a college education is supposed to be,” Silkman said. “I took a course last semester with Randy Bass … and we actually had some of these conversations in that class. When I got the invite to apply, I did just a little bit of reading from the email to learn more and I was pretty inspired. I would love to look at what the university does well and what the university doesn’t do well and build on some past knowledge that I have from that class and a couple of conversations that I’ve had just with student leaders at Georgetown.”
The student leaders and administration are optimistic about the event.
“I’m excited because I think it’s something that’s directly relevant to students, it’s not like an arbitrary prompt, or something that might be taken out of your hands or something that’s not really relevant or just a random ineffective product, it’s pretty much based on personal experience,” Director of Strategic Partnerships and Outreach Helen Brosnan (SFS ’16) said. “I’m curious because I think the monetary incentive is great obviously, but I think education is something that people think about in very disparate ways based on your background and where you’re from and income and all that, so I’m curious what people will come up with.”

The Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation will launch today with a symposium, following a $10 million gift from Alberto and Olga Maria Beeck (SFS ’81).
The center will operate under the purview of the Office of the Provost. Sonal Shah, a former economics professor, will serve as its founding executive director, and social entrepreneur and former White House Fellow Mark Hanis will serve as director .
“The mission of the center is at the core of the mission of the university, which is to educate men and women for others,” Alberto Beeck told The Hoya. “The mission of the center is to expand the knowledge of the exciting changes and opportunities that are taking place in the social sector, to expand the knowledge base of students and faculty … and to connect the global actors in the social sector with the university community.”
The Beeck Center is unique in its university-wide approach, which will bring students, professors and community members together to creatively solve social justice issues. Similar centers at Stanford University and Duke University are housed in business schools, according to The Washington Post.
“This is unlike other initiatives because it is for undergraduate students and graduate students, it’s cross-disciplinary and it touches on the entire university, rather than just the business school or the School of Foreign Service,” said Alberto Beeck, who is director of Virgin Hotels and the former president of a Peru-based cement company, Cementos Pacasmayo.
According to Shah, who previously directed the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation, the Beecks are the ideal donors for such a center because of their background in social justice.
“[The Beecks] had been doing a lot of stuff on social enterprise and social impact in the work that they do, and they really thought that it was important for training a generation of students on how to be prepared to be a part of this changing world,” Shah said.
The Beecks’ family connections to the university run deep. Besides Olga Maria Beeck’s status as an alumna, the couple has two children — Leticia (COL ’17) and Matias (COL ’15) — currently enrolled. Alberto Beeck said he and his wife made the donation because of reasons beyond these ties, however.
“[We created the center] because it is Georgetown and what Georgetown stands for in terms of values, in terms of its strength in global reach and in terms of its location in Washington,” Beeck said.
This spring, the center will focus on developing student leadership through issues such as impact investment, which focuses on social responsibility. Shah, who sits on the G8 working group for impact investment, which focuses on how the U.S. government can increase investment in social good, hopes to convene with students about these issues as well as bring policymakers to Georgetown.
“Everybody talks about social impact, but nobody knows how to measure social impact,” Shah said. “There’s a debate taking place, both in Washington and other places, about how governments and others measure social impact.”
While the center’s development team has begun to map out additional initiatives, its leadership wants student input to have a direct effect on the center’s programming.
“We’ll make mistakes. We’ll fail. Our hope is to do it quickly and learn from it, and I think that’s part of what innovation is about,” Mark Hanis, who will serve as director, said. “That seems to be nontraditional … but what we’re really saying is that we have to practice what we preach.”
The Beeck Center team is working on developing university-wide classes that will teach the practical skills needed for social innovation. Additionally, a lab space in Intercultural Center 100 will be available to students who want to develop their ideas.
“If you’re starting a nonprofit or starting an enterprise and you want to come sit and have a place to come do it, you’ll have a place and we’ll bring professors and others to provide mentorship in the process,” Shah said.
Additionally, the team is considering creating a mechanism to provide financial resources for startups. GU Impacts, also funded by the Beecks, allows students to work on entrepreneurship projects in developing countries throughout the summer and will now operate as a part of the Beeck Center. GU Impacts is in its third year and is sending students to six countries in South America and Africa this summer.
The Beeck Center will also sponsor a speaker series focusing on social innovation across public, private and nonprofit sectors. Speakers have yet to be confirmed, but organizers have received suggestions of such leaders as Pete Cashmore, who runs the tech blog Mashable, TOMS Shoes founder Blake Mycoskie and Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code.
“The hope is to spotlight people who are making a social impact. We would like to highlight various areas where there is not just innovation, but where innovation is used as a means to get to impact,” Program Manager for Innovation and New Media in the Office of the CIO Michael Wang (MSB ’07), who helped develop the center and will work there, said.
The team hopes to bring one or two speakers to campus before the end of the spring semester and then continue the series into the fall.
Aside from the short-term initiatives that will be set in motion after today’s launch, the team is working on developing longer-term goals for the center. The Beecks’ endowment provides for five years of expenses, after which the university will continue to finance the center.
One of Shah’s ideas is to put together a “millennial conversation” within the next few years, featuring speakers such as Chelsea Clinton and Barbara Pierce Bush.
Additionally, Shah hopes to develop a fellowship program to attract high-profile nonprofit leaders and other figures to campus for one semester. Shah imagines that these fellows would hold seminars once a week for about seven weeks.
“[The program is] a nice way that is not formally academic, but allows people to participate who might just have tangential interest in these issues,” Shah said.
The center also strives to be a place where the social innovation efforts already underway at Georgetown can convene. Center leaders hope for the involvement of campus organizations such as the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund and the Center for Social Justice, as well as professors who are already teaching classes involving ideas about social impact.
“Social innovation is already happening at Georgetown,” Hanis said. “There are ways that we can better be a glue to the different entities.”

The Georgetown Public Policy Review, the 19-year-old academic journal of the McCourt School of Public Policy, released its inaugural podcast Saturday. The podcast, which aims to be a go-to source for all things policy, discussed a range of issues from violence in the Central African Republic to the current agenda of Mexico’s president.
“The idea is to shed a slightly different light on the issues than what is being covered in the mainstream media,” GPPR Senior Online Editor Kristine Johnston (GRD ’14) said. “The podcast will help us gain more exposure and a slightly different audience than what we get reading the articles.”
The review publishes biannual journals in addition to its regular online content. The journal’s spring edition will be released next week at a Feb. 10 launch party.
“This summer, we transitioned to a website that would allow us to do things like podcasts,” GPPR Editor-in-Chief Kristin Blagg (GRD ’14) said. “Since we have reformatted the website, we have seen a big increase in the number of hits.”
The GPPR also consists of an interview branch, a marketing branch and a fundraising branch that organize different events to raise money to support the costs of the print journal. Meanwhile, the podcast enables the review to reach out to a different audience than that of the print publication.
“This podcast opens it up to folks who want to listen to it in a different format, whether it’s while they are on their way to school or just to get a better sense of what our students sound like, and what our authors bring to the table,” Blagg said.
The podcast, which spans 17 minutes, discusses a range of international affairs.
“I feel like the podcast is your one-stop shop for all policy issues in less than 20 minutes,” GPPR Executive Online Editor Jacob Patterson-Stein (GRD ’14) said. “It’s nice to have someone just tell you what you need to know in an informal conversation way.”
While making the podcast, Patterson-Stein drew on his experience running a radio show during his undergraduate years and his time working in communications for the More than Me Foundation in Liberia.
“I think the podcast is worth it, just for the learning process,” Patterson-Stein said. “There aren’t many opportunities to get to publish something like this and get to make it better without some professional consequence.”
The podcast uses past articles that staffers have written and connects them with a common theme. However, the articles the GPPR staff writes are based on its own interests and passions.
“Often times I find that the best articles come out of the author’s own passion,” Blagg said. “They often say something and have sort of an insight that no one has ever had before.”
According to Blagg, the dynamic between the different staffers allows for a higher level of political analysis than can be achieved in a single article.
“I think the other really cool thing about the podcast was how much they were able to interact and feed off each other’s ideas,” Blagg said. “It adds another dimension to the policy conversation.”
Despite this analytical boon, participants encountered numerous challenges while making the podcast — especially time constraints.
“Finding the time to get the people and equipment in a room for a couple hours on a Saturday is the main constraint but it’s easy to overcome,” Patterson-Stein said.
Laura Bowers (COL ’17) expressed interest in the podcast, highlighting themes she would like to see covered.
“I’d be most interested in listening to podcasts concerning social justice issues, how domestic policy in foreign countries and the U.S. foreign policy affects those issues,” she said.
In the future, the podcast will broadcast once a month and cover topics including domestic affairs, education and healthcare.
“Sometimes, you just want to have your ears do the reading,” Patterson-Stein said.

The Office of Residential Living postponed the implementation of a new housing policy that would affect study-abroad students until fall 2015 after pressure from social media platforms and a Georgetown University Student Association resolution that advocated for recently affected students.
Once the policy goes into effect next year, students who go abroad in the fall will only be able to apply for spring housing.
Director of Overseas Studies Craig Rinker said he hopes the policy, once implemented, will not dissuade students from studying abroad in the fall semester.
“There are many factors which impact a student’s decision whether or not to study abroad,” Rinker wrote in an email. “Considerations for housing are not dissimilar to other factors such as finances, academics, campus life commitments, etc. My hope is that students will find that the benefits of study abroad outweigh opportunity costs.”
The policy, originally set to affect current sophomores, was pushed back after students responded negatively. GUSA passed a resolution challenging the policy, but according to GUSA Campus Living External Board Appointee Megan Murday (SFS ’15), who served as the intermediary between the Office of Residential Living and students, the organization did not have a role in the final decision.
“Truthfully, I wasn’t part of the discussion on this,” she wrote in an email. “There were housing sessions [Feb. 3-7], so my guess would be that Residential Living talked to students then and decided to reverse. The policy started and changed as an internal decision.”
Five students created a Facebook event called “Students Against Restrictive Housing Policy,” which attracted 700 people in less than two weeks. The same students also created a popular Georgetown Roundtables page with 379 agreements. Will Simons (COL ’16), who plans on studying abroad in the fall and helped create both social media pages, said that the original change in policy excluding fall study-abroad students from the housing selection process came as a shock to sophomores.
“We felt that the new policy was unfair to study-abroad students because it unfairly penalized them with housing, especially those who decided to study abroad in the fall,” Simons said. “And we were really uncomfortable with the timing of the release of the new policy … that left people who were completing fall study-abroad apps with only about two weeks to reshuffle their housing plans for next year. It didn’t give us any time to reflect on the implications of the new policy and try to reorganize ourselves accordingly.”
Simons said that the recent postponement accomplished the group’s original goal but that there is still work to do in the future to make more lasting changes.
“We are very happy with that compromise. We understood that it was going to be very difficult and probably unrealistic to get the policy 100 percent reversed and then repealed,” Simons said. “We hope that over the course of the next year before the policy gets implemented, students and the administration can come together and talk about how to make a policy that fits the specifications and the deadlines that the Office of Residential [Living] has set, but doesn’t unfairly penalize students who study abroad in the fall.”
Since the policy will be enacted next year, current freshmen will be the first class to experience the changes. Sara Carioscia (COL ’17) hopes to study abroad her junior fall, but said that she sees the new policy as unfair.
“It’s not fair that I’m being penalized for taking an opportunity that my parents are giving me and that this school is giving me … they’re making it so that you might as well not take advantage of those opportunities. That’s the point of studying abroad in college,” Carioscia said.
Carioscia said her primary concern is that housing is not ensured after sophomore year.
“I’m more concerned about having a place to live, period, since housing is not guaranteed,” Carioscia said. “It’s frustrating and feels unnecessary. I don’t understand the point of it. I am a little anxious about it, because I would like to have a place to live as a junior.”
Despite the fact that opinions like Carioscia’s have been voiced to the Office of Residential Living, Rinker said that the change in policy has not affected student demand for studying abroad.
“Traditionally, Georgetown students have understood the importance of study abroad and have embraced it as part of the campus culture (Georgetown University is one of the leading universities in the nation with regards to student participation),” Rinker wrote in an email. “Our office (the Office of International Programs) has not seen any change to the level of interest in Full Year and Semester study abroad as a result of the new housing application and selection process. On the contrary, student interest remains higher this year in comparison to this point in the semester last year.”
Executive Director of Residential Service Pat Killilee was unavailable for comment.

With the formal introduction of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act on Jan.1, Americans have another option for health insurance. But while the ACA launch has focused on enrolling young, healthy individuals in healthcare marketplaces, few Georgetown students, most of whom are covered under the university plan or their parents’ health insurance, have made the shift.
For many students at Georgetown, knowledge of and enrollment in marketplaces under the ACA remains limited, largely because other options available to Georgetown students are highly comprehensive and competitive.
“I think students are generally not aware of Obamacare and that the majority have just heard about it in a political sense versus what it actually entails,” said Hania El Banhawi (NHS ’16), an intern for a nonprofit that promotes healthcare enrollment.
Within the D.C. health care exchange market, Georgetown’s Premier Plan, which is underwritten by United Healthcare Insurance Company, rings in at $193.75 per month, just under the least expensive ACA plan for customers under 27 years old, which costs $195.04 monthly.
“I don’t know if it’s a thing that [Georgetown students] know about or talk about a lot,” Emily Lett (COL ’17) said.
Georgetown requires students in a degree program who are registered for more than nine credits — or eight for thesis research, law or graduate students — to be covered by adequate health insurance, defined as coverage of $500,000 or more per injury or sickness that is valid in the Washington metro area.
According to Director of Family Medicine and Assistant Vice President of Student Health Services Jim Welsh, the current majority of undergraduate and graduate students remain covered under their parents’ plans, which are valid until they reach the age of 26.
“About 25 percent of undergraduates end up purchasing the university plan, and 75 percent end up staying on their parents’ plan, which drops to about 55 to 60 percent for graduate students,” Welsh said.
Georgetown’s Premier Plan provides full-year student coverage for $2,325 annually, including clinic visits, in- and out-patient coverage as well as mental health coverage. Starting in the 2013-2014 insurance year, United Healthcare began to cover contraception under the ACA’s Contraception Mandate.This includes preventive care and screenings for women as well as Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods.
“The plan that we offer is a very comprehensive plan and would be graded at a platinum level,” Welsh said. “The Affordable Care Act has added some changes that have levelled that playing field in terms of mental health care, which we are historically known for covering well.”
While Welsh acknowledged that the ACA has had an effect on enrollment in the university plan, he said it has not been detrimental to enrollment in the plan.
“As the Affordable Care Act is getting rolled out every year, we are carefully seeing the impact it is having [on student insurance], but we are now dealing with two years of [the ACA] and we are still seeing significant enrollment in our plan,” Welsh said.
Sebastian Nicholls (SFS ’16) was not surprised that the university, with a large population of primarily young, healthy individuals, was able to offer such a cheap option.
“Since around half of the nation’s universities offer student health plans, these are better options for college students,” Nicholls said. “By having a younger pool of customers, you reduce the costs of higher-risk individuals, and the reduced cost allows college plans to offer better benefits for the same price.”
Welsh expressed concerns about students who come to Georgetown with out-of-state, regionally based plans, which oftentimes do not translate to full coverage in the D.C. area.
“I’m using the Georgetown insurance, mainly because I’m an international student,” Banhawi said of her own experience with regional insurance discrepancies.
Amid malfunctions with its online platform, Healthcare.gov, the introduction of the ACA has not proven effective for all participants. David Turer (MSB ’16), who signed up with his parents for health coverage under the ACA, was temporarily dropped from the system at the beginning of the year because of a technical glitch.
“Their paperwork got messed up and they accidently dropped a lot of people, so they decided that they’ll put us back on their plan when the paperwork goes through sometime in February, but for now I am uninsured,” Turer said.
Nonetheless, Lett, who opted out of the university plan because it is cheaper to stay covered by her parents’ plan, speculated that she would enroll in the ACA if she were not already covered by her parents’ insurance.
“I personally would consider it now. There was a point that I didn’t have health care and that was really hard, so I do think it should be available for all people,” Lett said. “I don’t think it’s fair that being sick should cost you that much money if you don’t have [insurance].”
With the March 31 deadline to enroll looming, Banhawi is working with her insurance agency to promote these health care options to the uninsured public.
“Many people don’t know the deadline exists, and many have no idea how to get health care and what options are available to them. A large number of people don’t think they can really get ‘affordable’ care because they don’t know that they are eligible for certain insurance deals based on their living situation, so they just decide not to get insurance,” Banhawi said.
However, Welsh still regards the university plan as competetive with the Affordable Care Act.
“I think that students should look at all options, but my own research this year of the plans available to residents in D.C. shows that our plan still remains highly competitive,” Welsh said.

According to a letter written by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan on Feb. 5, Georgetown is one of 111 elite American universities that may have violated the Higher Education Act by leading applicants to believe they were required to fill out the College Board’s CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to receive federal financial aid when, in fact, they were not.
The PROFILE, which costs $25 for the first form and $16 thereafter, allows applicants to provide a more in-depth account of their financial status in order to qualify for institutional financial aid. This form is separate from the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which is the only form actually necessary for students to receive federal aid.
The 111 universities that have been accused of violating the act include every Ivy League university except Princeton, as well as Georgetown, Duke University, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan.
Georgetown Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said that any confusion about the roles of the two forms was not intentional on Georgetown’s part.
“Students who want to apply for federal aid only should complete just the FAFSA. Those wanting to be considered for Georgetown Scholarship must complete the PROFILE. The PROFILE is only required for institutional aid. It has never been our intention to suggest to prospective students or their families that the PROFILE is required for federal aid,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Pugh, the university has made necessary changes to prevent any future confusion.
“This week we learned that we could make these directions more clear on some of our financial aid websites. cscWe immediately took steps to make sure the distinction between the two forms is clear throughout the admissions process across the university. Our goal is to ensure that each prospective student understands all of the financial aid options available to them,” Pugh wrote.
While Crystal Walker (SFS ’16) did not have any problems differentiating between the two forms when filing for financial aid a year and a half ago, she pointed out the irony in charging applicants for financial aid.
“Even though it’s kind of annoying that I have to pay for this application so I can get aid — it does seem like a really big barrier — I’m still going to pay it because I want to get financial aid,” Walker said.
Chris Kolychkine (COL ’17) thought Georgetown’s financial aid documents were the clearest of any college he applied to.
“I understood completely and clearly that they were separate things,” Kolychkine said of the FAFSA and the PROFILE. “Georgetown … was probably the only school I didn’t have problems with in terms of financial aid because they were clear, crystal clear, every step of the way.”
At the same time, Walker added that the PROFILE fee is well worth the financial aid she has received from the university
“I mean, what’s $25 to $25,000?” Walker said.
In the wake of the accusations, the University of Pennsylvania has reworded the language on its website to clarify its position, according to university spokesperson Ron Ozio.
“To be certain there is no further misunderstanding, we have reworked the language on our website to make this more clear,” Ozio said in a statement., according to Bloomberg Businessweek.
Harvard University, which was also cited in the letter, will not change its financial aid procedure but rather will strive to maintain a clear line of communication with applicants, also according to Bloomberg Businessweek.
“[Harvard] will continue working to ensure that our students have the clear guidance they need to access the federal and Harvard-funded aid to which they are entitled,” university spokesperson Jeff Neal said.

A group of young Georgetown University Law Center graduates is making waves on Capitol Hill. The group, called Young Invincibles, has lobbied for rights and legal benefits for today’s black sheep generation: millennials.
Founded four years ago by then-Georgetown law students Ari Matusiak (LAW ’10) and Aaron Smith (LAW ’10), Young Invincibles is the preeminent youth advocacy agency in Washington, D.C. The organization was inspired by the pair’s desire to represent the interests of people between the ages of 18 and 34 and to provide a means by which their voices could be heard during the healthcare debates of 2009.
“There are so many situations where this generation does not have the voice they should have, and the debates are going on, but it disproportionally impacts [the youth’s] future,” Deputy Director of Young Invincibles Jen Mishory (LAW ‘10) said.
Smith stressed the oft-underestimated importance that the millennial generation can have in the national political discussion.
“There’s this idea that young people don’t care… [but] we understand from firsthand experience the power that young people can have in the political process, and that’s one of the big drivers for Young Invincibles,” Smith said.
According to the organization’s mission statement, the group conducts “cutting-edge policy research and analysis” by sharing the stories of young adults, designing campaigns to educate and inform the public on important issues, encouraging the younger generation to advocate for necessary change and protecting their economic interests.
“We work particularly on three core issues when it comes to economic interest; access to healthcare, access to higher education and access to good employment,” Policy and Research Director Rory O’Sullivan said.
Through Young Invincibles, Smith has had the opportunity to engage with President Obama on an array of topics, most notably job opportunities for recent graduates.
The group’s support has also buoyed pro-millennial legislation in Congress, including the Affordable Care Act proviso that allows individuals to stay on their parents’ healthcare plans until the age of 26. Last summer, the organization made strides in the debate on student loans by playing a large role in placing caps on interest rates for student loans.
“It was important that we got caps in the new policy that allowed for varying interest rates so that those rates wouldn’t get too high for students,” Smith said.
Smith praised the Georgetown Law curriculum for facilitating his, Matusiak’s and Mishory’s involvement in the public interest and about the theory and policy behind law, which greatly shaped the founding of Young Invincibles and the students’ careers.
“That program was amazing. It really had a huge impact on the development of our careers and many of the students from that program went on to do incredible things,” Smith said.
Rooted in the nation’s capital, the organization also supports staff and offices in San Francisco, New York and Chicago. The team hopes to expand further to facilitate more localized impacts through state legislation.

With CVS Caremark’s recent announcement that it would discontinue the sale of tobacco products from its stores by Oct. 1, 2014, student smokers may find themselves with fewer options outside the Hilltop, but will still have no problem buying cigarettes at Corp locations across campus.
One of the largest pharmacies in the United States, CVS has over 7,600 stores nationwide and over 800 medical clinics within those stores, including a location just off-campus at 1403 Wisconsin Ave. NW. The announcement, which has earned praise from President Barack Obama and several health-focused organizations, makes CVS the first national pharmacy chain to stop selling tobacco products.
“Ending the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products at CVS/pharmacy is the right thing for us to do for our customers and our company to help people on their path to better health,” President and CEO of CVS Caremark Larry Merlo said in an official statement Wednesday. “By removing tobacco products from our shelves, we will better serve our patients, clients and health care providers while positioning CVS Caremark for future growth as a health care company.”
Despite the announcement, the Corp will continue to sell tobacco products at its Hoya Snaxa and Vital Vittles storefronts.
“From what I have read, CVS has stopped the sale of cigarettes as they transition from a retail-based company into a full-scale healthcare provider. The Corp’s student-run grocery and convenience stores have no plans to become full-scale healthcare providers, and consequently, have no current plans to stop the sale of cigarettes,” Corp Chief Executive Officer Sam Rodman (MSB ’15) wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Hoya Health Hut employee Annie Coakley (COL’ 16), acknowledged that CVS and Vital Vittles are fundamentally different, and subsequently voiced her support for CVS’s decision.
“There is less contradiction there because they are a grocery store and all grocery stores sell cigarettes. They aren’t pushing it on students with a huge aisle or flagrant advertising,” Coakley said. “I was really interested in [CVS’s decision] … they can’t have a contradictory message of trying to promote wellness while still selling cigarettes. It’s a good strategy on their part.”
Smoker Michael Newton (SFS ’17) noted that, while inconvenient, the policy is a strong stance amid anti-smoking policies that are normally ineffective.
“It’s an inconvenience, because people want products, but it’s a very strong stand in a country with a very strong tobacco lobby. I do approve of it,” Newton said. “I think a lot of other stores should follow, because it seems like legislation such as plain-color packaging won’t stop addicts and the only way to get rid of it is to not provide any product at all.”
The CVS decision could prompt Georgetown students to change their tobacco purchasing habits. Because of the lower tax on tobacco in Virginia, some Georgetown students walk to the CVS across the Key Bridge in Rosslyn, VA to purchase their cigarettes.
“It’s five bucks at CVS and ten bucks at Vittles and around other parts of D.C. because of different tobacco sales tax,” Ruby Hugbee-Velasquez (COL ’17) said. “A lot of people buy at Vittles because of the convenience.”
“It will be inconvenient because I used to go over the Key Bridge to [the CVS in] Rosslyn for cigarettes because it’s a lot cheaper in Virginia. It’s kind of annoying now; I don’t know where I’m going to go … I guess I’ll get them from the Corp, but it’s more expensive,” Isaiah Collins (COL ‘17) said.
