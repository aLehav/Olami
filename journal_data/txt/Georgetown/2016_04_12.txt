D.C. Public Schools faculty and former students discussed the rise of charter schools, the value of mentorship in education and the benefits and shortcomings of after-school enrichment programs at an event titled “The State of D.C. Public Schools,” hosted by D.C. Reads in Healy Hall on Sunday.
The event featured four panelists involved with the D.C. Public Schools education system: Vanessa Noble (COL ’16) and Emmanuel Thomas (COL ’18), both educated in the DCPS system, Allie Liotta (COL ’15), a current Urban Teacher Center fellow at J.C. Nalle Elementary School and Reginald Pearson, a J.C. Nalle teacher.
D.C. Reads Advocacy Committee head Justin Fang (SFS ’17) moderated the event. In his opening remarks, Fang underscored the importance of hosting panel discussions to offer D.C. Reads tutors and the greater Georgetown community more insight into Washington, D.C.’s public school system.
“We wanted to open this up to the general public to show them what D.C. Reads is about, what we deal with, who we advocate for and why we do it,” Fang said.
Fang lauded organizations such as D.C. Reads and Teach for America for their efforts in providing extra attention and support for students.
Liotta, a former D.C. Reads coordinator who now teaches first-graders at J.C. Nalle Elementary School, said she experienced the positive effects of after-school tutoring programs first hand.
“I think [D.C. Reads tutors] are great in terms of relationship building. When my classroom’s tutor comes in on Mondays and Wednesday for an hour it doesn’t seem like much, but he’s working with a group of students who otherwise would not be getting that individual attention from me,” Liotta said. “Even just to have that extra hour each week is something that really adds up over time. It’s a really cool opportunity to have tutors in my classroom.”
However, Noble reminded the audience that because after-school programs are temporary and transient, students may not feel comfortable building deep relationships with their tutors knowing they will only be in their lives for one or two years.
She said that there is still a need for long-term solutions to the systemic problems DCPS faces.
“There’s a discrepancy, I believe, between the care that volunteers are putting out and what that child can receive in return. A lot of these instructors have really great intentions and really want to help these students,” Noble said. “But if you’re going to be in a child’s life for about a year, you’re not going to make that impact and the student is partially aware of that. The student understands that when young professionals come in around age 25, their goal most of the time is not to stay there. It’s a stepping stone in their careers, but as far as making those connections and being received by the students, it doesn’t always go the way it should.”
Nonetheless, Thomas emphasized that tutors and volunteers provide an important source of mentorship for children who often live in challenging socio-economic and familial circumstances. Thomas particularly highlighted the value of mentorship in developing character and motivation in today’s youth.
“The difference between an awesome teacher and a mediocre teacher is the mentorship. You can be very well-educated in your subject and you can teach it well. But if the mentorship isn’t there, then there’s no motivation,” Thomas said. “A lot of these kids statistically come from low-income homes and if they go to college, they’re typically first-generation college students. So they need some kind of motivation outside of the home.”
The panelists further discussed the rise of charter schools, independently-run schools that are increasing in popularity each year. The 114 public charter schools in the District are subject to fewer government regulations and external tests.
Noble spoke of the increasing autonomy of charter schools in the last five years, which has separated them from the public school system.
“When I got to the D.C. Public Schools system I realized education-wise, they weren’t where they were supposed to be, and at first, there was no real criteria for charter schools, you just had to apply,” Nobel said. “There was no difference between teachers, as far as who was an instructor there versus at DCPS. Now they’re trying to privatize the system and you can see a discrepancy between public and charter schools.”
Pearson argued that charter schools are lucrative fields to invest in, causing them to be subject to the influence of city politics and businesses. However, he also cited Friendship Public Charter School as a success story, noting the benefits of a big company’s investment in charter schools.
“Charter schools have been a big success. Friendship is a big, big success. They actually do the work. Their science program, their athletics show that,” Pearson said. “But, for the most part, I still see that it’s now a money-making system.”
The panelists then answered questions from the audience, including inquiries from D.C. Reads tutors about how to best connect with their mentees and make a positive impact on the DCPS system.
Liotta stressed the importance of tutors being aware of the historical context of the schools in which they are working. She highlighted the need to recognize their efforts as part of a community-wide initiative to better educate children in D.C.
“When you’re working in these spaces that are historically segregated spaces you have to be willing to have an open mind and learn from the schools that you’re in and the students you’re working with,” Liotta said. “Be open to the parents, be reaching out to them. It’s not just about the work you’re doing with one student — you are working in a community that has a greater context than you can imagine as one Georgetown student.”

Underfunded and understaffed, Georgetown’s Academic Resource Center received criticism for its wheelchair-inaccessible location, insufficient staff size and lack of visibility in an external review submitted to the Division of Student Affairs in January.
The 14-page report identifies deficiencies and offers 15 recommendations, including expanding the staff, relocating the center, improving technology and increasing faculty education on working with students with disabilities and with student-athletes.
The report, obtained by The Hoya last week, has not been publicly released as of press time.
Sheilah Shaw Horton, vice president for student development at Loyola University of Maryland, and Myrna Cohen, executive director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Weingarten Learning Resources Center, conducted the review from Oct. 28 to Oct. 30 last year at the request of Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, using information gathered from interviews and breakout sessions with students, faculty and administrators involved with the ARC. Horton and Cohen could not be reached for comment despite multiple efforts.
Housed under the Division of Student Affairs in the Office of the Provost, the ARC offers tutoring services and individual consultations and coordinates exams for 846 varsity athletes and around 750 students with registered disabilities. The center also provides assistance with study skills to around 17,000 undergraduate and graduate students.
However, staffed with five full-time professionals to provide academic services for the entire student body — with the exception of the men’s varsity basketball team, which has a separate coordinator under the athletics department — the ARC “has a minimal ability to serve the populations it professes to support,” according to the report.
Olson distributed the report’s executive summary to the Disability Working Group meeting Wednesday. The group, which consists of 30 students, faculty and administrators, aims to address disability rights on campus.
Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17), members of the working group, met with Olson on Friday to discuss the report.
“I’m a little skeptical as to why the full report was not shared at the working group meeting,” Khan said in an interview with The Hoya. She and Fisk received a full copy of the report from an unofficial source prior to Friday’s meeting.
In an interview with The Hoya, Olson said it is not standard practice for the university to release external review reports, and the university has no plans to release the full report to the public at this time.
‘Just Meeting Compliance’
One of the primary concerns highlighted in the report was the ARC’s location, which was described as “inadequate, embarrassing and deplorable.” Located on the third floor of the Leavey Center, the office is described as “not wheelchair friendly” and “difficult to locate.” In addition, the report indicates that the room used for accommodated testing on the fifth floor of the building was only able to accommodate nine students, describing it as a “former closet” and “claustrophobic.” The report suggested relocating the office to a larger space.
Olson said conversations regarding moving the ARC to a new location within the Leavey Center as well as hiring an additional full-time coordinator were ongoing, but that nothing has been finalized.
“We had discussed just where we needed to go certainly prior to that, but the report has helped focus some of our work, so we believe it is very helpful in shaping and sort of helping guide where we go next,” Olson said.
In recent years, the difficulties plaguing the ARC were brought to light through various cases in which the center was unable to offer assistance to students with disabilities. In April 2014, the ARC denied aid to a student requiring an American Sign Language interpreter for a Law School Aptitude Test class sponsored by GUSA, attributing the decision to administrative budget cuts.
Olson declined to comment on changes in funding allocation to the ARC.
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Rehabilitation Act of 1973 require institutions that receive federal financial assistance to provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities. In 2011, the parents of a student at Georgetown filed a complaint to the District of Columbia Office of Civil Rights, alleging that the university discriminated against their daughter on the basis of disability following a medical leave of absence. The investigation resulted in an agreement by the university to revise its MLOA policies.
Olson maintained that the university fully meets ADA compliance. Horton and Cohen’s report cited an anonymous administrator who said, “At a university that prides itself on excellence, we are just meeting compliance.”
Disability Services
The report identifies a lack of sufficient academic support for students with disabilities. ARC Director Jane Holahan and ARC Associate Director Annie Tulkin work with both students with cognitive, learning and physical disabilities and those without disabilities at the main campus and determine accommodations for those students at the Georgetown University Medical Center, while ARC Coordinator of Administrative Services Shannarese Sims provides administrative support.
The School of Continuing Studies and Georgetown University Law Center each have their own academic support coordinators. Last week, the School of Continuing Studies, which has a student population of more than 5,000, expanded its coordinator’s position from part time to a full time, according to Holahan. The School of Continuing Studies’ full-time coordinator will be housed under the ARC, while the GULC coordinator reports to dean of students at the law center.
According to Holahan, the number of students with registered disabilities at Georgetown has increased rapidly over the past two decades. When Holahan joined the staff in 1998, there were around 200 students with registered disabilities, a number that has increased to around 750 students today.
The ARC staff has not increased much with the growing number of students seeking academic support. In 1998, the ARC was staffed with two full-time professionals — which would indicate a ratio of 100 students with disabilities per coordinator. With three coordinators responsible for students with disabilities today, the ratio comes out to 250 students with disabilities per coordinator. In comparison, the Academic Support and Access Center at American University has 19 full-time staff, including a student-athletes coordinator and writing center support.
The report highlighted this disparity, noting “the imbalance that exists between legitimate demands on services and the resources to meet those needs inevitably leads to unintended neglect.”
Furthermore, the report suggests that with the limited size of the ARC, students with disabilities and student-athletes are prioritized over students who also require academic support, such as students from underprivileged backgrounds and international students.
Holahan, however, said she did not find this to be true, pointing to what she said was the more common problem of students failing to reach out to the ARC when they are recommended to do so by professors.
“A lot of people — students — referred here fail to follow through,” Holohan said in an interview with The Hoya. “And I think a lot of the time it’s due to embarrassment, shame; they don’t want to admit they do need this help.”
To address the inadequacy of the ARC’s services for students with disabilities, Horton and Cohen recommended hiring two additional coordinators focusing on learning strategies and accommodations.
Athletic Support
The report also details the lack of academic support resources for student-athletes. While the men’s and women’s basketball teams are each supervised by a coordinator, the remaining 25 varsity teams are monitored by ARC Associate Director for Student-Athlete Services Shelly Habel. The academic coordinator for women’s basketball, Adam Polacek, is housed in the ARC, while Kim Curry serves as academic advisor to the men’s basketball program under the athletics department.
According to the report, several community members suggested that the allocation of individual coordinators for the basketball teams “sends mixed messages regarding the academic focus of these two teams.” However, Athletic Director Lee Reed attributed this to differences in resources for more competitive and visible sports teams.
“We have [teams] that compete and we resource to compete on a national level … and we have some that are more participation sports,” Reed said.
As the coordinator for all nonbasketball sports, Habel works with more than 800 students on course registration, sending travel emails to professors, arranging final exam conflicts and recruiting tutors.
As a result of her workload, Habel is only able to monitor students identified to be academically at risk. According to Habel, she reviews 200 to 300 students’ schedules per semester during pre-registration.
“We have tried to rationalize the work in a way where I am doing more triage than I am day-to-day operations, which is unfortunate because it’s like an emergency room,” Habel said in an interview with The Hoya. “As opposed to proactive, it tends to be a little more reactive.”
The report notes that the ARC is significantly understaffed in comparison to equivalent centers at similarly sized universities, where Habel said “there are multiple ones of me.” The Office of Academic Support for Athletics at Villanova University has five full-time staffers.
“We’ve been working on this for at least two or three years and there have been no changes, at least in terms of reducing the number of teams or adding staff,” Habel said.
Reed said while the athletics department acknowledges the need for more academic support staff, budgetary constraints do not allow for further expansion. Reed also said the department has been hiring graduate students with experience in learning support to assist Habel with her operations.
“For us, just having another Shelly Habel would be very helpful,” Reed said. “We’re not trying to ask for at this point in time another full-time [coordinator]. We don’t think it’s feasible right now. … We’re in a resource-constrained environment like everybody else on campus. What we try to do is provide incrementally the support we can provide for our programs.”
Despite the current constraints the ARC faces, Habel said she hopes that the center will receive more funding to remedy its ongoing problems.
“We’ve been trying to work with the president’s office to indicate the need. It’s an ongoing conversation,” Habel said. “Hope springs eternal.”

YES – We shouldn’t be blaming the ARC for its lack of funding and resources. Its staff works so hard to help as many students as possible. We need to be pushing these questions up to the highest levels.

Notwithstanding the ARC being understaffed and underfunded, as anyone who actually has to use the center would tell you, there are other problems with the center that were not addressed in this article but should have been. Those that run the center are resistant to change and refuse to change a system that is in a technological stone-age. 
For one, at the beginning of every academic semester students with meet with disabilities must meet with Jane Holahan for 10-15 minutes to discuss their needs pertaining to the classes they’re in. This is great and I am thankful for Jane-how helpful and kind she can be and the personal relationship she develops with those she helps. However, instead of letting students schedule a time on a google calendar or online (like most other deans, professors, advisors etc do). She holds office hours for many ours a day for over a week. Leading to lines of people waiting for a meeting or having to just come back another day (even only 2-3 people ahead of you can mean a 30-40 minute wait and if 4 people are there and her office hours end in an hour they’ll tell you to come back tomorrow). This is just one example of an office unwilling to utilize basic technology. 
Another, involves test forms that students must fill out to take tests or quizzes at the ARC using academic accommodations (such as a computer or extra time) or when they need to reschedule due to athletics. These forms must be filed out a week in advance and under no circumstances will the ARC accept an email from a professor or a digital form. Quizzes are sometimes only scheduled  (or rescheduled) a couple of weeks in advance and there are ad. junct professors who only come to campus once or twice a week (or not at all if holidays or sickness get in the way) sometimes making it difficult or impossible to get a physical signature in the timeframe they want. There’s no reason not to have a digital version of the form (on hoyalink, google docs etc) or just accept emails other than unwillingness. (And anyone who has dealt with them can tell you how they are not particularly nice or flexible when you have an issue like this).  
People will always argue their office in understaffed and even if it is true in this case the ARC still has room to improve its use of the resources it currently has.

With over 100 speakers and 800 attendees, the third annual OWN IT Summit hailed women’s leadership through a day of lectures, interviews and breakout sessions in Gaston Hall on Saturday.
OWN IT was founded in 2014 by Helen Brosnan (SFS ’16) and Kendall Ciesemier (COL ’15), and has expanded to seven campuses since its inaugural summit. This year’s summit, sponsored by Bloomberg LP, was organized by a team of 29 undergraduate Georgetown women.
University President John J. DeGioia, in his introduction of the event, praised OWN IT as a forum for discussion and learning from women of all backgrounds.
“OWN IT is meeting a need and providing a setting for our community to come together alongside leaders who are meeting the challenges of our world with courage and determination,” DeGioia said. “It’s a testament to the strength of the university’s commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive campus culture in which women are able to learn, grow and thrive.”
This year’s summit co-chairs, Allyn Rosenberger (NHS ’17) and Soraya Eid (MSB ’17), said in their welcome that OWN IT provides a space for young women to talk about the issues they face. The co-chairs also issued a challenge to summit attendees.
“As you engage with the speakers and each other today, I challenge you to listen to each other’s stories,” Eid said. “Learn from them and walk away with a renewed understanding of how you own it.”
Co-Anchor of “CBS This Morning” Norah O’Donnell (COL ’95, GRD ’03), a member of the OWN IT Advisory Board, interviewed Olympian and World Cup soccer champion Abby Wambach for the keynote presentation.
Wambach, who has scored more international goals than any man or woman in the history of soccer, was charged with driving under the influence in Portland, Ore., a week prior to the summit. Wambach said it is important to own her mistake.
“Life is tricky and it’s not easy. No matter what you do or where you get to, everyone has to put their pants on the same way each day. I made a mistake, but I’m owning it,” Wambach said. “As a human being, we make mistakes. It’s never about what you do in terms of that mistake, it’s about how you handle it and what you do in the moments afterwards.”
Since her retirement, Wambach has tried to focus on broader women’s issues for which she did not advocate while playing as a USWNT soccer player. Wambach said she hopes other women can use their positions of authority to influence the world for good in ways she could not because of her focus on playing soccer.
“When I became a retired person, I started to get angry at myself a little bit. I didn’t push the envelope in certain ways, like the gender pay gap,” Wambach said. “That’s why I’m speaking to students, because it’s not me that’s actually going to change the world. What actually impacts and change the world is the next generation. It’s you guys.”
Five of Wambach’s former USWNT teammates recently filed a wage-discrimination action against the U.S Soccer Federation. While the women’s team won 2 million dollars for winning the World Cup, the men’s team made 9 million dollars without advancing past the early rounds.
“This is a conversation that’s been evolving for so long. Now women who are coming out of college feel like they deserve to be treated equally,” Wambach said. “I think it’s amazing that these women are taking these steps.”
The breakout sessions, where attendees could choose from panels, workshops and office hours, followed the morning panels and keynote. Workshops included resume-building, public relations and communications, such as “Success Under Stress” and “Women in the Political Arena.”
Office hours for speakers constituted the smallest breakout offering and were capped at 10 people. These interactions were intended to foster personal discussion between attendees and speakers, who reflected a wide variety of industries, including fashion; diplomacy, and science, technology, engineering and math.
Deputy Administrator of NASA Dava Newman said in “The Future of Science and Technology” panel that young women interested in following her path into a STEM field should be comfortable with failure. According to Newman, learning how to fail correctly is an important part in learning to succeed later.
“When you’re designing and building, just try, try, try,” Newman said. “Just try a whole bunch of crazy concepts, the crazier the better, and then somehow be comfortable with failure. Because if we fail here, then next time we’re going to do it better.”
Pandora Chief Operating Officer Tracey Griffin said in the “Entrepreneurial Leaders in Fashion, Style, and Design” breakout session that having strong role models to mentor women entering a certain industry — which Griffin did not have — is an important part of allowing them to succeed.
Griffin cited passion for their professions and a drive to change as the most important traits women can have in any industry.
“The one thing that’s fun about fashion is there’s lots of women in the industry. If I reflect on my career in the early days of investment banking, I was the like the only woman in the high-yield group,” Griffin said. “And then I look at where I am now at Pandora, and our executive team is more than 50 percent women.”
Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow, the co-founders of the “Call Your Girlfriend” podcast, which discusses pop culture and politics, hosted the final panel moderated by professor Marcia Chatelain, the host of “Office Hours: A Podcast.”
Friedman stressed the importance of women connecting with each other.
“The secret’s out: Women make great friends,” Friedman said. “When you think about someone, just get in touch with them in that moment.”
OWN IT volunteer Ida Adibi (COL ’19) said the most rewarding aspect for those involved in planning the summit was not the presentations themselves but rather being able to spread the summit’s message.
“As a volunteer, you don’t get to actually watch the show,” Adibi said. “But the best part of being a volunteer is watching it all come together, and seeing how your role really helps put everything into place.”
Aiden Johnson (COL ’19), who attended OWN IT, said he was impressed by the scale and reach of the summit.
“I didn’t really understand or appreciate the grand scale of how big this was or how powerful it was until I was sitting down watching all these people speak and watching Gaston fill up,” Johnson said. “It’s amazing that Georgetown has something like this, and I hope it keeps going in the future.”

The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board recently lifted Georgetown’s 27-year-old restaurant liquor license moratorium, allowing establishments in the District to begin applying for licenses April 11.
The decision will not affect the limit of liquor licenses for nightclubs and taverns, which remains at six, because of a separate Washington, D.C. law that cannot be amended or rescinded by the ABC Board.
The moratorium was implemented in 1989 in response to noise and vandalism complaints from Georgetown residents regarding patrons of establishments that were permitted to sell alcohol.
The moratorium capped the number of restaurants that could attain a class C/R license, which permits the sale of beer, wine or spirits on premises. The only way for a new business to obtain a license was to purchase one from another restaurant, at prices that could run upward of $10,000.
Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration Public Information Officer Jessie Cornelius said the ABC Board took into account public opinion and current neighborhood conditions in its decision to lift the moratorium.
“A hearing was held by the Board to receive public comment on Feb. 24 and written comment was accepted on the issue through March 4,” Cornelius wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Input received from Georgetown community and business groups supported lifting the cap on restaurant licenses because the issues of noise, trash and vandalism — which were the original catalysts for the moratorium — had improved.”
The recent change in regulation is largely due to support given by the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, which represents Georgetown, to lifting the moratorium.
Advisory Neighborhood Commissions are advisory boards that provide official citizen representation to governmental bodies. There are 47 commissions in the District run by volunteer commissioners who are popularly elected and serve two-year terms. The Georgetown commission specifically reviews all development in the historic district as well as all liquor licenses.
Vice Chair of ANC 2E Ed Solomon expressed support for the end of the moratorium, stating that it reflects a balance between restaurants and stores in the neighborhood.
“The time was right. The moratorium was enacted at a time when the community felt that there had to be some type of control on what was happening 25 or so years ago,” Solomon said. “Now we have a good mix of retail and restaurants here and we would like to see new restaurants come in that the community would support as well as the rest of the city.”
Bill Starrels, another ANC 2E vice chair, said the decision reflects a significant change in the past 27 years — drinking ages are now uniform at 21 years old in the wider District area, which was not the case before the moratorium was enacted.
“To have a beer back then across the Key Bridge you had to be 21 years old, but you could come across the bridge into Georgetown and only be 18 years old to have a beer,” Starrels said. “If you look at the history in terms of where things were with the drinking age and the also demographics you’ll see why it made sense for the moratorium to be set years ago and today it is not that needed.”
Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington legal counsel Andrew Kline said the time had come for the ban to be lifted.
“There was generally support for the lifting of the moratorium this time around. There was a realization by the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and from those in the community that it was serving no purpose,” Kline said. “I don’t think it will change much. There were many licenses not being used that were still available.”
Tom Birch, a third ANC 2E vice chair said the end of the moratorium will not necessarily result in an immediate influx of new restaurants and bars to the neighborhood.
“I expect that we are not going to see an immediate change overnight because all of this takes time,” Birch said. “They can get a liquor license just by applying for it, but they are going to have to find a place to locate and get the capital together and have a business plan and so forth.”
Birch said he hoped that the end of the moratorium will bring positive change to the neighborhood.
“I do think that it is going to create more of a community of really high-quality restaurants,” Birch said. “It’s great that the whole community is so interested in what has been happening, and what’s so important is that the business community and the residential community were in absolute agreement on this issue and came together to work out a solution.”
Solomon emphasized the benefits of lifting the moratorium on Georgetown’s restaurant scene and business community.
“We look forward to the opportunity we are giving to many of the new chefs and entrepreneurs to come to Georgetown,” Solomon said. “It’s going to be a win-win for the residents, the tourists and the businesses, and I think that it will give especially the local community an opportunity to see new restaurants come into our community.”
Restaurateur Ian Hilton, owner of the French bistro Chez Billy Sud on 31st Street, said the end of the ban will attract new businesses to Georgetown, benefitting the neighborhood as a whole.
“The lifting of the moratorium will likely draw more restaurants into the neighborhood. I think everyone knew it would pass. I think it’s a good thing,” Hilton said. “Restaurant operators will look at Georgetown who might not have done so in the past.”

Dr. Ernest Moniz defended the Iran nuclear deal and argued for a renewed push toward green energy technology at the 2016 Trainor Lecture and Award in the Intercultural Center on Monday.
Hosted by the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, Moniz was honored for his role in the Iran nuclear negotiations and awarded the 32nd Jit Trainor Award for distinction in the conduct of diplomacy.
Moniz participated in the P-5+1 talks between the permanent United Nations member states, China and the European Union as a part of the American-led international delegation working toward a plan to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
The nuclear agreement requires Iran to roll back its nuclear program and imposes a verification system to ensure it does not initiate new efforts to obtain a nuclear device, in exchange for lifting sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy since 1996. Former Ambassador to Yemen and Director of the ISD Barbara K. Bodine welcomed the audience before introducing School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman, who praised Moniz as a scientist serving the nation and one of the first scientists to win the Trainor Award.
“The transnational challenges we are facing go beyond the capacity of any single nation-state to solve,” Hellman said. “Individually and as the head of the Department of Energy, he really epitomizes the role of science in the service of the national interest and global community.”
Moniz emphasized the long, active role in diplomacy that the Department of Energy has played over the years, balancing multiple responsibilities including nuclear security and climate change.
“[The DOE] is sometimes referred to as the Department of Weapons and Windmills, Quarks and Quagmires because of the nuclear security responsibilities and clean energy, particularly climate change,” Moniz said. “It is the largest supporter of the physical sciences in the United States and we operate the key facilities like accelerators and resources that serve over 30,000 scientists each year to do their work.”
Moniz said he worked to build trust with Iranian scientists based around their work as scientists in negotiations.
“We had to go through a myriad of trade-offs, but the important thing is that a relationship of trust was built up at the scientist-to-scientist level,” Moniz said. “This did not in any way diminish our responsibility to achieve our core objectives, but it was built upon a trust in which we felt what was being discussed was always an honest proposition.”
Moniz said he was proud of the progress that he achieved through these negotiations.
“Until recently, the major focus was on eliminating their plutonium capability, which would come from a rack reactor that was under construction. It would produce more than enough plutonium for a bomb a year. The discussion was all around who would bomb it when. That was what was in the news,” Moniz said. “Today, the core of that reactor has been filled with cement as a result of the negotiations. Sounds to me like a better outcome.”
According to Moniz, criticism surrounding the deal tends to focus on what the deal does not do, instead of what it accomplishes.
“It did not stop arms transfers to Hezbollah, it did not solve the Houthi problem, it did not solve the missile problem. That was a choice made years ago that a manageable negotiation would be attempted,” Moniz said. “It’s very similar to what President Reagan did in the 1980s in negotiating arms control separate from all of our other problems with the Soviet Union.”
Following Moniz’s lecture, ISD Board Chairman and Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering moderated a question-and-answer segment, which featured questions ranging from potential plans for the United States to begin a fuel-leasing program to the roles Georgetown students play in combating climate change.
Maria Ciacci (SFS ’18) said she enjoyed listening to Moniz’s explanation of the Iran deal.
“I thought it was really informative. I like that he kept it basic enough for anyone that’s not necessarily in the field to understand,” Ciacci said. “He was really thorough with the history of his field as well as the Iran deal, and it was easy to understand and really see the intersection of diplomacy and science.”
Will Hallisey (COL ’16) also praised the secretary’s explanation of the DOE’s responsibilities.
“My dad does energy investing and so I know a little bit about this stuff, but it’s a brave new world because you have to figure out a world where there’s a cohesive interconnection of energy opportunities,” Hallisey said. “Someone talked about oil in developing countries, they mentioned it’s the department of weapons and they really do have a very encompassing job. His expertise is very encompassing as well.”
Hallisey said the lecture clarified his understanding of the Iran nuclear talks.
“You get the sound bytes on TV of the less educated point of view, but the fact that he is fundamentally assured of his position because he’s so educated, exactly what it takes for a country to have a nuclear weapon,” Hallisey said. “I think that’s what was one of the most important parts because you really do realize how extensively affected these people, these individuals.”

In a surprise reversal on his previous stance, D.C. Superior Court Judge Maurice Ross ruled April 4 to uphold the D.C. Board of Elections’ approval of an increased minimum wage measure last July, greenlighting activists’ efforts for a $15-per-hour minimum wage to be put to vote in a District ballot this November.
The decision marks a victory for advocates pushing for an increase to $15 from the current $10.50 minimum wage. Proponents of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2016” must now collect signatures from 5 percent of the city’s registered voters, including 5 percent each of five different wards, by July in order to include the issue on the ballot.
If approved by public vote on the ballot, which is scheduled to take place Nov. 8, the initiative would increase the District’s minimum wage annually until it reaches $15 in 2020. Following this, the wage would rise depending on changes to the cost of living.
Co-Chair of the D.C. for $15 campaign and Director of D.C.’s Working Families Party Delvone Michael said the campaign had garnered roughly 200 of the 25,000 required signatures as of April 8.
Michael expressed confidence in the feasibility of passing the initiative, citing a Washington City Paper January 2016 poll indicating that roughly 87 percent of the D.C. electorate supports a minimum wage hike to $15.
“D.C. is one of the most expensive cities in the country to live in and people shouldn’t work 40 hours and not afford to live in that same city,” Michael said. “The average cost of an apartment in D.C. is $2,000 a month. That means even if you make $15 an hour right now, there are lots of places that won’t even take your application for an apartment. We’re a better city than that, and we can do better.”
Michael estimated that the measure would benefit roughly 100,000 workers currently earning below a living wage.
“I think the leading economists agree that $15 is safe, that it would not have an adverse impact on the economy and actually helps spur the economy,” Michael said. “D.C. might be the capital of the nation, but without a living wage it cannot be the capital of equality.”
The judge’s decision on April 4 came after plaintiff Harry Wingo, then-D.C. Chamber of Commerce president who resigned in December, filed a lawsuit against the BOE last August alleging the ballot measure was invalid because two of the three board members’ three-year term limits had already expired when they approved the initiative.
Although Ross’ ruling this January invalidating the ballot initiative indicated that he favored Wingo’s case, the judge found in last week’s decision that there is legal precedent for board member holdovers to act until their successors are nominated.
Local attorneys Michael Bennett and Michael Gill replaced the two members with expired terms and were sworn in to the board after receiving D.C. Council approval April 5.
According to BOE spokesperson Margarita Mikhaylova, the initial lawsuit focused on the board members’ term lengths but in reality took issue with the substance of the initiative itself.
“We have all new members on the new board, so the case is really a moot point,” Mikhaylova said. “The case was not really brought because of board members’ terms, but because of the language of the ballot measure.”
D.C. Courts Media Director Leah Gurowitz said the D.C. Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits statements on pending cases.
Wingo declined The Hoya’s request for comment.
Georgetown law’s Center of Poverty and Inequality Director Peter Edelman echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the benefits of an increased minimum wage.
“If [the question is] whether I think that’s too high and will cause a big loss in jobs, the answer is no,” Edelman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “With few exceptions, economists believe that an increase of this amount will not have substantial negative effects.”
The wage hike follows years of incremental minimum wage increases in D.C. Beginning July 1, 2014, the District’s minimum wage jumped from $8.25 to $9.50 after the D.C. Council passed the Minimum Wage Amendment Act of 2013. The law established a series of $1 rate increases to be enacted on July 1 each year until the cap of $11.50 is reached later this year.
Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) also expressed support for raising the city’s minimum wage to $15 by 2020 in her state of the District address March 22.
“With grocery bills, childcare and eldercare, transportation costs and the other expenses of everyday life, an hourly minimum wage of 11 dollars and 50 cents will only stretch so far,” Bowser said in the address. “Low wages create an invisible ceiling that prevents working families from truly getting a fair shot.”

428 students, or 5.63 percent of the student body, voted in the Georgetown University Student Association senate elections Thursday, an increase from last year’s special election’s 294 student turnout.
Habon Ali (SFS ’18) won the At-Large seat, Musa Bassey (COL ’18) won the Southwest Quad seat, Andrew Granville (MSB ’17) won the Village A seat, Andrew Tabas (SFS ’16) won the Townhouses seat, and Marcus Leanos (MSB ’17) won the Village B/Nevils seat. All open seats were filled.
The Townhouses and Village B seats were uncontested, while Southwest Quad had three candidates. Two candidates ran for the Village A seat and one candidate ran for the At-Large seat.
The townhouses saw the lowest turnout rate, with 13 voters, while the Southwest Quad saw the highest turnout with 54 voters.
GUSA Election Commissioner Alden Fletcher (SFS ’17) said both turnout and candidacy rates are typically low for upperclassmen districts.
“You definitely see a drop off in participation as you get to the districts that represent primarily upperclassmen,” Fletcher said.
Fletcher said the election reform bill, which was recently passed by the GUSA senate and mandates the placement of three write-in slots on the ballot following this year’s last-minute addition of write-in slots to the executive ballot, did not have a significant impact on this election.
“So it’s good because now we actually have sort of a fixed amount, there’s no ambiguity about write-ins, how many can we have, so the election procedure’s been modified not during the middle of the election, which was primarily what we objected to during the exec,” Fletcher said. “The effect of having three on the ballot wasn’t a huge consequence, just because we had so few votes this election that it wasn’t an issue.”
Bassey wrote he was particularly disappointed by the low voter turnout.
“I’m humbled that the students found me to be the best candidate for this position. That being said, I’m disheartened by the turnout. Even if people had voted against me, I would have liked to see at least 60 percent turnout, not the abysmal level we got here,” Bassey wrote in an email to The Hoya (full disclosure: Bassey is a former columnist for The Hoya).
Bassey wrote that he hopes to advance GUSA’s image during his term.
“There are a good amount who are disillusioned because the organization operates more like a club than a representative, elected government. In my duration, I’d want to see more engagement of the student body going forward, as well as helping create the image of GUSA as a net good on campus,” Bassey wrote.
Tabas, who ran a spur-of-the-moment write-in campaign the day of the elections, said he hopes to get involved with the campus plan during his time in the senate.
“But then also I think people have been talking a lot about the campus plan. And it’s something that’s important to me, I think it’s kind of ridiculous that we’re being forced to build like a million new dormitories and house people in the hotel and all this stuff,” Tabas said. “It’s been amazing living in a townhouse, and I think that future students should also have that opportunity.”
Granville said he chose to get involved with GUSA to learn more about student government. He said he hopes to address the cleanliness of Village A over the course of his term.
“With Village A I think one of the biggest issues is the rooftop trash, and people struggle a lot of the time on the weekend to pick it up. I think it’s important to make sure that people on the rooftop all pick up their trash to make sure that the rooftop looks nice and clean,” Granville said.

The My School D.C. Lottery matched a lower proportion of its 21,208 overall applicants to schools this year, according to results released April 1.
This year the program received 1,000 more applicants. The lottery saw a decrease in the proportion of applicants it was able to match from 72 percent last year to 70 percent this year.
The My School D.C. Lottery was launched two years ago to address a series of complaints from District parents that the old lottery program, in which individual schools held their own lotteries, was difficult to navigate.
Schools voluntarily take part in the current District-wide system, with 96 percent of D.C.’s public schools currently participating in the lottery.
My School D.C. Executive Director Catherine Peretti said the new lottery program was established in response to the challenges posed by the old system.
“[The new lottery] came into existence because the number of schools in the lottery was growing at a fairly rapid rate. It was becoming complex for families to navigate disparate timelines and different applications, some of which were on paper and some which were online,” Peretti said. “In both the public charter sector and in the D.C. public schools out-of-bound lottery it was becoming too difficult for parents.”
To sort students into schools, the lottery relies on a matching algorithm developed by the Institute for Innovation in Public School Choice, an organization specializing in school choice systems that is based on the work of Nobel Laureate economist Al Roth.
Though the lottery system is random in that there is no advantage to applying first, it does incorporate preference. Students are matched to schools based on measures such as the number of available spots at each institution, proximity to the student’s residence and the applicant’s own ranking of school choices.
To apply to the lottery, students and parents must create a family account and provide basic information, such as the student’s identification number and proof of D.C. residency. Through this account, parents can pick up to 12 traditional or charter schools as their top choices. Additionally, students may apply to any of DCPS’s six selective schools, which admit applicants based on specific eligibility requirements and require essays or letters of recommendation.
From 2014 to 2015, the lottery program saw large increases in the length of its waitlist, where students are placed if they are not matched with either of their top choices or any schools. Waitlists for traditional schools surged by 25 percent, while those for charter schools rose by 18 percent in 2015, according to The Washington Post.
This year, however, with the addition of several new programs, including the provisionally titled Empowering Males High School — the District’s first all-male public high school — the lottery saw a more moderate 11 percent increase in its waitlist numbers.
Montessori and other specialty schools have drawn larger demand, with the waitlists for the Mundo Verde Bilingual School and the Twin Rivers Public Charter School containing over 1,000 students each.
McCourt School of Public Policy Associate Professor Nada Eissa, who specializes in public policy and economics, said the lottery effectively communicates information about which schools are doing well based on their desirability.
“What [the lottery] has provided the school system is a very strong signal of which schools are succeeding and which are not, which schools parents value and which schools they do not,” Eissa said. “The value of the DCPS lottery is exactly that — the signal it provides to the system and the administrators.”
D.C. Public Charter School Board Associate Communications Specialist Sara Maldonado said the demand for specific schools echoes the talk she has heard in the DCPS community.
“One of the things that we’ve heard in the community is that there is demand for language immersion schools,” Maldonado said. “The waitlist information is also showing that there is growing demand for pre-K and other specialty programs.”
According to Maldonado, the lottery program also aims to increase educational equity in the District. Despite spending nearly $30,000 per student, the District had a reading proficiency rate of 17 percent among its students, according to data released by the National Center for Education Statistics in 2014.
Peretti said that the lottery reduces barriers to educational access through a centralized application that provides easily accessible, multilingual information. Peretti emphasized the program’s aim to make it easier for students and parents to apply regardless of ethnicity or socio-economic status.
“In general, we strive for an equitable way to allow families to access schools of choice in the District,” Peretti said.
Adam Barton (COL ’16), a member of D.C. Schools — a language tutoring program for youth and adults from immigrant backgrounds — said the District struggles to provide equal access to language learners, or students for whom English is not a first language. Barton said that these students and their families have more difficulty navigating the lottery process, but highlighted improvements in outreach.
“[Language learners] have to navigate extra hurdles just to get into the lottery process,” Barton said. “I would be really surprised if there were no issues of racial disparities, but based on data I’ve seen, it seems that, in outreach, they’re doing a really good job.”
Aidan Thaggard (MSB ’19) said the lottery program aids the crucial goal of improving education to help all students, regardless of socio-economic status.
“The idea of improving education should be the ‘a rising tide lifts all boats’ idea where you don’t just cater to the overtly disadvantaged or the overtly advantaged, but you bring everyone up through whatever programs are functional for that,” Thaggard said. “By stratifying school programs, specifically through concentrating the higher level kids in some schools and, inevitably, the lower level kids in other schools, it’s going to be a lot harder to unilaterally bring students up.”

One for Georgetown, an annual philanthropic effort led by the 1634 Society, returned for its second year with more events and a $100,000 matched donation to endow scholarships April 4. A one dollar donation to the One for Georgetown campaign allows students access to several events with food and prizes.
The 1634 Society is a student-led organization working with the university’s Office of Advancement to educate students about philanthropy and service while connecting them with Georgetown alumni.
The 1634 Society has used the One for Georgetown campaign in the past to build student engagement in fundraising and community. This year, the group established the One for Georgetown Scholarship, which will fund four $25,000 scholarships through an anonymous alumni donor.
The group aims to see 35 percent participation among freshmen, sophomores and juniors. All the proceeds from student donations will be added to the scholarship in addition to the previously secured $100,000 donation.
When the One for Georgetown initiative was founded, the campaign lasted one week and was directed only toward freshman. The following year, the 1634 Society hosted a separate program called 4 for 4, a philanthropic event for sophomores. This is the second year the 1634 Society has hosted a One for Georgetown campaign for the three classes.
External Relations Chair of the 1634 Society Nicole Hassman (COL ’18) said the campaign adapted its goal for student donations from the past year, thereby ensuring that the full $100,000 donation from the anonymous alum could only be unlocked if the student body reached the donation goal.
“Last year we set our goal a little high. We set it at 2,500 [student donors] and we hit around the 1,700 range. So we set our goal for 1,789 this year, something that we thought was both feasible and a catchy number,” Hassman said.
One for Georgetown organizes daily food events for students who make their one-time donations to the campaign. Most of the food comes from popular Georgetown student groups such as Georgetown Bubble and Georgetown University Grilling Society along with popular restaurants like Wisemiller’s Grocery and Deli and Luke’s Lobster.
Philanthropy Co-Chair of 1634 Society Caitlin Garrabrant (SFS ’18) emphasized the popularity of this year’s food events, notably when Georgetown Bubble gave away bubble tea in Lauinger Library for a $1 donation on April 3 and working with the weekly farmers market to offer free food to participants.
During the collaboration process with vendors, Garrabrant said that several of the vendors have been enthusiastic, offering group discounts on orders. Hassman said the partnership and collaboration with neighborhood restaurants encourages greater student participation and involvement in 1634’s efforts.
“Finding Georgetown favorites like Wisey’s and GUGS is also always a big pull. Food events have always been really strong, and I think working with previously existing Georgetown groups is really helpful,” Hassman said.
As the campaign continues until its April 22 end, Garrabrant said she hopes students and the rest of the community will understand the significance of 1634’s efforts and how every individual’s contribution matters.
“One of the things people don’t realize is that the alumni donation is coming in so it’s actually a huge amount of money more than just the one dollar campaign. Also, it’s just a one-time donation, so once you have made your one donation you get to come to all the rest of the events,” Garrabrant said.
Angela Caprio (COL ’19) said she appreciates the campaign’s current efforts and understands how its impact both benefits those who will receive the scholarship and those who contribute.
“I think it’s a cool idea. It’s a cool way to give back to the community while getting free food. It feels like a win-win,” Caprio said.
Rachel Moss (MSB ’19), who participated in the campaign, said student contributions to the One for Georgetown campaign are small enough to be manageable for the entire student body and encourage community-wide involvement.
“It’s such a small amount of money that you don’t have to think twice about. I think that’s a great way to get everyone involved,” Moss said.

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) discussed his upbringing and the future of the Republican Party, both within the context of the 2016 election and beyond, at an event hosted by the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service in the Healey Family Student Center on Monday.
Scott is the first African-American senator from the state of South Carolina and the first African American to have been elected to both Congressional chambers. Prior to his current position, Scott served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013 and on the Charleston County Council for 13 years.
GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), who served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee, moderated the event.
William Treanor (COL ’19) introduced Elleithee and Scott, mentioning Scott’s upbringing in a poor, single-parent household in North Charleston and highlighting his accomplishments in public service.
“Scott has brought his ideals of economic freedom, lower taxes, higher-quality education and a commitment to helping American neighborhoods, who are most in need of our help through conservative values,” Treanor said.
Elleithee pointed out his conflicting political affiliations with Scott and explained why he extended the invitation.
“I’m a Democrat. I was at the Democratic National Committee before I came here. I have had a few thoughts about your party over the years,” Elleithee said. “But I thought today we could actually have a conversation about who and what your party is, what drew you to join the Republican Party, let you make the case to me to why I’ve been wrong all of these years and why young people should join the Republican Party and public service.”
Scott recounted the challenges he faced in his childhood, including his struggles in school.
“My parents got divorced when I was 7 years old. My father joined the Air Force, and we moved back from Michigan to South Carolina. Tough times. We moved into my grandparents’ two-bedroom house,” Scott said. “As a freshman in high school, I drifted in the wrong direction. I was flunking out, failed world geography. I think I am the only United States senator to fail civics. I also failed Spanish and English.”
Scott named his mother and mentor as positive influences on his life who motivated him to seek change through education.
“I had two major blessings and one of them was a mother who believed very strongly in the power of education. The other blessing was my mentor, John Moniz, who was a Chick-fil-A operator, who taught me that no matter where you start, no matter who you are, no matter what has happened, the power of education is the power for you,” Scott said.
Scott specifically referred to the life lessons he gleaned from Moniz and how they impacted his decision to join the Republican Party.
“He taught me that having a job would be a good thing in life and creating jobs would be an even better thing,” Scott said. “He taught me that you can think your way out of poverty. Not to suggest that those who are in poverty are not thinking, but to focus and to reinforce the value of education for me, a kid trapped in poverty.”
Scott elaborated on the reasons behind his decision to become a Republican in the context of his personal values and mission.
“I believe the Republicans do a very good job in issues relating to faith, issues of entrepreneurship and we are strong as well in the military. I represent the Republican Party and believe that the party has a very bright future,” Scott said. “I see the Grand Old Party as the ‘Great Opportunity Party.’ My focus has been the opportunity agenda, where the emphasis is education, work skills and apprenticeship programs. Those are some reasons why I became a Republican and I think this is how we refocus the party and take care of those who are receiving the least of these.”
In reference to the ongoing presidential elections, Scott stated that he was a strong supporter of former Republican candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who dropped out of the race March 15 after losing the primary in his home state of Florida to Donald Trump.
Scott credited the success of Republican front-runner Trump to the candidate’s ability to tap into the anger and frustration that has built up in the electorate over the past decade.
“What he has done, and in a remarkable fashion, is be successful in open primaries in a way that he has not succeeded in closed primaries. He has been able to literally bring over the old Reagan Democrats and has put together this amazing coalition of folks who have in many ways been disenfranchised from the political process,” Scott said. “We’ll see what happens. The question is whether he will be able to keep this momentum, which I think is very difficult.”
Georgetown University College Republicans Membership Director Hunter Estes (SFS ’19), who is also the former campaign manager for GU Students for Rubio, expressed admiration for Scott’s statements on the future of the GOP and the need for unity.
“Sen. Tim Scott spoke about the incredible potential of our party going forward to highlight its bright, hopeful, optimistic and pragmatic message. He was incredibly genuine in his responses and truly showed that he cared deeply about the policy subjects and bringing everyone together as Americans for the good of the nation,” Estes said. “He admirably denounced how some people choose to take advantage of people’s fear and anger and, rather, urged that we should look to what unites us in common goals as Americans, rather than what divides.”

Sister Helen Prejean, one of America’s leading opponents of the death penalty, discussed the importance of grace and forgiveness in her fight to overcome a global culture of death and judgment in the annual Bernardin Address in Copley Formal Lounge on Saturday. Prejean is the author of “Dead Man Walking,” an account of her experiences with two death-row inmates.
More than 120 members of the Georgetown community attended the event, which was hosted by pro-life student groups the Francis Project and Georgetown Right to Life
Prejean, a member of the Congregation of Saint Joseph, discussed an account of her relationship with death-row inmate Patrick Sonnier, a prisoner who killed two teenagers, Loretta Ann Bourque and David LeBlanc. Prejean was Sonnier’s spiritual advisor, and stood by his side during his execution.
Prejean described meeting David’s father, Lloyd LeBlanc, for the first time two weeks before Sonnier’s execution. Instead of spiting her for defending his son’s killer, Lloyd invited Prejean to pray with him, a powerful moment for Prejean.
“It was as we prayed that I got the first glimpse of his soul. He’s the hero of ‘Dead Man Walking,’” Prejean said. “As he grew to trust me, as I kept going back, then he took me into his heart.”
Prejean said LeBlanc told her how he stopped being kind after his son’s death, and that he was only able to save himself through forgiveness.
“‘They killed our son but I’m not going to let them kill me,’” Prejean said, quoting LeBlanc. “And he began to set his face to go down the road where he knew Jesus was waiting for him.”
Prejean created a program in New Orleans called Survive, which offers counseling to the loved ones of the victims of violent crimes.
Through her work with Survive, Prejean said she began to see how considerations of race bias the system of capital punishment.
According to Prejean, eight out of every 10 people who are executed or currently on death row have been sentenced for killing a white person.
“And when people of color are killed, it is a negligible death because it is a negligible life. Black lives matter,” Prejean said.  “When it comes to being a victim of homicide, you can just see it for yourself in the record.”
Prejean said prosecutors more easily identify with white victims and are hesitant to bring the death penalty against wealthy criminals who can afford to establish stronger legal defenses.
Prejean said the issue of the death penalty is part of a broader dialogue about the sanctity of all life.
“We need to be for life. From the unborn child just trying to be born to the person with Alzheimer’s who doesn’t even know their name: Human life has dignity, all life has dignity,” Prejean said.
Prejean said the run up to Sonnier’s execution and others like his subverted the value of human life.
“We do not yet have a Supreme Court that recognizes the mental torture that goes into taking conscious human beings with imaginations and giving them a date of death which they anticipate and die inside their minds a thousand times,” Prejean said.
Prejean said she struggled to find meaning in Prejean’s death.
“He says to me, ‘Sister, please pray God holds up my legs while I make this walk.’ Where is the dignity in this death?” Prejean said.
According to Prejean, the United States is currently among the global leaders in executions per year, alongside China, Iran and Yemen. However, support for the death penalty is at an all-time low and seven states have repealed it in the past 10 years.
Prejean said she is hopeful that the punishment will soon be abolished worldwide.
Associate Vice President for Student Affairs and Faculty Advisor to the Francis Project Jeanne Lord said preserving the dignity of all human life is entailed in Georgetown’s Catholic identity.
“I think for us as Catholics it is a very critical social justice issue. If you look at the mission and the identity of Georgetown University, we are committed to care for the whole person at all stages of life,” Lord said.
President of Georgetown Right to Life Michael Khan (COL ’18) said Prejean’s address was compelling because of her passion and appeal to personal experience.
“When she began to work with [death row inmates] and learn that they were actual humans with — as she mentioned — human emotions and faces, she really found the passion for [her work]. That’s what she shared today and I thought that was really helpful for our students,” Khan said.
Co-Director of the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life Spencer Crawford (SFS ’16) said he believes Georgetown students are predominantly in opposition to the death penalty.
“To see a room filled up on a Saturday afternoon to hear someone give a talk against the death penalty showed me where Georgetown stands on an issue like this,” Crawford said.

Professor Austan Goolsbee, former Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, argued demographic shifts and technological innovation in the United States will ensure a prosperous economic future at the Razin Prize and Economic Policy Lecture in the Lohrfink Auditorium on Wednesday.
Goolsbee’s plans rule out the consumer industry, oil and housing as viable industries for saving the American economy and instead propose that the demographic increases in population and innovation are the most likely saviors of the American economy.
During Goolsbee’s time as a member of President Obama’s cabinet, experts in Washington were predicting a V-shaped recovery, meaning the steeper the downturn in the economy, the faster it will rebound.
By the third year into the recession, economists altered their predictions to first a U-shaped recovery, signifying a slightly less marked rebound and then an L-shaped recovery.
Goolsbee said as the financial crisis was the result of a housing bubble, a V-shaped recovery was never possible.
“You can only have a V-shaped recovery when the economy can go back to doing what it was doing before the recession began. In other words, fundamentally not when you have a bubble that pops,” Goolsbee said.
Some economists have observed that more than 50 percent of the recessions since World War II have been caused either directly or indirectly by high oil prices. Goolsbee said although the price of oil is currently down, the American economy will not experience an oil-induced boom.
According to Goolsbee, falling oil prices indicate that demand for oil is also decreasing.
“I believe that the price of oil, like the price of all the other industrial commodities, is down because demand is down and [the market] is telling you, ‘we think emerging markets are going to be worse than what they’ve been,’” Goolsbee said.
Goolsbee said housing is similarly unable to save the economy. The Federal Reserve System annually forecasts a U-shaped recovery and 3.5 percent growth — something that has yet to happen.
“The Fed’s not the only one that’s messing that up but it’s the most prominent. Why? Because the forecast machine is inherently premised on reversion to the mean or return to normal,” Goolsbee said. “They don’t realize that they’ve implicitly defined the return to normal to be return to 2006 which is completely not normal, the peak of a bubble, and it’s not going to come back.”
Goolsbee said he remains optimistic about the American economy given the demographic increase in the United States, which presents a manageable problem.
“The U.S. population is projected to continue to grow to over 400 million, whereas in most advanced economies population will be shrinking or has already started shrinking,” Goolsbee said. “So the fiscal challenge facing U.S. is of serious magnitude but is of a manageable size in a way that it is not anywhere else.”
Goolsbee said American demographics, along with technology and innovation will in fact ensure long-term economic prosperity.
“The innovative capacity of human beings has proved totally unbounded, and that’s how we got richer and richer,” Goolsbee said.
Sam Ricciardi (COL ’16), who attended the event, said Goolsbee’s speech was reassuring.
“The content of the speech was surprising just because maybe I’m a cynic, I’ve always thought we are eventually doomed. But it was nice to have a smart person talk optimistically about the future for once,” Ricciardi said. “It’s the only time I’ve ever cut class for a speech, and I’d say it was worth it.”

The Washington, D.C. Department of Transportation began its eighth annual Potholepalooza campaign April 1, incorporating more technology — including traffic tracking data and interactive maps — this year to increase resident involvement.
Potholepalooza is a six-week, city-wide event in which potholes reported by residents are filled in within 48 hours instead of the 72-hour period standard for the rest of the year.
According to the DDOT, more than 64,000 potholes have been filled across the District since the first Potholepalooza in 2009; approximately 6,000 of those requests were addressed during last year’s Potholepalooza alone. During the campaign, the department deploys extra crews for the entire month of April,
Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced Potholepalooza at a joint press conference with Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) last Friday. Bowser also initiated the campaign by tamping asphalt into one of the city’s potholes.
“We know we need to do better,” Bowser said. “We know that we need to make the resources available so that we have a consistent program to get our residential streets in the state of good repair that we all expect.”
This year’s Potholepalooza marks the inception of several technological changes. Though the campaign has engaged residents and allowed them to report potholes through social media since 2009, this year the DDOT is using the Google application Waze to track traffic data in order to prioritize pothole inspections.
Residents can also track the progress of pothole repair in their area and around the District through interactive maps available on the DDOT website.
The DDOT spokesperson Michelle Phipps-Evans said the department has benefitted from using these maps in past projects, and is successfully applying them to their Potholepalooza this year.
“As a tool, we find that these interactive maps give residents a better sense of how work is progressing, and it provides more transparency as an agency,” Phipps-Evans wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Last July, we began to track ongoing repairs to our alleys in our first Alleypalooza campaign. This was so well received that we began to create this GIS [geographical information system] mapping for our Potholepalooza campaign. So far, the interactive maps have been well received.”
Bowser addressed the use of technology in this year’s initiative in a press release March 25, highlighting the ability of the new measures to improve Potholepalooza’s efficiency.
“Today, we are taking a fresh approach to pothole repairs in the District,” Bowser wrote. “By adopting new strategies and technologies we are better able to identify potholes, repair them quickly and ensure residents can drive on District roads that are smooth, comfortable and, most importantly, safe.”
Georgetown Business Improvement District Transportation Director Will Handsfield said the BID is impressed by the change Potholepalooza has affected so far, and expressed hope that it will continue to directly engage District residents.
“The Georgetown BID is very encouraged by DDOT’s continuing efforts to maintain and improve the conditions of our area roadways. Potholepalooza, now in its seventh year, has shown real success in meeting that need,” Handsfield said. “We’re very encouraged by the technical improvements that they have added to the program to make us more user friendly and more accurate.”
The DDOT is also implementing a central tracking system for District potholes — a departure from the individualized tracking system of previous years, in which different crews across the city tracked projects specific to their areas.
Phipps-Evans said the change came from a desire to ensure the campaign remains as efficient as possible in the coming years.
“DDOT wanted to have a better close-out process in place to record work that’s being done within our performance timeframes and parameters,” Phipps-Evans wrote. “Having all potholes tracked and closed within one system, and closed in the field, offers a more realistic timeframe for completion and reduces the possibility of having extended timelines to complete service requests.”
This year’s campaign is also shifting crews who normally deal with inclement weather to filling potholes, allowing the DDOT to begin the process approximately two weeks earlier than previous years.
Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) expressed support for Potholepalooza and praised the DDOT’s continued attention to city infrastructure.
“The care and maintenance of our roadways – streets, sidewalks and alleys – has been and continues to be one of my top concerns on the Council,” Evans wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m pleased that Mayor Bowser and the DC Department of Transportation are continuing the well-publicized Potholepalooza effort, while the city continues to undertake more serious rehabilitation work on roads in very poor shape.”

The Georgetown Program Board announced on Thursday that rapper Wiz Khalifa will headline the GPB Spring Kickoff Concert. The concert will be held in the McDonough Gymnasium on Saturday, April 22.
Doors will be open from 9 p.m. to 10:45 p.m., with tickets ranging from $35 for Georgetown students to $60 for non-students. The GPB is also offering two special ticket varieties exclusively to students: Fast Track and VIP. Fast Track, which is priced at $40, offers an expedited wait line, while VIP, priced at $50, also offers an expedited wait line in addition to a group picture with Khalifa.
Khalifa performed at previously at the Spring Kickoff Concert in 2012. GPB Co-chair of Concerts Sam Drummond (MSB ’18) said he has high hopes for Khalifa’s performance this spring and expects his second visit to be more popular.
“Obviously he’s a huge name, and we made it our goal this year to not settle for a smaller-scale artist,” Drummond said. “Wiz came to campus five years ago and it was a massive success. We thought it would be incredible to bring him back.”
Khalifa is currently on his “The High Road Tour” after the February release of his sixth studio album, “Khalifa.” “Khalifa,” which sold over 60,000 records and more than 20 million streams in its first week, also features artists such as Travi$ Scott, J.R. Donato, Ty Dolla $ign and Juicy J.
GPB’s selection of Wiz Khalifa came after an in-depth analysis of what artist would be the best fit for the university this year. After deliberation and planning, the committee decided a hip-hop artist would cater best to the interests of students who took a poll on what type of musical artist they wanted for the spring concert.
“We found that the campus, as well as our committee, would like a hip-hop artist, given our polls and committee discussions,” Drummond said.
Student reaction to the concert announcement has been largely positive. Ali Rehman (COL ’17), who identified as a long-time fan of Khalifa, echoed Drummond’s excitement.
“I’ve been a fan of Wiz since ‘Kush & Orange Juice,’” Rehman said. “From what I’ve heard and seen from his video logs, it seems like he knows how to put on a show.”
Daniel Frumento (COL ’18) also said he was excited for Khalifa’s appearance.
“Wiz is truly a wizard. ‘Black and Yellow’ is a constant song on my workout playlist,” Frumento said.
While students are excited about Wiz Khalifa’s appearance, GPB hopes the concert will be appealing to students regardless of their music preferences. Drummond also expects the yet-decided concert opener will also cater to students’ interests.
“The opener hasn’t finished contracting yet, but we think he’ll complement Wiz quite well. We also have a bunch of giveaways to hand out to make the experience even better,” Drummond said.
Tickets can be purchased on Tablelist.

Panelists from media organizations called for greater female participation in the traditionally male-dominated media industry in the “Women in New Media” panel during the OWN IT Summit Saturday.
The panel featured Founder and Editor-in-Chief of MuslimGirl.net Amani Alkhat, Editor-in-Chief of espnW and ESPN Magazine Alison Overholt, The New Yorker political cartoonist and Cultural Envoy for the U.S. State Department Liza Donnelly and Amel Monsur, creative director for VICE’s Broadly, the network’s women’s interest channel. The panel was moderated by The Wall Street Journal Executive Emerging Media Editor Carla Zanoni.
Overholt said being a woman can be an advantage in competitive industries..
“The thing that people often fear about being a woman is this idea of being other, that somehow being less represented is always a disadvantage,” Overholt said. “It can actually be a huge advantage. If you are a woman and you have ‘chutzpah’ and you jump in there, people are looking for you.”
According to Donnelly, gender affects a wider range of careers and on a deeper level.
“When I started cartooning, I didn’t realize it would be a gendered space, so I just kept drawing. But what the standards are for good tend to be male-based,” Donnelly said. “So I started to do more cartoons about what it’s like to be a woman. Men can write about women and women’s issues, but no one can do it like I can.”
Monsur said the first step toward greater representation, especially in a field like media, is speaking up.
“Sometimes it’s just about asserting or mentioning that you’re here. Don’t assume that people see you because many times they don’t,” Monsur said. “Media is an observation. I don’t know anyone who is a better orator or interpreter or observer than a woman. So we belong here.”
Alkhat said it is especially important to change the representation of Muslim women in the media.
“Once we get that, get that narrative out there, once we have that representation out there, that’s really what allows us to connect to one another. It humanizes everyone in each other’s eyes. It allows us an opportunity to just really get that message out there and to create change,” Alkhat said in an interview with The Hoya after the panel.
According to Alkhat, Muslim women are often characterized as being oppressed in the Western media.
“I think that Western media really likes to present us kind of in this box of being voiceless, of needing other people to do the talking for us, that we need to be liberated, that we’re oppressed, that we need to be saved from brown men,” Alkhat said. “It’s all these really racially embedded preconceptions of Muslim women that are perpetuated for very politicized agendas.”
While many careers and industries are currently male-dominated, each panelist stressed the importance of carving out women’s spaces within these fields.
“Once you’re in that space, continuing to have this dialogue, while it is exhausting, it will be valuable,” Monsur said. “Don’t ever back away.”
Alkhat said these spaces are a good starting point for furthering greater gender equity and female involvement, not only in media, but in business in general.
“Starting out with these women’s spaces is a good stepping stone,” Alkhat said.
Zanoni said she hopes gender becomes a non-issue.
“I don’t want to be a female leader. I just want to be a leader,” Zanoni said. “Hopefully the next generation will be able to just lead.”

United States Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith and Deputy Administrator of NASA Dava Newman pushed for a greater appreciation of women in science, technology, engineering and math fields during their “The Future of Science & Technology” talk at the OWN IT Summit Saturday. 
The panelists discussed their experience solving 21st-century problems as women in a typically male-dominated field. NBC4 morning news anchor Eun Yang moderated the talk.
Newman said she wanted to change the acronym STEM to STEAMD to include art and design.
“We need to write our own history. You tell the stories,” Newman said. “You’re going paint my picture of how we get to Mars.”
Both women noted the absence of the history of women who have greatly impacted science and technology.
Smith named Grace Hopper, who invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and Ada Lovelace, who is considered to have written instructions for the first computer program in the mid-1800s, as well as mathematician Katherine Johnson who recently received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her work with NASA, for leaving a particularly significant impact. As a mathematician, Johnson calculated the trajectories for Alan Sheppard, John Glenn and the Apollo mission.
“We’ve never seen a movie about Apollo with an African-American [female] elite mathematician in the team,” Smith said.
Sarah Smith (COL ’16), who attended the summit, said it is important that women are introduced to technology at a young age.
“They emphasized how the way women are socialized in technology at a young age needs to change and I completely agree with that,” she said. “We cannot let others destroy our confidence.”
The two technological giants ended their panel with advice for the next generation about raising girls to be strong, confident women.
“Don’t just tell her she’s pretty, tell her she’s pretty smart,” Megan Smith said.

New York Magazine columnist Ann Friedman and Tech LadyMafia founder Aminatou Sow, the co-hosts of the “Call Your Girlfriend” podcast, encouraged stronger friendships between females to advance the feminist movement at the OWN IT Summit Saturday.
At the panel, which was moderated by history professor and author of “South Side Girls” Dr. Marcia Chatelain, Friedman and Sow both agreed their lives differ greatly from the traditional caregiver roles that their mothers held. Sow said it was important to seek out new role models and appreciate past ones.
“For me, it’s a big thing about seeking out other role models, while at the same time, the older I get, trying to really find and appreciate the things that the women in my family have embodied or exemplified,” Sow said.
Sow also encouraged students to prioritize their current relationships after they graduate.
“Make peace with the fact that your friendship will probably change, and it’s not a reflection on the kind of the person either of you are,” Sow said. “If you are both open to the fact that it is a little harder to stay in touch, I think that helps.”
Friedman said working on their podcast has changed the dynamic of her and Sow’s relationship.
“Working on the podcast has imbued it with a sense of purpose, which is not always easy, but has made our friendship more powerful in a lot of ways,” Friedman said.
Sow said she has hope for the future of feminism and foresees even more advancements and achievements.
“Things are only going to get better, because we are getting louder, we expect more, we have more power and we have more money,” Sow said.
Friedman said she is excited for the future, and expressed anticipation for an increase in politically active feminists.
“I’m really excited to see what can happen if the circle of personally-identified group of feminists expands and people who personally conceptualize themselves as feminists start to become more politically active,” Friedman said.
Both Friedman and Sow said they view female friendship as a crucial support system and a key to the advancement of the feminist cause.
According to Friedman, the best, most healthy female friendships are emancipating and provide permission.
“Permission to be myself and to be great, but also to be vulnerable,” Friedman said.

Activism can be as simple as carrying a dildo.
That was one of the many messages relayed by the “Redefining Activism” panelists, who kicked off the afternoon half of the OWN IT Summit on Saturday. Moderated by Jamia Wilson, feminist activist and executive director of Women, Action, and the Media: WAM!, the panel touched both on the practical work of the three featured speakers and their advice for student activists.
#CocksNotGlocks organizer Jessica Jin drew widespread laughter as she described how she stumbled onto the gun control activism scene. After the University of Texas at Austin permitted students to carry handguns, Jin — initially as a joke — created a Facebook event for people to carry dildos instead as a sign of protest. Then, she went to bed.
“The next morning, it was raining dildos,” Jin said. “Suddenly, I was a gun prevention activist.”
According to Jin, the key lesson of the otherwise comical protest demonstrated the impact any individual could have.
“The dildo protest lowered the threshold for participation,” Jin said. “All of you have the power to make your voice heard.”
Founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America Shannon Watts said she was drawn into gun control activism after the Sandy Hook shooting, when she realized that women — particularly mothers concerned for their children’s health — had perhaps the most powerful voice in pushing for gun control.
“There’s this idea that women can’t take on this macho, testosterone-filled gun lobby,” Watts said. “But we can, and we are winning.”
In the new era of activism, Watts discussed the prevalence of hateful messages targeted at her through social media, which she acknowledged as difficult to fathom at times. Yet, she also noted the transformative power of technology in activism.
“There’s this incredibly positive side to social media,” Watts said. “Moms who have time when their kids are at school to do this hashtag activism — it actually works. We got Chipotle to change their gun policy over a weekend.”
Sarah McBride, an LGBTQ activist who currently works at the Center for American Progress and a former American University student body president who came out as transgender during her senior year, told the story of her husband, Andy, who was also transgender and died from cancer. McBride emphasized the power of storytelling and individual voices in activism.
“Empathy is an incredibly powerful emotion. So many people — particularly so many women — think that they don’t have anything to contribute, that their voice isn’t the right voice. But when you tell a story of love, friendship, kindness, people respond to that,” McBride said. “Never ever doubt that your voice matters.”
McBride said it’s important people recognize that sexism, transphobia and other similar challenges are connected.
“I think Own It just demonstrated one of these things, which is to very clearly and consciously make the statement for inclusion, that transgender women are women and transgender men are men and that we should all be respective in our identities,” McBride said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think the second is understanding that sexism, misogyny, homophobia and transphobia are inextricably linked.”

Co-founder of nonprofit organ donation startup ORGANIZE Jenna Arnold condemned complacency and shared her experiences enacting change at a “Trailblazers” panel discussion for the 2016 OWN IT Summit in Gaston Hall on Saturday afternoon.
CEO and co-founder of THINX Miki Agrawal was originally set to speak at the panel as well, but she could not appear due to sickness.
In addition to co-founding ORGANIZE, Arnold is a former teacher, has sold television shows to MTV and was the youngest American to work at the United Nations. She also previously founded PressPlay, a boutique content creation firm.
OWN IT co-founder Kendall Ciesemier (COL ’15), who told the audience that she had undergone two liver transplants herself, interviewed Arnold and praised her for her work in organ donation.
ORGANIZE, which Arnold co-founded with Greg Segal, is a New York City-based startup that aims to streamline and facilitate organ donor registration, a process which is currently primarily done at the Department of Motor Vehicles.
“If you Google Image ‘Hell,’ the first image that comes up is the DMV,” Arnold said.
Citing Madonna’s statement of “I’m tough, I’m ambitious and I know exactly what I want. If that makes me a bitch, okay,” Arnold highlighted her own qualities that have allowed her to fight against the organ donation industry’s thick bureaucracy.
“I am very unapologetic. I don’t care if I piss people off for the sake of saving lives,” she said.
Arnold advised college students to never be afraid to take risks and take on new challenges, and to not be afraid to make a life change.
“There’s this deep-seated fear that this first choice is ultimately going to dictate the next 40, 50 years of your life, and it won’t,” she said. “You can jump ship: from a relationship, from a city, from a job, at any point that you want.”
Responding to a question from Ciesemier about how she manages to not burn out, Arnold stressed the importance of caring for one’s own self, advice she said her mother gave her.  She said she is looking to move on to a new challenge soon, comparing the experience to floating on a Boogie board and waiting for the next big wave to come.
Self-described as impatient and easily bored, Arnold criticized the choice to not act above all.
“There’s no excuse to not do things. I think complacency is the cancer of humanity … and anyone who’s complacent I tend to judge.”
