A D.C. Department of Transportation proposal to provide free, city-wide parking to Washington, D.C visitors has residents concerned with what is already a scarce resource within the Beltway.
The August announcement of proposed visitor parking came after Georgetown’s announcement of a vehicle ban for all undergraduates, which took effect this fall.
The current visitor parking system in D.C. allows residents living on residential roads with permit parking to apply for two-week parking passes at local police stations. The proposal, however, would allow visitors to register online for a visitor placard that would be valid for one year. The placards will not have any information about the car or its driver, allowing the passes to potentially be used for multiple vehicles.
Since 2008, DDOT has sent placards directly to some residents in Wards 3, 4 and 5 as part of a pilot parking program. Limited areas of Wards 1, 2 and 6 were added in 2012. Wards 3, 4 and 5 have a lower population density than other areas of the city, which have garnered more adamant opposition to the proposal. The area of Ward 2 that participated in the pilot program did not include Georgetown.
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E has found issue with the DDOT’s “one-size-fits-all” policy,ANC2E Commissioner Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14) said.
“These regulations allow every house to have a permanent guest pass, and that’s just not feasible in our area,” Prindiville said. “We already have limited parking, and I think the legitimate fear is that these passes could be sold. It’s just going to make it difficult for everyone to park here.”
Prindiville stressed that the new policy infringes on residents’ rights to park freely in the area where they live.
“I think all residents here have a right to parking, and that includes a more stringent regulation on visitor parking,” Prindiville said.
Prindiville believes that the DDOT proposal could be changed or delayed due to the strong reaction throughout the city.
“Every single neighborhood association has come out against it,” Prindiville said. “I think the community response on this has been almost universal. I think that will be heard at DDOT — I hope that it will be heard — because the system will just exacerbate parking issues.”
Prindiville compared the DDOT regulations to the university’s parking ban.
“I submit that students should have that right, too,”Prindiville said. “They vote here, they live here, they’re full-fledged residents. There’s no reason they should be discriminated against.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson disagreed that the DDOT proposal had any bearing on student parking rights.
“The university strongly believes that most students do not need cars at Georgetown,” Olson wrote in an email.
Prindiville clarified that the two issues are separate.
“Although I’m really frustrated by the university’s stance on parking and putting regulations about parking in the Code of Student Conduct, this is a permit issue [for visitors],” Prindiville said. “It’s a bureaucratic decision that could wreak havoc on the parking situation here.”
Georgetown University Student Association Deputy Chief of Staff Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14) agreed and added that it would be unwise for students to attempt to use this expansion of visitor parking rights as a stepping stone for student parking rights.
“This probably isn’t the right issue to engage on,” Peterson said. “We need to work together to form a more livable community and engage our stakeholders and try to voice our way through.”

ALEXANDER BROWN/THE HOYAAn announcement that the university is considering an undergraduate residence outside the Georgetown neighborhood has met intense resistance, as student leaders launched a campaign Monday to get the proposal scrapped altogether.
Administrators clarified Monday morning that the satellite residence is just one option under consideration to help meet the 2010 Campus Plan commitment to provide housing for an additional 385 students by fall 2015. Yet leaders of the “One Georgetown, One Campus” campaign said it was important to voice student opposition as soon as possible.
“The wide response from students I’ve talked to has been that this satellite campus is flat-out unacceptable,” Georgetown University Student Association Chief of Staff Zach Singer (SFS ’15) said at a press conference to announce the launch of the campaign Monday evening. “We can’t wait for the university to come to a decision and be told, ‘This is what we’re doing.’”
Though the campaign is not technically a GUSA initiative, it is being spearheaded by Singer and GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14).
Details of the satellite residence option, which emerged in a series of private forums with student leaders held last week, are still fuzzy. The university is considering leasing sites as far as the Clarendon and Court House metrorail stations in Virginia, as well as locations north of campus on Wisconsin Avenue and near Capitol Hill. Potential sites would be judged based on the availability of high-quality housing and Metro accessibility, and could house anywhere from 100 to 385 students. Details on the locations under review are expected later this month.
Administrators objected to students’ characterization of the tentative proposal as potentially divisive for the student body.
“Even if most students don’t like the option, to be blunt and crass about it, most students don’t need to live there,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said. “If there is a subset of students who say ‘under the following conditions this would be kind of interesting,’ then it might make sense to pursue as an option.”
“My concern is that some of the information out there could be counter-productive,” added Associate Vice President for Community Engagement and Strategic Initiatives Lauralyn Lee, emphasizing that the university is still in the early stages of figuring out how to meet its legal obligation to provide extra housing.
Administrators added that they had always planned on organizing public discussions about the housing options being considered, even though the focus group sessions held last week were all private. Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey cited lessons learned from campus backlash to a lack of input on the original Northeast Triangle Residence Hall proposal in July.
Tisa said the Northeast Triangle, originally set to be completed across from Reiss Science Building for fall 2015, may be delayed. Olson did not confirm this but acknowledged that there are many challenges to building on campus.
“We know that this is a complex city in which to build buildings, and we’re doing our very best,” Olson said.
Despite these setbacks in Georgetown’s efforts to meet the requirements of the campus plan agreement, Tisa, Singer and other campus leaders who spoke at Monday’s press conference said they considered the option of satellite housing unacceptable under any circumstances. Students of Georgetown Inc. CEO Lizzy MacGill (COL ’14) emphasized the impact that the dorm would have on students’ ability to engage in extracurricular activities, while College Academic Council Vice President Parnia Zahedi (COL ’15) argued that it would limit opportunities for after-hours intellectual dialogue.
“This satellite campus will divide Georgetown in two,” Tisa said. “It puts our shared identity at stake.”
ALEXANDER BROWN/THE HOYAAccording to Singer, members of the “One Georgetown, One Campus,” campaign will spend the next several weeks collecting 300 signatures on a petition to get a referendum on the idea of an off-campus residence added to the ballot for the upcoming Sept. 26 GUSA senate election. Though GUSA has held referendums in the past — last year’s vote to support changing the Code of Student Conduct’s evidentiary standard from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing” is a recent example — this is the first time in Tisa’s memory that one has been added to the ballot via petition rather than as the result of a GUSA senate vote.
Tisa said the decision to promote the referendum via petition rather than through a senate vote will demonstrate that opposition to the satellite residence is a cross-campus phenomenon.
“There are so many student leaders who are passionate about this that we didn’t want to pigeonhole it by labeling it as GUSA,” he said. “Those groups can reach out to students much better than we can.”
Referencing the fact that the “One Georgetown, One Campus” Facebook page had received more than 400 likes in the 24 hours since it was created Sunday, he added, “I love GUSA, but I don’t think we could get that many Facebook likes overnight.”
He and Singer hope that the referendum will demonstrate student opposition to the idea and force the university to remove it from consideration. University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr emphasized that Georgetown was not considering a satellite campus — a term that has been used by the “One Georgetown, One Campus” campaign — similar to The George Washington University’s Mount Vernon campus. Kerr said that the satellite housing option would be strictly residential.
But Singer dismissed this distinction.
“It’s the ‘satellite’ word that’s the issue,” he said. “People are nervous about, is this truly going to be a living-learning community if you’re busing people in from 20 or 30 minutes out?”
ALEXANDER BROWN/THE HOYAAside from the hotly disputed issue of a satellite residence, neither administrators nor students were able to speak concretely about alternative methods of creating space for 385 extra beds.
Morey said that the university is also looking at additional construction on campus, mentioning Harbin patio, Kober-Cogan Building and the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center — a proposal that had been considered as part of the campus plan but was scrapped in July for financial and logistical reasons. Morey would not specify which of these were most likely.
When asked what options he would consider an acceptable alternative to the off-campus dorm, Tisa was also unable to offer specifics.
“There’s potential for renovation,” he said, before pivoting back to the satellite residence. “The problem is that [administrators] are not looking into the other options with the same vigor as they’re looking at the satellite campus … and that’s a Band-Aid solution.”
For now, Olson said that the satellite dorm option remains under consideration and will be discussed at an unspecified series of discussions with students in the coming weeks, even if a referendum is held on the issue.
“Certainly student feedback in that form would be taken very seriously,” he said, adding that majority opposition to the option would not necessarily remove it from the table.
Lee also urged students not to let the referendum to the satellite residence overshadow an opportunity to make clear what options they would consider acceptable.
“I’d challenge student leadership to think about whether [a referendum] is the most effective mechanism to have their voices heard right now,” Lee said. “I would hate to see all of the energy focused on what [students] don’t want and lose the opportunity to tell us what [they] do.”

Campus visitors and Jesuits on golf carts will need to pay close attention to a new initiative by the Department of Public Safety meant to address high incidences of on-campus traffic violations.
The educational effort, which will be rolled out in three stages before DPS begins issuing citations for traffic violations this fall, comes after DPS officers conducted a survey of on-campus traffic last year.
The survey found minimal attention paid to stop signs, with a 5 percent stop sign compliance rate for golf cart drivers and a 0 percent compliance rate for bicyclers. University cars and trucks stopped 60 percent of the time, while privately owned vehicles stopped 45 percent of the time. Contractor vehicles were the most compliant, with a rate of 66 percent.
“As a department, we noticed anecdotally that people weren’t obeying traffic signs,” Chief of Police Jay Gruber said. “We noticed a lot of near misses.”
The first phase of the DPS effort, which has been in effect for the past three weeks, focuses on education. Officers in full uniform, accessorized with traffic vests, are stationed at problematic intersections during peak hours to flag down traffic law violators. DPS has operational jurisdiction only within the campus gates.
Each phase will last for several weeks with no concrete timetable in place. The second phase will expand from education to written warnings, which will not carry a fine. The third phase will combine verbal cautions, written warnings and fines issued at officers’ discretion.
“Our goal is not to give citations out,” Gruber said. “If we’re successful in the first two phases, we’d rather educate the public and have them listen to us the first time.”
Citations are university-based, and do not fall under D.C. government jurisdiction. As such, citations consist solely of fines, not driver’s license points. Careless driving carries a $100 fine, while failure to yield right-of-way is a $50 fine and failure to halt at a stop sign — a problem Gruber describes as rampant — is also a $50 fine. For every mile exceeding the campus-wide 15-mph speed limit, $5 is added to the charge.
Drivers issued citations have the right to appeal to DPS. If violators fail to pay, DPS will forward the charge to a collections agency.
Because of a recent transfer from paper records to an electronic database, traffic violation records from past years are not available. Gruber, however, said he believed DPS officers have not issued many citations. Pedestrians have not been involved in accidents, but minor accidents between vehicles have occurred.
“As we grow as a pedestrian campus we’re concerned about pedestrian versus vehicle collisions,”Gruber said.
While the department’s education efforts target vehicle operators, Gruber does not believe that students are fully absolved of culpability, citing a lack of situational awareness while crossing the street, largely due to texting.
Fr. Otto Hentz, S.J., an associate professor of theology, has driven a golf cart for the past year because his hip is injured.
“Some [students] are bent over and working on their messages or Twitter or whatever, and they’re totally absorbed. You can drive right up to them before they notice,” Hentz said. “Other times they notice, but they turn back to their conversation and don’t move.”
The police department has reached out to the management of the organizations permitted to use golf carts as part of this fall’s program. There is no separate driving protocol for the carts.
Hentz said he received no instruction prior to operating his cart.
“I think they were relying on common sense,” he said.
The nonexistent rate of compliance for bicyclists draws concern from the police department.
“We will be targeting bicyclists as well. They are bound by traffic laws when using streets. They are sometimes the worst offenders,” Gruber wrote in an email.
Avid cyclist Greg Miller (SFS ’14) disagrees with the lumping of bicyclists with other vehicular traffic.
“I think making cyclists stop at stop signs hurts them more than letting them go through them. I think on campus, since all of the roads are privately owned, the university could definitely create such a possibility that doesn’t necessarily conform with D.C. traffic laws,” Miller said.
Three weeks into the educational effort, Gruber sees a noticeable change in driver habits.
“People aren’t very happy. It’s not something we’ve done here very often, so it’s a culture change,”Gruber said. “Anecdotally speaking, I can see one of the major intersections outside my window and there’s major compliance. People absolutely know what we’re doing, especially university employees who drive vehicles.”
The department will conduct follow-up surveys after each phase, using the same metrics as the original survey.

Not every interested student will be able to participate this year in Rangila, a first for the South Asian Society’s 19th annual dance show.
More than 600 students crowded into the Intercultural Center auditorium for sign-ups last Tuesday, and approximately 60 students have been placed on a waitlist. Last year, 550 students danced in 11 sold-out performances.
No prior dance experience is required to participate in Rangila, and it is unclear what factors determined who was placed on the waitlist. Rangila Coordinator Smiti Mohan (MSB ’15) said that seniority was considered, although some seniors did not secure spots in the show.
“The waitlist is partially determined by seniority but also sometimes we factor in the preferences of the dancers as to what they put as their top three. It is honestly determined on a case-by-case basis, and we try to be as objective and fair as possible,” Mohan said.
While there is not a hard limit set by the Center for Student Engagement on the number of participants allowed, the show’s coordinators, Mohan and Neal Seshadri (COL ’15), are hoping to bring the number of participants down to, at most, last year’s count of 550.
“We love having so many people sign up, but it’s also really unfortunate because we can’t accommodate every single person,” Mohan said.
Rangila coordinators and choreographers hoped limiting the number of people in the shows would improve the quality of the dances.
“One of the most common critiques we had last year was that there are so many people on stage, it just looks like one big blur of color,” SAS Vice President Mariam Ashraf (COL ’14) said. “We needed to find that balance of making the audience happy and making sure that the dancers don’t feel like they are one of a million.”
The SAS and CSE decision was also motivated by concerns about overcrowding the Gaston Hall stage.
“It’s come to the point where we are worried we are breaking the stage,” Ashraf said.
Other changes Mohan and Seshadri have made this year include limiting students to one dance each and increasing the number of seniors in the senior Banghra, which is now at 150 participants, so that non-seniors can fill other dances.
Mohan and Seshadri expect a portion of students to drop out in the first few weeks, which will allow for other students to come off the waitlist.
Some students are upset that they were unexpectedly waitlisted.
Laura Grannemann (SFS ’14), who is on the waitlist for senior Bhangra, said that she was told this year’s sign-ups would not guarantee a spot in the show.
“They pretty much told me it was unsure from the beginning, but you expect there wouldn’t be a problem, but I guess I was basing that expectation off previous years,” Grannemann said.
“I was very excited about dancing in Rangila after attending signups, so receiving the waitlist email Sunday night was a disappointment,” said Katherine Seder (MSB ’16), who is on the waitlist. “If I get off the waitlist, I will definitely still participate. I do not want to miss out on this fun and unique Georgetown tradition.”

In the past year, students have steadily posted their ideas and concerns on Georgetown Ideas, a web platform for community suggestions run through IdeaScale, but use across departments has been inconsistent.
The online platform run through Idea-Scale was launched in spring 2012 by University Chief Operating Officer Chris Augostini and Program Manager for New Media and Digital Strategy Michael Wang to create a digital dialogue with the student body. Since then, Wang has seen the small online community evolve into a dedicated group of students, faculty and staff.
“We have found that the Georgetown staff community wants to be engaged as well,” Wang said. “They are excited to contribute and join in on the dialogue, so that’s what we’ve been thinking through: how to better facilitate this dialogue.”
One of the campus institutions that has latched on to Georgetown Ideas has been Lauinger Library. Of the 27 ideas that Georgetown Ideas has marked as completed since it was launched in spring 2012, five of these are related to the library. Library staff generally responds to all queries related to Lauinger.
“In general, the library is very eager to respond to all of our users — anything that’s easy for us to fix we’d love to do that,” Program and Events Coordinator for Lauinger Library Jennifer Smith said.
The library implemented an online booking feature for study rooms after Shirley Adelstein, a government doctoral candidate, suggested it in a Georgetown Ideas post.
“I had spoken with folks at the library about it before and I thought perhaps this might be something worth posting,” Adelstein said. “I was pretty surprised how quickly the library responded. I think that IdeaScale was one part of a number of elements that moved the initiative forward.”
University Information Services have also found that the student input on Georgetown Ideas, in many cases, can help refine projects that are already in the works. A post last year for full campus Wi-Fi on the site garnered 390 votes.
“It was pretty clear to everyone that ubi-quitous Wi-Fi is something we’re striving for,” Wang said. “But in terms of where do students want to see it, we saw a lot of enthusiasm toward the lawn and that appeared originally on IdeaScale.”
Georgetown Ideas also allows administrators to prioritize projects while facing already limited budgets.
“In addition to helping us define what a particular problem is, students are helping us determine within the constraints of a limited budget what we should tackle first,” UIS Director of Communications Laura Horton said.
Some students are dubious that administrators are actually seeing their posts on the forum.
“I feel like I’ve got a lot of support, feedback, comments and in that way its had a positive effect, but I also haven’t seen any actual results from the post,” said Greg Miller (SFS ’14), who frequently posts ideas on behalf of the Office of Sustainability. “The process by which those ideas are translated into action isn’t very transparent.”
Miller cited mislabeled idea cards and the lack of a vote change function as two main problems with the current system.
“There are sustainability ideas that have been completed that have never been moved into that category by the administrators,” Miller said. “There’s no feature to change your vote even if you click it by accident.”
Conway Yao (SFS ’14), a frequent poster on the site, is also frustrated by the lack of response by some administrators.
“I think if all administrators could take a closer look and, if they’re not going to take action, at least post something,” Yao said. “Maybe some things are just not feasible from their perspective, but if they could at least address those things, then the students could get a better idea of what sort of products are feasible and which aren’t.”
Wang believes that administrative responsiveness is one of the growing pains of the system.
“The idea of crowdsourcing feedback is still new, and we are hard at work raising awareness in the community so that our administration can better collaborate and engage with students,” Wang said.
Wang notes that Auxiliary Services in particular already has alternative methods of student feedback in place.
“There has been a lot of new leadership in Auxiliary Services. They’re already doing a lot of outreach via social media — they’re not short of feedback mechanisms,” Wang said. “Just because they’re not using Georgetown Ideas yet doesn’t mean they’re shirking on communication.”
Smith does not fault fellow departments that are not able to offer the same kind of Georgetown Ideas presence as herself and her colleagues in the library.
“A lot of it is just having the time and having the resources to respond to [the posts]. If I was a department that had no ability to respond to comments on IdeaScale I think it would be pretty demoralizing to go on the site,” Smith said. “Fortunately, in the library, we’ve been able to address all of the concerns.”

As School of Foreign Service upperclassmen look beyond Georgetown to the professional world, a hallmark SFS program connects them with “friends,” or alumni mentors who provide opportunities for guidance and networking.
The Friends of the SFS program was originally created by Dean Emeritus Peter Krogh about 30 years ago and has been overseen for the past 25 years by Dean Andrew Steigman.
“The initial group of friends were drawn largely from distinguished personal friends of Dean Krogh, but as they dropped out, I’ve shifted the program to include only SFS alumni, many of whom are more recent graduates,” Steigman wrote in an email.
The program includes a list of 24 friends who mentor up to 12 volunteers, meeting with them at least twice a year,
One of these mentors is Zaid Zaid (SFS ’97), a lawyer with Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale and Dorr in Washington, D.C. Zaid said he tries to meet with students more than just the required two times.
“I’m happy to stay in as much contact with students as possible,” Zaid said.
SFS friends are given the freedom of both how and where they conduct their meetings.
“It’s always been at my home, and it’s usually dinner. It’s relaxed and we have an informal conversation,” said Hillary Thomas-Lake (SFS ’88), who has been involved with the program for seven years.
A volunteer student coordinator facilitates the interaction between the student groups and mentors.
“The SFS sometimes struggles to connect its students with alumni in a professional capacity,” student coordinator Ted Hocter (SFS ’14) wrote in an email. “Dean Steigman’s program has really been the only official SFS career outreach that I’ve seen for undergraduates.”
Sometimes, mentors can be not only a source of advice, but also a key connection for an internship or job opportunity.
Frank Samolis (SFS ’73), an SFS friend who currently works as an international trade lawyer in the District, has hired past mentees at his firm after their graduation from law school.
“It’s a nice network to build over time both for the mentor and the mentee,” Samolis said.
Thomas-Lake, a co-founder of LTL Strategies, an African development firm, has also hired past SFS mentees.
“A few instances we end up with people who will end up in my office,” Thomas-Lake said. “The different students I’ve been in contact with have been pretty dynamic and self-starting.”
The 24 mentors have a variety of careers, ranging from diplomats to journalists.
“I was drawn to the program because I’m actually interested in defense contracting and the man I’m partnered with, Matthew Billingsley (SFS ’90), has experience at Booz Allen Hamilton and he now works for Boeing,” first-time participant Matthew de Silva (SFS ’16) said. “I’m interested in learning about his career and how he’s gotten to where he is now.”
While eager to be a friend once again, Samolis wishes he could have had this opportunity during his time in the SFS.
“It’s been a terrific program. There wasn’t anything like that when I was an undergrad in the School of Foreign Service,” Samolis said. “I enjoy it because it’s always great to work with students.”

As classes begin in earnest and students return to Lauinger Library this semester, the look of the second floor may be a shock to some. The library’s overhaul eliminated half of its shelving, leaving the space empty for the time being.
“The library made several space improvements this summer,” Lauinger Library Coordinator of Communications, Outreach and Programming Jennifer Smith wrote in an email. “These projects are all part of our long-term space planning process in order to accommodate our users’ needs.”
Shelving on the second floor is now restricted to the east side of the floor, with the west side cleared. The cleared space is in the process of being converted into an additional seating area over the next few weeks, complete with carpeting and additional chairs and tables.
“We’ve heard from students and seen ourselves how crowded the second floor can get during peak study times,” Smith wrote. “By changing this space from stacks to a study area, we’re hoping to alleviate some of this crowding and give our students more room to do their work.”
Some students think that the changes alter the ambience of the floor.
“I feel like people are more productive … but it changes the vibe of it somewhat. People are more visible to each other, so they’re more aware of what they’re doing. That element of socializing is not going to be the same,” Ambika Tripathi (SFS ’15) said. “It’s too bland, too sterile, like a classroom setting.”
The space previously housed bound periodicals, which have been relocated to off-campus shelving at the Washington Research Library Consortium that students can access through the library’s online request system. Lauinger staff utilized several years’ worth of usage information to determine which periodicals to keep. Certain journals are also now available online.
The study spot will likely regain some of its usual level of activity when Midnight MUG reopens Wednesday. The storefront, which has been repainted and rearranged, will operate with limited hours until Sept. 23, closing at midnight instead of 2 a.m.
The library’s changes extend beyond the second floor. Microforms have been exiled to the lower level while government documents have been relocated to the second floor. Study rooms feature technological improvements, with 42-inch LCD projector systems and new whiteboards in addition to repainting. The fifth floor has also had some of its collections moved in preparation for renovations.
“We try to undertake these projects during the summer to be as least disruptive to our users as possible, but there may be other times during the year that we make some additional changes due to the impending renovation on the fifth floor,” Smith wrote.

With Tokyo chosen as the site of the 2020 Olympics, a local nonprofit is looking ahead to 2024.
D.C. 2024, which is not affiliated with the D.C. government, aims to bring the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games to the Washington, D.C.
This effort would be the second time the District attempted to win the U.S. Olympic bid. The city joined forces with Baltimore in 2002 for a proposal for the 2012 games that would have spanned Baltimore, Prince George’s County, D.C. and Northern Virginia. The proposal lost out to New York, which won the U.S. bid before losing to London at the international level.
Potential rivals for 2024 include Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, all of which have announced their intent to participate in the United States Olympic Committee bidding process, which will end in 2015. The U.S. candidate city will then compete with cities across the world for the International Olympic Committee’s host city decision, which will be announced in 2017, giving the chosen city seven years to prepare for the games.
D.C. 2024 efforts emphasize that the District’s location is ideal because it welcomes millions of visitors every year and regularly holds large-scale events. The city’s three nearby international airports and mass transit system are also cited as benefits, along with the number of sporting facilities within a 40-mile radius of the city.
Matthew Winkler, an associate dean in Georgetown’s master’s program in sports industry management and a former member of the D.C. 2012 Olympic bid committee, stressed the city’s viability as an Olympic host.
“The Washington, D.C., metropolitan region has one of the strongest demographic market areas in the world and the kind of socio-economic power that can help shed the misperception that the city is all about politics — it’s also a great sports town with strong traditions,” Winkler wrote in an email.
Any Olympic host city must invest a minimum of $3 billion into the Olympic Games, and cities must be able to provide at least 45,000 hotel rooms, a large international airport and public transportation.
Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals owner Ted Leonis and Redskins owner Dan Snyder have both expressed support for D.C. 2024, and Virginia businessman Dan Knise, who led the unsuccessful 2012 bid, has been reported to be involved in the 2024 push as well.
Additionally, Georgetown’s sports industry management program at the School of Continuing Studies is partnering with D.C. 2024 for “The Business of Global Sporting Events,” a course offered this fall about the process behind Olympic bids. The course’s final project involves presenting findings and recommendations to the D.C. 2024 Olympic committee.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh supported D.C. 2024’s efforts to bring the Olympics to the District.
“As a university, we are generally supportive events like this that bring energy, focus and economic development to [the] city, and if awarded, would work closely with [the] city to make the event a success,” Pugh said.
