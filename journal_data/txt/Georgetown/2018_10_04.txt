The Hoya Hub, an on-campus pantry offering free, non-perishable food items to members of the Georgetown community, opened Monday in the Leavey Center as part of a Georgetown University Student Association initiative to combat food insecurity.
Located in a room on the fourth floor of Leavey, the project aims to address students’ concerns over food inaccessibility on campus, which were raised by a 2016 GUSA survey. Plans to open the food pantry were announced last month, The Hoya reported.
Hoya Hub Vice Chair Madison Álvarez (SFS ’21) highlighted the need for students to have access to free and low-cost food on Georgetown’s campus.
“Within hours of our opening, we had students signing up for this resource, and the space appears to already have been used in its first twenty-four hours,” Álvarez wrote in an email to The Hoya.
As more people use the food pantry, the team hopes to obtain data that will show the extent of inaccessibility to food and help explain why hunger exists on Georgetown’s campus.
The launch of the pantry has been an ongoing collaboration between student organizations, project advisors and administrators, Hoya Hub Chair Caroline Barnes (COL ’19) said in an interview with The Hoya.
“This has been a decade of conversations of students at Georgetown working to get this off the ground, and the past ten months have been some of the most incredible months of my life,” Barnes said.
The Hoya Hub is funded by donations, which can be made on the Saxa Fund website, Vice Chair Sam Dubke (SFS ’21) said.
“For World Food Day, we’re going to try to do a roundtable discussion, bringing together alums who are involved in food justice, as well as professors, admins and students,” Dubke said in an interview with The Hoya.
The next step for the project is to raise awareness and support for the project, Assistant Dean for Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr, an adviser to the project, said.
“At this point, our main priority is to help raise awareness that the Hoya Hub exists and is a resource for those who may need it,” Cohen Derr wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The food pantry is one aspect of a larger university effort to address food insecurity on campus.”
The Hoya Hub student organizers are hopeful that the project will evolve into a space for programming and discussions about food insecurity, which will help eliminate the stigma surrounding food insecurity on campus, Barnes said.
“We would want to do some chef demos, also getting health services involved, so looking at the nutritional educational aspect of it, and just educating everyone about this issue,” Barnes said in an interview with The Hoya.
While the Hoya Hub currently offers nonperishable foods only, the team expressed its hopes for expanding the food pantry to include a refrigerator and a freezer in the future, in addition to having a larger space for various types of food.
The opening of the Hoya Hub has crossed what may be the biggest hurdle to food security on campus and has given way to more attempts to raise awareness for this issue, Álvarez said.
“We are coordinating with other student advocates to address the broader issues of socioeconomic inequality, poverty, sustainability, and food waste that contribute to hunger at Georgetown,” Álvarez said.

The McDonough School of Business Executive Master’s in Business Administration program reached its highest rate of female enrollment ever this year, with 45 percent female students.
The 20-month program specializes in skills relevant to mid- to senior-level managers as they build on their experience and deepen their understanding of executive management, even as students to continue to work full time.
Nita Swinsick, senior director of recruitment and admissions for executive degree programs, said the diversity of the class, which also includes 14 percent international students, along with their range of perspectives, will add to the EMBA students’ learning experiences.
“The Georgetown EMBA is truly transformative and during the program students will learn a wide range of skills,” Swinsick wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Being part of a diverse cohort with participants from many different backgrounds, our students also learn a lot from one another.”
The program curriculum uses a combination of case studies, lectures, simulations and group projects. Classwork differs by professor, but Swinsick said the ideal student in the program must be driven and collaborative in order to succeed.
“Students who are motivated tend to do well in our Executive MBA program. Our EMBA students maintain full-time jobs while completing the rigorous program, which is why motivation is key,” Swinsick wrote.
Swinsick said the program looks to provide personal support during the application process and throughout the program for all prospective students, but especially for women and other minorities. The personal help is designed to make students feel comfortable expressing their concerns. The program also tries to connect students to alumni with similar backgrounds to facilitate conversation and act as mentors through its active alumni network.
“We try to ensure that we have women alumni at our recruitment events who are available to speak with prospective students about their questions,” Swinsick wrote. “As our alumni have been through the admissions process and the program, we find that these firsthand experiences are very helpful.”
Swinsick said the program also encourages prospective students to have one-on-one meetings with admissions staff and puts them in touch with alumni.
“We find that sometimes prospective students are not comfortable with sharing all of their questions or concerns in group settings, so one-on-one meetings are helpful,” Swinsick wrote. “We also try to connect prospective students with alumni from similar backgrounds to help provide further insights about life during and after the program.”
Swinsick said the program would continue its current practices to engage women and provide mentorship for them in order to build on the current success of the program.
“We will continue to engage in the same kind of activities and we’re always looking for new ways to highlight the success of our female graduates,” Swinsick wrote.

Rose Gottemoeller (SLL ’75), deputy secretary general and highest-ranking civilian woman in North Atlantic Treaty Organization, received the International Trailblazer Award from the Georgetown Institute of Women, Peace and Security on Sept. 26.
Ambassador Melanne Verveer, executive director of GIWIPS, and Shehrazade Semsar-de Boisseson, a member of the Georgetown University board of directors, presented the International Trailblazer Award, which honors those who further women’s roles in peace and security. Last week’s ceremony in Brussels was attended by NATO representatives, European Union officials and Georgetown alumni, as well as Gottemoeller’s family, friends and co-workers.
“Our mission is to focus on those individuals who have played a leading role, a pioneering role—a trailblazing role, if you will—in furthering women’s engagement in peace and security.” Verveer said in an interview with The Hoya.
Gottemoeller is the highest-ranking civilian woman in NATO’s history and has been working as the deputy security general of the organization since 2016. Her career has included posts as the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security and the assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, among other positions.
“She is the deputy secretary general. There’s never been a woman in that role, so she is already blazing a trail by being in that position,” Verveer said. “The affection for Rose is palpable. People truly respect and admire her and understand the quality of her leadership.”
Throughout her career, Gottemoeller advocated for gender equality.
“NATO has been the most successful military alliance throughout history, but attention to the role of women in security has not always been at the top of NATO’s priority list,” Gottemoeller said in a Sept. 26 GIWPS news release.
As Deputy Security General, Gottemoeller pushed NATO to reinvigorate its efforts to include women in conversations about national security. Her efforts have led to the deployment of “Gender Advisers” to bolster female participation in NATO-led initiatives.
“She has been a role model, she has acknowledged that women have been underrepresented in the security sector. That is beginning to change, and her example is certainly an impetus for change” Verveer said. “Peace and security is not a women’s issue. It’s an issue that affects all of us and women’s engagement with the issue is for the benefit of all of society.”
Throughout Gottemoeller’s time with the organization, NATO increased its focus on the role that women can play in the security sector. With this comes an increased number of female leaders in NATO and in politics around the world.
“I think it is a time to think very positively and embrace these opportunities with confidence,” Verveer said.
Gottemoeller’s acceptance of the Trailblazer Award is also memorable because of her status as a Georgetown University alumna.
“This was the first time her rather extraordinary achievement has been noted through a special award by the University,” Verveer said. Her alumna status, “made [the ceremony] that much more special.”
Past recipients of the International Trailblazer Award include First Deputy Chairwoman of the Verkhovna Rada, Iryna Gerashchenko; co-founder of the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition Monica McWilliams; and Burmese human rights activist May Sabe Phyu.
“They’ve been women who in their professional work, or in their work at NGOs, have really demonstrated extraordinary leadership in peace and security,” Verveer said about the recipients. “In giving these awards, we hope it says these issues matter.”

The School of Continuing Studies’ Sports Industry Management program’s partnership with professional soccer team FC Barcelona continued in July with a trip to Barcelona and a meeting with team executives.
Daniel Kelly, the faculty director of the Sports Industry Management program, said in an interview with The Hoya that the program grants students entry to the Soccer Leadership Summit and “high-level access” to everyone involved in FC Barcelona. Planning for the partnership began in summer 2016 and the program itself started a year later, with the School of Continuing Studies hosting the Soccer Leadership Conference in July 2017.
This past summer, 22 graduate students traveled to Barcelona to meet with FC Barcelona executives and to learn about sports management on a global level, further expanding the partnership.
Prior to the FC Barcelona partnership, the Sports Industry Management program had partnerships with Under Armour and Washington, D.C. sports teams, like the Washington Redskins and D.C. United, Kelly said. However, given FC Barcelona’s status as the third most valuable sports franchise, Kelly noted that the partnership is a big deal for Georgetown. “It allows us to be seen as equal partners,” he said.
“With the addition of FC Barcelona, [the program] had a global reach it didn’t have before,” Kelly said.
The entire faculty is involved in the partnership, Kelly said, and courses can be tailored to students’ and professors’ experiences with FC Barcelona.
“We get some of [FC Barcelona’s] high-level executives to guest lecture,” Kelly said. Students gain a practical idea of what goes on in the real world of sports management, and faculty can adjust their classes according to their experiences with the program, according to Kelly.
Students are also working with FC Barcelona executives on their capstone projects, which FC Barcelona will implement, according to Kelly.
In February 2018, students in the Sports Industry Management program applied for a summer FC Barcelona leadership course that included a trip to Barcelona for the Soccer Leadership Summit. Selected students traveled to Barcelona in August, and upon returning home completed projects based on the experiences they had throughout the trip and presented them at the end of the month.
Adam Perez, a second-year graduate student in the Sports Industry Management program, said in an interview with The Hoya that the partnership with FC Barcelona is one of the reasons he applied to Georgetown, since the announcement came out as he was applying to graduate programs. Perez was one of the students selected for the summer leadership course and trip to Barcelona. He attended the summit and took the course focused on the business side of international soccer clubs.
The program is “a great way to get FC Barcelona to globalize itself and help their business in the US and around the world” and “a win-win” for both FC Barcelona and Georgetown, Perez said.
During their trip to Barcelona, the students attended meetings with FC Barcelona executives, including the Strategy and Knowledge Director, the Head of Business Development and Innovation, and the FC Barcelona Museum Director. The meetings included open discussions between the students and executives.
The program is now in phase two, where Georgetown and FC Barcelona are looking for “points of interest to enhance their partnership,” Kelly said. The program is currently working to place a graduate student in an internship within the club in Spain and to develop a course based on the partnership.

Matias Burdman (COL ’21) and Anna Landre (SFS ’21) are running unopposed for two seats on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E in the upcoming election Nov. 6.
Burdman and Landre, who are expected to win, would serve as representatives for Georgetown University as commissioners for single-member districts 08 and 04 for two-year terms.
SMD 08 and 04 are within the bounds of Georgetown’s campus to allow for student representation on the commission. ANC 2E is an eight-person governing body that meets monthly to pass resolutions on issues affecting Georgetown University, Burleith, Hillandale and Georgetown. After discussing the resolutions, the proposals are sent to the Washington, D.C. city government for consideration. Although Burdman and Landre would deal with various neighborhood concerns regarding topics like traffic, trash and construction if they win, both hope to address key concerns for the student body as well.
Burdman said he seeks to improve Georgetown students’ access to public transportation.
“I would say that Georgetown is chronically under-connected and underserved when it comes to the whole Washington, D.C. transportation network,” Burdman said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think that is something that should be addressed and something we can definitely work on through the ANC.”
Landre said she is running on a platform of increasing accessibility within Georgetown, building upon her work as accessibility policy team chair for the Georgetown University Student Association to promote accessibility on Georgetown’s campus.
“Because we are a historic area, a lot of people think that the historical integrity of certain buildings and accessibility are mutually exclusive, but that’s not that case, and there are a lot of innovative ways that we can change that,” Landre said in an interview with The Hoya.
Both Burdman and Landre expressed interest in working with on-campus infrastructure projects, specifically in relation to the campus plan, a 20-year plan focused on renovations, academic programs and off-campus activities.
“We want to make sure that the way that they are doing this and the decisions that are being made happen with the students’ best interests in mind,” Burdman said.
To ensure a smooth transition, Burdman and Landre plan to be actively involved with on-campus meetings relating to master planning and the Georgetown Community Partnership.
If elected, Burdman and Landre would take over the ANC seats of Zachary Schroepfer (SFS ’19) and Mara Goldman (SFS ’19). Goldman’s seat has remained empty since she stepped down in June earlier this year because after moving off campus she no longer lived within the bounds of the district she represented. After informal interviews with potential candidates, Schroepfer and Goldman decided to endorse Burdman and Landre, who found themselves without competition following the endorsements.
Goldman said that the commission enables students to have a voice in district politics in ways they otherwise could not.
“We make up a pretty significant portion of the district’s population and a lot of us are unrepresented since we are registered to vote in other cities or states,” Goldman said in an interview with The Hoya. “Having student representation allows us to have a student voice within the district government of a city that is significantly student-based.”
Though Burdman is running as a write-in candidate and his name will not appear on the ballot, unlike Landre’s, he said he does not expect this fact to impact his election.
According to ANC 2E Chair Joe Gibbons, the work and ideas by SMD-08 and -04 commissioners over the last two years have brought a different perspective to the community. Gibbons hopes to see a continuation of positive work put forth by the two future SMD commissioners.
“I’ve met the two incoming commissioners each individually, and we’ve talked about the different areas of interests,” Gibbons said in an interview with The Hoya. “They’re wonderful young people, so I’m really looking forward to working with them.”

U.S. President Donald Trump’s China policy transforms the West’s historic attitude toward China, former Singaporean diplomat and professor at the National University of Singapore Kishore Mahbubani said at an event entitled “Has the West Lost It?” on Monday in Healy Hall’s Riggs Library.
During the event, Mahbubani discussed his new book “Has the West Lost It? A Provocation.” Victor Cha, the D.S. Song-KF endowed chair in international affairs, moderated the discussion. The Georgetown Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues and the Office of the President co-sponsored the event.
Mahbubani said the U.S.-China trade war that began last spring when Trump put tariffs on Chinese imports demonstrates a shift in U.S. policy towards China.
“The Trump administration is not trying to reach a deal,” he said. “It is trying to alter the playing field in a very fundamental way and that’s a different game.”
According to Mahbubani, the escalation of the trade war came as a surprise to Chinese leaders.
“It has come as a big shock to the Chinese leaders who have come to realize that what is happening now between the U.S. and China is something completely different,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani said that China is ready to work with the United States to end the current trade war.
“The Chinese are prepared to make a deal,” Mahbubani said. “This is the fundamental question: is [the trade war about] a trade deficit, which is one probability or is it about China developing technological capability which they will one day do better than the United States?”
Mahbubani said that an attitude of complacency at the end of the Cold War and the belief that Democracy had triumphed over Communism caused the West to overlook the rise of powers like China.
“The West [went] to sleep at precisely the moment when the rest of the world was waking up,” he said. “At precisely the moment that China and India were waking up.”
The West continued to neglect the growing power of China and its admission into the World Trade Organization in the wake of 9/11, according to Mahbubani
“The effect of 9/11 was that the United States and some European countries marched into wars in the Middle East and got engrossed in wars there and did not notice something more fundamental happening in 2001 which was China’s admission into WTO,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani said China’s admission to the WTO brought an influx of labor to the world market, causing many Western countries to see domestic jobs go over sea and creating the space for leaders like Donald trump to gain power.
“The reason why China’s admission in 2001 into the WTO was far more significant is because according to Western theories of economics, according to Joseph Schumpeter and creative destruction, when you suddenly inject 900,000,000 new workers into the global capitalist system there will be creative destruction so workers lost their jobs,” Mahbubani said. “And then you see fifteen years later the election of Donald Trump.”
Western countries ignored China’s surge to economic power in 2014, according to Mahbubani.
“In 2014, in one of a major historical moment, China’s share [of the global economy] became larger than that of the United States and nobody noticed that that happened,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani explained that he wrote his book to demonstrate that Western countries could lose their standing in global affairs if they do not actively protect the current liberal world order.
“Has the west lost it? And the answer is no. But more accurately, not yet,” Mahbubani said. “Because my big fear, and the reason why I wrote this book now, is that the west could very well lose it if it continues going on autopilot.”
According to Mahbubani, people throughout the world enjoy greater peace and prosperity than any other time in history.
“The biggest truth of our times is that humanity has never been in a better condition than it is today,” Muhbubani said. “Today we are living in the most peaceful time ever in human history.”
Mahbubani recommend that the West adopt a policy of multilateral intervention.
“I am asking for minimalist unilateral interventions and I am asking for maximalist multilateral interventions. So yes, intervene but do it multilaterally.”
In order to achieve this policy of multilateral intervention, the West will have to cooperate with countries with which it may not have otherwise allied, according to Mahbubani.
“You have to work with countries that you are uncomfortable with if you want to solve global problems,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani encouraged Asian countries to assume the responsibility of protecting the current world order because they benefitted the most from it.
“But today, the biggest beneficiaries of this Western created order, the liberal international rules-based order, are the Asian societies. So the Asian societies who have been in one way or another, I’m exaggerating a bit, have been free riders on this liberal international rules-based order have got to stop being free riders.”
Mahbubani said that Asian governments are reluctant to assume the burden of defending the liberal world order but that future Asian governments will have to take responsibility for protecting that world order.
“Unfortunately, no Asian government is, of now, ready and willing to take on the job of custodianship,” Mahbubani said. “The burden is going to fall on the young Asians to take on some the responsibilities that the West used to undertake.”

Gentrification threatens Washington, D.C. jazz and art, jazz musician and composer Jason Moran said at an event Tuesday in Copley Lounge.
Moran, a distinguished artist-in-residence at Georgetown University and the Kennedy Center musical advisor and artistic director of jazz, has composed soundtracks for six films including the 2014 movie “Selma.”
Associate Professor of the History Department Maurice Jackson joined Moran during the event, “DC Jazz: Stories of Jazz Music in Washington, D.C.”
The event was titled after Moran’s new book, which discussed music culture in the District. Curator of Music and Performing Arts at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African-American History and Culture Dwandalyn Reece moderated the discussion.
Moran said developers capitalize on D.C.’s artistic history, naming new buildings after artists like Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, even as they replace important cultural institutions with new apartments.
“Do we let cultural institutions like a club, I consider it an institution, do we let the club go away? Right, and then we forget it. And then maybe they build a high-rise there and they call it Ellington,” Moran said. “They call one of these buildings Coltrane or something like that. So they sell the idea of the culture, meanwhile wash it away.”
Washington, D.C., and specifically the U Street Corridor neighborhood, gained fame as a center of American jazz and black culture in the first half of the 20th century. Colloquially called “Black Broadway,” U Street was home to many famous black artists and intellectuals, according to Washingtonian. Jazz icons such as Louis Armstrong played on U Street during the height of its fame, Washingtonian reported.
New buildings on U Street, including an upscale apartment building called The Ellington, force people who traditionally created the renowned music scene of the city to leave, Jackson said.
“There are buildings going up everywhere, and people are being forced out,” he said, discussing the modern state of music in D.C.
Jackson said District schools suffered budget cuts that gutted music programs, further damaging D.C. arts.
“That is what is happening now, the idea of legislating out the music, and legislating out these things,” Jackson said. “What was first thing that the public schools did when the budgets got low? They took out music, and they took out PE.”
Moran said he struggles to reconcile the contrast between the Kennedy Center — a cultural icon of D.C. — and the threats to on-the-ground development of music in the District.
“It’s very frustrating sitting and working at a place like the Kennedy Center which is — our job at the Kennedy Center is to make sure that the culture is held and people are able to feel it from all around the world and people do look at the institution for us to do that,” Moran said. “But I also know that the root of our music evolves is on the ground.”
Jackson said his new book aims to contribute to cultivating a welcoming culture in D.C.
“With this book we hope it can recreate this city in a mold where black people really feel welcome,” he said.
Moran hopes musicians will continue to uphold and contribute to the District’s rich and historical music scene.
“I’m really hopeful that something will happen and musicians are fighting for some kind of way to ensure that the music is kept apart of the fabric of the city,” Moran said. “And the city owes it to the musicians who live here to create the culture that attracts people.”

The university reiterated its disapproval of social Greek organizations Sept. 16 in a campus-wide email, which discouraged students from joining such organizations because of the organizations’ common association with high-risk behavior such as alcohol abuse.
Greek organizations are inconsistent with the university’s Jesuit values, namely inclusion and respect for the individual, according to the email sent by Jeanne Lord, associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students.
Georgetown does not provide funding or benefits for social fraternities and sororities, and these organizations are not officially recognized by the university.
“I write today to remind you that Georgetown University does not support a social Greek system: social fraternities and sororities are not eligible for access to University benefits, nor do they have the benefit of University oversight,” Lord wrote.
About 10 percent of Georgetown students participate in fraternities and sororities, according to the Georgetown University Student Association.
Administrators have sent a similar message to students at the beginning of the academic year since 2015. This year’s email specifically mentioned the second Council of Advisory Boards fair on Oct. 13, a new addition to the club recruitment cycle this year, which will provide students a second chance to meet club members.
GUSA released an open letter rebutting the university’s justification of its policies toward Greek organizations. The letter, which was included in GUSA’s weekly newsletter, argued the policy is unfounded because Greek organizations demonstrate diversity, are more inclusive than many other student organizations and are supported by other Jesuit institutions.
“For many, Greek organizations are spaces to find community, enhance leadership skills, and develop into people for others,” GUSA’s letter read. “The administration doesn’t need to recognize Greek life for us to acknowledge that it’s an important part of many students’ Georgetown experiences.”
The letter also took issue with the administration’s claim that social Greek organizations are associated with high-risk behavior, arguing this behavior is not unique to Greek life and pointing out the progress organizations have made in changing their culture.
Monica Rivero (COL ’20), GUSA liaison to unrecognized student groups, echoed the letter’s sentiment, stating that clubs that are recognized by the university can also lead to high-risk behavior.
“GUSA also acknowledges that both unrecognized and recognized student groups on campus can serve as places for high risk behavior,” Rivero wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are committed to moving forward and cooperating with students to ensure that we can foster safe and healthy social spaces on-campus.”
The letter affirmed GUSA’s commitment to allowing students to have an option to engage or not in Greek life on campus.
“Whether you choose to join a Greek life organization or not, GUSA will ensure that decision remains up to you,” according to the letter.
