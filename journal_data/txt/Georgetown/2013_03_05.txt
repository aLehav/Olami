Pope Benedict XVI officially stepped down as pontiff and became Pope Emeritus of the Roman Catholic Church Feb. 28 after announcing that he would leave his position Feb. 11.
The pope’s resignation marks the beginning of sede vacante — a  Latin phrase meaning ‘empty seat’ — a period marking the lack of Catholic leadership as the College of Cardinals elect a new pope in a process called conclave.
Traditionally, at least 15 days of mourning precede the beginning of a conclave, but Benedict amended the Vatican Constitution to allow conclave to convene as early as nine days after resignation.
Once conclave begins, the approximately 115 cardinals who are eligible to vote will be locked in the Sistine Chapel and barred from all communication with the outside world until they reach a two-thirds majority in their decision for Benedict’s successor. Given the unprecedented advanced warning and time for consideration, this conclave is not expected to last as long as it normally does.
“I think it will be a fast conclave because of the long time elapsing between the announcement of resignation and the beginning of conclave,” theology professor Fr. John O’Malley, S.J., wrote in an email. “I’m sure some cardinals already have their first choice, but they also know that they have to be flexible because of the two-thirds majority required.”
Despite the several weeks available to consider the question of succession, experts and speculators alike are hesitant to predict a leading candidate.
“Peculiar this time is not so much that there is no ‘front runner’ or cardinal with [a] strong public profile, but that there does not seem to be even a group of five or six who are ‘likely,’” O’Malley wrote.
However, O’Malley indicated that certain qualities are to be expected of the next pontiff, namely a desire to streamline the Roman Curia and Vatican bureaucracy in order to help the officials coordinate more effectively and more efficiently.
The most prominent American papal candidate, Timothy Cardinal Dolan, Archbishop of New York and President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that he did not believe he would be elected.
“I’ve got a round-trip ticket,” Dolan said in an interview with CBS New York on Monday.
Meanwhile, Catholics around the world are flocking to Rome and the Vatican to participate in the historic proceedings and to send their prayers and farewells to Benedict. According to the Vatican, more than 200,000 people filled St. Peter’s Square on Sunday for the Pope’s final Angelus address and 50,000 people requested tickets for Wednesday’s audience.
Sue Marie Breden (COL ’14), who will head to Rome on Saturday with the Georgetown University Chamber Singers, said that this is a fascinating time for the city.
“With the conclave being so close and the [Italian] elections going on at the same time, I just get the feeling that there’s going to be a heightened sense of excitement,” she said.
Services of Thanksgiving on Benedict’s behalf were held throughout the Archdiocese of Washington, whose leader, Archbishop Donald Wuerl, is also a cardinal elector. Wuerl will participate in the conclave and left for Rome on Sunday, according to his office.
The university also participated in wishing Benedict well, holding a Mass in his honor on Tuesday evening in Dahlgren Chapel.
The Vatican announced in a press release that they expect the new pope to be installed before Holy Week, the most important week in the Catholic liturgical calendar, which begins March 24.

Scott Ginsburg (LAW ’78) is suing Georgetown University Law Center for breach of contract and fraud.
Ginsburg, a Dallas businessman, donated $5 million to the law center in 2000, designated toward construction of the proposed Scott K. Ginsburg Health and Fitness Center on campus, and another $2.5 million over the next decade. However, the fitness center currently does not bear his name.
Law center officials offered Ginsburg an altered donation agreement that excluded naming rights when the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Ginsburg of insider trading. However,Ginsburg claimed that he did not sign an altered agreement with Georgetown.
Ginsburg is attempting to recover the full $7.5 million of his donations to Georgetown.

While Georgetown officials say that President Obama’s College Scorecard system, announced in his Feb. 12 State of the Union speech, is a commendable effort to help parents and high school students make informed financial comparisons of colleges nationwide, the system fails to take into account intricacies of Georgetown’s financial aid structure.
The scorecard initiative, the result of a cooperative effort between the White House and the U.S. Department of Education’s College Affordability and Transparency Center, evaluates each institution on the basis of cost, graduation rate, loan default rate, median borrowing and post-graduation employment. The results for each institution are then compared to a national average.
Georgetown’s “average net price,” which is what undergraduate students pay after grants and scholarships are subtracted from the institution’s cost of attendance, is listed as $26,521 per year, which is considered “high.” However, the loan default rate of 1.3 percent is below the average of 13.4 percent, and the median borrowing rate of $212.90 per month is in the “medium” range. Georgetown’s six-year graduation rate is “high” at 93.8 percent.
According to Georgetown’s Office of Student Financial Services, the average total student loan debt for Georgetown’s Class of 2011 was about $12,000, which Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming (SFS ’72) said is well below average national debt.
But according to Fleming, these numbers do not tell the whole story.
“Every financial aid package offered to a prospective Georgetown student reflects our commitment to meeting full need and differs based on the financial situation of the individual applicant,” Fleming wrote. “Therefore, the average net cost figure on the Scorecard might unintentionally result in discouraging some potential students from applying when they might receive significantly more aid than the Scorecard might suggest and thus have a very low net cost.”
Fleming stressed that Georgetown’s unique efforts to meet full need and to individuate financial aid packages will continue regardless of their poor representation on the Scorecard.
“The university has a long-standing commitment to its financial aid policy of meeting full need, and the university works very hard to hold down debt incurred by our undergraduates,” Fleming wrote. “Those are policies that we are very proud of and on which we continue to work, and I would not want to see the Scorecard undermine that.”
The Department of Education has not yet collected data on graduate employment but hopes to eventually incorporate that data into the system.
According to the Cawley Career Center’s Senior Survey Report for the Class of 2011, 66 percent of graduates are employed full-time. An additional 20 percent are enrolled in graduate or professional school.
While the Scorecard’s assessments are based on the university as a whole, the Career Center’s employment numbers also conduct a breakdown based on school: 52 percent of College graduates, 69 percent of School of Foreign Service graduates, 90 percent of McDonough School of Business graduates and 74 percent of School of Nursing and Health Studies graduates were employed full-time, with average starting salaries of $48,911, $50,267, $61,802 and $50,763, respectively.
Obama originally proposed the College Scorecard in January 2012, and the federal government released a preliminary version last June. Last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also released a Financial Aid Comparison Shopper meant to help families calculate the cost of college.
