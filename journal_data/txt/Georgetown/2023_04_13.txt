A Georgetown University professor who specializes in medical anthropology received the esteemed Guggenheim Fellowship, which honors exceptional scholars in the social sciences, natural sciences, humanities and creative arts.
School of Foreign Service (SFS) professor Emily Mendenhall was one of 171 scholars chosen from a field of roughly 2,500 applicants to receive funding for an academic research project. With her grant, Mendenhall plans to study the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and various unrecognized symptoms of the virus.
Mendenhall is the author of four books, including her most recent publication “Unmasked,” which surveys the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in her hometown of Okoboji, Iowa.
Before the onset of the pandemic, Mendenhall researched syndemics, or the adverse interactions of disease and social conditions, in Soweto, South Africa. There, she profiled how spirituality and mental health can impact physical well-being. Though her time was cut short by the global health crisis, Mendenhall was still able to publish several journal articles about her research, including a case study about cancer in a South African town.
Mendenhall said the fellowship will offer a much-needed reprieve from a hectic period in her life, during which she hopes to not just expand her academic horizons but also give herself the time to reflect and recharge.
“I was eager to find a fellowship that would provide intellectual space to rest, think, read, and write after a hectic decade of having kids, working toward tenure and promotion, and living through a pandemic,” Mendenhall wrote to The Hoya.
Lahra Smith, an associate professor in the Georgetown African Studies program, said Mendenhall offers an interdisciplinary perspective that bridges the gap between biology and anthropological theory, two subjects that may not appear to be related at first glance.
“Her work has long focused on mental health broadly and her new project takes up the interconnectedness of disease and trauma in the context of long Covid,” Smith wrote to The Hoya. “Prof. Mendenhall is uniquely situated to bring comparative and field-based knowledge to these questions.”
Ken Opalo, an assistant professor in the SFS, said Mendenhall’s research adds key insight into the intersections between socioeconomic status and physical health on the continent.
“Her work provides a lens through which to understand how inequality and poverty may exacerbate medical conditions in African states,” Opalo wrote to The Hoya.
Opalo said Mendenhall’s “Unmasked” ties public thought into the world of the COVID-19 pandemic in an interesting way.
“More recently, her book on the pandemic showed how political/cultural identities influence people’s understanding and response to public health crises,” Opalo wrote.
In addition to her specialization in medical anthropology, Mendenhall said her recent work has allowed her to expand her literary interests by writing a historical novel about the fascinating life of a family member.
“I’m also finishing a novel about my great grandmother who lived under a secret identity for seven decades and was a spy for the Irish Independence Movement,” Mendenhall wrote. “The book is about trauma and recovery — as well as her extraordinary life. It’s been fun to explore a new genre of writing!”
Mendenhall said she hopes to help undergraduate students understand that pathways to success are often not straightforward and can include a healthy dose of setbacks.
“Take chances, accept failure, and keep trying,” Mendenhall wrote. “I wish students knew about the multitude of failures in my career — staying positive, taking risks, keeping an open heart and mind, and learning with and from people with different life experiences is crucial to growing and changing through life.”

For many law school graduates, working on Capitol Hill is an out-of-reach dream because of low salaries and a high cost of living.
The Capitol Hill Fellowship Program, a new initiative from the Georgetown University Law Center, seeks to change that dynamic by offering a stipend of $20,000 to as many as five graduates who take volunteer positions on the Hill in fall 2023. The fellowship aims to build upon existing pathways between the Law Center campus and legislative offices by increasing the accessibility of volunteer work.
Legislative offices that are interested in hosting fellows can apply to do so — including at the request of a law student who wishes to work in a specific office, according to a Law Center press release.
Josh Chafetz, a professor of law at the Law Center, said the fellowship will help expand current opportunities that law school graduates have to work in the nation’s legislative branch.
“I think these fellowships are great,” Chafetz wrote to The Hoya. “They’ll allow the law school to deepen and broaden our already-impressive connections with the Hill, and they’ll ensure that more recent graduates who want to begin careers on the Hill will have the opportunity to do so.”
Noah Widmann (GRD ’23), who served as treasurer of the Georgetown Law chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said the new funding opportunity will assist those interested in working in public service.
“I think that the fellowship is actually a really great opportunity for people that come to Georgetown specifically to seek out public interest,” Widmann told The Hoya. “Whether that’s the Hill in the short term or the long term or whether it’s getting their foot in the public service world, I think that this is a great opportunity for that.”
The fellowship will help students reach their goals of working on Capitol Hill by circumventing obstacles like financial strain, according to Widmann.
“When you’re in an environment where you’re at a top school like Georgetown, a lot of people tend to kind of think that there’s only one track to go down,” Widmann said. “I think this fellowship’s a really great opportunity for people to just be able to follow the path they intended.”
Widmann graduated from Columbia University as a transfer student from community college and said the fellowship will go a long way in terms of financial inclusion and accessibility.
“I’m the first to go to any kind of college from my family,” Widmann said. “I think that this represents such a seismic shift in the representation that, you know, the people we’re selling to the Hill are going to have, and I think that that’s a huge deal, right?”
Many young professionals after earning law degrees take unpaid or low-paying, but full-time, volunteer positions on Capitol Hill in which they gain valuable experience and do important work for less than a living wage. However, the high cost of living in Washington, D.C., means such jobs are not financially viable for many qualified law school graduates.
The Law Center’s Assistant Dean Morgan Lynn-Alesker (GRD ’07) said she acknowledges the financial barriers posed by such Hill positions.
“This fellowship will give our graduates a chance to apply their law school training as they gain experience, network, and open doors for employment opportunities,” Lynn-Alesker wrote to The Hoya.
Lynn-Alesker also said the fellowships will facilitate long-term jobs in Congress and the federal government for Law Center graduates.
“We are thrilled to pilot a fellowship program that will launch careers in public policy and civic engagement,” Lynn-Alesker wrote.
Widmann said increased pathways to Capitol Hill will bring more voices, including ones that are historically underrepresented, to discussions of public policy.
“I think that when you take away these financial burdens and barriers, you just simply are going to have a better representation of the country going to the place where decision making for the country’s policy happens,” Widmann said.

The McDonough School of Business (MSB) is launching a new four-day professional certificate in business sustainability, the first of its kind. 
Admitted students will participate in four days of programming with the stated goal of walking away with a sustainability-oriented mindset and a clear-cut sustainability strategy for their respective businesses and organizations. The Georgetown University Office of Executive Education will offer the program for $3,800 dollars per participant from May 4-7.
Certificate faculty include Vishal Agrawal, the academic director of the MSB’s Business of Sustainability Initiative, and Safak Yucel, an assistant professor of operations management. There will be 11 sessions covering topics ranging from sustainable supply chain management to carbon neutrality, according to the program website.
The program emerged from demand from those in the field for green solutions in modern business and technological landscapes, according to Agrawal.
“We received several requests from alumni and practitioners who wanted to learn more about cutting-edge research and best practices related to sustainable business,” Agrawal wrote to The Hoya. “Therefore, we conceived a short and focused program on this topic to be offered over a short period of time, which would enable participants to attend despite working full time.”
Agrawal said he is looking forward to connecting participants with actionable sustainability solutions.
“I am particularly excited about the sessions which help participants learn how to make the business case for sustainability,” Agrawal wrote. “That is, not only learn the best practices related to sustainable business, but learn how to actually make it happen in their organization.”
Sophia Pezeshkan (CAS ’26), who works in the MSB Technology Center, said she feels providing professionals with sustainability training may help create a shift within the culture of executive positions to consider environmental impact more seriously. 
“In general, I think that’s amazing,” Pezeshkan said. “I think it will help raise awareness, and especially with established business people because it’s usually the younger generations who are more aware of environmental changes. Those are the people who can make a change right now.”
Yucel said the expert faculty involved with the certificate will enable program participants to apply the curriculum to real-world issues immediately.
“This program provides access to a unique set of faculty that conducts cutting-edge, award-winning, practically relevant research on sustainable business,” Yucel wrote to The Hoya. “In addition to our thought-leadership, the program will allow participants to apply their learning the very next day when they go back to their offices. This practical approach, I believe, will be quite useful.”
Yucel said a unique attribute of the program is its relevance to those in the business field and its responsiveness to ongoing changes in the industry. 
“This program is mostly driven by the demand of professionals and companies to better equip future business leaders with a sustainability perspective,” Yucel wrote. “Based on examples from a variety of industries, participants will learn how business model innovation can be implemented to improve both economic and environmental performance, whilst addressing common managerial challenges preventing the adoption of sustainable energy and technology.”
While undergraduate students are ineligible for this certificate, both Agrawal and Yucel said they recommend students in the MSB and across Georgetown’s other schools to research and consider applying for the Sustainable Business Fellows program, which aims to inform aspiring business leaders and entrepreneurs of the modern-day challenges in light of climate change.
Pezeshkan said she hopes the certificate can grow to eventually support Georgetown students in living more sustainable lives.
“I’d appreciate partnering with the certificate to find new sustainable technologies for students in the business school,” Pezeshkan said. “Technology helps avoid wasting paper, but new solutions are always welcome.”

Georgetown University researchers published the most recent data from their study tracking school districts’ implementation of funding from the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) fund, a federal government aid program that has supported schools since March 2020, on April 4.
Researchers at the Edunomics Lab, an institute that explores education finance and its impact on students, compiled a database of how school districts in every state have allocated ESSER funding. The study predicted that given the current pace of spending, federal funds for the program will run out in September 2024. 
The Edunomics Lab runs the only dashboard in the nation that tracks how school districts in all 50 states are allocating ESSER funds, according to Marguerite Roza, the director of the Edunomics Lab and a co-author of the article. The researchers’ study explores how the expenditure of funds reflects the various priorities and outcomes of school districts, with the goal of informing current and future policymakers in the education finance realm.
Roza said their study comes at a pivotal moment as schools spend larger amounts of money in the face of budget constraints as they emerge from the pandemic.
“We’re facing what we call a fiscal cliff,” Roza told The Hoya. “In a year and a half, this money runs out. Districts will have to figure out how to live on less money, and there’s inflation, so people are really struggling with deciding how much to pay teachers.”
The ESSER fund is the largest federal government program that provides funding for schools, according to Katie Silberstein, a co-author of the study and a strategic projects lead at the Edunomics Lab. 
“ESSER is the largest ever one-time infusion of federal funds, and these funds were distributed to districts such that districts with larger concentrations of high-need students received more,” Silberstein wrote to The Hoya. “As our center is regularly exploring equity impacts, we are well-positioned to meet this unique moment to try to understand state and district financial decision-making with their ESSER funds and the impacts on students.”
Silberstein said she hopes the report and the study’s ongoing dashboard will help states make more informed decisions about allocating ESSER funds for the coming year.
“The hope is that states and districts will take the opportunity to assess their current and planned investments, evaluate the impact these investments are having on their students and pivot where necessary in order to make the most of the remaining federal aid,” Silberstein wrote.
The Edunomics Lab received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to conduct this research, according to Roza.
Roza said ESSER funding was distributed over three waves, with the first two occurring during the Trump administration. The Biden administration oversaw the third and largest wave, which provided up to $10,000 per student in high-poverty school districts like those in Detroit and Cleveland. 
ESSER funding contributes nearly $5 billion in total to education every month and will continue to do so until the money runs out, according to Roza.
Roza said the Edunomics Lab study aims to understand the outcomes of ESSER and find nationwide patterns to new spending habits.
“We’ve never had this much cash flow into the system without a whole lot of rules attached to it,” Roza said. “So I think people want to know what happened to the money, and school districts got to decide how to spend it.”
Judy Zhou (SFS ’24), a student researcher who helps Silberstein gather and synthesize data, said the ESSER study could lead to policy implications for states, school districts and students.
“The ESSER dashboard places all states’ ESSER expenditure data in one place, which creates opportunities for conversations that compare spending across states and regions,” Zhou wrote to The Hoya. “Especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, students need support and resources more than ever. The ESSER dashboard has the ability to give us a glimpse into understanding what those needs are through data.”
States cannot force school districts to spend their funding in any particular way, which results in each of the approximately 14,000 school districts in the country making spending decisions through publicly elected school boards, according to Roza. 
Silberstein said states are mostly implementing the funding as the federal government had hoped they would — but these districts also exercise their discretion in many ways.
“ESSER funds were distributed with the purpose of safely reopening schools, and to help meet the academic, social, emotional and mental health needs of students post-pandemic, particularly those most severely impacted,” Silberstein said. “States and districts are meeting these intended uses, though there is wide latitude with those investments.”
Jigyasa Sidana (GRD ’23), a student research assistant on the project, said the Edunomics Lab’s study serves to connect all of these data points and identify larger trends.
“There is diversity in priorities for school level spending across districts and states,” Sidana wrote to The Hoya. “Edunomics Lab is performing a crucial role in this regard — by bringing all data together for quick and accurate analysis.”
Sidana said she hopes the lab’s ESSER dashboard will reach policymakers and influence their future decisions.
“I hope that the policymakers in the U.S. education system utilize the ESSER data analysis to make decisions regarding the ideal level and type of funding for various school needs, determine adequate reporting requirements for school districts and most importantly, ascertain how school level spending impacts student outcomes,” Sidana said.

The Georgetown University Inter-School Academic Council (InterAC), released a statement March 29 urging the university to move from using a distinct college application to the Common Application for undergraduate admissions.
The document was the result of several months of deliberation by the InterAC, a body that brings together Academic Council presidents, the GUSA President, the GUSA Senate Speaker and other designated representatives.
Over 900 colleges and universities, including all Ivy League schools, participate in the Common Application, which allows students to standardize a personal statement and demographic information and submit school-specific supplements and materials. The dashboard on the Common Application allows students to easily track their applications and streamlines the fee waiver process. 
Students wishing to apply to Georgetown must use a separate Georgetown-specific portal and start their application there anew, re-uploading demographic information and essays. Students needing a fee waiver must have their guidance counselor email the university directly or fill out a separate form, rather than using documents already provided on the Common Application. 
The GUSA and InterAC official statement argues that Georgetown’s current application poses accessibility barriers that limit the diversity of Georgetown’s student body. Applications through the Common Application from underrepresented minority populations have increased by 131% over the past eight years — a statistic that far outpaces the increase in diversity in Georgetown’s student body, according to the statement. 
“The Common Application is accessible, navigable, and familiar to high school students, their teachers, and counselors,” the statement reads. “The Georgetown Application is not, and requires additional advising resources. This is a concern for many American high schoolers who are qualified for Georgetown admission but lack available assistance.”
Adrian Ali-Caccamo (SFS ‘24), the president of the Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS) Academic Council and an SFS representative in the InterAC, said that he and other members of InterAC have spoken to Provost Robert Groves on the university’s resistance to using the Common Application. 
“His comments on the Common App issue have been insightful and informative about the logistical and co-related challenges of moving to the Common App,” Ali-Caccamo wrote to The Hoya. “Given the University’s continued use of the Georgetown Application, they have clearly been resistant to a move to the Common App.”
A university spokesperson said Georgetown seeks to hold onto a student-centered approach in its application process. The spokesperson also wrote that the applicant pool continues to grow in esteem and diversity.
“Georgetown’s application preserves a student-centered approach, keeping our process as personal as possible and allowing us to coordinate an alumni interview for nearly all candidates, which gives them an opportunity to directly tell their story,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “The Common Application promotes a larger volume of applications. Even though Georgetown’s application asks students to do more, it puts students first.”
Ali-Caccamo said Georgetown’s distinct application contradicts the university’s Jesuit values and serves as a barrier to entry for prospective students because of the higher degree of institutional knowledge that the application necessitates.
“By using an alternative application system, applicants need some additional degree of institutional knowledge, high-school resources, and counselor support to simply send their materials to Georgetown, which may limit some students before they even have a chance for the admissions office to consider their merit as applicants,” Ali-Caccamo wrote.
Yen-Han Chen (CAS ’25) said using a different application did not serve as a significant barrier in his application process to Georgetown. Still, he said Georgetown may benefit from switching to a more widely used application platform. 
“In the grand scheme of things, it was fine, but the added step feels unnecessary,” Chen said. “I’m not sure what Georgetown would lose if we switched to a more united or more unified application like Common App or Coalition. You know, it would certainly give Georgetown more exposure, make it more accessible to different people.”
Chen said Georgetown would have a larger applicant pool to select its incoming students from if it used the Common Application or Coalition Application. 
“We can discuss how much of a barrier it is, but nobody denies that it would be more convenient for applicants,” Chen said. “If we have a greater pool of applicants, we have a broader talent pool to pick from and really pick for the best and most qualified students.”
Ali-Caccamo said that while responses to the petition have been positive, he will not feel satisfied until Georgetown moves to the Common App. 
“Publishing this statement was an important step, but there is work to be done,” Ali-Caccamo wrote. “Releasing this statement does not alone feel celebratory. I think of it as a way for us to formally state our position to the Georgetown administration. In the broader picture, I will feel better once Georgetown moves to the Common App.”
