In a status hearing Thursday afternoon for Daniel Milzman (COL ’16), who was arrested in March after making ricin in his dorm room, Magistrate Judge Alan Kay accepted the defense’s request to reconvene at a later date when the investigation has seen more progress.
“Our hope is that we’ll have some progress,” Milzman’s attorney, Danny Onorato, said to Kay in his request to delay court.
Milzman’s family, along with a handful of friends and acquaintances, attended the hearing at the U.S. District Court on Thursday, which lasted about five minutes. Past hearings to decide Milzman’s incarceration status had seen as many as 70 attendees.
Milzman, who is charged with possession of a biological toxin, has been held in D.C. Jail since March 21. A magistrate judge originally ordered Milzman released pending trial to seek psychiatric care, but U.S. District Court Chief Judge Richard Roberts overturned that ruling to keep Milzman in custody upon appeal by Assistant U.S. Attorney Maia Miller on March 31.
Georgetown University Police Department officers first found ricin in Milzman’s McCarthy Hall room March 18.
In accordance with the Speedy Trial Act, which sets time limits on the stages of a federal criminal prosecution trial, the current stage expires June 7. Court is scheduled to reconvene for a status hearing June 2.
