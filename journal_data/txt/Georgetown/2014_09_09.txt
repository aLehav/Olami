Spontaneity is still possible in D.C. tattoo parlors, but District tattoo artists are still pushing back against proposed regulations to the industry.
The D.C. Department of Health has eliminated the 24-hour waiting period for tattoos from its proposals for city tattoo parlors, following pushback from tattoo artists on the regulation. Some tattoo artists, however, are protesting the remaining regulation through petitions opposing the revised DOH proposal.
Mason Hogue, a tattoo artist at Embassy Tattoos in Adams Morgan, said that the proposed regulations are unreasonable, since the regulations include stipulations that are not economically feasible, according to tattoo artists.
“It’s almost as if they Googled what not to do and put all that in their proposal,” Hogue said.
Hogue, who moved to D.C. recently from California’s Bay Area, said that D.C. should look to cities with longer histories of tattoo regulations, such as San Francisco.
In July 2012, California enacted the Safe Body Art Act, which mandated that tattoo and piercing parlors register with local governments and participate in yearly health and safety training. The legislation also barred tattoo artists from charging less for tattoos by shirking on safe, quality equipment.
“San Francisco’s regulation is pretty spot on,” he said.
Matt “Fatty” Jessup, the proprietor of Fatty’s Tattoos and Piercings in Dupont Circle has begun circulating his own petition in opposition to the proposals.
“The second draft of regulations is filled with bizarre rules that are impossible to comply with and demonstrate an incomplete understanding of body art practices,” Fatty wrote in the petition.
He highlighted three major problems stated in the second proposal draft: the requirement that tattoo artists use hollow needles, which he said do not exist for tattoos; prohibition from using supplies not registered in the District, even though, according to Fatty and Hogue, there are no registered tattoo supply manufacturers in the District; and the requirement that all tattoo parlors hang a warning sign, listing a contact number for customers who believe that “have been injured at this establishment.”
“This is ridiculous,” Fatty told the Washington Examiner. “They’re trying to scare our customers away.”
As of Monday, the petition has 1,442 supporters.
“Clearly they don’t understand body art practices or the equipment we use,” Fatty wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Additionally, the new proposals call for stricter regulations on waste disposal practices.
Hogue said that while some parts of the law were appropriate, they were washed out by the overly stringent regulations on areas like garbage disposal, as stores have to keep their garbage inside to be approved as sterile.
“One, that is just an unnecessary practice that needs to be implemented, and two, more business or retail locations cannot provide that kind of space, and especially with the rat problem in D.C … To store food, garbage and stuff like that indoors would create more problems than it would protect the customer,” he said.
Both Fatty and Hogue believe that tattoo artists should be more involved in the policy-making process.
“I think having the input and expertise of the body art community is essential. That’s why myself and others in the D.C. body art community formed the D.C. Coalition of Professional Body Artists,” Fatty wrote.
Students who have gotten tattoos while at Georgetown spoke positively of their experience in parlors.
“I went to Jinx Proof on M Street. They had excellent customer service,” Marlene Cox (COL ’16), who has a tattoo of a black feather on her right foot, said. “They talked me through the implications of my chosen placement, size of the tattoo, duration of the procedure, and after care.”
Donald Kim (SFS ’16), who has a tattoo of a Bible verse in Italian, also went to Georgetown’s Jinx Proof.
“They were very cool and awesome. When I went with questions, they were very helpful, they answered all my questions. It was very efficient, and he was very kind,” Kim said.
Though unfamiliar with the proposed regulations, Cox was pleased that the new regulations at least removed the 24-hour waiting period.
“As a rule, parlors never service anyone under the influence. The 24-hour waiting period would only serve to protect the parlor from a lawsuit, I would imagine,” Cox said. “I would not want a 24-hour waiting period. It feels too much like a rule that people unfamiliar with the culture of body art would try to put in place.”

The Healey Family Student Center opened to students Friday with an all-day celebration that included tours, free food and a casino night. The center, which has been in construction since last August, provides students with over 43,000 square feet of space. The building includes a great room, 12 study rooms, three private conference rooms, two dance studios and four music rooms.
The event began with speeches from university administrators including Father Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (CAS ’88), Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, Provost Robert Groves and Director of the Center for Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr. Prior commitments prevented the presence of University President John J. DeGioia, who will attend the center’s dedication in October.
The event began with a blessing from O’Brien, who said that the space represents new opportunities for student growth and change on campus.
“Bless all of our activity that will make this space a new home for us at Georgetown, a gathering space where bonds are made and deepened among us,” O’Brien said. “We celebrate with great joy today all of the bounty knowing that we are called to give what we have received in such abundance.”
O’Brien and Olson said they remembered the space as it was 11 years ago, when it served as a dining hall for campus.
“You heard that when the ultra-modern New South residence hall opened in 1958, this was the main dining hall. It remained that way until the year 2003,” Olson said. “I remember laughter and conversations, which will now come back to this place.”
As an alumnus, O’Brien said that he was pleased to see such expansive change to a space that he once loved.
“We remember fondly this space as the New South Dining Hall. Believe me, it is much improved. On behalf of the alumni community, thank you,” O’Brien said.
Olson said that the HFSC surpassed his expectations and excellently embodies the university’s spirit.
“We have our living greenery on our Hoya Saxa wall — which looks even better than I imagined — we have the comfort and coziness of our breakout rooms, we have the sunny breezy terrace that will open in just a few weeks, we have dance studios upstairs and we have the spirit of Georgetown, alive and well and good and noisy already,” Olson said.
According to Groves, the center represents a new step towards a more cohesive, unified student body, joined together by place.
“We have the strongest academic programs in the world, we have wonderful student clubs and organizations, we have devoted student-athletes and intercollegiate competition, we have campus ministry that serves a variety of needs and through spaces like this, we can gather together to study, to relax, to have fun and to reflect among our peers,” Groves said. “This is all by way of saying that we think at Georgetown, place matters. We can’t do what’s going to go on here in a virtual network system. We have to be face to face, looking at one another in the eyes, and we have to learn what makes others tick, and this is what this kind of space is about.”
The official blessing and dedication of the center will occur Oct. 8.
The HFSC will soon include the pub, Bulldog Tavern, opening Oct. 31, Hilltoss, the new Students of Georgetown Inc. venue, opening Nov. 1 and outdoor terrace Riverside Lounge, opening in four to six weeks.
The terrace, funded by $2.2 million from the Student Activities Fund, was entirely designed and developed by students. According to Olson, without students, the space would never have become a reality.
“My final gratitude is given to the students, because so many students, current and past for more than a decade now have spent hours and hours dreaming about, imagining, arguing over and redesigning and building support for this space,” Olson said. “It is a remarkable story, as there usually is at Georgetown, about student initiatives and ownership, so all of these students, past and present, have made this come to life.”

After the university officially partnered with the Pat Tillman Foundation in May, two graduate students, Wayne Johnson (GRD ’15) and Bonnie Hayes (GRD ’15) were among the 2014 scholar class.
The scholarship fund, which was created after the death of NFL player and veteran Pat Tillman, supports the education of around 60 students from the military each year. This year, the foundation selected 59 students out of more than 7,500 applicants.
Although no Georgetown students were awarded the Tillman scholarship last year, two graduate students and one law student from Georgetown won the scholarship in 2012.
Johnson is currently studying international development in the School of Foreign Service’s master’s program. When on active duty in the military, Johnson, 29, led a counter-improvised explosive device assignment in Afghanistan, spent two years at an army research lab and became an active commander for a parachuting unit.
“I was happiest when I was doing the bomb work because I felt like I was helping people. When I was doing disaster work, that was also a good cause,” Johnson said. “I learned about myself that it’s important to me that I’m engaged in the group cause and helping others.”
When he finished his service, Johnson decided to apply to Georgetown for a variety of reasons including its good reputation, excellent professors, religious affiliation and access to internships.
Johnson credits Elizabeth Ferris’ INAF-698 class “Introduction to Humanitarian Crises” as instrumental to his career path. The class covered different types of aid and how they are delivered across the world.
“The world of humanitarian organizations is an imperfect one, but I think — I hope — that students came away from the course realizing that humanitarian response is constantly evolving in the search for more effective response to people whose lives have been shattered by war or disasters,” Ferris wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The big weakness is the seeming inability of the international system to prevent conflicts in the first place and to devote the necessary attention to post-conflict, post-disaster reconstruction when the television cameras have moved on.”
According to Ferris, Johnson seemed to be extremely engaged in the issues discussed in class.
“He was an enthusiastic and interested student, he asked lots of questions about the reading and class presentations,” Ferris wrote. “I think he was moved by some of the situations we covered and came away with both a better understanding of how the system works — and hopefully many more questions.”
Hayes, 32, the other recipient of the scholarship, is studying in the Sports Industry Management Program at the School of Continuing Studies. Hayes served on the Air Force for seven years, including a stint as a mental health technician in Kuwait. She helped soldiers involved in IED attacks, an experience which propelled her interest in helping war amputees. Currently, Hayes works at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
“The degree is going to help me do one of my dreams, my biggest dream, which is to have my own sporting complex geared toward war amputees,” Hayes said.
Hayes said she chose Georgetown because she knew it would provide her with knowledge to help her achieve her dream.
“At the time, Georgetown was ranked sixth in the nation or in the world,” Hayes said. “It’s awesome because it’s close to me and I wanted to go someplace that had a whole bunch of instructors who were already in the industry who I could learn from.”
Hayes said that one particular professor, Bobby Goldwater, provided useful advice for her future. Goldwater said that he enjoys Hayes’s ability to work effectively in groups.
“Bonnie is a very thoughtful individual,” Goldwater said. “In especially her group projects, she was certainly a valued contributor. She works very well in a team environment. She was very thoughtful in all of her contributions throughout the semesters.”

Following the guidance of the White House and the Office of Civil Rights, the Office of Student Conduct introduced several changes to Georgetown’s sexual misconduct policy last week.
Hearing panels in sexual misconduct cases, which previously included three faculty or staff members and two students, will now consist of two faculty or staff members and one student in order to limit the number of people involved.
Additionally, the university plans to hire outside investigators to look into all complaints prior to conducting a hearing. Previously, sexual misconduct hearings were conducted in the same manner as hearings for other breaches of the code of conduct.
“I really like [the changes] because it looks like what they are doing is that they are trying to standardize a lot of the reporting process and making it less subjective and trying to create a more supportive environment,” Sexual Assault Peer Educator Haley Maness (NHS ’15) said.
The White House created a Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault last January and the Task Force has since issued recommendations for effectively responding to sexual assault incidents and for sexual assault prevention.
The new changes in the sexual assault policy arose after students and faculty members expressed concerns at a forum last spring about Georgetown not having a survivor-centered conduct process.
“A lot of the changes were based on commitments that were made during the Sexual Assault Forum in April,” Georgetown University Student Association President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said. “What the summer provided us with was an opportunity to take stock of all of that was said and figure out what it would look like when we rolled out [the changes] in the fall.”
Under the new policy, survivors of sexual assault can avoid coming face-to-face with their perpetrators during their hearings through the use of closed-circuit video technology. The incorporation of this technology, which has already taken effect, is an effort on the part of the university to make the conduct process more survivor-centered.
“[The cameras] are immediately ready to go, and that will be part of cases going forward,” Tezel said.
In addition to these changes to the student code of conduct, the Division of Student Affairs’ Sexual Assault Working Group has developed a Survivor Bill of Rights. This document serves as a resource to inform survivors of their rights both at Georgetown and at the national level and outlines the sexual misconduct process for both complainants and respondents.
“We are preparing an email that will go out this week about the Survivor Bill of Rights,” Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson said. “It will go out to all students on the main campus and will outline the steps, some of the resources, and will include a link to the Survivor Bill of Rights.”
While the updated code of conduct and the increased resources mark a significant change in the university’s sexual misconduct policy, students and administrators have expressed their hope to see continued conversation with both students and faculty and staff at Georgetown.
“One thing that I recently have found to be really important is seeing faculty members get trained,” Maness said. “Oftentimes when you are in college, you feel a little lost, so you find an adult that can guide you through a difficult time; a lot of the time, you would go to a faculty member about [an issue].”
Last year, the Title IX Office offered training sessions to about 500 Georgetown faculty and staff.
“The Title IX office is ramping up to do a similarly ambitious program this year, so that it reaches a whole lot of individuals that work with students,” Olson said. “There is currently not a program for faculty and staff that is like ‘I Am Ready,’ but this Title IX training is probably the most focused training that directly addresses these issues.”
Beyond these trainings, students are pushing for clearer explanations of who is a mandatory reporter and who is a confidential resource on Georgetown’s campus. Mandatory reporters are administrators, faculty members and staff members who are required to report any student disclosure of sexual assault to the Title IX Office. Sexual Trauma Specialist Erica Shirley is the confidential resource in Counseling and Psychiatric Services, while Sexual Assault and Health Issues Coordinator Jen Schweer and Sexual Assault Services Specialist Bridget Sherry are confidential resources in Health Education Services. Certain faculty members and religious leaders are also designated as confidential resources.
The Women’s Center and the LGBTQ Resource Center are designated as safe spaces, meaning that student disclosures of sexual assault are submitted to the Title IX Office for statistical purposes, but personal information is not released.
“I would love to see it included on syllabi because it means that professors would understand their role and students would understand it, too. It is not necessarily a bad thing that they are mandatory reports. All it means is that they have to let someone else know so that numbers can be reported and that the survivors can have all of the resources necessary,” Maness said. “For me, one of the worst things possible is for a survivor to go to a professor and to disclose and to be surprised when that professor has to tell someone else.”
Formal conversations about sexual assault occurred New Student Orientation this year, as Sexual Assault Peer Educators led discussions about affirmative consent and bystander behavior.
Additionally, student activists and faculty and staff members are looking to improve the sexual assault conversation on Georgetown’s campus through events like “What’s A Hoya,” the freshman-oriented lifestyle program.
“The great thing about ‘What’s A Hoya’ is that we can get a large group of people in one room, but the challenge that you have to work with is that a lot of these conversations should not be taking place in a large lecture hall, so we need to be very conscious of size and what resources on the student side there might be to facilitate smaller group discussions,” Tezel said.

The new Winter Plan released by the District of Columbia’s Interagency Council on Homelessness predicts a 16 percent increase in the number of homeless families seeking services in Washington, D.C, from last year. The report estimates that more than 820 homeless families will need access to resources once the temperature drops below freezing.
The recently approved Winter Plan outlines how the city will ensure it fulfills its obligation under D.C. law to shelter adults and families to keep residents from suffering hypothermia and possible death.
With the expected increase in homeless families, social services and shelters around the city will work more to meet the increased need.
“Clearly, this winter, there was an emergency in the number of beds available for families and youth in the city during the winter, and there’s no reason to think that same situation won’t happen again. So this city is trying to increase capacity through a number of different strategies, but the winter’s right around the corner, and there is a greater demand for shelter than the system has to meet,” James Beck, the development director at Sasha Bruce Youthwork, said.
According to The Washington Post, the expected increase might also delay the closing of D.C. General emergency shelter, which was expected to close this year.
Homelessness also includes families and individuals moving from home to home or living in motels for extended periods of time. These families who do not live in shelters also have access to social services in the city. ThriveD.C., a charity organization that gives aid to struggling individuals also saw an increase of about 15 to 20 percent in the population it serves with assistance during the day.
“We’ve experienced a definite increase in the last 18 months — actually, we could probably say more than that, a couple years, because we have had a number of other agencies that are in our neighborhood close,” ThriveD.C. Development Director Jennifer Paul said.
Adding to the difficulty in accommodating the increased number of homeless families, last winter saw a pattern of homeless families staying longer than expected in shelters due to problems finding affordable apartments, requiring additional space in community centers and motels around the city. The continued increase is linked to the recent economic recession, which in turn affects jobs and incomes.
“The recession has lingered for the poorest segments of our city, and people are struggling – people that were marginally housed have not seen the bounce back that some are claiming in the stock market or the wider economy, so the city continues to have extreme poverty level in particular quadrants,” Beck said. “It’s just a fact that their housing stock is limited; it’s finite, and yet the numbers of people that continue to be victims of the recession are not becoming less.”
At Georgetown, Hoya Outreach Programs and Education work to serve homeless families with programs like Mobile Soup Kitchen and Hoya Dental.
“If any families are stuck outside and they bring their kids to the park, we have a fan through Mobile Soup Kitchen that goes out every other Saturday that brings soup and bananas,” HOPE Co-Chair Gianna Maita (COL ’15) said. “HOPE Dental puts together dental hygiene kits for children and adults and those are the ways that we can contribute in a more tangible way.”
Maita stressed the importance of promoting awareness of these problems outside the front gates.
“Raising awareness on campus is really important for HOPE. Students are frequently thinking about a lot of other problems that are big global programs, and that’s great, but it’s really important to recognize that there are these issues within our own city,” Maita said.
According to Paul, ThriveD.C. is dependent on volunteers, a need that will only increase further at the temperature dips.
“We have a very vigorous volunteer base and an ongoing need for volunteers,” Paul said.

President Obama expanded the federal “Pay As You Earn” program for federal student loan borrowers through executive order this summer, allowing those with loans borrowed before 2007 to be eligible.
Under PAYE, monthly payments on student loans will be capped at 10 percent of the borrower’s income, and the balance will be forgiven after 20 years of payments. Now expanded, government officials estimated PAYE will include about 5 million more people when enacted in 2015.
In accordance with Obama’s executive action, the U.S. Department of Education had renegotiated its contracts with federal student loan services to encourage loan servicers to be more attentive to the needs of their borrowers. According to a press release, the DOE will begin to undergo the process of altering regulations and allowing more borrowers to have payment caps of 10 percent of their income under PAYE, to make sure that students are able to pay off their student debt.
“All hard-working students and families deserve high-quality support from the federal loan servicer, and we are continuing to make sure that is the case,” Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in a press release.
The department also detailed new incentives for lenders to improve customer service and repayment support.
The Department of Education will now allocate federal borrowers to lending services based on new performance standards. Lenders are incentivized by metrics that now weigh customer satisfaction more heavily and reward on-time repayment and low delinquency and default rates. Students currently default at a rate of 10 percent on two-year loans, and nearly 15 percent on three-year loans, according to the Department of Education. The department will implement new contract renegotiations in order to help prevent students from defaulting on their loans and help them in their pursuit of higher education.
Georgetown economics professor Arik Levinson said that although the higher default rates in student loans cost the federal government more, they are an important government service because they provide recent college graduates with wider job options.
“If you go work on Wall Street, you’ll pay it back quickly. If you go work at a lower-paying job, you can pay it back more slowly. Depending on your politics, it could be a good thing. It makes low-income jobs out of college more attractive,” he said.
According to the Institute of College Access and Success, the 70 percent of students nationally who graduated college in 2012 who took out student loans graduated with an average of $29,400 of debt.
“The student loan system is pretty messed up as it is now. … I think what Obama’s doing through executive order is great because Congress is not going to pass anything,” Elizabeth Biener (SFS ’17) said.
To facilitate the increased attention to customer service, the Secretaries of the Treasury and of Education will partner with private tax companies Intuit, Inc. and H&R Block, using their platforms TurboTax and Mint.com to disseminate information on new federal student loan repayment options.
“Obviously, I support more customer service and ease, because I have student loans. … That really determines a big part of your financial future,” Biener said.
The Obama administration also aims to increase the funding of Pell Grants, community and minority-focused colleges, expand college tax credits and simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
Georgetown offers grants, scholarships, and loans to eligible students, based on each individual student’s financial needs.

The university revised the Code of Student Conduct this fall in order to more thoroughly define harassment, hazing and bullying, especially regarding cyberbullying and online harassment.
The previous version of the code defined harassment as “any intentional or persistent act(s) deemed intimidating, hostile, coercive or offensive,” which lacked both a true formal definition and a specific definition concerning online conduct.
The updated code first defines harassment as “any severe, pervasive or persistent act or conduct, whether physical, electronic or verbal, that can be reasonably expected to inflict fear, to intimidate, to incite violence or to force someone to do something against his/her will or self-interest.” It then elaborates on what constitutes harassment, including cyberbullying.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said that the policy demonstrates the administration’s dedication to each student’s well-being.
“These changes to our policies reflect our commitment to ensuring a civil and respectful campus community,” Olson wrote in an email. “Harassment, hazing and bullying (cyber or otherwise) are all acts that demean others, and we want to be clear about how seriously we take these issues.”
Haley Maness (NHS ’15), a recent victim of cyberbullying who addressed the issue with the Office of Student Conduct, said that the university was responsive to her case.
“They were initially very shocked by it,” she said. “So I think they take it a little more seriously. But it was disappointing because there were limited things that they could do. They made sure that I was OK and I was safe, but there was nothing they could really do to move forward with it. … I think they looked at it and said, ‘This is actually impacting people.’”
Maness received a death threat online last year following posts on the Georgetown Confessions Facebook page, but she was encouraged by the university’s quick reaction.
“I was lucky that a lot of the administrators took it very seriously, but a lot of my fellow students were like, ‘That person didn’t mean it,’ ‘It was just a joke’ or ‘You shouldn’t take it that seriously.’ And that was difficult because it was something that really scared me and felt really traumatic to me,” Maness said.
Georgetown University Student Association President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said that he is optimistic about the new policy.
“This will hopefully give the university more tools to root out and identify cyberbullying where it occurs. I hope it comes with additional resources for students who find themselves the victims of cyberbullying,” Tezel said.
Tezel also noted the foresight in updating the hazing policy with the recent growth of on-campus Greek life.
“When it comes to hazing, it will be interesting to see how the university can enforce the new policy because much of this activity takes place off campus and outside the auspices of the university,” Tezel said. “I don’t think it affects Georgetown like it does other schools. With that said, it’s something we have to be constantly aware of, especially with the increase in Greek life on campus in recent years. While Georgetown Greek life has an excellent track record, we have to constantly be vigilant.”
In late spring, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) reintroduced the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act, which is currently making its way through a Senate committee and would require colleges and universities that are receiving federal funds to define anti-harassment policies and to include cyberbullying in those policies.
“I also think that it’s really important that the university is putting it into their policy because things online are legally admissible in court. And so if it’s something that’s admissible in court, it’s something that’s so strictly on the record,” Maness said.
Maness said that she thinks the university’s new policy could change how students view cyberbullying.
“It’s a lot easier for people to do to people online because they’re not strictly talking to that person face-to-face,” Maness said. “And so I think that’s why it’s more frequent. If the university starts taking it more seriously, then people will be more responsible with their actions and with their words. The hard thing is that it’s going to be difficult for some students to come forward and say that.”

This semester, the university released Campus Quad, a new mobile application that connects students to extracurricular life on campus by sending notifications about events and meetings for clubs and organizations.
Georgetown and Stanford University are the first two campuses to incorporate the app.
“[Georgetown students] have the chance to help us create a platform that students across the country can use,” Campus Quad founder Frances Cairns said. “I’m doing this because I think students deserve the right to have mobile access in a modern world and my goal is to enable that and we are waiting to hear what students have to say.”
The app is designed to change how student clubs and organizations interact with the student population.
“Basically there is a dashboard that shows you who is interacting with your content. For clubs and organizations, it’s a really powerful tool. … It’s real time activity and content flowing back and forth,” Cairns said. “On large campuses, the information isn’t always easy to find. … We wanted to build and app that would serve the students and allow students in real time to explore what’s happening and different ways to navigate around campus.”
Specifically at Georgetown, the app aims to make it easier for student groups to promote their events.
“A lot of the times at Georgetown, it’s very tough to get a lot of people to come to your events. You can flyer and send out listserv emails all the time, but sometimes that still doesn’t generate a lot of attendance,” Student Activities Commission Chair Patrick Musgrave (COL ’16) said. “If this were to become used actively on campus, then groups would be able to advertise efficiently and get their message out more because everything is now online and students use their phones all the time.”
The app allows groups and organizations to create mobile flyers to promote an event and push them out to various social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
“It could definitely help out a lot of groups that are maybe smaller and sometimes struggle to have attendance to their events,” Musgrave said.
Ultimately, the app streamlines all the information into a singular feed. Students can customize their feeds by following various clubs and organizations.
“The app gives all groups equal access to all students, allows for users to filter based on interests and enables users to import events that interest them directly into personal calendars,” Georgetown University Student
Association Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) wrote in an email.
The app will continue to be developed in order to incorporate features that are specifically tailored to Georgetown’s student body.
“One of the cool things we can do at Georgetown is to include information on the Google Maps and the Android Maps. It’s the first campus in the nation to have this,” Cairns said. “It will be a data layer with more specific photographs and information about how to navigate the campus. Our question is how can we make the app better and more robust to successfully navigate campus.”
Cairns said she is also very enthusiastic about hearing from students and addressing what students think works best.
“We are really interested in feedback and what we can do it improve it. We totally revamped the app based on the feedback we got at Stanford,” Cairns said.
While the application is still brand new to Georgetown, awareness on campus is growing, according to Musgrave. The app was introduced at Blueprint Training, a program for student leaders to learn about campus resources.
“Presidents have been reached out to about [the app]. It was mentioned at the Blueprint Training [for student leaders] and we will continue to encourage organizations to use the app,” Musgrave said. “Commissioners will also meet with all their groups to finalize budgets and we will push that as a way to promote it even more.”
Kirsten Craddock (COL ’15), club squash captain and vice president of the Undergraduate Bioethics Society, said that she thinks that the app will be an effective outreach tool.
“For both squash and the Undergraduate Bioethics Society, figuring out how to get fans or members to come to events is always a challenge. The way the app works on time and location sound like it could really improve accessibility to events on campus,” Craddock said. “I hope it lives up to expectations and that student groups use it.”
