The McDonough School of Business received a $7.3 million donation to fund an expansion of undergraduate global immersion programs from Joseph Baratta (MSB ’93) and Abigail Baratta (SFS ’96), according to a campuswide email from University President John J. DeGioia on Nov. 22.
Part of the donation will be used to establish the Baratta Endowed Global Business Education Fund, which funds undergraduate opportunities to participate in experiential and immersive learning programs, including the Global Business Experience study abroad program.
The donation will also establish the Baratta endowed chair in global business, a position that will be held by Ricardo Ernst, director of the Global Business Initiative and professor of operations and global logistics in the MSB.
The funds from the donation will go toward paying for the expenses of participants in the MSB’s global immersion programs and part of each recipient’s salary and expenses.
Baratta, the global head of private equity for Blackstone, sits on the university’s board of directors and the MSB’s board of advisers.
The undergraduate portion of the Global Business Experience was first established in 2013 with an earlier gift from the Baratta family. The program allows students to develop and present consulting projects to major companies in Spain, France or Argentina, with the objective of learning how businesses use global strategic thinking.
Interim MSB Dean Rohan Williamson said the donation will expand global opportunities for MSB undergraduates.
“Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business is committed to ensuring all of our students graduate with a global mindset, which will provide the knowledge and context from which our graduates can build successful and impactful careers,” Williamson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Ernst said the funds from the donation will pay for the expenses of participants in the MSB’s global immersion programs, particularly the Global Business Experience.
“The contribution of the Baratta family is supposed to be used to fund, to pay for the expenses of this thing, because you need to pay the airline ticket, hotels, faculty members and all the different expenses and additional incremental costs of doing a program like this one,” Ernst said.
Joseph Baratta said in a university press release that Ernst deserved this honor given all the work he has done for the MSB. The Global Business Fellows is a joint program between the MSB and the School of Foreign Service combining courses in business and international studies.
“Ricardo Ernst has been able to effectively utilize Georgetown’s academic resources and its location in D.C., a city increasingly at the epicenter of global business issues,” Joseph Baratta said in a university statement. “He is dedicated to making Georgetown McDonough the preeminent program for global business studies.”
Ernst said the Barattas’ donation validates the efforts of the Global Business Initiative to make the school more global.
“I’m extremely excited, because it allows us to legitimize the effort that we have put to actually make the McDonough School of Business, and with that Georgetown University, actually move a step further in the direction of becoming a true global university,” Ernst said. “This is extremely exciting. This is extremely good news.”
­DeGioia said the donation highlights the continued importance of global education to the MSB.
“I cannot begin to express my appreciation to Abbie and Joe for their continued dedication to our university and to providing our undergraduate students with the very best opportunities to develop a nuanced, first-hand understanding of international business and the global economy,” DeGioia wrote.
Erik Alfieri (MSB ’17), who participated in the Global Business Initiative, said he is glad the donation will allow more undergraduates to experience the opportunities he had.
“I hugely appreciate the fact that Mr. Baratta invested in the program because I have had great experiences with it,” Alfieri said. “At Georgetown we are so lucky to have this as an option. I don’t know of any other schools that offer this experience. It shows how much he cares about the program.”
Alfieri said the program extended his business education beyond the limits of a classroom.
“The idea that our teachers communicated to us, which I agree with, was you can only do so much learning in the classroom,” Alfieri said. “It definitely showed that it’s hard to make really good decisions without really knowing the culture and the people of the area.”

The Washington, D.C. Council is considering scaling back the ceremonies surrounding President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration Jan. 20 due to concerns over protests and the District’s excessive spending.
According to an article in The New Yorker, hundreds of thousands of protesters are planning demonstrations for the days leading up to the inauguration. One group, the anti-war and civil rights protest group ANSWER coalition, has already received 7,000 commitments from citizens to protest, while civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton is planning to organize a demonstration in front of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on Jan. 14 — just six days before the inauguration.
City organizers are also bringing in 3,200 law enforcement officials and 7,000 national guardsmen from across the country to help direct traffic and control crowds.
Chris Geldart, who is running D.C.’s preparation for the inauguration as the director of the District of Columbia’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, said law enforcement is anticipating protests in response to the inauguration.
“Just looking at what’s happening across the country, we may see more folks come out and exercise their first amendment rights,” Geldart said. “We have plans for that. We plan for that for every inauguration.”
Geldart met with the President-elect’s committee Nov. 18 to discuss preparations for the inauguration and to ensure agencies involved, including security and media personnel, understand their responsibilities before the event. He noted the bulk of city expenditure on inauguration day was devoted toward crowd control and security.
“We made sure there wasn’t any additional spending in there that didn’t line up with the schedule of tasks we had done for prior inaugurations so we weren’t being wasteful with funding,” Geldart said.
Councilmember Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) suggested during a Nov. 8 pre-legislative session that the council eliminate or reduce city funding for a stand to be constructed on the steps of the John A. Wilson Building on Pennsylvania Ave NW. The glass-enclosed stand — which seated 2,000 people, including elected officials, during the inauguration in 2013 — incurred a cost of about $342,000 for the city.
Silverman’s Communications and Community Outreach Coordinator Ashley Fox said this measure stemmed from nonpartisan concerns about extravagant spending on the inauguration.
“Excessive spending has been a topic of discussion for several years now,” Fox said. “I think at the council there’s generally a shift in discussions in whether or not we’re being fiscally responsible, making sure we’re using taxpayer dollars as effectively as possible.”
The District is expected to spend about $29.9 million on the inauguration and attract between 800,000 and 900,000 spectators to its events, which include an inaugural ball, luncheon, parade and the formal swearing-in of the president. Congress has allotted the District roughly two-thirds of the expected total expenditure, but the D.C. Council will likely request reimbursement of an additional $10 million in fees.
In the District, residents voted heavily democratic in the 2016 election, in which Trump received only 4 percent of the votes compared with Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 93 percent share of the D.C. vote.
Fox noted that the District’s Democratic leanings could possibly affect the council’s desire to cut back spending on the inauguration.
“To foot the bill for a really big celebration that is not necessarily reflective of District residents’ ideals, values or votes was something that was part of that conversation as well,” Fox said. “We should best serve District residents so that we make sure we are working in their interests.”

The Washington, D.C. Council approved the elimination of the 5.75 percent sales tax on diapers, tampons and other feminine hygiene products Nov. 15 by approving the final passage of the Feminine Hygiene and Sales Tax Exemption Amendment Act of 2016.
The council, which has been deliberating the bill since April, will follow the example of Illinois, Connecticut and New York, all of which repealed the “tampon tax” this year. The bill will not go into effect until next October.
Councilmembers Anita Bonds (D-At Large), Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), LaRuby May (D-Ward 8), Yvette Alexander (D-Ward 7), Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) and then-councilmember Vincent Orange (D-At Large) co-introduced the bill in April.
According to Silverman’s Senior Policy Advisor Samuel Rosen-Amy, the decision to cut the tax on feminine hygiene products was based on the desire to ease the burden on women and working families.
“The councilmember thought this was an important bill because it’s an issue of fairness,” Rosen-Amy said. “Women shouldn’t be taxed for needing certain hygiene products, so there shouldn’t be an additional tax on them.”
Rosen-Amy said the tax exemption would allow low-income families to moderate these often costly expenses.
“Sales taxes tend to burden lower income families more,” Rosen-Amy said. “So, if you can reduce the tax burden on them, to the councilmember that seems like a no-brainer.”
The bill must first receive funding of an estimated $3 million per year from the District’s $13 billion budget for next year to go into effect. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) will release the 2017 amended budget in March.
“Unfortunately if we don’t find the money, even if we pass it, it still won’t go into effect,” Rosen-Amy said. “It’s a significant amount of money, so it won’t be easy, but it’s potentially doable.”
However, Bonds’ Chief of Staff David Meadows said that funding concerns do not pose a serious problem to the tax exemption.
“The cost of implementation is a minor hurdle,” Meadows wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is minor when compared to our 13 billion budget.”
The bill has nevertheless encountered opposition from various organizations within the District. Richard Phillips, senior policy analyst at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a non-profit, nonpartisan think tank that focuses on state and tax policy issues, expressed concerns that the exemption would not be an efficient way to address some of the inherent issues surrounding sales taxes.
“For a long time there has been this misconception that the sales tax is actually a luxury tax,” Phillips said. “You shouldn’t have inequalities in what is and isn’t being subjected to the sales tax.”
Phillips also expressed concerns regarding implications of the tax exemption for other products.
“If one year we exempt diapers, and the next year t-shirts, and shoes, then you have a problem where your sales tax base keeps getting eroded year after year, because you have different groups asking for exemptions,” Phillips said. “Once you exempt all these different things, you create a real problem for the tax code overall.”
Nevertheless, Bonds argued feminine hygiene products and diapers for both babies and incontinent adults are medical necessities that should not force additional costs on families.
“Women, babies, and persons with disabilities who need these products should not be taxed for natural bodily functions,” Bonds said to The Washington Post.

Georgetown attempts to balance the need to improve services and facilities for students with reasonable increases in tuition, according to university administrators in a Hoya Roundtable on tuition transparency hosted by Georgetown University Student Association on Nov. 17.
The university increased tuition by 4 percent for this year, in a move that was met with significant opposition from students.
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) published an article in The Hoya demanding increased transparency around the issue, while the Facebook page “Hoyas Against the Hike,” was liked by over 170 students Sept. 2 since its August launch.
When setting the tuition for the next academic year, Groves said the Board of Directors always aims to minimize tuition, but that becomes difficult given the funding demands in the tuition-setting process.
“You are stakeholders because you are charged this tuition,” Groves said about the students’ investment in the tuition increases. “The faculty are stakeholders. They are paid through the revenue that comes into the university, and all the other staff members are part of that.”
Another cause of Georgetown’s tuition hike originates from the university’s relatively small endowment compared to other major private universities with comparable academic ranking, according to Provost Robert Groves, who gave a presentation during the event.
Georgetown is ranked in the top 25 U.S. colleges and universities per U.S. News and World Report, but has the 61st largest endowment according to the 2016 NACUBO-Commonfund rankings. Georgetown did not begin to fundraise until the late 1970s, about a decade after the Jesuits stopped formally running the university.
Groves said Georgetown’s modest endowment means tuition fees are a more significant source of the university’s revenue.
“If you looked at [percentage of revenue as tuition] for Stanford or Harvard, you would see a smaller portion of their revenues come from tuition,” Groves said. “They have much, much larger endowments.”
Georgetown’s revenues for FY 2016 totaled $1,189.4 million dollars, including 49 percent from tuition and seven percent from endowment income. Total expenses over the same period totaled $1,180.3 million dollars.
Georgetown’s endowment as of June 30, 2015 is approximately $1.5 billion.
Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Christopher Augostini said the university is focusing on overall growth in response to high costs.
“We have to look at the enrollment growth, enrollment growth in particular in graduate programs has increased proportionately to the expenses,” Augostini said. “We have to look at the size of the faculty in terms of the size of the curriculum offerings.”
Groves said the university’s 2016 fundraising efforts will help decrease reliance on tuition for revenues.
“We’ve just finished a fundraising campaign that was the most successful this university has ever had,” Groves said. “1.6 billion dollars, a lot of that money went immediately to paying for operations over the fundraising period.”
Groves said the university is exploring opportunities to expand alternate sources of revenue.
“We are very interested in trying to grow revenues from grants, from research grants,” Groves said. “That’s good for faculty to teach you and for student research assistants. This goes right back in to what we’re doing as a university.”
Groves also pointed to meeting student needs as a central part of the discussions surrounding tuition.
The roundtable featured a PowerPoint presentation by Provost Robert Groves, a student Q&A section and a 15-minute small group discussion of students and administrators to facilitate better dialogue.
The event also highlighted Arrupe Hall, Ryan and Isaac Halls, the Muslim Prayer Room, Cooper and Shaw Fields and the Village C Black Box as recent efforts to improve student life on campus.
The university’s 20-year campus plan outlines future projects designed to benefit students, such as the possible creation of a student life corridor.
Groves said the university must balance tuition costs with campus improvement projects, including expanding Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle services.
“We’ve done a variety of things to try to figure out how we can provide better GUTS service, and that’s been increasing our costs on GUTS,” Groves said. “We’re trying to balance that to essentially offer the services you want without increasing the costs too much.”
During the Q&A session, some students expressed concern over future tuition hikes and if they would surpass the 4 percent increases students have seen in the past few years.
“In our estimates on the out year right now, that number is 4 percent,” Groves said. “But we will revisit that.”
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said the roundtable was a good format for students to understand tuition increases.
“I think we saw a lot of different students who were generally passionate about tuition setting and the process, so overall very happy with that,” Khan said. “I think [the students’ participation in the roundtable] showcases that the university needs to continue engagement regarding tuition and remember that we are their constituents and they need to answer our questions.”

Students must work to ensure that free speech at Georgetown remains open and respectful in light of the divisive presidential election, according to administrators and free speech student advocates in a Free Speech Open Forum on Nov. 17.
The discussion follows three bias-related incidents reported by the Georgetown University Police Department on and off campus since Nov. 1.
The forum, hosted by the Georgetown University Student Association Free Speech Policy Team and the university Speech and Expression Committee in McShain Lounge, featured Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and Assistant Dean for Student Engagement Erika Cohen-Derr, alongside Free Speech Policy Team members Ben Costanza (COL ’18) and Jessica Andino (COL ’18).
Olson said the university strongly supports free expression, but draws a line when free speech becomes harassment.
“We have made a strong commitment here to allow students and members of our community to express ideas to a great degree,” Olson said. “The boundary there really only comes about when speech moves into harassment or threats.”
Georgetown’s Free Speech and Expression Policy protects students’ right to free speech on campus, including posting flyers in Red Square and on their residence doors and student groups’ ability to table in Red Square.
Olson said the university faces delicate decisions in differentiating protected forms of speech from harassment.
“This is of course complex territory,” Olson said. “Is a statement that’s making fun of someone’s ethnicity or sexual orientation always harassment? Maybe not. Are there lots of circumstances where it does move into that territory? Yes, there are. And we try to look at the individual facts of each situation.”
Andino encouraged students to report legitimate cases of harassment or abuse.
“It’s important to keep on the lookout for targeted harassment. If a student threatens another student, that needs to be reported,” Andino said. “I think a lot of students don’t know that until someone who knows about it tells them.”
Following the election cycle, which divided the campus community in response to President-elect Donald Trump’s victory, Cohen-Derr said student organizations have an important role to play in contributing a diverse array of perspectives to a campuswide political climate some students consider left-leaning.
“Regarding the election, the College Republicans have the opportunity to address the election outcome in a way that makes available that space for people who are Trump supporters to come and talk about that,” Cohen-Derr said. “We’ve seen programming that espoused the opposite view, but now is the chance for that body to come out and host some programming.”
Costanza said while student culture can shape expression on campus, it is up to students to choose to accept viewpoints with which they disagree.
“The culture of the student body can only be affected by the administration so much. You can’t affect top-down change very easily,” Costanza said. “So it’s up to the students to say, ‘Listen to people.’ The administration and the policy will support free speech, but we have to allow it as students, and we have to encourage it, and make sure people are comfortable, whether they’re an ethnic minority, a sexual orientation minority or a political minority.”

Excellent!  Does this apply to conservatives too, or just to liberals?
Can I write things like…
A Muslim jihadist rammed his car into students at OSU and then preceded to slash them with a butcher’s knife.  This event was no different than the thousands of documented Muslim acts of terrorism which have taken place and documented by the website “The Religion of Peace and a stack of Dead Bodies” since 9/11.
Is it OK for me to write the above or is this not free speech even though it is true?
The reason I ask is because the UN has banned free speech due to Muslim pressure.  The 57 member OIC has turned the UN into an Orwellian charade where violent, misogynist countries now make the rules.  I mean, like, what could be more Orwellian that Saudi Arabia being on the Council for Human Rights?
Can I write these facts or is this not covered under “free speech”?  In fact with the editors even publish my comment?  LOL
[…] campuses remain places of free speech and open inquiry. At Georgetown University, as we learn in this article the University’s paper, students and faculty decided to be pro-active in discussing this issue by hosting a forum on […]
