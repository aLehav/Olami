During the most recent round of negotiations regarding the university’s 2010 Campus Plan, Georgetown committed to housing 90 percent of undergraduates on campus by the year 2025. As part of the promise, the university is aiming to provide housing for 385 students in the Leavey Center.
The decision to convert the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center into a dorm by the fall of 2014 was announced last year, and updated plans were made available this week. According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, the converted space would allow for about 250 beds. The university recently announced that it expects to construct three additional floors to accommodate the remaining 135 residents.
The university submitted preliminary versions of the plans for the addition during the final Zoning Commission hearing on the campus plan earlier this month. Kerr said that design work will begin in the next few months. The university plans to keep the height of the renovated building equal to the height of the current structure at its highest point and to build from the hotel tower toward the university bookstore. Plans for the addition must be approved by the Old Georgetown Board and the Commission for Fine Arts before construction can begin.
The Hoya previously reported that the conversion of the hotel area is expected to cost about $8 million, which does not include potential revenue losses from the discontinuation of the hotel. It is not yet clear how much the construction of the addition will cost or when it is scheduled to open.

A female jogger was sexually assaulted in the Georgetown section of the Capital Crescent Trail Wednesday evening, U.S. Park Police reported.
According to a press release on the U.S. Park Police website, the victim was approached from behind while running on the trail at about 9:16 p.m. The attacker put her in a choke hold and she lost consciousness. She awoke to find that her pants were down and the suspect was fondling her. She screamed, and the suspect fled.
The press release describes the suspect as a muscular black male with dreadlocks and a thin beard wearing a white shirt and black shorts. It also estimates that his height was between 5-foot-8 and 5-foot-11 and his weight between 180 to 200 pounds.
The Department of Public Safety issued a public safety alert via email notifying members of the campus community of the incident. It also urged community members to use caution while on the trail, an 11-mile paved path that runs between the Georgetown neighborhood and Silver Spring, Md.
U.S. Park Police are conducting the ongoing investigation of the incident.

University Vice President for Facilities and Student Housing Karen Frank will leave her position at the end of August, University President John J. DeGioia announced in an email sent to the campus community Thursday afternoon.
Frank will now serve as a senior advisor to University Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Chris Augostini.
According to the email, the university plans to launch a national search for Frank’s successor. In the interim, Frank Tiscione, who spent 13 years working with the Architect of the Capitol, will fill the role of Interim Vice President for Facilities and Student Housing.
Frank has worked at the university since 1987 and oversaw the construction of the Leavey Center, School of Foreign Service campus in Doha, Qatar, Regents Hall and the Calcagnini Contemplative Center in Bluemont, Va.
“Over the past ten years alone, Karen has been instrumental in the largest capital expansion in our history by adding [10] new buildings, totaling more than 1.5 million square feet of new space,” DeGioia wrote.
Frank also played a role in the development of the university’s sustainability projects and managed Georgetown’s grounds-keeping, waste management, energy management and transportation services.University Vice President for Facilities and Student Housing Karen Frank will leave her position at the end of August, University President John J. DeGioia announced in an email sent to the campus community Thursday afternoon.
