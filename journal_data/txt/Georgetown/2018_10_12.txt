Jetlagged from a 12-hour flight and lugging two 50-pound suitcases behind her, Rachelle Bonja (SFS ’20) had finally made it to the United States.
Growing up in Aleppo, Syria, Bonja, arrived alone in Washington, D.C. with no phone, no credit card and no idea how to get to Georgetown University to begin her freshman year in the summer of 2016.
“My parents can’t come to the U.S.,” Bonja said. “They are not allowed in, because I’m Syrian. I had literally no one when I got here, and I had to take a cab to Georgetown. I remember the feeling of seeing people with their parents and feeling so desperate because I wanted to know how to do things.”
For many international students, this sense of discomfort and anxiety is not foreign.
Georgetown markets itself as attracting students “from around the world,” with 3,048 international students from 125 countries enrolled in both university programs, 458 of whom are undergraduates, according to the Office of Global Services.
OGS strictly defines international students as those with an F-1 or J-1 visa, which permits international students to legally study at U.S. colleges and universities. Yet, for students like Bonja, who hold U.S. citizenship with no familial or cultural ties to the United States, this narrow definition can be excluding.
The Cultural Gap
While many international students come to Georgetown without any prior experience in the United States, some students attend programs that introduce them to life in a U.S. college setting, including summer courses at U.S. universities like Georgetown. Those students often feel more prepared to assimilate into Georgetown’s environment.
Having a good command of English can also break down certain cultural barriers, according to Austrian native Roxana Helena Demeter (COL ’21).
“I’ve obviously had an easier time because I was fully fluent in English and relatively ‘assimilated’ to American culture by the time I came here,” Demeter said.
Still, Demeter cautioned against the pressure to assimilate for international students.
Assimilation, Demeter warned, can result in the loss of one identity to gain another, fracturing the two instead of creating a balance of coexistence.
“Assimilation is just an ignorant idea,” Demeter said. “Why would you want students to assimilate to American culture as opposed to them bringing their own cultures and them feeling wholly comfortable in continuing to practice their culture?
That’s how you get a vibrant community where everyone feels welcome.”
For others, the culture shock of moving to the United States eroded with time, according to Brazilian student Gabriel Donato Gonçalves (COL ’19).
“I feel like I was only able to assimilate with American culture after I struggled with it,” Donato Gonçalves said. “I don’t want to change where I am today, because even though it’s been very difficult at times, I think these times have taught me a lot.”
Filling the Gap
Given the difficult transition international students can face, Georgetown has sought to create a resource at their disposal to ease certain burdens.
Established in 1983 and rebranded in 2014 to distinguish itself from study abroad programming, the Office of Global Services is tasked with helping international students who are sponsored by the university. To obtain a F-1 or J-1 visa to study in the United States, students’ applications are contingent on their acceptance to an accredited university; for prospective Georgetown students, obtaining the proper paperwork can take weeks and weeks of bureaucracy.
Once international students arrive on campus, OGS can provide immigration and cultural adjustment support, according to Rachel Rubin, director of International Student and Scholar Services. The center also aims to act as a campus resource for the entire international student body throughout their time at Georgetown.
To help students find their bearings, OGS offers a mini-orientation specific for international students within New Student Orientation. I-NSO offers a daylong program of information panels discussing visa restrictions, health insurance and other logistical requirements.
In the latter half of the day, the orientation focuses on cultural assimilation to both the United States and Georgetown, I-NSO orientation leader Seo Young Lee (COL ’21) said.
OGS Falling Short
While OGS strives to be a resource for “the entire international student body,” the center only serves a subset of foreign students — those with F-1 and J-1 immigration statuses, but not those who hold dual citizenship with the United States. As such, OGS does not interact with all “self-identifying” international students, according to OGS International Student Advisor and Orientation Director Stacy Williams.
“OGS staff and resources serve only two student groups — those in F-1 and J-1 immigration status — at the undergraduate and graduate student level, so our perspective is limited to experiences of those students even though there are many, many students studying in different statuses or that hold non-U.S. citizenship at Georgetown that may self-identify as an international student,” Williams wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Dual nationals are not counted as international students in official statistics, according to OGS.
Despite her need for support, Bonja never received an offer of OGS resources since her U.S. passport prevents her from appearing on the roster of international students.
Many international students seek a more personalized support system than OGS can offer, rather than generic answers copied and pasted from a handbook, according to Australian native Calvin Dass (MSB ’20).
“The trouble with OGS is that I think they mean very well, but it’s very difficult to provide a customized experience because of the all of the differences and levels of Americanization,” Dass said.
New measures for the 2018 international students’ orientation program included an “American Narratives” panel, where international students shared their experience about being international in the United States and at Georgetown, according to Lee.
“We hoped it would give international students some advice and, most importantly, peace of mind going into this whole process of acclimating to college,” Lee wrote.
Beyond a personalized experience, international students have called for a fuller sense of investment in their future through increased job support. Extensive regulation of employment for students with visas complicates their job search. Students can work on campus for up to 20 hours per week, for example. For internships, however, students on certain visas must follow specific restrictions; they must find a position related to their major and can work only a limited time over their time in school.
Dass is only allowed to work 20 hours per week in a non-work-study job on campus; only certain internships pertaining to his major — most of them unpaid — will hire him.
OGS should offer professional counselling for employment opportunities to help foreign students on visas, Dass said.
“OGS offers no [job] support, to my knowledge, as far as finding jobs,” Dass said. “It’s more about what to do once you’ve got the job from the legal standpoint. You can tell that they put the effort in, it’s just that I really wish they had specialized knowledge.”
When asked about OGS job support for international students, Rubin noted OGS directs foreign nationals to the Cawley Career Education Center, which offers informational sessions about various career paths and options as an international student.
“OGS closely collaborates with them [Cawley Career Center] to encourage attendance and provides information during the sessions about the student immigration regulations that govern internships, employment, and training,” Rubin wrote.
Georgetown as a Global Home
Over the past year, steps have been taken to widen the reach of OGS. The International Focus Committee, a group composed of representatives from campus offices that hosts focus groups to gather input on international students’ experiences, was formed last December in hopes of fostering collaboration among faculty and staff who play a role in the international student experience.
The committee, which includes faculty, staff, university leaders and international student representatives, meets regularly to discuss the best practices for supporting international students, to coordinate cross-office resources and programs, and to serve as an idea hub for events and programming, according to Rubin.
Further support around issues pertaining to financials, cultural assimilation and paperwork could greatly benefit the international student population on campus, according to Dass.
“OGS should make Georgetown feel like a home away from home,” Dass said. “I don’t mean emotionally, because they do a good job of that. I am talking about understanding that international students don’t necessarily have everything that domestic students have and providing support for those particular needs.”
In particular, Dass recommended tailored support for international students who need a permanent address for summer applications, like those for internships.
The transition to a new country with no prior context, both as a freshman and a foreigner, can be extremely challenging. Bonja likened the experience to hiking without adequate supplies.
“Being dragged around and being uncomfortable all the time, this is how I would best describe my life in the U.S.,” Bonja said. “It’s unrelated to being happy — it’s a physical state, not a mental state. It’s like when you go hiking, and your shoes are wet, and the bed isn’t comfortable, but you’re still happy because you’re hiking. I’m struggling through, and my shoes are always wet, but I’m really happy because I chose to be here.”
Donato Gonçalves remained hopeful for international students’ outlook of Georgetown.
“I am a strong believer in the butterfly effect. If I change anything — any door I walk in or any step I take, I wouldn’t be where I am today,” Donato Gonçalves said. “Six months, two years from now, you’ll be able to realize how much these times teach you. There is a place for everyone at Georgetown.”

The LGBTQ Resource Center is celebrating its 10th anniversary with OUTober, an annual monthlong programming series honoring the LGBTQ community, this month.
This year’s theme, “Looking Forward,” aims to build off the current on-campus LGBTQ infrastructure to identify emerging issues for the community through a series of keynote speakers, discussions and events, according to LGBTQ Resource Center Director and Special Assistant to the Vice President of Student Affairs Shiva Subbaraman.
“The center has been here for 10 years, so we are also celebrating our 10th anniversary of the Resource Center,” Subbaraman said in an interview with The Hoya. “The center came as a result of student activism in 2007, and it is the first center in a Catholic institution and still is the only center in a Catholic institution.”
OUTober’s focus needs to move past foundational issues pertaining to infrastructure and visibility, according to Subbaraman.
“This year what I’m trying to do is to look forward to see where are the gaps of the composition that we need to go and build on and hopefully in the next few years we will identify where those emerging issues are, where those gaps are, and that is where the conversations will go,” Subbaraman said.
Despite the significant progress made in the 10 years since the LGBTQ Resource Center’s opening, Subbaraman wants to combat apathy toward LGBTQ issues.
“People tend to think we have gay marriage, we have acceptance, everything is fine, but it is not,” Subbaraman said. “There are a lot of new emerging identities, there are lots of new emerging touch points, and I think continuing to educate ourselves and educate the campus about those gaps is where I want to go.”
GU Pride Co-President Andrew Molinari (COL ’21) hopes people who take part in OUTober acknowledge the progress made in the LGBTQ community, but also recognize the areas that need improvement. 
“I hope they see celebrations of what makes our community so great and also what needs to be worked on,” Molinari said. 
OUTober, a tradition that began in 2012, is organized by the LGBTQ Resource Center, Georgetown University Pride, Georgetown University Queer People of Color and the McDonough Alliance. 
Smaller events and discussions are held in collaboration with various student clubs, academic departments and organizations, along with Campus Ministry.
This year, GU Pride is focused on putting forth fewer, larger events in hopes of creating a sense of community among the student body, specifically for new students, according to Molinari.
“I love October because it’s so early in the school year, so especially for newer students who are trying to see what is the LGBTQ scene on this campus, what are its strengths, what are its weaknesses and what is beautiful about it, we as student clubs get to show all of that in one month which I think is great,” Molinari said.
The LGBTQ Resource Center first opened in August 2008 following a student-led campaign “Out for Change” and a 2007 town hall, where University President John J. DeGioia promised more initiatives to create a LGBTQ-friendly campus in response to bias-related incidents on campus.
OUTober serves as an opportunity to educate the campus on LGBTQ history, culture and diversity, much like heritage months the university recognizes, Subbaraman said.
“We need to use this opportunity to educate the campus on LGBTQ histories, cultures and the large diversity, because the LGBTQ community is diverse by race, ethnicity, class, religion, ability: You name anything, we are diverse,” Subbaraman said.
The main event of the program series and key 10th anniversary celebration, “Edges that Blur,” is a conversation about student activism between Marcia Chatelain, the Provost’s distinguished associate professor of history and African American studies, and Daniel Porterfield, president of the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit leadership think tank.
In addition to the major key speakers and events, numerous ethnic and cultural student groups, including the Asian-Pacific Islander Leadership Forum, will be collaborating on smaller scale events in OUTober. APILF is hosting a “Queer and Asian Dialogue” at the LGBTQ Resource Center on Nov. 7 to discuss these intersections of identities, according to APILF leadership team member Heejin Hahn (COL ’20).
“One of the main things we discuss is what does being queer and Asian mean to you, because both are such diverse terms that apply to so many different people,” Hahn said. “So, hopefully meeting and hearing other stories will create comfort for people who think they are alone on this campus.”
Although OUTober aims to create a campus environment where special attention is paid to LGBTQ issues during the month of October, its organizers hope that by having events in the start of November as well, discussions will continue past the scope of the events.
“Our goal is to build community and have that community extend throughout the year and not just be limited to our events in OUTober,” Molinari said.
While OUTober displays distinct features of Georgetown’s LBGTQ community, the month also highlights the ways in which it is integrated into the larger Georgetown University community, Subbaraman said.
“There is a tendency on college campuses to think of LGBTQ identities as separate from all other identities. As if being gay defines all of who we are, and it does not,” Subbaraman said. “The presence of this is to really showcase that LGBTQ people not only are a part of this community, but we are part of all other communities and all other communities are a part of us.”

This article is so disappointing. Georgetown LGBTQ Resource Center has no interest in elevating the narratives of Black trans students on campus. In 10 years , they continue to fail Black trans students.

Thanks Lourdes for bringing this up. I am, as always, happy to meet in person and discuss this with you, and with students. Thanks, Shiva

An Ethics and Oversight Committee for the Georgetown University Student Association senate is set to be approved this week, after the senate unanimously voted Monday to pass legislation to improve the internal accountability of the senate and GUSA’s executive branch.
The formation of the new committee comes a month after the resignation of former president Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) amid sexual misconduct allegations, but the committee was created independent of the recent resignations,  according to Dylan Hughes (COL ’19), GUSA senator and chair of the eight-person committee.
No complaints had been filed against Nair through the Title IX office or the Office of Student Conduct, he wrote in a May 28 email to The Hoya. A university spokesperson confirmed that, as of May 2019, Nair was not the subject of any complaints through either office nor had he been found responsible for any violations of the Student Code of Conduct.
The legislation instructs the committee to track senators’ attendance records at meetings, monitor potential conflicts of interest and ensure that members communicate regularly, said Hughes, who was elected chair of the committee at the senate meeting Monday.
“This committee is just designed to ensure that GUSA is behaving ethically and responsibly,” Hughes said. “I’ve been at Georgetown for four years now, and in my time, I’ve seen examples of GUSA acting unethically.”
The committee will also be tasked with investigating the financial activity of GUSA and subpoenaing any GUSA member, including presidential candidates. Upon investigating, the committee can issue letters of warning and initiate articles of impeachment.
Vice President Kenna Chick (SFS ’20), GUSA’s former mental health policy coalition chair, expressed support for the committee’s goals but raised concerns about its potential handling of mental health issues.
“This committee needs to find that careful balance between oversight and compassion,” Chick wrote in an email to The Hoya, describing her experience seeing people forced out of work spaces for mental health reasons. “This committee can certainly avoid replicating those ablest practices and interactions, but the Chair and Vice-Chair must prioritize the health and wellness of students to do so.”
Hughes cited illegal spending by presidential candidates and chronic absences as examples of problems that could potentially have been avoided with an oversight committee.
Sam Dubke (SFS ’21) echoed Hughes’ concern with absences, saying it was what motivated him to help draft the legislation forming the committee.
“I was a senator last year, and I personally was very frustrated working with the executive branch because a lot of people wouldn’t respond to emails or set up meetings,” Dubke said. “A lot of senators would just not come to meetings that they felt were unnecessary, and there was functionally no enforcement mechanism.”
During the 2018 GUSA executive race, runner-up candidates Josh Sirois (SFS ’20) and Casey Doherty (COL ’20) alleged that the campaign of Nair and Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) exceeded the $300 budget limit. The Election Commission did not find violations of finance rules, but former GUSA Election Commission Co-Chair Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said in February that the process of campaign financing monitoring needs to be improved.
“The whole issue in general of campaign finance is something that is desperately, really really desperately broken and needs to be fixed,” Willard said. “I am of the personal belief that of all the campaigns I have seen in four years … of the candidates that spent the maximum amount of money, there is a strong chance that some of them just didn’t report additional expenses. Because there’s no way for us to check.”
GUSA Senators Saham Ali (COL ’21), Dubke and Hughes introduced the legislation Monday night. Dubke will serve as vice chair of the new committee.
The members of the committee will also include the vice chairs of the senate’s four standing committees, who have not yet been elected, as well as two nonvoting participants from the executive branch.
Hughes and Dubke emphasized that they, along with Ali, wrote the legislation over the summer and that it was not a response to the recent resignations.
“This legislation was in process over the summer. We have been drafting this for months,” Hughes said. “This is not, nor was it designed to be, nor should it ever be, an emergency response committee.”
Having an oversight committee will help fulfill the senate’s promises of increasing GUSA’s transparency, GUSA Senator Karan Chauhan (SFS ’22) said.
“GUSA has a reputation for being ineffective, so by creating the Ethics and Oversight Committee, the senate is building a sense of trust that we are doing the work we were elected to do,” Chauhan said. “Ideally, the committee will work as a limited check, because ideally, everyone will be doing their job.”
GUSA Senator Logan Arkema (COL ’20), who ran for GUSA president in February, agreed with Chauhan’s desire for a restricted role for the committee, welcoming it chiefly as a mechanism for patrolling attendance and executive responsiveness.
“Having an ethics committee helps, but this committee isn’t going to solve every single ethical and transparency issue within GUSA,” Arkema said.  “It was primarily established to crack down on senators who don’t do any work.”
While the GUSA executive has until Oct. 18 to either veto the legislation or sign it into law, Chick indicated that the bill would be approved.
“Prior to signing this legislation, we certainly want to continue our working relationship with this committee and address some of the concerns we have,” Chick wrote. “We’re confident in the committee’s objectives, and want to improve the committee through active collaboration.”
This article was updated May 28 to indicate the absence of Title IX or Office of Student Conduct complaints against Nair and to include comment from Nair.

Justin Poole, deputy director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the main source of geospatial intelligence for the Department of Defense and the U.S. Intelligence Community, spoke at the Kalaris Conference on Sept. 27 in Gaston Hall, an event that brought several national security leaders to Georgetown. Poole currently manages day-to-day operations of the NGA and has worked in the national security industry for 28 years.
The Kalaris Conference, which focused on current trends in national security, included journalists, professors, employees of national security organizations and members of think tanks like the Brookings Institute.
The Hoya spoke to Poole during the daylong conference, touching on topics of artificial intelligence and geospatial security strategies.
Can you tell me in your own words a little bit about what you do?
The agency that I am responsible for running as the deputy director is the ….World’s premier provider into spatial intelligence. Geospatial intelligence is one of what we call hints, or disciplines of intelligence that describes where and what and, in context, is happening on any particular point on the Earth’s surface. We can convey that intelligence information — or sometimes we call it products — in a lot of forms. It can be an answer to a question: Are troops moving there? It can be graphical — oftentimes it’s communicated through maps, through charts.
Just because I noticed that a lot of the talks today are about cybersecurity or involve cybersecurity in AI, how has that reshaped the national security and national security world?
Cyber is a little more on the world stage, in the press, etc., but the explosion of all things digital — big data, information, volumes we’ve never seen before — we have an opportunity as purveyors of intelligence to use this information, and we do. We have to be concerned about the chain of custody, where it came from, is it accurate, has it been influenced by some sort of bad actor from cyber perspective, are the systems that we are using vulnerable?
We are not unique; NGA is not unique in that. The entire intelligence community, D.O.D. and the world is susceptible to cyber. The way it has changed is it has made our awareness of it and our need to deal with it and invest in the appropriate measures to protect the information that it’s our responsibility to provide, that keeps our national security safety.
How do you contribute to protecting civilians? How do you know who is a civilian and who is not?
Yeah, the high-level answer is — I don’t want to say it’s not my job to protect civilians. It’s my job to inform the people who will be making decisions about the protection of civilians, so the easiest way to describe our role is geointelligence about what things are on the ground: That’s a mosque; that’s a hospital; that’s a housing area; that’s something else. And so we’re able to provide that context about a geographic region that allows whoever is doing operations to understand the landscape.
And there are ways you see in the news of determining where a particular, let’s just say adversary — you mentioned ISIS, what types of places they go, where they, do they like to frequent these kinds of facilities, then my teams can find those for our military, our allies, our war. But to not always put a wartime setting on it: If we’re looking at flooding disasters or hurricanes in Haiti, one of the first things the first responders want to know is where were the schools, the churches and maybe elder care facilities and the hospitals. They want to know where everything is, but those are maybe places where you want to go first to make sure that people are taken care of. So we can do that as well, if asked by FEMA. … Don’t forget the humanitarian aid disaster relief piece.
How do you respond to natural disasters? Is it a reactionary response or do you prepare for them in advance?
When it comes to the business of intelligence, predictive analysis is very important. So that’s more about — you see a pattern of life of something, we have analysts who have such steep tradecraft that they can offer an assessment of what might occur next. And I say that very carefully, because while predictive analysis is a thing, sometimes when you say we can predict, I picture crystal balls, and that’s not what we mean. We can give you with varying degrees of confidence an assessment of what might happen, when might a military exercise begin, when might an attack on a something occur.
To the last part, no, we focus on everything. More and more in the counterterrorism world it’s not about state actors, so we do it all. Where you’re going with the question about individual people is starting to get into things that 1) are fairly sensitive but 2) also involve other organizations, but to try to give you something, it goes back to pattern of life again. You know — where are things within a city, you know where are the houses, where are the internet cafes, where are this, that and the other thing. So we bring that to the table and combine with other partners. We can try to limit the types of things that you’re talking about. And we have been effective, but we’ve had a lot of practice on it.

October 12, 2018 by Will Cassou Leave a Comment 
Will Haskell (COL’18) knows it may be hard for some to take a 22-year-old’s State Senate campaign seriously, but he has at least one supporter: former President Barack Obama.
Obama tweeted his support for 260 Democrats, including Haskell, running in gubernatorial, U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Senate and state legislature races in his second wave of endorsements Oct. 1. His long-awaited first round of endorsements was announced Aug. 1.
“Today, I’m proud to endorse even more Democratic candidates who aren’t just running against something, but for something—to expand opportunity for all of us and to restore dignity, honor, and compassion to public service. They deserve your vote,” Obama wrote in the tweet.
Haskell launched his campaign to represent Connecticut’s 26th congressional district in the State Senate in March, during the spring semester of his senior year at Georgetown University.
Haskell deferred his plans to enroll at the Georgetown University Law Center to focus on his campaign, which has been thrust into the national spotlight in the days following Obama’s endorsement. In the days since, Haskell has been profiled by several national publications, including The New York Times and ABC News.
Despite Haskell’s inexperience compared to his opponent — State Senator Toni Boucher (R-Conn.), who has served in state legislature since 1997 and as a senator for Connecticut’s 26th congressional district since 2009 — he has received significant support from more established Connecticut politicians. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), as well as Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), have all endorsed Haskell and campaigned for him.
Though Haskell’s campaign reached out to the Democratic National Convention about the possibility of being endorsed by Obama after his first wave of endorsements in August, the news on Oct. 1 came as a surprise to Haskell, as he was initially unsure whether Obama would get involved in state legislative races.
“I was amazed that President Obama decided to get involved in this race, but I think it speaks to the importance that the Connecticut State Senate goes blue this year, and just what’s at stake in state legislative races and in state houses across the country,” Haskell said in an interview with The Hoya.
The Connecticut State Senate currently includes 18 Republican and 18 Democrat senators and is the only tied state legislature in the country, which makes this race especially significant, Haskell said.
“People are really starting to look at the 26th district, and a seat that hasn’t been held by a Democrat since the 1970s, all of a sudden, might actually flip,” Haskell said. “We think of this state as a blue state very often, we see Jim Himes and Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal on TV, and Connecticut go blue in almost every presidential election, and we forget that actually this is a very purple state with the only tie in the whole country.”
Though Obama’s endorsement has given Haskell national attention and an boost in volunteering numbers, it will not be a defining factor of the race, Haskell said.
“For anybody who’s paying attention, they’re not going to see a huge shift in this race, they’re going to see just more of the same, of exactly what we’ve been doing: listening to, and learning from, voters,” Haskell said.
Haskell’s campaign manager and college roommate Jack Lynch (COL ’18) said that, while he and Haskell are excited about the endorsement, they are not taking anything for granted.
“I think the excitement in this race is definitely on Will’s side of things, but we’re challenging an incumbent who has been in office for over 20 years,” Lynch said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’re more confident than we were a couple of weeks ago, but we’re not going to be complacent at all, only cautiously optimistic really until the polls close on election day and we see how things have gone.”
Lynch acknowledged that Haskell’s youth has the potential to make voters apprehensive in backing him.
“The biggest concern with his age is that people aren’t going to take him seriously, but anyone who meets Will or talks to him at an event knows how seriously he takes this race, and how much he knows about the policies that are affecting Connecticut,” Lynch said.
However, Lynch also said Haskell’s youth has benefitted his bid.
“It makes him stick in people’s minds; it gets people’s attention that a 22 year-old is running for office,” Lynch said.
Despite recent upticks in voter registration, the campaign is still concerned about voter turnout on election day, Haskell said.
“The problem is we need to make sure those newly registered voters actually become voters, actually get to the polls. So an obstacle facing our campaign is that it’s too hard to get absentee ballots,” Haskell said.
Haskell hopes that young people especially will make their voices heard this election season.
“I read recently that three out of four millennials plan to sit out the midterm election. To be frank, that’s insane. We have more at stake than anybody else,” Haskell said. “Our generation, we’re not just going to be at the ballot in November, we’re going to be on the ballot and our futures our going to be on the ballot.”
Sanford Ungar, a government professor and director of the Free Speech Project of Georgetown University whom Haskell worked under, also has high hopes for Haskell’s chance in November.
“I was pleased, but not really surprised, that President Obama had endorsed him,” Ungar wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Will is one of the most interesting political candidates in the country this fall, and the outcome of his [s]tate Senate race in Connecticut will be a bellwether of things to come.”
Haskell is hopeful for election day, from observing reactions to recent political events.
“With everything that’s been happening in the news recently, with Justice Kavanaugh taking his seat on the bench and throwing into jeopardy reproductive health and freedom, environmental regulation, voting rights, LGBTQ equality, people are getting involved and they’re frustrated and energized in a way that is really inspiring to me,” Haskell said.

The inaugural “CAB Fair 2.0,” hosted by Georgetown’s Council of Advisory Boards, is scheduled for Sunday, Oct. 14. The fair was organized to combat club exclusivity on campus.
The second CAB Fair, which will take place on Harbin Hall’s patio, was proposed as a way to highlight clubs that are inclusive or do not require an application, according to CAB Chair Carley Mambuca (SFS ’18).
“This CAB Fair is open exclusively to those organizations with open membership,” Mambuca wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Any group that is tabling either does not have an application process or is only signing folks up for the aspects of their organizations that do not have an application (EX: GUSA policy groups).”
The fair is aimed at elevating the status of open-membership clubs to help students find a club aligned with their interest, Mambuca wrote.
“All Hoyas deserve to find their community on the Hilltop and it is hard to think that our peers are the judges as to whether or not that can happen with certain application-based groups Open-membership organizations are just as worthy and welcoming,” Mambuca wrote. “I do believe that Georgetown students celebrate each other for their diverse passions, but that in some ways has not transferred to the way those view clubs and organizations on campus, and CAB is actively pursuing solutions to this phenomenon.”
The first CAB Fair of the semester took place Sept. 8 and featured over 200 student organizations, many of which require applications and interviews.
The “CAB Fair 2.0” comes after a largely student-led effort to mitigate the effects of Georgetown’s club culture based largely on application-based clubs. Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs Erika Cohen Derr convened a working group of student leaders and representatives from student groups such as the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, Students of Georgetown, Inc., and Blue and Gray Tour Guide Society in the spring of 2017 to look into potential solutions.
“Georgetown really has deferred to student leaders to lead the fight against Georgetown’s current club culture, which is why I have installed the second CAB Fair this year,” Mambuca wrote. “I think this is a great first step, but it is in no way fixing the issue in its entirety.”
Mambuca wrote that following a survey conducted by the 2018 Senior Class Committee last Spring, discomfort with the club application processes seemed to be a persistent complaint for freshmen and an isolating feature of Georgetown’s culture that made the campus inaccessible for many new students.
“Very few folks said that they felt at home in the Hilltop during their freshman year. Most mentioned sophomore or junior year,” Mambuca wrote. “It is reasonable to believe that is, at least in part, a result of the organizational exclusivity faced by many freshmen.”
In 2016, GUASFCU accepted 7.6 percent of 290 applicants and Blue and Gray accepted 10.2 percent of 313 applicants. In 2015, the Corp accepted 18 percent of all applicants. These organizations no longer release their acceptance rates, according to club representatives.
The exclusive club culture at Georgetown can be a shock for freshmen, Georgetown University Student Association freshman representative Connor Brennan (SFS ’22) said.
“A lot of us come from schools where we’re big fish in a small pond. We come from a high school where we were leaders and the best in everything, and that’s how we got into Georgetown. Now, we are big fish in an ocean of very big fish,” Brennan said. “It’s sort of jarring to the mentality that has driven many of us, and I think it’s a culture shock.”
Former Chair of the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and representative to the informal working group on club culture Aiden Johnson (COL ’19) criticized club exclusivity at Georgetown and helped established open membership for the Lecture Fund.
“At some point along the road, we embraced this idea that for clubs to be efficient or attractive they have to be exclusive,” Johnson said. “That is a myth; it’s a lie that we tell ourselves, just look at the astounding and inclusive clubs at the second CAB fair. The cost of turning a student away from a club they care about is, in my opinion, far higher than the cost it takes to find a place for them.”
The current efforts to reduce pressures from clubs that require applications offers hope for a more inclusive club environment on campus, Johnson said.
“The students who worked on the second CAB Fair are reminders that only students can fix Georgetown’s club culture because we are the ones who created it,” Johnson said. “I’m thrilled that new students get this extra chance to find a community at Georgetown; they deserve an explanation as to why it is so hard to find one in the first place.”

The Metropolitan Police Department is conducting an ongoing investigation in search of the driver responsible for hitting two Georgetown University medical students in a hit-and-run incident Sept. 5, according to MPD Communications Director Dustin Sternbeck.
The two students, Rayva Khanna (MED ’22) and Areeg Abu El Hawa (MED ’22), were crossing the street at approximately 7:20 p.m. at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue NW and Albemarle Street NW in Tenleytown when they were hit by a black sedan making a left turn into the pedestrian crosswalk, according to MPD. The driver, whom Abu El Hawa identified as a young man talking on the phone, immediately drove away following the incident, according to The Washington Post.
Khanna and Abu El Hawa sustained non-life-threatening injuries from the accident.
MPD published surveillance footage of the hit-and-run incident collected by a nearby camera in an Oct. 2 announcement seeking the public’s assistance in locating the driver and vehicle of interest. A reward of up to $1,000 is being offered to anyone who can supply information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator as part of MPD’s Crime Solvers of Washington, D.C. program.
Khanna and Abu El Hawa plan to press charges against the driver once he has been identified, Abu El Hawa said.
“But the fact he ran away and didn’t check on us, I don’t want that person in the road,” Abu El Hawa told The Washington Post. “He doesn’t have a value on life, and that kind of person needs to be rehabilitated and educated.”
Khanna hopes the driver will be prevented from causing any more accidents, according to The Washington Post.
“He’s just living his life, and my friend is going to all these doctor’s appointments,” Khanna said. “He’s faced no consequences for having done something horrible. He needs to not be driving right now.”
D.C. has had three transportation-related deaths in the month of September alone, according to WTOP.
Similar incidents over the past few years have pressured the District to take action to reduce the number of traffic-related injuries. The District Department of Transportation launched Vision Zero in 2016, an initiative to eliminate traffic deaths and injuries by the year 2024.
D.C. councilmembers and other District officials raised concerns about a lack of pedestrian safety despite the Vision Zero initiative at a joint public roundtable held by the D.C. Council Committee on Transportation and the Environment and the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety Sept. 27.
Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), co-chair of the hearing, questioned the District’s slow pace in implementing the Vision Zero initiative, citing the deaths of a bike rider and scooter rider earlier that week.
“Where is the urgency to fix dangerous intersections and curbing dangerous driving before someone is killed?” Allen said in his opening statement.
At the hearing, other councilmembers, David Grosso (I-At Large) and Brandon Todd (D-Ward 4), expressed their agreement with Councilmember Allen and called for the city to hasten making the adjustments necessary for safer roads in D.C.
Co-chair Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) further emphasized the urgency of the situation.
“These deaths remind us that we’re not just talking about statistics but real lives of individuals with families, friends and co-workers,” Cheh said. “They demonstrate in a dramatically sad fashion how important the success of Vision Zero is for our community.”
DDOT has taken precautions to improve pedestrian safety as a part of the Vision Zero initiative this year, according to DDOT Director Jeff Marootian’s testimony to the D.C. Council.
“Thus far in 2018, DDOT has worked to plan, engineer and construct several roadways and corridors in all eight wards that will improve bicycle and pedestrian safety,” Marootian said. “We have also installed 19 Leading Pedestrian Intervals, modified 14 intersections that create a conflict between the dual turn lanes and pedestrian crossings and have closed 20 blocks of sidewalk gaps which is almost 8 miles closed in the last three years.”
The Vision Zero initiative is set to receive $500,000 in fiscal year 2019 grants, according to a June 21 news release. The money going towards the new initiative is earned through fines from automated traffic enforcement violations, such as speeding and running red lights. Since 2017, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) has allocated $2 million in grants to Vision Zero in hopes of improving pedestrian and cycling safety.
DDOT is dedicated to carrying out the initiative outlined by Bowser, DDOT Director of Communications Terry Owens wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The District of Columbia is fully committed to Mayor Bowser’s Vision Zero initiative and proactively working to address transportation safety,” Owens wrote.

Kenna Chick (SFS ’20) was confirmed as Georgetown University Student Association vice president by the GUSA senate Oct. 2, following a series of executive resignations in September.
President Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) nominated Chick for the position on Oct. 1. Martinez, former transition chair of the senate, became president under GUSA’s bylaws Sept. 16 following the resignations of former President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19), Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19), Chief of Staff Aaron Bennett (COL ’19) and nine other senior staff members. Nair resigned Sept. 11 amid sexual assault allegations.
No complaints had been filed against Nair through the Title IX office or the Office of Student Conduct, he wrote in a May 28 email to The Hoya. A university spokesperson confirmed that, as of May 2019, Nair was not the subject of any complaints through either office nor had he been found responsible for any violations of the Student Code of Conduct.
Martinez approached Chick, former chair of the mental health policy team, about the possibility of being nominated on Sept. 26. The pair previously worked together on the off-campus therapy stipend to provide mental health support for low-income students. The stipend successfully launched last spring after a $10,000 university contribution and a Saxafund fundraising effort.
“I could tell that Juan and I had (and continue to have) a similar passion for improving the college/university experiences of Georgetown students,” Chick wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Ultimately, I decided to accept the nomination because I know that GUSA and, more importantly, the student body at large face many difficulties, particularly now, and I want to do all that I can to help ease those difficulties, rebuild student confidence in GUSA and advocate for student wellness on campus.”
Chick is the first GUSA executive of East Asian descent and Martinez is the first Latinx and undocumented president. Improving diversity and creating an inclusive GUSA environment are critical for Martinez and Chick.
“I think this speaks to the larger lack of diversity when it comes to people of East Asian descent in positions of leadership,” Chick wrote about her heritage. “I am also proud to announce a senior staff that is diverse in a number of ways, from race to ability.”
Martinez and Chick plan to focus their administration on advocacy, transparency and student health, according to Chick. Both have experience in policy and advocacy with GUSA, and hope to encourage other students to work for change, Chick wrote.
Chick’s passion for improving student health and wellness is why she first became involved with GUSA, she said.
“I originally became involved in GUSA to serve as the GUSA Chair of the Mental Health Policy Team because I was very passionate about creating a Georgetown that is conducive to the health and wellness of its students, especially those who are experiencing difficulties in mental health,” Chick wrote.
Continuing this work as vice president is a top priority for Chick, from educating students on well-being to eliminating barriers for health resources.
“I also want to work towards promoting a more survivor-centric campus culture by advocating for healthier student interactions and greater awareness,” Chick wrote.
Given the atypical circumstances surrounding Chick’s appointment as vice president, rebuilding student confidence in GUSA is vital, she said. Chick hopes to better communicate GUSA’s role and purpose to the student community.
“Oftentimes, there’s a perception that GUSA is all about a self-serving pursuit of ‘status’ or ‘attention,’ but at the end of the day, I got involved in GUSA and I’m remaining involved in GUSA because it’s really about working to make Georgetown a better place for all Hoyas,” Chick wrote. “Whether it’s academics, quality of life, mental health, or any other area, my priority is making the experience better for all students.”
Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Kenna Chick was confirmed Oct. 3.
This article was updated June 23 to indicate the absence of Title IX or Office of Student Conduct complaints and to include comment from Nair.

The U.S. Senate confirmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by a 50-48 vote on Saturday.
Kavanaugh was sworn in Monday at the White House after a contentious confirmation process. Kavanaugh fills former Justice Anthony Kennedy’s seat on the court, following Kennedy’s June 27 retirement announcement.
Kavanaugh’s confirmation passed the Senate by the closest margin of approval since the confirmation of Justice Clarence Thomas, according to Politico. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) was the only Democrat to vote for Kavanaugh. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) (COL ’80) abstained and voted present and Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) was not present and did not vote, according to The New York Times.
Christine Blasey Ford, who was acquainted with Kavanaugh in high school, accused Kavanaugh of assaulting her at a high school party 36 years ago. The Senate delayed its vote to confirm Kavanaugh to hear testimony from both Kavanaugh and Ford, and to allow for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the allegations.
The FBI did not find evidence supporting Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh. It did not interview Ford or Kavanaugh and the White House security office coordinated with the FBI for the investigation, according to The Washington Post.
Law students and faculty throughout the country joined the effort to protest Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Almost 1,000 female law faculty signed a letter opposing the confirmation of Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court, according to The Hill.
Georgetown students attended protests at the Supreme Court to show support for Ford and express disapproval toward Kavanaugh. During the week, students drew chalk messages in Red Square expressing support for survivors of sexual assault, especially those on Georgetown’s campus.
The Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation reflect how the protection of survivors’ and women’s rights is still a problem in the United States, according to Georgetown University College Democrats Chair Maria Cornell (SFS ’20).
“She had all these things going for her to make her story more believed [sic] by Republicans, the media, the general American public, but yet that didn’t happen,” Cornell said in an interview with The Hoya.“I feel like that shows how far we still have to go as a country.”
Despite the turmoil surrounding his nomination, Kavanaugh should decide cases based on a fair interpretation of the Constitution rather than politically motivated agendas, Georgetown University College Republicans President Jake Lyons (COL ’20) said.
“My hopes are that Justice Kavanaugh will carry on the tradition of the Supreme Court being a place of nonpartisan and fair rulings based upon their interpretation of our Constitution — separate from the politicized agendas of the executive and legislative branches — and it is my expectation that he will do so,” Lyons wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Senate Judiciary Committee mismanaged the hearings, according to Lyons.
“I believe that the process was a train wreck – the committee hearings were handled poorly by all sides involved,” Lyons wrote. “And it was exacerbated to the point of watching hearings looked more like a reality drama show than anything else. It was unbecoming to the institution of the Senate, with again, Republicans and Democrats alike to blame.”
Cornell was also dissatisfied with the way the hearing was handled, and said Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee used a female prosecutor to protect their public image.
“I think the decision of Republicans to bring in a woman to question Dr. Ford because they didn’t want to do that, because the optics of that are awful, I think that’s just absolutely cowardly, and I think shows that they kind of know that they were in the wrong in terms of where they stood on her allegations and just believing her generally,” Cornell said.
Georgetown Sexual Assault Peer Educators said Kavanaugh’s confirmation negatively affected many survivors of sexual assault on campus and throughout the country.
“The nomination and confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States has deeply impacted many members of our community, as well as countless others across the country,” Georgetown Sexual Assault Peer Educators said in a statement. “As always, we encourage anyone who has been impacted by interpersonal violence to take advantage of resources available at Georgetown.”
Those who feel deeply affected by the Kavanaugh’s confirmation should take time to reflect and find an outlet for their frustration, Cornell said.
“I would just encourage anyone who feels upset by this to find productive ways to channel their anger, whether that’s productive through like self-care, whether that’s political mobilization, whatever they need to do to take care of themselves,” Cornell said.
Resources: On-campus resources include Health Education Services (202-687-8949) and Counseling and Psychiatric Services (202-687-7080); additional off-campus resources include the D.C. Rape Crisis Center (202-333-7273) and the D.C. Forensic Nurse Examiner Washington Hospital Center (844-443-5732).

Professor Christine Fair is on immediate research leave after a tweet on her personal Twitter account calling for violence against Republican senators received backlash last week, according to an email sent by Dean of the School of Foreign Service Joel Hellman on Oct. 5.
Fair’s tweet was a response to the Sept. 27 testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee by then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh — who is now a confirmed justice — in which he denied sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford in high school.
“Look at [this] chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement. All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps,” Fair wrote in her tweet. “Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.”
Hellman wrote in an email to the SFS that the decision to begin Fair’s research leave immediately, rather than wait until the previously scheduled date, was reached mutually between Fair and university administrators. The planned date for the beginning of her research was not included in the email.
“To prevent further disruption to [Fair’s] students and out of an abundance of caution for the security of our community, we have mutually agreed for Professor Fair to go on research leave effective immediately,” Hellman wrote in the email.
Some of the complaints about Fair received by the university were threatening, prompting an institutional response, Hellman wrote.
“It’s become clear that incivility begets incivility. While we have received many legitimate concerns from members of our community and beyond regarding the social media posts Professor Fair has made in her personal capacity, many other complaints registered have been provocative and threatening,” Hellman wrote. “Our Threat Assessment Team and Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD) have taken preventive steps to secure our campus, conduct safety assessments, and continue to monitor the situation.”
Brahmachari Vrajvihari Sharan, the university director for Hindu life, will take over Fair’s “Intermediate Hindi” classes, according to Dan Byman, vice dean of the SFS.
Fair’s tweet received backlash from alumni, students and conservative-leaning media. A poster was hung early in the morning on Oct. 4 in Red Square, displaying Fair’s tweet, followed by an add-on reading: “Why won’t President Degioia [sic] condemn this?”
President John J. DeGioia released a statement Oct. 4 condemning Fair’s use of violent imagery but defended school officials’ right to freedom of speech, in an email sent to the Georgetown community.
“We protect the right of our community members to exercise their freedom of expression. This does not mean the University endorses the content of their expression,” DeGioia wrote. “We can and do strongly condemn the use of violent imagery, profanity, and insensitive labeling of individuals based on gender, ethnicity or political affiliation in any form of discourse. Such expressions go against our values.”
Fair described the backlash as censorship intended to discipline her free speech as a woman in an interview with The Washington Post.
“It’s another way to discipline women’s bodies, by asking us to discipline our rage,” Fair said. “I cannot tell you the rage and hurt it feels as all of those men on that Judiciary Committee kicked sexual assault survivors in the gut.”

Eliza Lafferty (COL ’21) and Patrick Walsh (SFS ’21) were elected speaker and vice speaker of the Georgetown University Student Association senate in an emergency senate meeting Oct. 2.
Lafferty, the former transition chair of the senate, and Walsh, the former transition vice chair of the senate were nominated for Speaker and vice speaker after former Transition Chair Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) ascended to the GUSA presidency, a result of vacancies in the executive following the resignations of former President Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and former Vice President Naba Rahman (SFS ’19). The speaker and vice speaker nominations and confirmations are an internal voting process within the GUSA senate body.
Both Lafferty and Walsh said increased transparency is a key part of their vision for the GUSA senate moving forward, in terms of both policy areas and student engagement. The pair brought in Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22) as an executive officer to help with this goal, Walsh said.
“One big hope that all three of us have is really making sure that the GUSA senate is much more accessible to the whole public, to all of the student body,” Walsh said. “GUSA doesn’t work well when it’s not in touch with the student body, and that’s one thing that I want the student body to know.”
Lafferty sees increased transparency as a remedy to GUSA’s failure to reflect the entire student body in terms of gender, race and other identities.
“We know, going in, that we don’t represent everyone, that we aren’t all of the voices of the student body,” Lafferty said. “That kind of goes back to this radical transparency idea, where we need to be as transparent as possible about everything we do because we can’t be advocating for the student body when we don’t look like the student body.”
In addition to transparency, Walsh seeks to use the GUSA Senate to elevate and uplift student voices, both in the GUSA policy teams as well as in external student advocacy organizations.
“One criticism that’s always happened in the past is that student government has tamped down on student activism, and that’s what we’re trying to avoid,” Walsh said. “That’s why we’re trying to use GUSA as an institution that can help support student activists, and can help uplift their voices in the specific skill sets that GUSA has, while also allowing for those activists to still do advocacy effectively.”
Lafferty hopes to address students’ limited knowledge about the GUSA Senate and its operations.
“Once people understand how institutions work, then it helps them to feel more comfortable coming to that institution, and so my goal is that people will come to us, and will feel comfortable voicing their opinion,” Lafferty said. “GUSA is best when we’re advocating for students directly, and when we’re doing good policy work.”
Hayley Grande (COL ’21), a GUSA At-Large Senator who voted to confirm both Lafferty and Walsh, discussed her view of the future of the GUSA Senate, and her confidence in Lafferty’s leadership.
“I completely trust her leadership and her vision because I think that she will bring her passion to that role as Speaker, and she’s also a great motivator, so she’ll be able to bring out the best in everyone,” Grande said. “There’s a lot to look forward to, and the past was rough, but it’s in the past, and we have to keep moving.”
The roles of Speaker and Vice Speaker of the Senate are supervisory, involving tasks like setting agendas for the Senate, overseeing policy committees and managing media relations, according to Lafferty and Walsh.
“The truth is that, as Speaker and Vice Speaker, we do kind of have to step down from doing direct policy work,” Lafferty said.
Both Lafferty and Walsh stressed the need to rebuild trust in GUSA moving forward. Walsh said he had faith in GUSA Senators and the executive branch, because of their commitment and dedication to student advocacy.
“GUSA can still be effective because of Georgetown students,” Walsh said. “A lot of the people involved in the Senate now, and a lot in the executive, really care about this institution and really care about this school.”
Lafferty discussed the wider effects on both the students and the institution, as well as her goal to ensure the Senate is more self-aware and in tune with Georgetown students.
“This institution that we’re in has had a lot of troubles, and there were very problematic things that happened within it. It’s making us just be very aware of every step that we take forward,” Lafferty said. “All of us are better and stronger people because of what we went through.”
