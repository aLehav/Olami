A School of Continuing Studies (SCS) student won the Lena Landegger Community Service Award for his volunteer efforts with the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association (GUSVA) and Arlington County Medical Reserve Corps (MRC). 
Every year, the award recognizes Georgetown students who demonstrate an exceptional commitment to serving communities in need. James Jaramillo (COL ’22), one of this year’s recipients, received the award because of community service efforts within the Georgetown community, especially his service in assisting veterans returning from service. Jaramillo is the first SCS student to win the award in the school’s history.
While in GUSVA, Jaramillo coordinated local, military-affiliated events, leading tours of Arlington National Cemetery to educate visitors on the lives of veterans. With a motto of “Veterans for Others,” the driving mission of GUSVA is to wholly embrace the principle of giving back, according to Jaramillo. 
An Army veteran himself, Jaramillo said he initially attempted to distance himself from his military background when coming to campus out of fears about stereotyping.
“I did this because for many years prior to attending Georgetown, I attended community college and felt as if the label of ‘veteran’ drastically altered how people perceived me,” Jaramillo wrote to The Hoya. “I still interacted with veteran communities by serving on the board of our Student Veterans Association chapter, and participated in our decision-making process, but I wanted undergraduate students to realize that veterans aren’t a one size fits all!”
Wesley Wilson, the director of Georgetown’s Military and Veterans Resource Center, said the award serves as a well-deserved acknowledgement of the contributions Jaramillo and other veteran student organizations have made to Georgetown and communities in need. 
“I am elated to see James Jaramillo recognized for his service activities. Our military-connected student organizations are crucial in creating a space for military students to connect, build community, and continue serving,” Wilson wrote to The Hoya. “I am proud and thankful for GUSVA’s service to our campus community and to their country.” 
In addition to his work with GUSVA, Jaramillo assisted the Arlington MRC in their vaccination efforts and response to COVID-19, something he said inspired his passion for providing equitable healthcare. 
“My volunteer experience with the Medical Reserve Corps allowed me to see how healthcare disparities impacted people from underserved communities,” Jaramillo wrote. “These interactions helped me realize my goal of working in primary care as a physician in the future with the goal of improving health equity and trust in underserved communities to improve their access to care.”
Jaramillo quickly became a reliable and regular volunteer for MRC’s vaccination clinics both during the pandemic and after, MRC coordinator Michael Fletcher said. 
“Even as the initial rush of vaccine demand slowed down later in the year and life ‘returned to normal’ for many volunteers, James still found time to sign up for a shift, usually multiple times a week,” Fletcher wrote to The Hoya. “Clinic staff are always happy to see his name on the daily sign-in sheet, knowing that he’ll be there to fill any role needed of him and have a positive, infectious attitude while doing it.” 
SCS Dean Kelly Otter said Jaramillo exemplifies the school’s ideals of supporting the common good. 
“From serving our country to giving back to our community, James exemplifies the many strengths of our student veterans at SCS who go above and beyond the classroom to build a better future,” Otter wrote to The Hoya. “I am incredibly proud of James who is a role model among his peers demonstrating how empowered students can thrive and ignite positive change in their communities.”
Jaramillo said he remains engaged with healthcare volunteering even after graduation and encourages his peers to get involved in their own communities. 
“This award empowered me to continue to aid my community and show others how Hoyas can positively impact our surroundings,” Jaramillo wrote. “These days I find myself volunteering with the MRC, MedVets, and my neighborhood community center. MedVets is specifically designed to provide mentor services to veterans considering a medical career.”

Georgetown University students sold a variety of dorm items, including used rugs, fridges and shelves, diverting nearly 500 pounds of waste during a used dorm item pop-up sale over the course of three days during the Fall 2022 semester move-in.
Brooke Hodge (SFS ’24), Stephane Granato (SFS ’24) and other members of the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN) collaboratively sold over 100 products and raised $1,500 during the sale, which ran on Aug. 19, 21 and 22.
Granato said the event helped reduce waste and increased the accessibility of clothing, school and dorm materials, which were GREEN’s primary goals for the sale. 
“It gave people, especially students who can’t afford to buy all brand new stuff, access to more accessible dorm items at a more affordable price,” Granato said in an interview with The Hoya.
Half of GREEN’s earnings from the event will be used to eventually establish a permanent shop for reused supplies, called a REUSE shop, while the other half is being directly allocated to Georgetown Mutual Aid, according to Hodge.
“The overarching goal of the permanent REUSE shop would be to encourage a circular economy, significantly reduce waste, and increase the accessibility of clothing, school, and dorm materials on campus while raising money for local nonprofits,” Hodge wrote to The Hoya. “We also hope in the future that we will be able to pay student workers as this year, we relied on the volunteered time of the 7 grant recipients and friends willing to help.”
The Office of Sustainability initially suggested the idea for a dorm supply pop-up sale following the move-out drive at the end of the Spring 2022 semester when students donated supplies to be reused, according to Granato. 
The pop-up was funded by GREEN’s Spring 2022 winnings of $500 from the Greens Commons Award, which is awarded to proposals that support discourse and action on environmental and sustainability issues in the Georgetown community, according to the Green Commons Awards’ values statement. 
Hodge said she, Granato, Rita Alan (SFS ’24), Paul Aversa (SFS ’25), Elizabeth Packard (COL ’25) and Eleanor Hohenberg (COL ’25) worked together on the application for the award. 
“We wrote a proposal to receive funding to collect dorm items, store them over the summer, and host a popup REUSE shop during fall move-in,” Hodge wrote. “After getting the funding we collected donated dorm materials and clothing during the move-out drive, transported and stored the materials in a storage unit, and transported them back to campus in the fall where we hosted the pop-up sale for 3 days during move-in.”
Granato said the pop-up served as a trial run to show that students would use and benefit from a permanent REUSE store.
“We’re hoping that the pop-up shop’s success is a proof of concept,” Granato said.
The biggest obstacle the group faces in trying to open a permanent store is finding a space on campus to operate out of, according to Granato. 
“We’re looking at a few different options, but to be honest, it’s been really, really hard — we’ve been trying to get a space for a long time,” Granato said. “It’s still up in the air, and we may also try and establish ourselves as our own nonprofit. We’re kind of exploring a lot of different options right now.”
The Center for Student Engagement also prohibits GREEN from selling items for profit as an organization, so the permanent shop will not be able to be directly affiliated with GREEN, according to Hodge. 
“GREEN members will be working outside of the club to develop a proposal and long-term plan for the development of an eventual permanent REUSE shop,” Hodge wrote.
To bypass this issue in the past, GREEN has partnered with The Corp for their thrift shop efforts. The group worked with Georgetown Mutual Aid and The Corp last year to develop Uncommon Threads, racks where used clothing and accessories are sold in The Corp’s Uncommon Grounds and Hilltoss, according to Hodge.
Granato said student demand for used items is irrefutable, and a permanent REUSE store will benefit the student community. 
“We think the demand is really clear, people love the store,” Granato said. “I think it serves a great purpose, raising money for charity, for mutual aid on campus, but also giving students access to used items and also promoting sustainability.”
This article was updated on Oct. 18 to correct the list of students who won the Green Commons Award.

Georgetown University’s Center for Social Justice is launching its second iteration of the Legacy of a Dream (LoaD) internship program, which pairs students up with local nonprofits.
Students who are selected for the program work with leaders and organizations that have been recognized by the John Thompson Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award for their strides toward solving key issues in Washington, D.C. When applying, students fill out a form where they indicate their areas of interest and their preferences from a list of organizations. If chosen, students are then matched with the organization that best fits their interests. 
Students selected for the program are expected to work six to eight hours a week, and can participate on a volunteer basis or apply their Federal Work Study awards.
As a LoaD intern, Maggie Fan (SFS ’25) worked at House of Ruth, an organization that supports women recovering from trauma and abuse. 
Fan said the program allowed her to engage with issues within the D.C. community and use her skills and expertise to make a positive impact.
“As a LoaD intern, I had the opportunity to work with incredible women who empower their local community around injustices of domestic violence and homelessness,” Fan wrote in a promotional flier for the program. “In my first year at Georgetown, I researched the effectiveness of eviction policies before and during Covid. I was able to directly implement my research into the organization’s work.”
Rachel Tao (COL ’25), a member of the spring cohort of LoaD, interned at Academy of Hope, a local Black-led adult public charter school. 
Tao said she gained valuable administrative skills beyond her expectations coming into the program.
“On one hand, I gained more practical skills like communication, coordinating with several dozen volunteers regularly, and research, studying industry best practices and other organizations’ fundraising tactics,” Tao wrote to The Hoya. “I also learned a lot about fundraising and social media marketing strategy that will serve me well in future roles.”
Beyond gaining work experience, the program also allows Georgetown students to make long-lasting changes in their partner organizations, according to Tao.
As a LoaD intern, Tao said she designed an entirely new digital fundraising strategy, which Academy of Hope has recently implemented. 
“That project required significant dedication and effort, but it will be deeply rewarding to see my recommendations carried out, to know that I had a tangible impact on the organization that will last for years to come,” Tao wrote. 
Fan said she also got to make an impact outside of her typical responsibilities as an intern at House of Ruth.
“The most rewarding experience was meeting the incredible staff and taking their photographs to design their IDs,” Fan wrote. “I was happy that I could design something useful for the staff beyond solely my internship.”
Tao said the experience she gained in the program has helped shape her thoughts regarding her future career. 
“I gained meaningful experience in being a part of a team and a greater social justice movement for racial and economic equity,” Tao wrote. “Perhaps most valuably, this internship has made me so much more interested in nonprofit work as a potential career path. Whatever I do in the future, I will take my experiences at Academy of Hope with me, making me a better worker and person. I would highly recommend the experience!”
The LoaD internship program works in tandem with the award, providing support to selected organizations while giving motivated students a rewarding experience, according to a university spokesperson.
“This program strengthens the John Thompson, Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award by supporting awardee organizations with talented Georgetown students who are committed to social justice work; creates a pipeline of work opportunities for Georgetown at highly vetted, impactful and mission-aligned DC non-profit organizations,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya.
Fan said she recommends LoaD to anyone interested in exploring the work people are doing beyond Georgetown’s gates.
“I would definitely recommend this program to anyone who’s really trying to learn more about D.C. as a whole beyond solely Georgetown,” Fan wrote. “I was able to really get out in the community and learn about D.C. and its really cool organizations.”

Business for Impact, an initiative under Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business (MSB), held a forum discussing the nation’s medical debt crisis and possible next steps for healthcare providers and policymakers.
The Sept. 8 forum focused on a report from the Business for Impact initiative, which works to see how business can help solve social, economic and environmental challenges. The report, called “Prescription for Medical Debt: How Care Providers, Collection Agencies and Government Can Help,” identified the main causes and consequences of medical debt accumulation. Approximately 1 in 10 U.S. adults owe medical debt, with collective medical debt held by Americans amounting to aroundt $195 billion in 2019. Health expenses generated by the pandemic and recent inflation have since exacerbated the issue. 
The forum was sponsored by Capio, a management company dedicated to resolving clients’ outstanding medical bills and helping them find solutions for medical debt. 
The forum’s speakers included Hank Cardello, who authored the report; John McNamara, assistant director of consumer credit, payments, and deposits markets at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; Ashwini Kotwal, CEO of Arietis Health, a revenue cycle management company; and Mark Detrick, CEO of Capio. 
Cardello, who serves as Executive Director of the Leadership Solutions for Health and Prosperity program at Business for Impact, said medical debt worsens the health outcomes of patients by disincentivizing seeking further treatment.
“One of the most insidious results of medical debt is the avoidance of routine or essential healthcare in order to avert additional medical expenses,” Cardello wrote to The Hoya. “Nearly half of the respondents (45%) in the American Cancer Society study had delayed care for a serious issue due to their medical debt.”
Almost a quarter of U.S. adults have avoided refilling a prescription due to cost, according to a 2022 study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation. This figure increases to 29% and 30% of U.S. adults for Hispanic and black patients, respectively. 
Even medications that are essential for a patient’s survival, such as insulin, may be skipped due to the financial stress, which significantly worsens health outcomes, Cardello said.
“A recent study of diabetes patients by CharityRx found of the 60% of respondents who rationed their insulin due to medical debt, 54% reported that they couldn’t do everyday activities, 44% said they couldn’t work, and 37% said they couldn’t go to school,” Cardello wrote. “One-third reported becoming sick as the result of rationing their insulin and 38% wound up in the hospital for one or more days.
By inviting panelists and attendees across a wide range of backgrounds, the event encouraged inter-field collaboration on the medical debt problem, according to a Capio spokesperson. 
“The goal of the event was to bring together a variety of healthcare industry and regulatory leaders who are on the forefront of the medical debt crisis to shed light on why medical debt has ballooned and to propose practical solutions that could help the millions of Americans who find themselves overwhelmed by medical debt,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. 
In addition to addressing the consequences of medical debts, panelists also discussed ways medical debt disproportionally affects some American households equally. 
Medical debt is especially detrimental to certain low-income and at-risk demographics known as ALICE patients, the Capio spokesperson said.
“Too many people can’t afford an unexpected medical bill. There is a group of Americans who are commonly referred to as ALICE patients (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed Americans),” the spokesperson wrote. “These individuals often have zero to negative net worth, don’t qualify for financial assistance, and when an unexpected medical debt arises in their lives, they’re often unable to afford it and fall into debt.”
Paying medical bills is something that 41% of working-age Americans, approximately 72 million people, struggle with, according to a survey by The Commonwealth Fund. The likelihood of medical debt increases 20% for low-income adults unable to afford adequate health insurance.
The spokesperson recommended passing policies that extend the time people are given to pay off debts to make the burden more manageable for patients. 
Cardello said he hopes to see greater transparency with patients on how to navigate medical debt paired with substantial legislative change moving forward.
“Consumers need to be empowered with better information about how to climb out of and avoid medical debt, and industry should provide easy-to-use tools to help them,” Cardello wrote. “Legislators should establish affordable payment solutions for at-risk households that make repayment feasible without jeopardizing the family’s basic needs.”

The Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy announced five new Richmond Foundation Fellows in recognition of their work in public health policy.
The fellows for the 2022-23 academic year, announced Sept. 6, are Becky Normile, (GRD ’23), Alekhya Chaparala, (GRD ’24), Rosemary Rhodes (GRD ’24), Rehman Liaqat (GRD ’24) and Nadia Stovicek (GRD ’23). Fellows receive a partial-tuition scholarship of up to $25,000 and a paid research assistantship related to health care access with McCourt faculty. Though specializing in different fields, all five fellows are driven by personal connections to their work.
The George E. Richmond Foundation is dedicated to researching the role of oral health in comprehensive health care and advancing health through science, economics and policy. Fellows are selected for their demonstrated interest in health policy, addressing systemic issues in health and expanding access to health care.  
Normile, who became interested in health policy after working with several states on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the fellowship has broadened her understanding of the weaknesses of public health policy. 
“It also showed me how much work we have left to do as a nation to ensure all individuals have access to high-quality, affordable care and are able to attain good health,” Normile wrote to The Hoya. “This is why I’m so excited and honored to be a George E. Richmond Fellow, where I’ll have the opportunity to examine strategies state Medicaid programs can use to improve access to oral health care for underserved populations.” 
Having served as a teaching assistant for incarcerated students during her time as an undergraduate at Cornell University, Chaparala said the fellowship gives her the opportunity to use a policy perspective to pursue her passion for improving population health. 
“The fellowship adds a practical experiential component to my experience at McCourt, and gives me an opportunity to explore my interest in health policy at the state and local level,” Chaparala wrote to The Hoya. 
Rhodes, who is studying the sociodemographic, economic and environmental indicators of health service, said she is inspired by her mother, a physician who primarily treats low-income and marginalized populations in Washington, D.C.
“I grew up in my mom’s hospital — I volunteered there starting from the time I could pretty much walk and talk. This naturally led to a leading interest in health economics and policy,” Rhodes wrote to The Hoya. “I would constantly ask my mom why the different populations that she was seeing had different outcomes (or even, from my young eyes, why it seemed like one demographic was more susceptible to a condition than another).”
Social determinants of health, which include a patient’s race, age, residence, occupation and economic status, shape health outcomes like recovery rates and life expectancy. For instance, systematic inequality in housing conditions and food access contribute to higher rates of obesity, asthma and chronic illness in African Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites, according to the Center for American Progress.
Liaqat said memories of his immigrant parents overcoming the difficulties they faced coming to the United States fuel his passion for public policy. 
“For me, such aspirations revolve around refugee and immigration policy,” Liaqat wrote to The Hoya. “From my mother’s refuge in the United States as a mother of six under life-threatening conditions in an underprivileged home to my father who drove a taxi in D.C. for nearly three decades, immigration reform has always been something that I knew I needed to pursue, not merely something I wanted to pursue.”
Liaqat said his lived experiences continue to inform his work in refugee and immigration policy reform and its intersection with health care accessibility. He hopes to use his background in Pakistani politics and policymaking to create processes that respect the rights of refugees, specifically, through his pursuit of creating access to affordable health care in the United States.
After seeing how research on health equity has grown as a field, Rhodes said she is optimistic that real change is possible within the new generation of policymakers. 
“I hope that by the end of my life we’re closer to a world where all individuals have equal and affordable access to healthcare (because we should be realistic about how slow policy can work sometimes!),” Rhodes wrote. “I am of the opinion that when economic inequality is discussed, health should always be a component of that conversation.”

Georgetown University is positioning itself to become a leader in the tracking and prevention of emerging viral diseases after securing a $12.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support emerging virus research.  
The funds will bankroll new research and educational projects overseen by Verena, a shorthand name for the Viral Emergence Research Initiative. Verena is a Georgetown-based research initiative founded by two university scientists in 2019 dedicated to researching the inception and spread of infectious diseases, according to a university press release. The grant, which Georgetown received in August and expires in 2027, also sanctifies the NSF’s latest Biology Integration Institutes, which provides support for collaborative teams that perform research within and beyond biology.
Founded six months before the COVID-19 pandemic, Verena’s team has employed machine learning and multidisciplinary research techniques to determine where the next pandemic might come from and how to stop it. Verena hopes to continue this line of research through the new funding, according to Colin Carlson, the director and co-founder of Verena and an assistant professor at Georgetown.
“The days of ‘quiet periods’ between epidemics are over — from this point on, we’re headed from COVID-19 straight into monkeypox, into the next public health crisis,” Carlson said in the press release. “Our goal is to build the data and tools we need to know what’s coming tomorrow — and maybe, actually, be ready next time.”
Carlson said he hopes the new funding will enable Verena to pursue more complex and more meaningful research. 
“Three years in, we’re thrilled at the chance to scale up and tackle even harder problems — and hopefully start to make real impacts in global health and conservation,” Carlson said. 
Verena’s work has already proved to contribute significantly within the scientific community. In April 2022, Carlson and Gregory Albery, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown and Verena’s second co-founder, published a study charting the potentially disastrous impact climate change will have on the spread of infectious disease. 
Carlson and Albery’s simulation forecasts that cross-species disease transmission will increase drastically in coming decades as changes in climate force species previously isolated from one another to cohabitate. The study reported that the intensified viral exchange among animals increases the likelihood that one of the roughly 10,000 viruses capable of infecting humans will do so more often and with more devastating effects. 
A large portion of Verena’s new funding will go toward researching bats, one of the animal kingdom’s most effective virus transmitters. Mosquito-borne illnesses will also receive a special focus from the institute.
Sharing and synthesizing public data about viruses is another core part of Verena’s work. The institute is in the process of constructing what it hopes will be the largest open data ecosystem in viral ecology. 
Verena began the process of enlarging its team only weeks after receiving its first installment of NSF funds, announcing a slate of new fellowship and staff positions in late August. Verena’s team and Georgetown University School of Medicine (GUSM) leaders hope the institute’s sustained growth will yield significant benefits for scientists and policymakers hoping to tackle future pandemics, according to Edward Healton, executive vice president for health sciences. 
“This is a global problem that will take a team of researchers from many different perspectives and experiences to address emerging diseases,” Healton wrote to The Hoya. 
With new funding, Verena may also develop its training and educational programs to expand research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, according to Cynthia Wei, assistant professor in Georgetown’s Science, Technology and International Affairs program and who serves as Verena’s education director.        
“Students will have chances to connect with and learn from a sharp, diverse, and vibrant group of researchers, as well as unique opportunities to engage in Verena research,” Wei said in the press release. “These experiences will provide an exciting window into the process of collaborative, interdisciplinary, and actionable science. They will also provide a chance for students to be a part of cutting-edge discoveries on viral emergence.”
The grant given to Verena will enable Georgetown to become a leader in emerging virus research as further scientific attention is given to infectious diseases.
“Addressing emerging diseases — especially against the backdrop of climate change — and its disproportionate impact on some populations, is one of our more important health issues,” Healton wrote. “Georgetown is well positioned to lead this work.”

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) established a new office to help mitigate the large influx of migrants that have been bussed into the District from Republican-controlled border states.
On Sept. 8, Bowser announced the creation of the Office of Migrant Services which will be considered part of the Department of Human Services and will work to provide additional support to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are currently aiding migrants in the District. Since the spring, D.C. has been struggling to manage the large influx of migrants that have been sent in on chartered buses by the Republican governors of Texas and Arizona. 
Texas has spent more than $12 million as Republican Governor Greg Abbott vows to prevent border crossings in his state. Abbott has chartered buses for migrants who enter the United States to East Coast cities, often controlled by Democrats, such as D.C. Abbott has done so in a move to antagonize the Biden administration for its border policies and send these migrants to traditionally liberal cities.
Two planes carrying migrants were flown to Martha’s Vineyard on the night of Sept. 14, a move that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has taken credit for. Abbott sent two buses of migrants to Vice President Kamala Harris’ residence in D.C. Sept. 15.
About 9,400 migrants have been bused to the District since the spring, according to a press release from the Executive Office of the Mayor. The press release describes the move as a political stunt designed to draw the attention of the White House. 
“President Biden’s inaction at our southern border continues putting the lives of Texans—and Americans—at risk and is overwhelming our communities,” Abbott said in a recent press release from his office. “To continue providing much-needed relief to our small, overrun border towns, Chicago will join fellow sanctuary cities Washington, D.C. and New York City as an additional drop-off location.”
Abbott has claimed the move is in the best interest of both the migrants and the towns they have been seeking asylum in.
Elham Atashi, co-director and associate teaching professor in the Justice and Peace Studies program at Georgetown, said that while the bussing of migrants is a recent phenomenon, the issue of immigration is not a new crisis.
“The practice of loading migrants on buses and driving them to urban centers such as Washington, DC has shifted and artificially reconstructed border experiences,” Atashi wrote to The Hoya. “But it has also further derailed us in effective policies to deal with the cause of such large-scale migration, criminalized the issue and dehumanized the migrants.”
After declaring a public health emergency,  Bowser filed emergency paperwork for the Office of Migrant Services to the Council of the District of Columbia. 
“With this plan, we are staying true to our D.C. values and building a system that will support a compassionate, consistent and well-coordinated response,” Mayor Bowser said in the press release. “This is a new challenge for D.C., but I feel confident that if we lead with our values, and if we put the right systems in place – which we are doing with the Office of Migrant Services, then we will lead a response that makes our community proud.”
The District government will allocate $10 million to the Office of Migrant Services. The money will provide both the government and NGOs the ability to serve more migrants who are arriving and seeking asylum. According to the press release, Mayor Bowser will request that the federal government reimburse the money.
The Office of Migrant Services will allow the District to respond to the arrival of migrants without the use of the D.C. National Guard. This program, which is separate from the houseless service system, will attempt to meet the needs of the migrant population, including food, accomodations and medical needs
Mayor Bowser requested that the National Guard be deployed twice to respond to this crisis, but the request was denied by the Department of Defense (DOD). According to the rejection letter obtained by CNN, the Pentagon wrote that it would not be appropriate to deploy the D.C. National Guard. Mayor Bowser does not currently have the power to deploy the D.C. National Guard and must ask the federal government to do so because D.C. is not a state.
According to Atashi, D.C. must act to support migrants who arrive and act to implement specific policies that accomplish this. 
“Once the buses arrive in DC, it is up to the city of Washington DC not to derail and outsource the problem as Federal and shift the city’s response as prolonging effective policies into waiting for help,” Atashi wrote. “What is more useful is to begin to think about policies that can consider this as a problem for the community in Washington DC and to tap into resources for assistance, guidance and support.”

A group of Georgetown undergraduates and professors helped rebuild an educational visitor center in the Diani Beach region of Kenya this summer.
The center was built under the jurisdiction of Colobus Conservation, a not-for-profit organization founded in 1997 to protect vulnerable primate species in East Africa. The center has now expanded to conducting research on human-primate relations, animal welfare, forest protection and eco-tourism awareness.
The natural habitats of species native to Diani Beach have become disrupted as the location has become an increasingly popular vacation spot. Tourism-related development, such as the construction of hotels, threaten the biodiversity of the area, which has lost 75% of its forests over the past 25 years.
The Georgetown team spent the Spring 2022 semester designing a visitors center that raises environmental awareness for tourists in collaboration with the Colobus Conservation. Angela van Doorn, an assistant professor of biology and trip leader, is a long-time friend of the center’s director, Pamela Cunneyworth.
Over the summer, the group went on a two-week trip to Africa to bring their plans to life.
Greg Latronica (COL ’24), a student member of the team, emphasized the importance of communicating with Diani Beach region locals to best understand where their help was needed.
“The relationship that exists between humans and local animal populations is special and delicate. Listening to different people share their perspectives made it clear to me how interdisciplinary environmental issues have become,” Latronica wrote to The Hoya. “This work is super important, but what’s even more important is listening to the stories and perspectives of those affected to reimagine a future where both humanity and nature have the opportunity to thrive.”
The goal of the project was to encourage people to appreciate Diani Beach as more than a vacation spot and promote a mindful treatment of the beach’s ecosystem, John Katial (COL ’25), another student member of the team said.
“We constantly strove to maintain a delicate balance in our conservation messaging, one that conveyed both the precarious situation the Southern coast ecosystem is in as well as the hope and beauty surrounding its resilience,” Katial wrote to The Hoya. “In trying to impact viewers, we wanted them to walk away with a sense that while the situation is serious their actions do make a difference.”
When the team was creating posters and plaques for the visitors center, it was a priority that their work inspired, rather than disheartened, visitors about environmental change, Katial said.In their mission to inform, trip leader and biology assistant professor Dail Chapman said it was important for visual aids to be clear, engaging and fun.
“The exhibit needed to keep the attention of all ages and it was important that it be interactive,” Chapman wrote to The Hoya. “After a year of prep, two weeks working on site, and lots of incredible experiences in-between, we accomplished what we set out to do.”
Shauna Bennett, an assistant professor of biology who also helped to lead the trip, said the project allowed her to enjoy a new dimension of teaching outside of a classroom.
“Personally, my highlight from the trip was being able to share a brand new, perspective-changing experience with a group of students,” Bennett wrote to The Hoya. “It’s my favorite part of teaching, but wow, does travelling really let you learn together.”
In addition to revitalizing the visitors center, the team assisted Colobus with data collection on human-primate interactions at local hotels and supported staff with the day-to-day tasks of the conservation center,” Latronica said.
The students studied a variety of monkey species at Colobus and learned about the complexities that come with primates living in such close proximity to humans, from human razing of monkey habitats to the negative effects of the presence of monkeys on the local tourism industry, according to Katial.
Latronica said witnessing this relationship was eye-opening, helping him realize the importance of considering all perspectives in issues concerning the future of human interactions with nature.
“There was something awe-inspiring about observing monkey troops in their natural environment, and their intrinsic value is something so clear when you see it first-hand,” Latronica wrote. “Listening to different people share their perspectives made it clear to me how interdisciplinary environmental issues have become.”
Katial said his favorite memory from the trip was exploring the nature of Kenya and seeing how the region could serve as an example of environmental best practices around the world.
“What I found most amazing about it however is that even with relatively few resources, their conservation paradigm is inspirational,” Katial wrote. “The island has banned plastic, uses solar power, and fishes sustainably. They are a model to be emulated.”

Georgetown University announced plans to renovate the ground floor of Healy Hall, tripling the space dedicated to the Georgetown Scholars Program (GSP).
Construction is already underway for GSP, which provides support for first-generation and low-income (FGLI) students. The new 2,300-square-foot space will include a student lounge, several work spaces, private offices for meetings, a kitchen and a storage space. The renovated ground floor will also hold a brand-new well-being space for students to participate in health and wellness programming and a gathering space for students involved with Catholic ministry. Construction will be finished by Fall 2023.
GSP Student Board President Sofia Chen Ma (MSB ’23) said she envisions the new space to be the core of the GSP community.
“When you think about what the space is going to look like, it’s not an office space, it’s not a center, it’s a community hub for GSPers to gather together,” Chen Ma told The Hoya. “For us, it was a long time coming.”
The new space will allow the program to better support first-generation college students, according to Missy Foy, executive director of GSP.
“This project also provides an opportunity to think about how to provide our first generation college students a distinct community space, while leveraging the opportunity for our students to casually meet students from a variety of backgrounds, which can be crucial for students’ development,” Foy wrote to The Hoya.
In January 2021, the Georgetown Office of Student Equity and Inclusion planned to move the program’s space from its original location in Healy Hall to an office in New South Hall.
However, university officials found structural concerns in New South in July 2021, resulting in GSP’s relocation to the fourth floor of the Leavey Center. These changes were announced to the public August 2021, sparking outrage among community members. After nearly three months of protests from students and alumni, the university announced that the program would return to Healy Hall.
Chen Ma said GSP’s location in Healy is an important symbol for first generation, low income students. 
“The student hub would be that space for students to be a sanctuary that wasn’t created on the confines of privilege, but its mission and its intention was for students like us,” Chen Ma said in an interview with The Hoya. “Getting that space back for us to be able to build community to be able to be who we are and claim space, I think is important.”
Chen Ma said before the COVID-19 pandemic GSP’s office fostered a community she felt safe in, something she is looking forward to having again with the new office.
“It was just a very gathering space where you can just go and hang out and not have anything to say and still be welcomed,” Chen Ma said. “It felt very relieving for me, because I can just be myself. I can just come to this space and be who I am meant to be, and just talk to people and get to know people on a more intimate level, and talk about real things, and I met a lot of my closest friends.”
Lisa Kennedy (COL ’25), who is a GSP storyteller, or someone who records the history of GSP’s work, is looking forward to having a physical office space.
“I didn’t get to experience the sense of community that having that office creates,” Kennedy said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s a safe space for GSP students where they can really feel supported by campus staff, and of course there’s unique struggles that first-gen low income students face that can’t be adequately addressed without having that space.”
Architects are working with GSP members to incorporate student input into the planning of the space, Kennedy said. 
“They’re really trying to factor in student voices, GSP student voices and GSP student leader voices when they’re developing the student office,” Kennedy said. “They’ll be doing focus groups in the coming months to solicit student opinions and voices, and GSP staff’s opinions on what this new space should look like, and how we should organize it because we will be sharing the space with other campus organizations.”
Chen Ma said she is excited to return to the space she and many other people fought for GSP to be in. 
“We know we have the option to go other places, but I think we had so much support from other people that I think it was like we were right on sticking by our gut and saying this is the space that we want to be at, and fighting for that,” Chen Ma said.

Amid the vendors selling wood-fired pizzas and flavor-stuffed empanadas at the Georgetown University Farmers Market (GUFM) sits a composting station where students can discard food waste as an effort to create a more environmentally friendly campus.
The composting bins, organized by GUFM in collaboration with the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN), are located in the middle of Red Square during the market every Wednesday afternoon until it closes for the winter. In addition to helping students reduce waste, the initiative aims to educate students on the importance of composting efforts.
GUFM Director Francesca Donovan (COL ’23) said the aim of the initiative is to expand the amount of waste that can be collected as more students learn that the composting bins are available.
“We are working to bring even more compost, because at this point we are constrained to three bins and we definitely want more,” Donovan said to The Hoya. “So far we have had a couple students bring their compost from the last week and drop it off, which is the goal here.”
Compost Cab, a local Washington, D.C. environmental organization that aids in composting efforts, picks up the compost from GUFM each week. In addition to GUFM, composting is available at the Dupont Farmers Market and Eastern Market Farmers Market in D.C. 
Nadia Sadanandan (NHS ’24), one of the leads for the GREEN’s Zero Waste Team, which is helping to organize the composting initiative, said educating students on how to compost is important for reducing waste on campus. 
“The other thing we need to help students with is teaching them how to compost in their dorms and that they can actually store food waste and food scraps in their freezer in a ziplock bag and bring it to the market every Wednesday to drop off,” Sadanandan said to The Hoya.
Avery Kaye (COL ’24) said composting in college helps her to reduce her impact on the environment and to continue with sustainable practices that she grew up doing. 
“I composted at my high school, and I still make an effort to compost today when possible,” Kaye said to The Hoya. “It’s nice to be able to go to the farmers market and have the opportunity to compost there and try to be as sustainable as possible while in college.” 
Through the D.C. Department of Public Works’ Home Composting Program, District residents are able to earn a maximum rebate of $75 on a home composting system. The program is intended to encourage D.C. residents to take steps at home to compost and reduce their environmental footprint.
While on campus, programs such as GUFM’s compost initiative allow college students to contribute to composting efforts and environmental sustainability in the District.
Common items that can be composted include fruits and vegetables, crushed eggshells, coffee grounds and tea bags. Meat and dairy products cannot be composted at GUFM as they may cause odors and attract insects. 
GREEN volunteers will be present at GUFM to answer questions about composting and ensure that students are composting the correct items, Sadanandan said. 
Composting is environmentally beneficial as it reduces an individual’s carbon footprint, decreases the reliance on chemical fertilizers, improves soil quality and reduces landfill emissions. 
Sadanandan said the ultimate goal is to expand to other campus locations so that students have a place to dispose of their compostable materials any day of the week. 
Donovan said composting is just one step toward creating a more sustainable and environmentally friendly GUFM.
“We’re also aiming to shift our vendors to more sustainable packaging so that we can be a fully compostable market,” Donovan said.

The Georgetown University Farmers’ Market (GUFM) is back with new vendors who are offering fresh produce, acai bowls, Italian sandwiches and more for the Fall 2022 semester.
The GUFM is held in Red Square every Wednesday, and was founded to improve access to fresh food on campus and promote local and sustainable agriculture while supporting a holistic view of nutrition. This semester, GUFM will feature nine permanent seasonal vendors: Bun’d Up, Borek-G, Yoga in a Bowl, Swizzler, Timber, DMV Empanadas, Maracas Ice Pops, Georgetown Bubble and newly added Dreaming Out Loud (DOL), according to Chloe Hwang (MSB ’23), GUFM co-director. These vendors will each have a stand through the last market in November.
DOL is a non-profit organization working to create economic opportunities for marginalized communities in the Washington, D.C. region by supporting their financial stability and food security through workforce development aid and entrepreneurship training.
“We are working to create an integrated pipeline to jobs, economic opportunity, and community wealth-building for our most marginalized communities, utilizing the food system as the catalyst,” the DOL website reads.
Hwang says GUFM added DOL to the vendor list because of its mission and fresh produce offerings. 
“Besides the opportunity for Georgetown to have produce at the market again, we chose to work with DOL as they’re a nonprofit dedicated to ensuring equitable opportunities for marginalized communities in DC,” Hwang wrote to The Hoya. 
GUFM will also feature several new vendors that will rotate on a weekly basis throughout the semester. On Sept. 7, Italian sandwich shop Cucina Al Volo and Hippie Sippin,’ which offers fresh acai bowls, had pop-up stands at the market.
The market will also include Rita’s Crepes, a Bethesda-based creperie that uses organically sourced produce, as a seasonal vendor starting Sept. 21. 
Kiely Johnson (COL ’23) said she appreciates the opportunity to try local food on campus and is looking forward to exploring the variety of options from new vendors.
“I love the Farmer’s Market because as a student living on campus, it’s really nice to be able to grab some closeby, non-campus food once in a while,” Johnson wrote to The Hoya. “Some of my favorite days here at Georgetown have been when I’ve gotten lunch at Timber Pizza or Swizzler and enjoyed it on the lawn with some friends in between classes. I am definitely excited for new vendors each week because I love to try new foods and mix it up.” 
All vendors featured in the GUFM must complete an application to be considered, and they are selected based on several criteria related to food waste and sustainability, according to Hwang.
“We select each one after evaluating if they meet our criteria; we care about where they source products/ingredients from, what they do with their leftovers (food waste is a really important aspect of sustainability), and if they are willing to learn how to accept SNAP benefits/EBT card/flex dollars,” Hwang wrote. “One of our long-term goals is to make the farmers’ market accessible for the community.”
GUFM Co-Director Francesca Donovan (COL ’23) said the GUFM sends the application out to DMV area restaurants and farmers market stands, though some vendors reach out directly to be featured. Donovan said the GUFM typically also sources beyond D.C., but has shifted to focus on more local restaurants in order to provide them with more support, particularly given the economic impact of COVID-19 on businesses.
“We also try to bring in vendors from beyond the Georgetown bubble, but after the pandemic we may be revising this to help support local businesses,” Donovan wrote to The Hoya. “Our criteria aims for vendors with locally sourced produce and ingredients as the farmers market exists as a sustainable way to eat local food.”

CW: This article references/discusses gun violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources. 
An emergency blood loss training program is being implemented in Washington, D.C. public schools (DCPS) for health and physical education teachers.
Stop the Bleed (STB), which is being rolled out in DCPS this year, is an interactive training program provided by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) that aims to teach individuals lifesaving techniques to stop fatal blood loss in the event of emergencies. While the program is currently limited to select teachers, high school students will also eventually participate and receive training. The program has prepared over 2.1 million people worldwide already to treat fatal blood loss in the event of an emergency.
Babak Sarani, chair of the ACS Committee on Trauma for Washington, D.C., believes this training will save many people in the District from preventable death.
“Bleeding is the most common cause of preventable death following most injuries,” Sarani wrote to The Hoya. “Therefore, we see the basic skills that STB teaches as something that all people should know. If you really think about it, the skills taught in STB are easier than CPR – which is now a common part of everyone’s vernacular.”
Teaching this program to students in the District will help residents be prepared to act in blood loss situations. In the District, 128 people die by guns in an average year. Gun violence costs the city around $2 billion, and D.C. has the highest gun homicide rate in the country. 
The hour-long course aims to teach people life-saving techniques to stop excessive blood loss, while also ensuring the person rendering aid is not injured themself.
“The course consists of teaching people how to recognize bleeding and how to stop it through 3 simple steps: applying direct pressure (almost always this is all that is needed), packing a wound if it is deep, and applying a tourniquet if the bleeding is severe and cannot be controlled with pressure/packing,” Sarani wrote.
DCPS students are also required to participate in a mandatory CPR program prior to graduation, but Sarani said STB was added to the CPR requirement to expand the lifesaving skills that high school students already learn.
“The first step was training a sufficient number of DCPS teachers on STB and so the course that we just finished with them about 2 weeks ago was a train-the-trainer model where we certified about 30 or so DCPS teachers as STB teachers,” Sarani wrote. “These are the same people who teach the no-hands CPR. Because the STB curriculum and teaching materials are already set/created, rolling out the actual course to the students will be very easy.”
Nonetheless, the implementation of the program in DCPS has not been without its challenges.
“The biggest challenge was finding time to train the teachers. As you can imagine, the teachers’ time is very limited and getting everyone together at the same time for training was tricky,” Sarani said. “Luckily, DCPS was able to find time during the summer when teachers undergo a lot of in-service training in preparation for the upcoming school year.”
STB also initially struggled to get enough training materials for teachers. Since the program is outside of the DCPS budget cycle, DCPS did not budget to purchase teaching kits. Sarani said that the DC Committee on Trauma voted to use its own funds to put 180 teaching kits into school and ensure all graduating high school students are trained.
“The DC Committee on Trauma (COT) yesterday voted unanimously to use our own funds to put 180 teaching kits into the schools,” Sarani said. “This will be enough to make sure that all of the graduating high school students this year get trained at a ratio of 1 teacher per 4 students.” 
DCPS Manager of K-12 Health Education Erin Lumpkins said she believes that the training is especially critical for children in D.C. to learn, given the city’s high rates of gun violence. According to the D.C. Policy Center, an average of 2,800 kids were nearby for each 2021 homicide in the District.
“Youth Risk Behavior Survey data shows that 10.5% of high school students in DC have been threatened or injured by a weapon,” Lumpkins wrote to The Hoya. “This demonstrates that there is a need to equip students with the skills to respond to bleeding injuries.”
Lumpkins believes that the training will enable students to respond confidently in emergency situations with these newfound skills.
“Individuals that have been trained to respond to emergencies are more likely to respond when the need arises,” Lumpkins wrote. “We have seen this trend for CPR/breathing emergencies and hope to see the same effect with bleeding injuries.”

The Onward for Afghan Women Initiative, which is an initiative of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS), welcomed two Afghan women refugees into Georgetown’s global human development master’s program.
Salma Alokozai (GRD ’24) and Nasim Azizi (GRD ’24), two of the Afghan women who received help from GIWPS, received the scholarships to study at Georgetown beginning this fall. Alokozi previously worked in the Ministry of Finance in Afghanistan as the director general of macroeconomics and fiscal policy, while Azizi worked in the Women’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Herat.
GIWPS, with assistance from governments, companies, organizations, and individuals across the world, helped evacuate over 1,000 Afghan women leaders and their families when Afghanistan’s capital city Kabul was captured by the Taliban after U.S. troops completed their withdrawal from the country in August 2021. The move came just weeks before the scheduled deadline for U.S. troops to withdraw from the country.
Over the past year, GIWPS continued providing support for their resettlement in the United States. In addition, GIWPS has helped provide resettled Afghan women with platforms and connections to advocate for the women and girls who remain in Afghanistan. 
Azizi said her past work in human development and women empowerment motivated her to apply for the global human development program at Georgetown.
“When I received information about the Global Human Development Program (GHDP) scholarship, I decided to apply for it because, in my opinion, when a woman has the opportunity to develop, she can serve the country’s future,” Azizi wrote to The Hoya. “By continuing to study in this field, I want to be a source of service to my fellow human beings.”
Alokozai said studying at Georgetown has been a part of her healing process following the events that occurred in Kabul last year.
“Georgetown and this program, and becoming part of this community helped me a lot to recover from the trauma back at home,” Alokazi told The Hoya. “It gives me purpose at a time where I had to start from scratch.”
After earning her degree in global human development, Alokozai said she aspires to help people and countries find their way towards development.
“What I was witnessing, or realizing as part of my work, made me want to pursue a master’s degree in global human development because I think it plays a crucial role in helping the countries move towards prosperity and economic self-reliance,” Alokozai said. “Also in people’s lives and their welfare.” 
Alokozai said she is focused on advocating access to education for Afghan women while building an identity for Afghan women distant from victimization.
 “The overall goal is that we need to be seen as capable enough enough to be trusted with big decisions in the country and outside the country without being seen as victims of violence and human rights violation, which is a truth, but that shouldn’t become our weakness, that shouldn’t become something that takes away the courage, the confidence from us,” Alokozai said. 
The Taliban implemented a ban on girls’ education once in power. In the past year, around 850,000 Afghan girls have been stopped from attending secondary school. While the Taliban has reallowed education for girls in some areas, these cases are rare and Taliban policy has largely provided obstacles to the pursuit of education for Afghan girls.
According to GIWPS Program Director Allie Smith, Director of Communications and External Affairs Sarah Rutherford and Afghanistan Policy Associate Lina Tori Jan, members of the GIWPS team, it was important to ensure that the Onward for Afghan Women Initiative continued to support Afghan women leaders even after the withdrawal.
“We wanted to ensure that the work didn’t end at evacuation and that these leaders had opportunities to continue their leadership and advocacy, thus Onward for Afghan Women was born,” the GIWPS team wrote to The Hoya. “Our mission is aimed at elevating and equipping Afghan women leaders with opportunities to continue their advocacy on behalf of Afghan women and girls.”
Azizi was also a part of the Women Deliver Young Leaders Class of 2018, which connects young advocates with platforms and resources to amplify their influence, and a 2019 United States Institute of Peace Generation Change Fellow, a program that partners with young leaders globally to strengthen the transformation of their local communities. 
Azizi said international organizations like GIWPS are important in pressuring governments into change. 
“Afghan girls and women in the current situation need justice for education and work,” Azizi wrote. “Advocates need the support of international organizations such as GIWPS to influence the current government and pressure them on girls’ education.”
Alokozai said she hopes to serve as an example of the power Afghan women can have in the transformation of their communities if given the proper resources and support.
“Just by trying my best to be my best version is one of the goals. I hope to represent Afghan women in the best possible way and tell people that we can do a lot more, if we are given the opportunity,” Alokozai said.

Writing is about finding voice in the nuances of the human experience, Tanzanian author and Nobel Laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah said at an event Sept. 14. 
The event, titled “A Conversation with Nobel Laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah,” was hosted Sept. 14 in Gaston Hall and led by Georgetown University professor of English and Interim Director of the Lannan Center of Poetics and Social Practice Aminatta Forna. The event was hosted by the Lannan Center and co-sponsored by the African Studies Program. At the event, Forna engaged in conversation with Gurnah about migration, colonialism, the writing craft and Gurnah’s most recent book, entitled “Afterlives.”
Gurnah grew up on the island of Zanzibar in Tanzania but was forced to leave the country due to oppression and persecution against Arab citizens in the 1960s. Gurnah’s work explores the trauma of displacement, the tension between the colonized and colonizers and the reality of a culturally diversified East Africa. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2021.
At 18 years old, Gurnah left Zanzibar as a refugee and migrated to the United Kingdom to seek asylum as a student at Christ Church College. Gurnah’s works include characters who are often forced to leave their native homes and endure the instability of migration, speaking to his lived experiences.
According to Gurnah, migration is often not only about finding a new home, but rather also consists of grappling with what was left behind.
“It isn’t just about making out in this new place. It isn’t just about getting your kids to go to school and behave well and not wreak havoc, or finding a job or integrating — whatever the word is,” Gurnah said at the event. “It is also about living with what has been left behind.”
Gurnah said the trauma migrants face, whether they are fleeing war, persecution or another crisis, is often in addition to the difficulties of leaving behind community members. 
“People who leave, leave people behind,” Gurnah said. “Not everybody leaves, so they leave knowing others are left behind. So when they arrive at a place of safety, they know others are not safe. I think this in itself must be a very traumatic experience, in addition to the trauma of losing your home.” 
Gurnah’s newest novel, “Afterlives” focuses on the story of Ilyas, who was stolen from his parents by German colonial troops on the coast of east Africa as a young boy. Ilyas returns to home years later to find his parents gone and his sister abandoned into de facto slavery. The book focuses on young people in this society as they live, work and fall in love in an interconnected way with the threat of war looming.
Gurnah’s novels use a variety of narrative voices, from soft to humorous to elegiac. Gurnah said it is important to identify this voice in the writing process.
“I don’t begin to write until I can hear the voice, which is not necessarily a narrator’s voice until I can hear the voice in which the tone, shall we say, the narrative is going to operate in,” Gurnah said. “The voice allowed me to imagine much bigger scenes than simply the story, the various subtleties of reflection and narration.” 
Gurnah also highlighted the advantage of using comedy and absurdity in his 1988 novel “Pilgrim’s Way,” which follows Daud, an immigrant to England from Tanzania who navigates life in an unfamiliar place and faces racist abuse from his new countrymen. 
According to Gurnah, comedy and absurdity can be used as literary tools to expose injustices migrants face in new places. 
“His attempt at seeing the absurdity or the banalities of the lives of the people he thinks despises him is a way of contesting or responding or fighting back,” Gurnah said. “Through comedy, he makes fun of the people who make fun of him. He places them in situations where they might look ridiculous rather than powerful.”
Though one element of colonialism’s legacy is the imposition of European languages on African nations and the erasure of indigenous languages, Gurnah said he is optimistic about the future of literature in the post-colonial world.
“I’ll be very happy to see all the various languages of the formerly colonized world producing their own texts and their own literature which can be celebrated by their own nations and so on,” Gurnah said. “We’ll wait and see.”

William Scully says 
September 16, 2022 at 2:07 pm
The article on Tanzanian Nobel Laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah was a stark reminder of the often perilous journey that millions of migrants have made over the centuries in search of a better life.
Mr. Gurnah’s personal experience and success should also serve as an inspiration not just to future migrants but also to those who are native born to a country, that where one comes from does not have to determine where one ends up or how much you can accomplish.

Former Georgetown University professor and Jesuit historian Fr. John O’Malley, S.J, died Sept. 11 at the age of 95.
A beloved teacher for 67 years, O’Malley was a leader in the Jesuit community and was considered the dean of Catholic historians. A renowned expert on early modern European history and the Roman Catholic Church’s Second Vatican Council, he joined the Georgetown community in 2006 as a professor in the department of theology and religious studies, and taught his last class in Spring 2020. O’Malley died following a brief illness at the Colombiere Jesuit Community in Baltimore, Md.
Born on June 11, 1927, in Tiltonsville, Ohio, O’Malley began his career in the Catholic Church when he entered the Jesuit order in 1946. He studied Latin for a semester at John Carroll University and then spent three years studying philosophy at West Baden College before going on to earn a Ph.D. in history at Harvard University in 1966. 
O’Malley contributed to 150 academic essays and authored 29 books on the Catholic Church and the Society of Jesus including “The First Jesuits” (1993), which won two best-book prizes and is now published in 12 languages, according to an email sent from Georgetown Jesuit Superior Rev. Ron Anton, S.J., to the Georgetown community Sep. 11 announcing O’Malley’s passing.
“Fr. O’Malley was a beloved member of the Georgetown community, a devoted pastor and a trusted mentor, advisor and friend to students, colleagues and Jesuits around the world,” Anton wrote.
Jonathan Marrow (COL ’18), who took O’Malley’s course “Two Councils: Trent and Vatican II” in 2017, said he was a life-changing professor whose intellectual ability encouraged his students to expand their curiosity about history.
“What he did in the classroom — intellectually and personally — was unforgettable,” Marrow wrote to The Hoya. “He was able to take events that occurred five centuries ago and use them to prompt vibrant discussions about questions of faith, history, institutional change, and cultural practice.”
Rev. David Collins, S.J., director of Georgetown’s Catholic studies program and a close friend of O’Malley’s, said O’Malley was a kind person who was highly regarded as a scholar and mentor within the Jesuit community.
“He’s internationally the single most influential church historian of his generation, bar none, so that’s one side of him,” Collins told The Hoya. “And the other side is he was unrelentingly cheerful and encouraging, and that was part of why he was just fun to be around and in general enjoyable to be around.”
O’Malley served as an educator and historian throughout his life. O’Malley did not join the Society of Jesus to become a priest, but rather to continue the order’s work in education. 
Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) said O’Malley’s life embodied the key values of the Society of Jesus.
“John — in his life and in his scholarship — captured the fullness of the Ignatian tradition that has been passed down to us from St. Ignatius and the first Jesuits,” DeGioia wrote to The Hoya. “His prolific writings contributed important insights about Jesuit and Church history, and because of his work, we have a deeper capacity to engage in the richness of the Ignatian tradition.”
Collins said O’Malley’s personality and character seeped into the mentorship he provided for students and others, including Collins himself.
“John was one of these people that people flocked to him,” Collins said. “He was happy to be consulted and had very good advice for their own scholarly work, and that sort of inexhaustible cheerfulness.”
Marrow, who is now a middle and high school history teacher, said O’Malley’s guidance played an important role in his decision to pursue a career in education.
“Father O’Malley helped me — a Jew — fall in love with Georgetown and the Jesuit tradition,” Marrow wrote. “He helped me fall in love with teaching. He helped me explore the nature of faith and how it influences historical and contemporary actors.”
O’Malley published five books after arriving at Georgetown. In 2016, he received the Centennial Medal, the highest honor from Harvard University’s Graduate School of Arts and Science, for his work as a historian. 
Despite not knowing him personally before arriving at Georgetown, Director of Campus Ministry Rev. Gregory Schenden, S.J., said O’Malley made him feel welcomed when he arrived in 2014. 
“While I was nervous about living in community with such a scholar & presence, John immediately disarmed any such notions,” Schenden wrote to The Hoya. “His warmth & humor aided me in feeling at home & assisted in my sense of belonging at Georgetown.”
Even in casual conversations with O’Malley, his scholarliness and curiosity was exemplified, Schenden said. 
“From Jesuit history to baroque art to cinema, John’s intellectual capacity was astounding. However, I maintain what was most unique about John was his rare combination of intellectual prowess & incredible kindness to all — his colleagues, his students, his Jesuit brothers,” Schenden wrote.
O’Malley maintained his curiosity and drive to educate himself through his entire life until his death, Schenden said.
“John never lost the wonder & awe of a young student,” Schenden wrote. “He lived his life as a perpetual student, which is what made him such an engaging, remarkable academic & teacher.”
O’Malley’s funeral will be held Sept. 17 at Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown, followed by a procession to the Jesuit Cemetery on campus for his burial. A reception will be held at Wolfington Hall to follow. 
DeGioia expressed that O’Malley was a valuable mentor and advisor to students whose loss impacts both members of the Georgetown community and Jesuits worldwide.
“It was an honor for us to have his presence on our campus for 16 years and to have his faith and his scholarship as a resource in our community,” DeGioia wrote. “As a friend and colleague, I will miss him greatly.”
