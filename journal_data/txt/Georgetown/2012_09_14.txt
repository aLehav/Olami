Three experts on the violence in Colombia discussed their work at a panel on Wednesday.
The event, called “Immortal Joy and Furrows of Pain: Terror and Testimony in Colombia,” was organized by the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice and featured photographer Stephen Ferry and writers Sibylla Brodzinsky and Max Schoening.
Photographer Harry Mattison served as moderator for the discussion and showed photos from his experiences documenting the conflict in El Salvador during the 1970s and 1980s.
One image featured rows of massacred victims with a crowd looking on and a priest photographing the bodies.
“Why was the priest taking pictures?” Mattison said. “Because no one would believe.”
The event emphasized this sense of disbelief, which Ferry illustrated by presenting images from his book “Violentology” — named after a Latin American field of study that examines conflict, calledviolentología.
“I realized it’s far more severe, far more complex, than I had imagined,” Ferry said about the Colombian violence.
He traced the history of violence in the South American country to La Violencia, a civil war between the country’s liberal and conservative parties that gripped the country during the 1940s and 1950s. The end of the war, however, did not bring a stop to the violence. Since then, government forces, a leftist insurgency and right-wing paramilitaries have jockeyed for control of this volatile region.
“The reaction to [the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] was the paramilitary movement, which was a cure worse than the disease,” Ferry said.
He described how the paramilitaries joined with drug traffickers to create an unholy alliance against the leftist guerrillas, which caused violence in Colombia to increase.
Brodzinsky and Schoening also presented excerpts from a collection of oral histories that they edited “Throwing Stones at the Moon.”
The excerpts included the stories of survivors of the conflict.
“A lot of them continue to live in dire situations,” Schoening said of his interviewees for the book. “There’s a limit to the regeneration that could happen through the process of storytelling.”
While the violence has subsided, Brodzinsky noted that the country still faces a long path to recovery.
“There are certainly fewer massacres, kidnappings [and] killings than 10 years ago, but it’s by no means over,” she said. “The situation in Colombia will remain violent for many years.”
Students who attended the panel had strong emotional reactions.
“I felt like I could really connect with the images,” Katherine Everitt (COL ’13) said. “Any word I could use is too shallow.”

Georgetown’s first-ever Social Norms Campaign, which aims to promote responsible drinking on campus, will begin this Monday.
Health Education Services is launching the campaign as part of its annual BeWell Week, which now lasts 14 days.
Similar to last year’s event, which was held the week of Sept. 26, BeWell Week aims to promote a happier and more health-conscious environment at Georgetown.  The Hoya Health Hut, where Health Services staff and student volunteers will offer advice and provide healthy food, will rotate locations between O’Donovan Hall, Copley Lawn, Red Square, Leavey Center and Village C.  Additionally, Yates Field House will offer free fitness classes to encourage the community to stay active.
“We’re trying to encourage laughing, relaxing, exercising and other components of a healthy lifestyle,” said Catherine Merwin (NHS ’15), a BeWell Week student organizer.
But the primary focus of the program is the Social Norms Campaign, which will highlight the dangers of binge drinking and alcohol abuse.  Planning for this campaign began nine years ago and will culminate this year on Sept. 26 in a day devoted to alcohol education.
According to Social Norms Coordinator and Health Promotion Counselor Tessa Telly, the campaign aims to encourage responsible drinking rather than to lecture students about the consequences of alcohol consumption.
“The theme this year is ‘work hard, play hard.’ We hear this slogan all the time, so we thought it was a better way to connect with students, as it is definitely relevant to college students,” Telly said. “We hope students will make smarter choices.”
BeWell Week Student Coordinator Jessica Kohan (NHS ’14) emphasized that the campaign aims to address the pressure that some students may feel to drink heavily.
“Being a college student, I know that one of the assumptions that comes along with college life is binge drinking. We understand that Georgetown students are very ambitious and hard working, and to contrast that constant work, students often feel they need to ‘play’ just as hard as they work,” Kohan said. “We want this campaign to show students that having fun and partying does not have to mean getting black-out drunk.”

The Office of Residence Life approved plans to institute a Jewish Living Learning Community on Wednesday.
Dubbed Bayit — “home” in Hebrew — the program is the10th Living Learning Community at Georgetown and will become an option on housing applications for next fall. The LLC’s future location is still unknown.
According to Mitchel Hochberg (SFS ’15), who spearheaded the project, the LLC aims to provide a hub for Jewish life on campus.
The idea emerged after Hochberg had a casual conversation with a friend from the Muslim Interest LLC.
“[He] told me, ‘Why don’t you guys start one of these?’” Hochberg said. “We joked around a bit, but I started to really consider it after the conversation.”
Hochberg observed that despite the prevalence of student groups and initiatives dedicated to Jewish interests — the Jewish Student Association, the Georgetown Israel Alliance, the Jewish Chaplaincy and the Program for Jewish Civilization — there is no defined home for Jewish students on campus.
“It’s taking a community that exists [and] really centralizing it, [creating] a hub for its activities and a residential dimension,” Hochberg said.
Jewish Student Association Co-President Isaac Mishlove (SFS ’15) said that the LLC will facilitate the exchange of information between Jewish student groups.
“There is a lot of redundancy that happens when you look at a wall and you have a PJC poster, a JSA poster, a chaplaincy poster. … When anyone looks at it, all of them blend together,” Mishlove said. “I think it will be a good space for people that are involved in different groups to have a lot more transparency on what’s going on in different aspects of Jewish-related life on campus.”
Hochberg distinguished Bayit from other LLCs by pointing out that it will meet the needs of an already well-developed group.
“It is unique among the other Living Learning Communities because it’s not creating a community in the same way that some of the other ones are,” Hochberg said. “It serves a function for an existing community that was not served before.”
However, Mishlove expressed concern that the LLC, which can accommodate only a limited number of students, will potentially create an exclusive group.
“Initially, I thought it was going to be a divider for Jewish students on campus. I still [have] that hesitation,” Mishlove said. “Because we come from so many places, [have] so many ways of practicing [and] so many mixes of students identify as Jewish in different ways … unity is a thing we need to work on.”
As with other LLCs, interested students can apply to live in the space, but Hochberg said that those who follow the kashrut, a set of strict Jewish dietary laws, will be given priority.
“It will be a lot easier for prospective students who are very observant [of] Jewish dietary laws to come to Georgetown if they [have] an environment like this,” Hochberg said.
Mishlove said he anticipates that Bayit will attract students who already are involved in Jewish leadership positions on campus.
“The names that would be going into this lottery would be pretty predictable already,” Mishlove said.
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner, the faculty adviser for Bayit, said the LLC will provide more opportunities for Georgetown’s Jewish students.
“For folks that want a slightly more intensive cultural experience and holistic experience of living a Jewish life, this will be a great opportunity,” Gartner said.

The installation of credit card meters with GPS tracking devices in all District taxis, a centerpiece of Mayor Vincent Gray’s 2010 election campaign, has been postponed indefinitely following a contract dispute levied by bidders that failed to win the Taxicab Smart Meter System contract.
The $35 million contract, which was granted exclusively toVeriFone Systems, Inc. in July, was suspended after Monica Parchment, a judge on D.C.’s Contract Appeals Board, ruled that protests by a pair of losing bidders must be resolved before  installation of the “smart meters” in all of the District’s 6,500 taxis can be continued. Only a few dozen meters were installed before the protesting bidders, Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC of New York, and RideCharge, Inc. of Alexandria, Va., forced installation to grind to a halt.
This decision came after Gray celebrated the installation of the first meter in August. The modernization of D.C. cabs was one of the mayor’s most highly publicized goals throughout his campaign, according toDoxie McCoy, the mayor’s senior communications manager.
“When [Gray] came into office in January 2011, this was one of his main priorities. It continues to be a major focus despite the recent setbacks, and we are confident that things will be settled as soon as possible,” McCoy said.
However, fulfilling the initial goal of outfitting all city cabs with the new meters in time for the presidential inauguration in January will prove difficult.
“We’re disappointed with the conflict, though we are very hopeful that it can be resolved quickly. That said, if the judge orders that the contract needs to be resolicited, that goal will no longer be reachable,” said Neville Waters (MSB ’91), public affairs specialist for the D.C. Taxi Commission. “The commission really was hoping for all of the cabs to be ready with this new technology by the time of the inauguration, particularly because of the added tourism we will see.”
Both the DCTC, including its commissioner, Ron Linton, and the mayor’s office are hopeful the deadline can still be met.
“These meters will be a disincentive for crime, as drivers will not have to carry as much cash and will therefore be lesser targets for robbery and assault,” McCoy said.
The GPS-equipped meters will also include a safety button that drivers can push to notify medical or police personnel of an emergency.
“We are really counting on [having] this contract pull through because we have a distinct vision to incorporate technology into public vehicles for hire, whether for hailing, booking or paying for cabs,” Waters said.

For every disabled student who has struggled to navigate campus, Georgetown students are in the initial stages of establishing one of the country’s first Disability Cultural Centers.
“As a whole we live on one of the most inaccessible campuses ever,” said Lydia Brown (COL ’15), an autistic student who is spearheading the project.
About 20 members of the university community attended an event on Wednesday night that Brown organized, at which they began the process of assembling a planning committee that will write a proposal and lobby support for the center.
“This is in the very beginning stages,” Brown said, adding that the Center will require funding, office space and a full-time faculty director and will likely take a few years to get off the ground. “It will be the foundational branch of the university for addressing disability and it will directly collaborate with student organizations and centers specific to disability and diversity in general,” she said.
The proposed center will serve as an administrative office similar to the LGBTQ Resource Center. The center will promote equal access, provide a safe space for conversation and encourage activism.  Additionally, the center will offer social activities, a mentorship program and community service projects.
“It’s very different from a disability support services office. Their primary goal is to facilitate and provide support services. … The idea behind establishing a Disability Cultural Center is to not just talk about disability in the medical sense,” Brown said.
While groups like DiversAbility, Best Buddies and Active Minds address the needs of disabled students on campus, Georgetown’s disabled community lacks a unified center, Brown said.
Renleigh Bartlett (COL ’15), who struggled with getting around campus on crutches because of a sprained ankle, rated Georgetown a six out of ten on its accessibility.
“Getting around campus [when I was on crutches] was ridiculous,” Bartlett said. “Not every building has ramps or pressure-sensitive doors.”
Bartlett added that students on campus do not always respect their disabled peers.
“A lot of ableist language goes on,” she said. “There’s a lot of dismissal on campus. I think there needs to be less hesitation on open discourse.”
Ally Collin Segura (COL ’15) echoed Bartlett’s statement.
“There’s a lot of ignorance surrounding the neurodiversity community, and I think Georgetown could do more to help,” he said. “This is a social justice issue.”

Although Craig Cassey (COL ’15) and Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14) are running unopposed for seats on Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, both candidates have launched efforts to increase their vote count in November’s election.
Cassey and Prindiville are aiming to improve on voter turnout from the last election cycle, when current ANC Commissioner Jake Sticka (COL ’13) was able to win his seat with nine votes in an uncontested election. According to ANC 2E Chair Ron Lewis, more than those nine people attempted to vote inSticka’s district, SMD 2E04, but several students filled out their ballots incorrectly, using Georgetown’s main campus address as their home address rather than their individual dorm address. Still, this year’s candidates are working to encourage more students to vote in D.C.
Sticka feels that there will be better voter turnout this year due to student dissatisfaction with the outcome of the 2010 Campus Plan negotiations, despite the fact that the presidential election might compel students to vote in their home districts.
“I think there have been a lot of events in the past two years that have shown people how important it is to get involved by registering,” he said. “I think you’re still going to see a lot more people vote here, and I think in 2014 that will go up even higher because people won’t be voting at home.”
Both Cassey and Prindiville are also hopeful that recent events relating to the campus plan will increase turnout, even though their elections are uncontested.
“I’m hoping to receive as many as I can possibly get,” Cassey said. “When Jake Sticka ran, he was also uncontested, but there’s an importance in having a large student turnout. It represents a unified student body that wants to engage in local politics and hold their elected officials accountable.”
Cassey added that a strong voter turnout will send a clear message to the representative of SMD 03, a district split almost evenly between students and local residents. The district is likely to elect a non-student in this election, but a high vote count for Cassey and Prindiville would show the SMD 03 representative that he could be defeated in the next election if he fails to represent student interests during his term.
Lewis, however, questioned the significance of increasing the number of students registered to vote in D.C.
“I don’t think it matters,” he said. “In an uncontested race, you don’t expect a high vote count, no matter who is registered where.”
The issue of where students should register to vote this year has prompted controversy. While some say that students should vote at home, where their votes may count for more, Prindiville and Cassey feel that students should use their vote to influence local elections.
“I hope students will register in the District,” Prindiville said. “Students in the District have remarkable power in a local election. My hope is to encourage students to exercise this power and exercise their vote.”
In the months leading up to the election, both Cassey and Prindiville are focused on educating students and helping them register. Their efforts include one-on-one conversations and social media campaigns.
Prindiville has devoted a section of his campaign to student outreach and education.
“We’re going to be doing a lot of door-to-door knocking, tabling in Red Square and reaching out to specific students, helping them through the registration and voting process … [and] encouraging them to vote in their local election,” he said. “I think students … need to add their voice to the conversation.”
Prindiville added that TurboVote, a service that allows constituents to register to vote online, should increase student participation this year.
“Registering [to vote] in D.C. is already very simple, but I think TurboVote is great because it targets students and makes [registration] very easy,” Prindiville said.

Despite former Director of Georgetown University Outdoor Education Russ Watts’ resignation, the program continues to expand its presence on campus.
Watts resigned after accepting a job at the Dog Tag Bakery, a local nonprofit organization that serves veterans and their families by providing baked goods. Former Assistant Director Sam Bonfield assumed responsibility as Outdoor Education’s interim director in April.
Student Director Alex Moran (SFS ’13), who temporarily filled Watts’ position in the spring, described Watts as a very enthusiastic and popular leader but said that the travel-intensive nature of the position contributed to Watts’ decision.
“Russ just recently got married, and he has a five-month-old baby. Outdoor Education required him to travel a lot, so it wasn’t the most convenient,” Moran said.
The recent change in leadership, however, provides opportunities for a more influential student management team.
“Outdoor Education at Georgetown is pretty much a student-run organization now. In my opinion, new leadership is always an opportunity for positive change and growth,” Moran said. “We’ve hired a new team of coordinators and base camp managers and, as the new director, Sam has a very clear idea of what we should focus on this year and how we want to grow.”
According to Moran, Outdoor Education plans to create more leadership positions to encourage student involvement. The department is also looking to expand its class offerings in response to a surge in student interest at this year’s Student Activities Fair. The Georgetown Outdoor Activities Training program will hold a wilderness first-aid course in the spring, while the Georgetown Rock Instructor Program will be collaborating with GOAT to provide more outdoor activities and training options and to plan more trips for students on campus.
“I know Outdoor Education is in great hands,” Watts said. “I loved working at Outdoor Education and am excited to see how Georgetown and the new managers and future directors can take what we all have built over the last decade to the next level of excellence.”

Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, released a statement to the media Saturday criticizing Georgetown’s representation of the Hindu faith in its theology courses.
Zed said that a spring 2012 Georgetown course on Hinduism, “Hinduism Today,” made use of dacoitfilm, a genre that depicts bandits in rural India. He argued that the course should instead focus on the more religious aspects of Hindu culture.
“GU should treat the … third largest religion of the world more respectfully and depict it more honestly,” he said in the statement.
The film in question, “Bandit Queen,” tells the nonfictional story of a child bride who escapes from her much older husband to live as a criminal but eventually becomes a member of the Indian parliament.
Ariel Glucklich, the theology professor who taught the course last spring, defended his decision to show the film in class.
“It’s not dacoit. It’s not an exploitative commercial movie,” he said. “I would wager any amount of money [Zed] never saw the movie.”
Zed’s statement listed many alternative media sources and texts that he thought would be more appropriate to a Hinduism course. In response, Glucklich explained that “Hinduism Today” was intended to focus on modern representations of Hinduism as well as current cultural practices. He said that in his other courses, which focus on the history of traditional Hinduism, he teaches many of Zed’s suggested texts.
“This critique came from someone trying to defend a point of view, not thinking about students’ education,” Glucklich said. “He’s thinking of defending a privileged point of view, and that’s not my job at Georgetown.”
Theology courses that explore Hinduism attract Hindu and non-Hindu students alike, and some agreed with Zed’s criticisms.
“I was worried for the people who didn’t have a background in Hinduism,” Hindu Students Association President Anwesha Banjeree (COL ’13) said. “I remember sitting in class, wondering what everyone else was thinking about us.”
Banjeree, who took Gluckich’s class “Hindu Religious Tradition,” said she thought she interpreted the lectures differently from her non-Hindu classmates.
“To me it was like a history class, but to other people it was a Hinduism class,” she said. “I liked it, but it still concerned me to some extent.”
Smiti Mohan (MSB ’15), who serves as HSA’s treasurer, took the course in question, Glucklich’s“Hinduism Today,” in the spring of 2012.
“I would speak up if [the professor] asked if any practicing Hindus had anything to say,” she said.
Some of Georgetown’s introductory theology classes also touch on Hinduism.
HSA Vice President Neha Jejurikar (NHS ’13), who is currently enrolled in “The Church in the 21stCentury,” taught by Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (CAS ’88), said she has enjoyed her theology courses.
“Although our focus is on Christianity today, [O’Brien] is very proactive about including the Hindu faith in discussion in the classroom,” Jejurikar wrote in an email. “I am thankful that he makes a conscious effort to relate the issues we talk about in class to every student’s faith tradition.”
But Banjeree, Mohan and Glucklich agreed that they want to see more resources for Hindu students at Georgetown.
“Hinduism is so vast and diverse, so having classes that focus on smaller aspects of the religion could be cool,” Mohan said. “Maybe a class about holidays or a class exploring different incarnations of the gods. The [current] classes are so broad and try to cover so much.”
Glucklich also expressed interest in reintroducing classes that focus on teaching the Hindi language.
“We had a Hindi teacher for two years, but she’s gone,” he said. “Sanskrit is taught by a professor in the linguistics department, so the approach is not to read scripture but from a linguistic perspective.”
Banjeree expressed gratitude to Georgetown’s Campus Ministry staff for their support of HSA.
“They have been very supportive [of] HSA and HSA’s growth over the past few years,” Banjeree said. “I think they’re very open minded to our future and the Hindu community on campus. We would not be half of what we are without their support.”

Almost seven months after the release of the Student Life Report, a 10-year blueprint for improving the quality of the on-campus experience, its primary recommendations are still in the process of being addressed.
The main requests brought up in the report included improving administrative accessibility, increasing the availability of student space, expanding Georgetown’s arts programs, increasing undergraduate research opportunities and hiring a professional director of club sports, among others.
According to Director of Student Life Report Implementation Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), the Georgetown University Student Association wants to carefully prioritize recommendations and ensure that student autonomy is emphasized in the process of enacting the goals listed in the report.
“We’re not saying these are the 60 recommendations and we’re trying to check them off,” he said. “A lot of the recommendations are in progress.”
Appelbaum said the Hoya Roundtables and the crowd-sourcing website IdeaScale will be utilized to allow students to input their suggestions for campus improvement.
According to President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13), GUSA has struggled to implement several of the recommendations related to improving communication between students and administrators.
“Reducing bureaucracy is always a challenge at this university,” she said.
Thus far, GUSA is working to institute office hours for University President John J. DeGioia and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson.
“We all love him, but we don’t see him, so it would be great to see him at those bigger events,” Gustafson said of DeGioia.
According to Chief of Staff Jake Sticka (COL ’13), GUSA has successfully made strides toward addressing space recommendations included in the report.
The construction of Regents Hall has increased the number of study areas on campus, but GUSAhopes to continue to add to study space on campus based on recommendations made in the report.
Additionally, a centralized space-booking system, overseen by Director of Student Programs ErikaCohen-Derr and Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis, has been created to consolidate information about space availability across campus.
GUSA is also working with the performing arts board to improve arts at the university. Students and faculty alike have expressed disappointment with the current programs.
Department of Performing Arts Chair Maya Roth said that the university recognizes its oversight of the department.
“The last time Georgetown went through [the Middle States accreditation process], there was serious concern about how you can call yourself a rigorous liberal arts institution for not taking the arts seriously,” Roth said.
However, Roth said that due to an increased interest in the arts, the arrival of new students with fresh talent and the university’s recognition of the need to dedicate more resources to this program, she is hopeful that the department will expand.
GUSA also aims to improve student intellectual life by instituting an undergraduate research symposium that will be held in the spring.
“It’s a great way to centralize intellectual life,” Sticka said. “Now we see Georgetown as a school rewarding research.”
Though the university has not yet hired a professional director to manage Georgetown’s club sports program, these teams now have a cabinet member to represent their interests in GUSA.
Overall, Sticka was optimistic about the progress of the report’s implementation.
“It’ll be exciting, going forward,” he said.

The Department of Health reported six critical and two noncritical violations of the D.C. Health Code in an inspection of O’Donovan Hall conducted Sept. 4.
According to the department’s report, a food establishment with six or more critical violations would typically be closed immediately, but Georgetown’s dining hall was allowed to remain operative because it corrected two of the violations — improper separation and protection of different foods and the absence of an advisory notice warning diners about raw or undercooked foods — during the course of the inspection.
The other four critical violations identified during the Sept. 4 inspection were unclean food surfaces, improper temperatures for holding cold food, worn-out cutting boards and a broken walk-in cooler. The two noncritical violations were that some employees did not wear hair restraints and that the facility lacked chemical strips for testing sanitizing solutions.
The dining hall was last inspected in September 2011, when the DOH reported only one noncritical violation of the health code.
Leo’s is designated as a level three institution— an evaluation made independently of a food establishment’s inspection results — by the DOH, indicating that diners are at moderate risk of contracting food-borne illnesses. According to the District of Columbia Register, a level three rating indicates extensive handling of raw ingredients and preparation or processing of potentially hazardous foods.
In the aftermath of eight health code violations, Leo’s also continues to face backlash from students and workers about dining changes that were implemented at the beginning of the semester. Among those alterations were the removal of the popular make-your-own-pizza station and the scaling back of the pasta station.
“A lot of the things that students liked best about Leo’s are gone,” Craig Cassey (COL ’15) said. “I never leave Leo’s satiated any more.”
Cassey is among a group of several students, including members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, that has been informally petitioning Dining Services and the administration to bring back some of the old favorites.
“Essentially, we’ve seen a lot of food changes happening at Leo’s that have impacted students and the quality of food … and we’ve seen a lot of student response to that as well as a lot of worker response to that,” GSC member Erin Riordan (COL ’15) said.
The criticism prompted the university to launch a revamped outreach campaign titled “We Hear You 2.0.” The new effort includes the reintroduction of make-your-own pizza on weekends, an expansion of the pasta station and the creation of daily wok specials and a taco station.
But according to GSC member Julia Hubbell (COL ’15), these changes aren’t enough.
“[The GSC] thinks that this is a very important [issue] that we want to bring into conversation on the campus about the quality of food that our students are receiving and for there to be a discussion about how to make it better,” Hubbell said.
Cassey believes that news of the dining hall’s Sept. 4 health code violations will provide greater impetus for the campaign.
“It’s a good thing to use to get people motivated to change Leo’s,” he said.

In contrast to the hostility and tension that characterized the relationship between Georgetown and its neighbors during the 2010 Campus Plan negotiations, both parties are starting to express optimism that a new era of cooperation has begun.
According to Lauralyn Lee, who is set to become the university’s associate vice president for community engagement and strategic initiatives in early October, the university and the surrounding community have identified a series of common objectives that lend themselves to collaboration rather than combat.
Lee said that the Georgetown Community Partnership — an organization of university and neighborhood representatives that aims to provide a forum for the joint resolution of town-gown issues — will help enable this shift in attitude.
“One of the things we’ve agreed on going into the partnership is a common set of goals,” Lee said at a Wednesday meeting with campus press. “We’ve identified some strategic priorities that we share, and … we’re asking everybody who’s engaged in the partnership to work toward the kind of community in which we want to live.”
Ron Lewis, chair of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E and neighborhood appointee to the GCP’ssteering committee, also attended the meeting.
“[The GCP] is revolutionary for everybody,” he said.
The partnership will operate on a committee structure, with working groups designated to deal with specific issues related to Georgetown’s neighborhood relations. The groups will be overseen by a steering committee that includes Lewis, Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and a university appointee.
Tuesday’s announcement that Gustafson would be part of the GCP leadership came after months ofGUSA’s lobbying to get a student representative named to the steering committee.
“Vail [Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), vice president of GUSA,] and I over the summer have literally been saying in every meeting with every administrator, no matter who they are or if they’re related to theGCP, that having a student representative on the GCP is of the utmost importance and a symbolic step toward establishing the students as a legitimate party in our immediate and neighboring community,” Gustafson said.
Lee said that while students were excluded from the closed-door negotiations that led to the agreement between Georgetown and the community on the campus plan, there is now an opportunity for greater student involvement.
“We recognized that the nature of the particular negotiation process wasn’t conducive to having students at the table but that we would ultimately get to the partnership where we really think the rubber is going to hit the road in terms of the work of the real value of building our community and that will have student engagement,” she said.
Gustafson is hopeful that her spot on the GCP will allow her to channel student opinion in a meaningful and results-oriented way. She said that she and her team will gather feedback through office-hour conversations with students, special working groups and subcommittees of the GCP in which students will be more widely represented.
“It will be important that students who care about housing and transportation get involved as soon as [the GCP] starts,” she said.
Lee identified GUSA’s Feb. 27 Student Life Report and the Hoya Roundtables that have taken place on campus throughout the year as other ways of gathering student feedback.
Both Lee and Lewis stressed developing quality on-campus student life as a top priority of the GCP’ssteering committee.
“In terms of campus student life [and] the idea of a true living and learning community on campus … there’s room for improvement,” Lewis said. “We need places where it can be made a lot more congenial for students and a lot more opportunities for students to socialize on campus and have a welcoming, safe and physically adequate building space that just doesn’t exist now.”
Gustafson agreed that on-campus student spaces should be a main focus, adding that she would also emphasize the need for a wider array of transportation options through her position on the GCP.
Lewis said that he and other community partners will ensure that the neighborhood voice is also effectively represented on the GCP. In addition to Lewis, representatives of the Burleith Citizens Association, the Citizens Association of Georgetown, ANC 3D and the Foxhall Community Citizens Association will serve on various GCP committees.
While the details of the structure of the GCP have yet to be ironed out, Lewis and Lee said that it will function on the basis of consensus.
“There’s going to be lots of listening, lots of discussing [and] lots of conversation,” Lee said. “We’re going to hear different opinions and … work together in the partnership to get to a consensus. Sometimes … people are not happy about the decision that is also ultimately the recommendation … but that’s the design. The plan is to let those perspectives be fleshed out.”
Lee also acknowledged that while the formation of the GCP foreshadows a norm of cooperation, the group will continue to face challenges as it begins to tackle concrete issues.
“One of the challenges is to begin to think and act like partners,” Lee said. “We are transitioning from what was sort of a hostile environment. … Given the history … there’s a natural first few months of the partnership that will be challenging.”

Georgetown University and the McDonough School of Business each moved up in the U.S. News and World Report’s 2013 college rankings, which were announced Tuesday.
Georgetown rose one spot to No. 21 in the national university category, tying with the University of California at Berkeley. This category encompasses schools that conduct large-scale research and offer a full range of undergraduate majors as well as master’s and Ph.D. programs.
Despite Georgetown’s improved placement, Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon said that the university does not place much value on rankings.
“It is no big deal and really of no influence on admissions,” Deacon wrote in an email. “Everyone tends to overrate the importance of these ratings.”
According to the publication’s website, U.S. News bases its rankings on a metric that considers peer evaluations, high school counselor ratings, freshman retention rate, six-year graduation rate, class sizes, faculty pay and credentials, admissions selectivity and financial resources.
The MSB experienced a more sizeable improvement in rank this year: The school rose three places in the best undergraduate business list to No. 17 and tied for fourth in the international business school category.
U.S. News forms its business school rankings by surveying deans and senior faculty at undergraduate business programs and asking peer schools to rate other programs.
MSB Dean David Thomas said that the new ranking will increase awareness of Georgetown’s business school.
“I think [the ranking change] is a result of making our peers more informed about what we are doing,” he said.
Unlike Deacon, Thomas said the magazine’s rankings have the potential to affect applicant interest in the MSB.
“There are a lot of students … for whom U.S. News and World Report is almost like a bible in terms of judging the quality of schools and [how they will] influence where students are going to work,” Thomas said. “So there’s no question in my mind that those reports and rankings have a huge influence on applicants and applicants’ parents.”
