Conservative and religious groups both on and off campus are raising voices of opposition over the Georgetown University Lecture Fund’s announcement that President of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America Cecile Richards will speak at Georgetown in April.
Since the announcement March 3, the Cardinal Newman Society, the Archdiocese of Washington and students have spoken out against the student-run Lecture Fund’s invitation.
Georgetown University released a statement March 3 reaffirming its commitment to freedom of speech on campus in a statement, but neither condoned nor condemned Richards’ upcoming visit.
“We recognize that the perspectives of some speakers run counter to the Catholic and Jesuit values that animate our university,” the university wrote. “We work very hard to ensure that these values maintain a privileged place in our community while at the same time providing a forum that does not limit speech either in the content of the view being expressed or the speaker expressing the view.”
Planned Parenthood and Campus Ministry declined to comment. For an earlier brief on this story, the Lecture Fund released a short statement.
“The Lecture Fund strives to bring speakers to Georgetown’s campus to enlighten, educate and, occasionally, entertain. The Lecture Fund has been a student organization at Georgetown for many years and our process on bringing speakers has remained the same.”
The Lecture Fund declined to comment further.
Cecile Richards has served since 2006 as the president of Planned Parenthood, a non-profit organization founded in 1916 dedicated to promoting and delivering reproductive health care, sex education and contraceptives internationally. Richards previously founded and served as president of America Votes, a coalition affiliated with the Democratic Party, and as deputy chief of staff to Nancy Pelosi, the democratic leader in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Planned Parenthood has come under fire during the 2016 electoral cycle after undercover anti-abortion activists alleged, based on secretly recorded videos, that the organization sells aborted baby organs to scientific laboratories for profit. In response to the allegations, Planned Parenthood claimed it only received compensation for the transport and storage of the organs, which have been used in research contributing to a Polio vaccine, as well as in treating Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.
The Archdiocese of Washington released a statement March 7 regarding the event, urging Georgetown’s Jesuit community to better impart the Catholic Church’s values on the university.
“The Jesuit community on campus clearly has its work cut out for it and a long way to go as it tries to instill at Georgetown some of the values of Pope Francis. Until then it is hard wholeheartedly to share in the cry, ‘Go Hoyas!’” the statement reads.
The Cardinal Newman Society, which was founded in 1993 by Catholic college alumni with the goal of promoting and defending Catholic education created a petition March 9 urging the university to cancel the event. The petition, titled “Tell Georgetown: Say NO to Planned Parenthood President,” received over 7,000 signatures in its first 24 hours. As of March 16, the petition had 13,000 signatures.
Patrick Reilly, founder and president of the Cardinal Newman Society, spoke with CNS News on the issue, claiming the allowance of Richards’ visit shows Georgetown’s lack of commitment to its Catholic morals and identity.
“Besides a clear bias in the choice of speakers, there’s no sense of moral truth, which is the central point of a Catholic university. Either you accept Catholic moral teaching as true or you do not. In the case of Georgetown, they simply do not,” Reilly said.
Maya M. Noronha (COL ’05, LAW ’10) published a petition March 7 titled “No Planned Parenthood at Georgetown” demanding that the university prevent Richards’ visit. The petition states that hosting the president of Planned Parenthood would violate Georgetown’s free speech and expression policy that bans dangerous and threatening speech. The petition has been cosigned by over 70 members of the Georgetown community as of press time.
“First, the policy prohibits expression that ‘endangers or imminently threatens to endanger the safety of any member of the community’ Cecile Richards advocates for the killing of innocent human life by abortion,” the petition states. “Hosting an abortion advocate on campus is offensive and hurtful to those healing from a past abortion.”
Noronha asserted Richards’ visit stands contrary to Georgetown’s Jesuit and Catholic identity.
“A university group giving Cecile Richards alone the platform to advocate for abortion is contrary to Georgetown’s Catholic and Jesuit identity,” Noronha wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Conservative student groups have similarly voiced their opposition to the Lecture Fund’s invitation.
Michael Khan (COL ’18), the president of Vita Saxa, also known as Georgetown University Right to Life, an access-to-benefits university organization which serves to promote anti-abortion, anti-euthanasia and anti-death penalty views, also critiqued the upcoming event.
“The problem here is that it’s a recognized student group that gets funds from the university and resources from the university,” Khan said. “With the Lecture Fund, the budget it has and the prominence it has on campus, it really seems like an endorsement from the university and that’s really troubling.”
Ximena Céspedes (COL ’19), a member of Vita Saxa and the Catholic Daughters, voiced her concerns about Richards’ lecture topic and how it aligns with the message of H*yas For Choice, an on-campus student organization dedicated to pro-abortion rights activism. H*yas for Choice, which is not recognized by the university, is the only provider of free condoms on campus and is also a provider of comprehensive information on sexual health and pregnancy services.
“If H*yas for Choice had invited her to speak on campus, I don’t think it would’ve been a problem, but there’s the fact that the Lecture Fund is recognized by the university,” Céspedes said.
H*yas for Choice President Sophia Kleyman (COL ’16) said she appreciated the university’s dedication to free speech in light of the controversy surrounding Richards’ invitation and hoped others would recognize how such a dedication does not take away from its Jesuit identity.
“I think first of all, it’s important to know that, just because Georgetown is hosting a speaker that goes in contradiction to what the church believes, doesn’t mean that makes Georgetown any less Catholic, any less dedicated to upholding Jesuit values,” Kleyman said. “The conversation should be applauding Georgetown for the fact that they’re able to acknowledge the contradictory views but also on the fact that it’s important to uphold a diversity of ideas and viewpoints.”
Alliemarie Schapp (COL ‘19), who plans on attending the event, said she came to Georgetown for its open dialogue and conversation on pressing issues in modern society, exemplified by events like these.
“Planned Parenthood has a lot of services beyond promoting abortions, and if that’s an individual’s only objection to having [Richards] come and speak, then I think that that objection should be evenly applied to anyone who comes to campus who holds the view of being pro-choice, and that is simply illogical,” Schapp said. “If President DeGioia rescinded the invitation it would affect my view of Georgetown negatively.”’
Richards is scheduled to speak at Georgetown in April, with the Lecture Fund so far only confirming that the event will be closed to the public and that it will consist of remarks followed by a question-and- answer period.

Another petition against Cecile Richards’ visit to Georgetown has garnered over 11,600 petitions.
I wish the 2.8 million preborn babies killed under Cecile’s watch as Planned Parenthood president would have been given the same right to “exchange ideas” in the market of “diversity,” but, alas, their right to life was wrenched away from them.  Shame on Georgetown U.

I oppose abortion on the same basis as the Hyde Amendment, but the Church bases its demonization off PP on a quite small proportion of the organization’s list of services, while letting the large number of beneficial treatments and services slip conveniently off its radar.  It is not likely that the Church would hold to a similar line of reasoning were it to be condemned in its entirety by the actions of a relatively few pedophile priests and their accomplices/aiders/abettors. I think Georgetown’s students capture and sustain a long tradition of free, open, and honest debate that has existed since Jesuit education began. People do not learn to use their minds if all they are fed is intolerant orthodoxy. “Judge not that you be not judged” seems to apply remarkably well here. Conflating abortion with contraception as prohibited acts makes no sense in the attack on PP.  The Chuch realizes this; contraception reduces the incidence of abortion. One is clearly the greater evil. Time to minister to the real world. Maybe, just maybe, the Jesuits’ liberal tradition is really what is in the crosshairs here.

Haha is this Chuck Thomas guy really serious trying to draw an analogy with the Catholic Church sex abuse scandal?  Imagine if the Catholic Church held the same position on pedophilia that Planned Parenthood has on abortion – i.e. that men have a right to be pedophiles, just like women have a right to abortion, and that it has no intention of stopping pedophilia amongst it ranks….but people should continue to value the Catholic Church based pedophilia is only a small part of the Catholic Church’s overall mission.

Georgetown will hire three new staff members, two to Counseling and Psychiatric Services and one to the Division of Student Affairs, in an effort to expand mental health resources, according to a campus-wide email sent by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson on March 15.
Current plans propose adding a staff psychologist and a case manager to CAPS on the main campus and a staff psychologist to CAPS at Georgetown University Law Center. The new positions will be filled by fall 2016.
Olson wrote that the decision to add the three new hires is part of the university’s ongoing efforts to strengthen mental health services on campus.
“Colleges and universities across the country have seen greater use of mental health services by students in recent years,” Olson wrote. “At Georgetown, we recognized similar needs for additional counseling services for our students. Over the past few months we have
worked closely with students to address these needs on our campus.”
By expanding the staff, the university aims to reduce waiting times for routine appointments and to offer more personal support for students with complex issues.
The added case manager position will double the size of the current case management staff, according to a press release from the Georgetown University Student Association.
“They will be available to serve students’ mental health needs, ensuring that students receive proper follow-up care and can continually receive support when taking or returning from a medical leave of absence,” GUSA Director of Communications Will Simons (COL ’16) wrote in the press release.
GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) said that he hopes this does not mark the end of mental health reform on campus.
“We view these hirings as a step in the right direction. One of GUSA’s priorities is to ensure that students have access to timely and high-quality mental health services,” Luther wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will continue to work with the university to ensure that CAPS is adequately staffed and work to change the culture around mental health on campus.”
GUSA President-Elect Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said while she is excited by the new hires, mental health reforms need to continue.
“This is amazing news, and something students have been advocating for a while, so it is incredibly exciting to see the university work towards expanding mental health resources,” Khan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There is a lot more to be done, and this great addition to the CAPS program shouldn’t end the conversation on mental health resources and policies. We need to ensure that the conversation on mental health on our campus continues to expand.”

Georgetown College Dean Chester Gillis will conclude his duties as dean at the end of the 2016-17 academic year, University President John J. DeGioia announced in a campus-wide email Tuesday.
“As Dean of the College, Chet has overseen the implementation of many new academic programs, including new majors in African-American Studies; Justice and Peace; Biological Physics; and Environmental Biology; and new minors in Business; Film and Media Studies; Journalism; Education, Inquiry, and Justice; Philosophy and Bioethics; Cognitive Science; and Korean,” DeGioia wrote.
In the email, DeGioia said he would create a committee to find a replacement for Gillis.
“Please join me in expressing our sincerest gratitude to Chet for his deep care and dedication to the members of our Georgetown community and wishing him all the best as he prepares to conclude his service as dean,” DeGioia wrote.
Gillis was unavailable for comment as of press time.
Gillis has served in his current role since 2009. Prior to becoming dean of Georgetown College, Gillis served as the amaturo chair in Catholic studies in the Georgetown department of theology. Gillis will return to the theology department as a faculty member in 2017 after a brief sabbatical.
Gillis has published numerous works on topics such as comparative religion and Roman Catholicism. Gillis also co-edits the Columbia University Press Series on Religion and Politics.
Chief of Staff of the Office of the President Joseph Ferrara praised Gillis’ contributions to the Georgetown community, adding that he is eager to cooperate with Gillis in finding his successor. “His leadership and vision have advanced the College and the Georgetown community in countless ways. We look forward to working with [Gillis] over the next year to ensure a smooth transition in the leadership of the College and to support his return to the faculty,” Ferrara wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Students also expressed their gratitude for Gillis’ work in the College. “I think that it’s sad to see him go. His many years of service, as well as everything he’s done for the school, will definitely be appreciated,” George Jose (COL ’18) said. “He’s been serving as an advocate for the students and he won’t be easy to replace.”
Students outside Georgetown College also acknowledged Gillis’s work, particularly in expanding minor and certificate programs for non-College students.
“I think it’s really cool how he started many programs like the justice and peace program,” Megan Patel (SFS ’18) said. “It’s hard for schools to partner with each other, so his work to help with that was really good.”

Carly Fiorina, former chief executive officer of tech giant Hewlett-Packard, spoke about her recent presidential campaign Tuesday night in the Fischer Colloquium as part of Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service’s ongoing series, “Reflections on Running.” Fiorina spoke to a standing-only audience, describing the intricacies of her presidential race with a sort of political candor that can only occur in retrospect.
Fiorina opened the event by addressing her lack of interest in politics earlier in her life, saying she gradually transformed from being politically apathetic to fervently active in politics.
“As a student I didn’t care anything about politics,” Fiorina said. “Frankly, there were a lot of times in my life when I didn’t bother to vote. I thought politics somehow existed in a different world, which had nothing to do with me. … As I spent more and more time in business I came to realize that actually politics and politicians and the policies they pursue impact every one of our lives whether we know it or not.”
Fiorina also discussed her unhappiness with the political landscape she encountered that prompted her run for the California Senate in 2009 to address her dissatisfaction with the state’s policies.
“I had seen the impact of many liberal policies on the state that I loved, [California], which has the highest income inequality in the country, which spends more money per pupil on education than 49 out of 50 states and yet has outcomes that are 49th out of 50,” Fiorina said. “California is kind of a test case, in my mind, of what happens when you have wrong-headed policies for too long. It works really well for the rich and it doesn’t really work for anyone else. And so I ran.”
Although her bid for the California Senate was ultimately unsuccessful, Fiorina did not regard the attempt as a failure, but rather as an encouragement for future political action.
“It’s a demonstration, I think, that as Americans we actually have more common ground than we imagine sometimes. That’s certainly what I found, and I found it to be true in the presidential election as well,” Fiorina said.
After battling breast cancer and losing her daughter, Fiorina officially announced in May 2015 she would be running for president. Fiorina said the decision was driven, in part, by her desire to rebuild the reputation of conservative women in the United States.
“I wanted to reintroduce people to what being conservative is because there are a lot of things that people think they know about conservative women, but those are just caricatures,” Fiorina said.
With her hat officially in the ring after her announcement video went up on her website on May 4, 2015, Fiorina said she began looking for opportunities to improve her discouraging initial odds.
“We always knew that because we didn’t have the years of building up the political infrastructure, I mean I started literally from ground zero, [that it would be hard],” Fiorina said. “I had a team of two people, I had less than four percent name recognition nationally. Most people had never heard of me.”
Fiorina said she knew the debates would be important for building her reputation among voters. However, Fiorina did not initially make the main debate stage and was instead featured on what she called the “happy hour debate,” the less publicized debate which aired before the main presidential debate. This debate featured candidates considered to have an outside chance in the presidential race.
Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), the executive director of GU Politics and the event moderator, said Fiorina first captured the public eye in this debate, highlighting her own performance and its impact on her campaign.
“I don’t think there’s anyone who would disagree that she was the star of that night among both debates,” said Elleithee. “She saw a surge right after that, people did begin to hear her name, and did begin checking up on what she was talking about.”
Fiorina was invited to the next Republican debate at the Reagan Library during which her sparring with Donald Trump and stern words for Planned Parenthood saw her polling number rise to its eventual peak in the next few weeks.
“I was very satisfied,” Fiorina said on air with American Broadcasting Company’s “Good Morning America”. “When I went into the debate, almost half the audience didn’t know my name, and I introduced myself successfully.”
Fiorina’s rising polling numbers stalled weeks later and after lackluster results in Iowa and New Hampshire, Fiorina officially bowed out of the race Feb. 10, citing lack of media attention as a major factor in her campaign’s fall.
“We couldn’t get any oxygen. When I was no longer on the debate shows there was no path forward,” Fiorina said.
Having traced her campaign’s trajectory in the primary race, Fiorina then spoke about the presidential race going forward, fielding several questions about the campaign of the Republican Party’s frontrunner, Donald Trump.
“Politically speaking, I think I probably thought what a lot of people thought, that [Donald Trump] was going to go away,” Fiorina said.  “Well, we were wrong, he did not go away, which is why, on the Republican side, the only thing we can do now is beat him.”
Fiorina said she formally endorsed Senator Ted Cruz since she believes he is capable of beating Trump.
“[One of the reasons] I’m campaigning for Ted Cruz is because he’s the only one who can beat Donald Trump, and Donald Trump has to be beaten. He cannot be the nominee of the Republican party,” Fiorina said. “When the Republican establishment gets together and says, ‘we’re going to pick the nominee,’ it doesn’t work. … The only candidate who has a chance at beating him fair and square at the ballot box is Ted Cruz.”
The event ended after nearly an hour and a half of Fiorina’s reflection.
An attendee of the event, Jason Gusdorf (SFS ’16) believed Fiorina’s response to a question about Trump’s candidacy to be unaligned with the reasons the public criticizes Trump, but enjoyed the event nevertheless.
“Fiorina declared that Trump and Clinton were ‘two sides of the same coin,’ since Trump donated money to politics and Clinton accepted it; Clinton and Trump were equally guilty. This won Fiorina a round of applause from the audience. Not only was her thought patronizingly simple, but it implied that the criticisms of Trump centered around how much money he has donated to politicians … How an audience of Georgetown students could applaud such a statement baffled me,” Gusdorf said. “Regardless, I appreciated the chance to see such a high-profile political leader.”
Anthony Persico (SFS ’19), who also attended the event, said he considered Fiorina’s talk as a candid look into the unseen aspects of a political campaign.
“It was refreshing to hear somebody as intelligent as Mrs. Fiorina talk outside of a political setting. She was able to speak openly and honestly without worrying about how people would really react,” Persico said. “She spoke about personal stories and experiences that only somebody on the inside of the campaign for the White House could have known.”
The event marked the second in a series of talks by former presidential candidates, the first being a talk by Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor who also ran in the 2016 presidential election. GU Politics announced another installment of the “Reflections on Running” series Tuesday. Rick Santorum, former Pennsylvania senator and two-time candidate, will be speaking about his recent campaign March 21 at 7 p.m. in Old North. It also announced Thursday that the fourth installment of the series will be held March 22 at 6:45 p.m. in McShain Lounge with a talk from Martin O’Malley, former Maryland governor and presidential candidate.

Former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor argued that an excessive concern with short-term political goals sacrifices long-term success in Congress at an event hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service on Wednesday.
The conversation, titled “How Short-termism is Breaking Washington,” was moderated by GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) and GU Politics fellow and senior politics editor at the Daily Beast, Jackie Kucinich.
According to Cantor, short-termism is a phenomenon in national politics in which members of both parties grow increasingly polarized and prioritize small political victories in the short term at the expense of long-term stability, cooperation and progress.
“Short-termism is the result of degradation and a lack of trust in our leaders and our political institutions,” Cantor said.
Cantor argued that in the 2016 election, short-termism is visible in the factions within the Republican Party that support Donald Trump and the progressive wing in the Democratic Party that back Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
“If you think about short-termism and what is infecting so much of the public discourse today, there is this trend toward short-termism in both the corporate and business arena as well as in government and politics,” Cantor said. “Where they have something in common is this lack of trust or faith in institutions.”
Cantor cited the public outrage that resulted from the 2005 Parade Magazine cover story on the “Bridge to Nowhere” project in Alaska — a project that sought to connect the small town of Ketchikan with its airport — as an example of how the public began to lose faith in the federal government and see Congress as a body full of inefficiency, wastefully spending taxpayer dollars.
“[They] are saying, ‘Why would I trust these people who say they have this long-term vision where they are taking us, if this is the result,’” he said. “A big reason Republicans lost the majority in 2006 is because of those types of decisions that were allowed to take place.”
He proceeded to explain that this phenomenon could have been prevented shortly after the election of President Barack Obama in 2008.
“The election of Barack Obama held so much potential and promise for this country. I was just elected into Republican leadership and became the minority whip when Barack Obama was sworn in,” Cantor said. “As Republicans, we were in the extreme minority. He had supermajorities in the Senate and overwhelming majorities in the House. It allowed him to do a lot of things.”
Cantor said that with the overwhelming presence of Democrats in the federal government, the House minority was the most powerless body.
“The powerless force was we in the House. We had such a small minority,” Cantor said.
Cantor recalled his first negotiations with Obama and the White House team.
“The president reached out to [former Speaker ]John Boehner and me and he said, ‘Hey, we want to work with you. Come on in to the White House, bring us your ideas’,” Cantor said. “That quickly dissipated after the inauguration. We were dispensed with because that month we got no feedback from the White House and they announced they were going forward with their stimulus bill … We felt we were given the cold shoulder.”
Cantor said following that meeting, Democrats forced a series of bills through Congress along partisan lines including the 2009 stimulus package, the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the 2010 Dodd-Frank reforms. Cantor said he believes these types of legislation contributed to the rise of the Tea Party and increased distrust in the federal government.
“That evolved into the mandate we got in the elections of 2010 and put us in the majority. It wasn’t necessarily that they became confident in us,” Cantor said. “They said, ‘Hey, Republicans, get in there and be that check and balance on what we believe is the administration run amok with all this legislation and regulatory overreach.’”
Cantor said that until the Republicans gained control of the Senate, their primary role was as a balance to a largely Democratic government with the aim of preventing future Democratic policies. Then, due to a variety of factors, expectations began to shift.
“All of a sudden, you weren’t just there to block, you’re there to undue it,” Cantor said. “Well how in the world does one House repeal these legislations? It’s not going to happen. That became the new test. My side played into that and we started passing repeal bills, over and over again.”
Cantor said Republican voters expectations were difficult to meet, and contributed to more distrust as the House failed to make changes. According to Cantor, whenever movements formed to try to make compromises, voters confronted their legislators with anger.
Cantor said he himself was a victim of his constituents’ anger in Virginia when he lost the republican primary to a Tea Party candidate.
Cantor said Trump’s rise in the Republican Party is a concerning sign for the party.
“How do you go about being a party of inclusion? You stay away from the kind of statements being thrown around by some from my side,” Cantor said. “Trump is really worrisome. If he is the standard bearer of our party, what does that say? You don’t say that about Mexicans, you don’t say that about minorities, you don’t say that about women.”
Ellie Singer (COL ’18), who introduced the congressman, said she appreciated the opportunity to hear him speak.
“It’s such an honor. I love him to death and I have admired his work for quite some time,” Singer said. “As a Republican myself, it is difficult to watch our party going through so much infighting, so it is refreshing to introduce a speaker who is so focused on dialogue.”
Elleithee said in an interview with The Hoya that speaking with Cantor was especially important to him because of his own background in Virginia politics.
“It’s kind of surreal for me, because I came up through Virginia politics and he was majority leader when I was at the DNC. A lot of my career was spent attacking Eric Cantor. Now that we have stepped away from the political arena, we have different perspectives,” Elleithee said.
Elleithee said he hopes students left the event with a glimpse at the perspective of a national leader.
“To be able to hear from someone at the highest level of government and who fell victim to some of this distrust and short-termism, to hear from him and engage with him is important,” Elleithee said. “So much of what we do is to begin to see if we can impact the discussion now.”

Georgetown University Law Center’s prohibition of students campaigning for the upcoming presidential election came under congressional scrutiny at a Subcommittee on Oversight hearing of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee entitled “Protecting the Free Exchange of Ideas on College Campuses” on March 3.
The GULC cites its tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Service Code, which precludes nonprofit organizations from supporting political candidates, as grounds for its prohibition of student participation in campaigns.
GULC student Alexander Atkins (LAW ’17), who has spearheaded efforts in the past six months to revise the policy, testified before the subcommittee, which isthe chief tax-writing committee in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Atkins has challenged the policy since he and other law students comprising an informal grassroots group supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were prevented from tabling outside Georgetown Law’s McDonough Hall in September and distributing campaign materials altogether in October.
Atkins received support in his efforts from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting individual rights at American universities. FIRE issued an open letter in February to GULC Dean William Treanor urging the university to lift its restrictions on student expression.
Following FIRE’s letter, the center announced its intention to revise its policies and has allowed Atkins to provide feedback on draft revisions, but still prohibits candidate advocacy on campus.
Georgetown Law’s acting Executive Director of Communications Anne Cassidy said the center has committed to implementing changes in its policies.
“We’ve been revising our tabling procedures and expect they’ll be updated soon,” Cassidy wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GULC also issued a statement written by the university’s Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming to the subcommittee stating that an internal review of the policy is being conducted.
“We are adjusting the policies to make very clear that individuals as well as groups are able to reserve tables for organized activity and that all members of our community are able to make reasonable use of University resources to express their political opinions,” Fleming wrote.
Atkins, who was invited to testify alongside FIRE’s Associate Director of Litigation Catherine Sevcenko and experts in the fields of free speech and tax law, said the hearing represented significant progress for political engagement on campuses.
“For many members, especially those who attended college in the sixties and seventies, the idea that America’s campuses would be anything other than hot beds of free expression and political thought came as a counterintuitive shock,” Atkins wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think my testimony helped to paint a startling picture of the way that previous generations’ understanding of the culture of college campuses differs dramatically from present reality.”
In her testimony, Sevcenko stressed FIRE’s stance that cultivating political expression on college campuses requires cooperation across party lines.
“This is a bipartisan issue,” Sevcenko said. “Georgetown prevents students from campaigning for Bernie Sanders, but about the same time American University prevented students from campaigning for Rand Paul. As long as the IRS guidelines remain unclear, censorship will win out every time.”
The hearing revealed a rift between Democrats and Republicans on the subcommittee. Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) mentioned recent speakers invited to speak on Georgetown’s campus, including Sanders and Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, to demonstrate the university’s politicized climate.
“What we’re seeing today in this subcommittee, in my opinion, is really searching for a problem that doesn’t exist,” Crowley said. “Georgetown University isn’t bound to the First Amendment, but they are on their own initiative devising a policy that ensures full inclusivity for all of their students.”
Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) characterized the situation as indicative of a culture of excessive political correctness, stating that the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment applies to every American university.
“I don’t care what kind of college it is, private or public,” Kelly said. “I think it’s absolutely chilling that we have to have this kind of hearing to expose what’s going on.”
University of Miami law professor Frances Hill, who was summoned to testify because of her expertise in tax law, argued that legal precedents have existed since 1972 that indicate that student campaigning does not jeopardize a university’s tax-exempt status, as GULC claims.
“On the tax side, it’s a well-settled issue, it’s not one of the hard ones in tax law,” Hill said. “One just has to assume that university officials were misinformed or improperly briefed on tax law, and that’s where the solution has to lie.”
FIRE’s Senior Program Officer Marieke Tuthill Beck-Coon said that although she commends the GULC for reviewing its policy, it should immediately suspend its ban as it makes its decision.
“These students are rapidly losing their window of opportunity to weigh in the primaries,” Beck-Coon said in an interview with The Hoya. “They definitely should be allowed to engage in speech on some kind of interim basis while they’re revising their policy.”
Atkins highlighted his satisfaction that the subcommittee called a hearing focused on the issue of free speech and political activity on university campuses.
“Challenging authority is never comfortable or easy,” Atkins wrote. “It was very rewarding to finally have a captive audience – let alone Congress – that was interested in hearing about our experience.”

Georgetown’s decades-long ban on new liquor licenses – long accused by business owners of atrophying the neighborhood’s restaurant industry – faces an uncertain future.
The D.C. Alcoholic Beverage Control Board will issue its decision March 30 on whether to extend, modify or allow the moratorium to expire.
Implemented in 1989 following complaints from Georgetown residents of noise and rowdy behavior from unruly patrons, the moratorium capped the number of establishments that could attain a Class C/R license, which permits the sale of beer, wine or spirits on premises.
Within the past five years, liquor licenses were hoarded by landlords and resold at exorbitant prices, in some cases even fetching $15,000. The resulting license shortage saw prospective restaurant businesses fleeing Georgetown for more restaurant-friendly areas like Adams Morgan and Dupont Circle. In 2009, the D.C. Office of Tax and Revenue auctioned off a seized license to Johnny Rockets on M Street for $100,000.
The Advisory Neighborhood Commission, in collaboration with Georgetown’s Business Improvement District, drafted a settlement agreement this past December that outlines how establishments can operate even without the moratorium in place. The ANC, a body composed of District residents, considers government policies that directly affect the neighborhoods it represents.
Student ANC 2E Commissioner Kendyl Clausen (SFS ’16) predicted that the proposed settlement lifting the moratorium would not cause Georgetown’s restaurant scene to revert back into the rowdiness that irked residents in the eighties.
“This covers everything from hours, where noise can be heard from before you get a violation, how many people you can have, whether or not you can have live entertainment there and an entire array of things,” Clausen said. “It addresses all the problems they had during the ’80s and has formal mechanisms that make it more standard of a process.”
Clausen added that the Georgetown neighborhood itself is no longer conducive to a party scene.
“The popular bar, clubbing areas aren’t in Georgetown anymore,” Clausen said. “People don’t come from Northeast to club on M Street, that’s just not a thing that happens. A lot of the fears are no longer there, because the moratorium has so successfully worked that we are actually losing a lot of our hip restaurant life as well, and I don’t think we’re at risk of any craziness happening again.”
Student ANC 2E Commissioner Reed Howard (SFS ’17) said the moratorium arose from Georgetown resident apprehensions about the neighborhood’s identity. Howard said that now, with shuttered businesses, the community is confronted with a fresh bout of soul searching.
“When it was first imposed, neighbors were really looking to protect the character of the neighborhood. They were anxious that it would turn into an entertainment district, and it was really put in place to protect the identity of Georgetown,” Howard said. “Throughout the years, neighbors have agreed that so far it has hurt businesses, and there haven’t been as many local restaurants opening up in Georgetown and it’s been harder for their doors to stay open.”
Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration Public Information Officer Jessie Cornelius said the board plans to take these issues into account as it makes its decision.
“When making a decision regarding a moratorium zone, the board takes several factors into consideration,” Cornelius wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It would consider all public comment that it receives and examine the effect of establishments on neighborhood peace order and quiet, including noise and litter issues; crime statistics, residential parking needs and vehicular and pedestrian safety.”
Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington legal counsel Andrew Kline stressed his client’s opposition to all liquor license moratoria, but he said the lifting the ban is unlikely to impact restaurants in Georgetown because the shortage has lessened over the past three years. Of the 68 total restaurant licenses, he estimated that over 20 are currently not in use, making them readily available for new restaurants that wish to operate in the neighborhood.
“I think it’s all kind of much ado about nothing,” Kline said. “It’s kind of like lifting an isolation order when there’s a disease outbreak when no one has seen the disease in two years. It’s just like ‘Okay, so?’ It’s an odd event.”
Restaurateur Ian Hilton, owner of the French bistro Chez Billy Sud on Georgetown’s 31st Street, agreed. Though the moratorium had deterred him from opening a restaurant in Georgetown in the past, he said other factors are more responsible for stifling the neighborhood’s restaurant development, particularly the neighborhood.
“The biggest factor is rents,” Hilton said. “Rents in Georgetown are extremely high, particularly on M Street where only really national chains can afford the types of rents they have there. So I would say the moratorium is a factor, definitely not the biggest factor, but lifting it is a good step for Georgetown to come out of its bit of isolation and get some new operators in the area.”

Ahead of the upcoming 2016 housing selection, the Office of Residential Living has launched a new housing selection portal called Hoya Housing.
The redesigned housing management system replaces Georgetown University Student Housing, the university’s housing portal for over a decade. Hoya Housing will provide students with a greater range of features and a more streamlined housing selection process, among other upgrades.
Under the new Hoya Housing portal, the number of room selection phases will be reduced from five to two. Students will select apartments, suites and townhouses in the first phase, and singles, doubles and triples in the second phase, according to Director for Residential Services Patrick Killillee.
In GUSH, students were assigned time intervals one minute apart for their initial housing selection process. A student’s number of housing points, which were distributed by school year with extra available to those who attended certain events, determined these time intervals.
With Hoya Housing, the one-minute intervals will be replaced by a 15-minute exclusive time period in which an undetermined number of groups — possibly 20 — will search for rooms before the next group of students has access.
“Every group will have this time when they’re the only 20 groups in that 15 minutes. But you’re up against everybody at the same time, there’s no time that’s all yours,” Killillee said. “If you don’t pick in that 15 minutes you won’t get locked out, but the longer you wait, the less options you have.”
Under the previous system, a group sponsor would be solely responsible for taking group members’ selection codes, but in Hoya Housing, every group member must individually add himself to the group.
Additionally, there will be a new roommate-finding feature through which groups of students may look for others who may help them fill a vacancy in their room. As part of this process, students will be expected to update their living preference questionnaire.
“If you’re in a group of three and want to find a fourth person, you can search around and find someone to be part of your group,” Killillee said. “Or, if you’re an individual and you want to find someone to live with you can find a roommate that way.”
Students living in apartments, suites and townhouses must select in advance which members of their group will live together in each room and who will take a single room.
According to Killillee, the change from GUSH to Hoya Housing occurred due to a university-wide initiative to eliminate “homegrown” systems made in house. A few years ago the Office of Residential Life redesigned the housing system and settled on a proposal by StarRez, a company providing housing software for other universities.
While many new features exist as part of Hoya Housing, Killillee noted how there are a few things that the system does not do that GUSH did do. Hoya Housing does not have a room specification feature like GUSH, so students will have to research the specifications of each room ahead of time.
The Office of Residential Living has held three information sessions about Hoya Housing since the beginning of February and received a record turnout of students. The Office of Residential Living is currently hosting office hours about the new system in case students have questions, and the new system has been well-received by students.
“We’ve had students go in and test the application as testing users and they have had positive things to say,” Assistant Director of Assignments Krista Haxton said. “I think they like that it seems a bit cleaner, it seems like a newer look, and so we’ve gotten good feedback there.”
Nicholas Ebert (SFS ’18) said the new feel of Hoya Housing works better than the old GUSH portal. Ebert noted that the twenty-minute intervals in which multiple groups compete would be better than the one-minute exclusive periods groups, as they would make the process more expedient.
“I think it’s good that they’re changing Housing-At-A-Glance because it always felt outdated when I was using it for things other than housing selection,” Ebert said. “The twenty-minute block works better than the one-minute intervals. I think the process will be more efficient.”
Aditya Pande (SFS ’18) said he admired the automation of the additional features, including the check-in and check-out process. Pande noted the modernized housing system could be more effective for the student body.
“I think it’s good. They’re bringing more features to where people are, on the internet,” Pande said. “It’s the way people communicate, and this is how our housing process should operate.”
The 2016 housing process will begin with phase one from March 23 to 30, consisting of selection for apartments, suites and townhouses.

The Beeck Center for Social Impact & Innovation announced this year’s recipients of its GU Impacts fellowship, a program that allows 16 undergraduate students to participate in a fully-funded 10-week summer internship focused on social innovation at organizations in the United States and abroad.
Fellows will intern with six social impact organizations: Fundación Avina in Colombia, Yanbal International in Peru, the Inventtus Corporation in Nicaragua, the Center for Civic Innovation in Atlanta, the D.C. Federal City Council and Mann Deshi Foundation in India.
The program accepted 16 fellows from a pool of 73 applicants this year, down from a pool of 115 applicants last year, the first year of the program. Applicants were able to rank specific programs based on language ability and preference.
Program Manager Matthew Fortier said the decline in applications is likely due to self-selection on the part of interested students.
“We were more transparent and clear at the beginning of the recruitment process about the requirements of the program,” Fortier said. “I think in that way, while we received fewer applications than last year for the same number of spots, essentially we had a higher quality of applications because applicants already knew what they were getting into when they applied.”
Fortier said the Impacts fellowship aims to expose students to the social development sector through experiential learning opportunities.
“More broadly speaking, we’re looking to develop individual leaders in all sectors,” Fortier said. “So we’re investing in the development of these individuals while. at the same time, they’re having a direct impact with the organizations and projects that we’re working with.”
Fortier said GU Impacts hopes to combine service and learning into a meaningful experience that fellows can draw on through the rest of their time at Georgetown.
“In doing that, we’re looking to have an impact on multiple levels, to have an impact on the individual fellows themselves, to influence their individual academic and professional careers and the contributions that they can make back to Georgetown and the larger community once they’ve returned,” Fortier said. “We’re also looking to have an impact on the organizations and the beneficiaries of these organizations themselves.”
Fellows at Fundación Avina, a new partnership for this year, will monitor the peace and political process in Colombia following the recent agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces, create an impact-investment platform for the foundation and examine the water imprint of Avina’s partner organizations.
According to Fortier, the partnership is pending approval from the Office of Global Services as Colombia is under a State Department travel warning.
“At Georgetown we already have graduate students doing work there with the Center for Latin American Studies, so we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to run that program this year,” Fortier said.
Yanbal International is a cosmetics company with a strong social impact mission. In a micro-entrepreneurship model similar to that of the cosmetics company Avon Products, Inc., Yanbal empowers its sales consultants to implement direct sales models under the supervision of a director.
GU Impacts fellows will work on analyzing and enhancing the company’s direct sales model and structure.
The Inventtus Corporation consists of two social enterprises, Nuve Technologies and Mochila Digital, which focus on democratizing technology in Latin America. The fellows will be working with these enterprises to examine how access to technology can contribute to education.
The Center for Civic Innovation in Atlanta is a startup that focuses on projects aimed at creating an environment that can catalyze entrepreneurship both in Atlanta and in cities across the United States.
The DC Federal City Council focuses on impact investing in infrastructure around the DC area, especially in Anacostia.
Mann Deshi Foundation is a multifaceted organization that works towards the economic empowerment of women in rural India. Mann Deshi consists of a bank, a business school and a chamber of commerce. The organization builds skills surrounding access to finance and helps the women with whom it works to develop their own businesses.
Shola Powell (COL ’17), a GU Impacts alumna mentor who interned with Mann Deshi last summer said she was able to see the impact of Mann Deshi first-hand.
“I went around to different villages and met with different women and learned more about their company and how Mann Deshi helped them, and what kind of resources they had access to,” Powell said.
Valerie Sanchez (SFS ’18), another alumna mentor who interned in the Philippines last summer with Ateneo Center for Educational Development, a partnership that has been discontinued this year, stressed the significance of the fellowship in helping her plan her path at Georgetown.
“It very much helped me in terms of being able to pick my major,” Sanchez said. “I decided that development is something that I wanted to focus on, and the strategy behind different projects or implementation of projects around the world, and that’s really what I came here for.”

The Lincoln Memorial will undergo an $18.5 million renovation this year thanks to a donation from billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein to the nonprofit the National Park Foundation.
The renovation, which is set to continue into 2019, is the biggest modification to the memorial since its 1922 dedication. In addition to Rubenstein’s donation, the National Park Service, a federal agency that oversees all national parks, will contribute $800,000 towards the project.
Rubenstein is the co-CEO of The Carlyle Group, a global asset management firm based in Washington, D.C. He also serves as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Performing Arts Center.
Rubenstein’s donation is part of the Park Foundation’s Centennial Campaign commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Park Service. The goal is to raise $350 million during the campaign. $211 million had already been raised by the end of January.
During the renovation, the memorial will, for the most part, remain open to the public without significant disruptions. It is likely that certain sections may be closed off for periods of time while construction and repairs are underway.
Most of the work done to the national monument, which receives around 7 million visitors a year, will occur beneath the chamber that houses the 120-ton statue of Abraham Lincoln. The exhibit space, which currently includes only a bookstore and restrooms, will be expanded from around 750 square feet to 15,000 square feet.
According to the Park Service, Rubenstein’s donation will be used to fund improvements in three main categories: exterior work, new underground spaces and added exhibits. The exterior repairs will include stabilization and changes to the roof and walls, the restoration of the Jules Guérin murals on the monuments interior walls and general landscaping of the memorial’s grounds.
The new underground spaces include enhanced accessibility, expanded restrooms and the relocation of both the museum store and office space, used for security and research. The new exhibits will allow visitors to view the foundations beneath the monument.
The project will be conducted in four phases between 2016 and 2019. The preliminary phase one of the restoration will begin in 2016 as plans for the new exhibits are drafted. Phase two and phase three will form the bulk of the renovations, with phase four enhancing landscaping upon completion of the project.
Rubenstein’s donation marks the largest of the four contributions he has made to the national parks. His funding has supported repairs to the Washington Monument, restoration of the Robert E. Lee Memorial and renovation of the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial.
In a Park Service press release published Feb. 15, Rubenstein referred to these contributions as patriotic philanthropy, expressing his enthusiasm to honor a historic figure,
“These improvements will hopefully enable more people to better understand and appreciate Abraham Lincoln’s remarkable leadership during one of the most trying periods in American history,” Rubenstein said. “I am humbled to be a part of honoring this great man and preserving this iconic memorial for future generations.”
In the press release, Park Foundation president Will Shafroth also voiced his excitement about the donation.
“Mr. Rubenstein’s gift will better allow the Lincoln Memorial to stand the test of time, providing current and future generations the opportunity to connect more deeply with the values our 16th president held dear, and inspire dialogue to help us learn from one another,” Shafroth said.

Enrollment in Washington, D.C. public schools and charter schools increased 2.3 percent in the past academic year to a total of 87,344 students, according to figures released February by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education
The increase is part of a seven-year consecutive trend of growing enrollment. 48,439 students are now registered in public schools and 38,905 are enrolled in charter schools.
State Superintendent of Education Hanseul Kang attributed the increase in enrollment to the accomplishments of DCPS.
“Year after year, more families choose public schools in the District of Columbia, which is a testament to the amazing work of our teachers, school leaders and staff,” Kang said to The Washington Post. “I look forward to seeing this trend continue as we dig deeper into the important work of improving the quality of public education in the District.”
McCourt School of Public Policy Research Fellow Thomas Toch, who specializes in education, explained his theories on what could be driving the trend.
“It is a reflection of the growing population in the District,” Toch said. “There is a immigration of mostly younger, affluent people. A lot of millennials are moving to D.C. and they tend to have young children and they are tending to live in areas that they would not have been in in the past.”
Toch said another important aspect of the recent developments is demographic, highlighting the fact that many of the millennials migrating into the city are white.
“There is a chance with this influx of new students to create a more integrated school system,” Toch said. “It’s unclear whether that will happen, but this could be the start of a very interesting evolution of racial dynamics in the city, moving away from what has been a largely segregated landscape in the past, and that could be very encouraging.”
Toch highlighted increased parental interest in their children’s education as a potential consequence of the rise in enrollment and demographic shifts in the school system,
“Many of these new parents with kids in the DCPS are younger, well-educated and are people for whom a good education is particularly important,” Toch said. “One consequence is likely to be that there will be a good deal of parental engagement in schools and the pressure will be on schools to perform in the same way that more affluent families who tend to send their kids to private school bring a great pressure to bear on independent schools.”
However, Georgetown government associate professor Douglas Reed predicts D.C.public schools will face hardships if the increased enrollment patterns continue.
“I think that one of the things going forward that is going to be interesting is if this growth continues and if the D.C. real estate market continues to be as dynamic as it is, finding sites for schools if they’re going to build new ones could in the foreseeable future be a challenge,” Reed said.
Reed said that a possible solution to this would be increased collaboration between the different types of schools that fall under the DCPS umbrella.
“You have traditional neighborhood schools, the charter schools and then you also maybe have some themes from magnet schools that blend in too,” Reed said. “I think that they should make a greater push for collaboration between charter and public schools and this is hard to do because charter schools are very much operating with their own objective and mission.”
Reed added that one of the biggest problems DCPS faces is the achievement gap.
“To the extent that poor kids are not achieving at the same rate as middle class or upper middle class kids, this is a hard problem to solve nationally, not just in the District,” Reed said. “They have done somewhat better in terms of test score outcomes, but this may just be a function of how they are getting a more middle class and affluent student body.”
McCourt School of Public Policy Research professor Jeff Strohl discussed the growing appeal of living in the District.
“People have found that the resurgence of the inner city of D.C. is attractive. The city has definitely become more attractive over time,” Stohl said. “You have to keep in mind that Washington D.C., at one point in the nineties, was the murder capital of the country.”
According to Strohl, current demographic structures put underprivileged populations at a disadvantage in the school system.
“The critical demand is on improved schooling and on improved inclusion,” Stohl said. “There is always a problem in Washington of demographic segregation and it’s going to be a continual problem to ensure that the affluent voices on school issues still lead to inclusive and positive impacts for the disadvantaged portions of the population.”
Strohl added there are still many issues in the District’s public schools, despite the increased enrollment.
“The school system is in a very weird place because it is being yanked into the present by these demographic changes that are led by a very vocal affluent population that is demanding that the public school system deliver a high quality education, and the school system is going to take awhile to catch up,” Stohl said.
However, Reed highlighted the improvements that have been made in the school system.
“The schools have done better in terms of organization and school facilities,” Reed said. “They have done a really great job improving the central administration and the physical climate of schools and so they look great and those are some really compelling reasons to be in D.C. schools.”
Strohl also emphasized the achievements indicated by the increased enrollment for DCPS.
“Overall it is a sign of strength and it’s a sign of growth,” Strohl said. “I think that growing enrollments show that maybe D.C. public schools have really turned a corner over the last 10 years.”

Czech politician Vit Jedlicka, president of the self-proclaimed Free Republic of Liberland, addressed the issues confronting the micronation he dubbed the world’s freest country to around 25 attendees gathered in Healy Hall Feb. 29.
Jedlicka chronicled Liberland’s legal difficulties since he declared the seven-square-kilometer tract of disputed land between Serbia and Croatia as a sovereign state April 13, 2015.
According to Jedlicka, the densely-forested strip of uninhabited land is a terra nullius – no-man’s-land – which exists because Serbia establishes its boundary along the Danube River, while Croatia maintains borders drawn prior to the formation of Yugoslavia.
Both countries swiftly renounced Jedlicka’s claim, with Croatia deploying police to remove trespassers on the land. Jedlicka, arrested last May for illegally crossing the Croatian border, said there have already been 36 documented instances of Croatian police seizing Liberland supporters exiting through its border, though he estimates many more arrests have occurred without his knowledge.
Liberland’s push for recognition has nevertheless attained support from hundreds of thousands of people who have applied for citizenship on its website, including 300 Washington, D.C. residents.
The state’s rejection of government interference and taxation has resonated with libertarian groups including Georgetown’s Young Americans for Liberty, a student group that advocates personal freedom, a group Jedlicka contacted to organize the event.
Though no government has acknowledged Liberland as a sovereign state so far, over 10 political parties worldwide have endorsed what would be the world’s newest and third-smallest country, trumped only by the Vatican City and Monaco.
Jedlicka said much of Liberland’s appeal stems from frustrations with overregulation in countries like France, which Jedlicka said demands taxes as high as 70 percent of income.
“The great thing about Liberland is that it connects the business community, lawyers, former politicians, venture capital investors, crazy people like myself, everybody. Most of us are anarchists who believe the government can be organized by just market forces” Jedlicka said. “Together we form a new nation which is founded in the belief of liberty and voluntary exchange, which is one of the most important things in our life.”
Jedlicka outlined a vision of Liberland’s future as fraught with legal battles concerning its legitimacy, an issue he plans to take to the Croatian Constitutional Court and potentially appeal in Europe’s human rights courts.
In the meantime, he has assumed leadership of the country by drafting a tentative constitution, vying for investors and meeting with foreign government officials.
Jedlicka’s described his first diplomatic meeting with Prince of Lichtenstein Hans-Adam II on Feb. 27.
“The first thing he told me was how great it would be if we are going to be sitting next to each other at the UN, which shows he is very open-minded to these things,” Jedlicka said.
Liberland’s constitution, drafted in accordance with the state’s motto “To live and let live,” outlines a bill of rights and legislative, executive and judicial branches. Jedlicka said the document expressly prohibits taxation and can only be amended with the unanimous consensus of a legislative assembly.
Despite Liberland’s emphasis on individual rights, Jedlicka abstained from establishing a direct democracy in the constitution, arguing this form of political regime can be dangerous.
“I even said in a high school in Czech Republic, ‘You know, Hitler rose to power through democracy,’ and they said ‘No, this is not possible. You cannot tell this to the kids,’ but this is the reality,” Jedlicka said. “It is a terrible system, where 51 percent can vote to kill the other 49, and that is democracy.”
Jedlicka said the country needs roughly $60,000 to fund its development, including $5,000 for a scholarly summit on April 16 held five miles from Liberland’s proclaimed territory. For each one-dollar donation, investors are ascribed one virtual merit that Jedlicka uses to gauge citizen engagement.
Jedlicka said the territory may form a militia for protection, though he wants the micronation to be maintained through peaceful means.
“I can see us maybe having a militia, and I imagine most people will be voluntarily armed,” Jedlicka said. “But I think to get Liberland we will have to get it through journalists feeling sorry for us, and flowers and also beer.”
Head of Liberland’s U.S. office Tom Walls, who attended the lecture, underscored the state’s mission to be the world’s freest country.
“We are a country where people have the absolute freedom to do as they wish as long as they don’t hurt anyone else,” Walls said. “We are a like-minded group of individual people who exchange goods and service among ourselves, and when it comes to citizenship there is nothing saying you can’t have your own country’s passport along with Liberland’s.”
Young Americans for Liberty Vice President Addie Nix (SFS ’18) said although she views Liberland as a marketing tool for libertarianism more than a feasibly independent nation, she sees its potential as a free trade zone, similar to places like Hong Kong.
“I could see it as this very small but very enterprising place where a lot of business would be based, probably for tax reasons, but, hey, there’s no problem in that,” Nix said. “I don’t know if I’ll be applying for citizenship anytime soon or where this is going to be 20 years from now, but it’s a valiant effort.”
Young Americans for Liberty Treasurer Kevin Chao (COL ’18) said he was initially skeptical of Liberland, but warmed to the idea after Jedlicka’s presentation.
“I’ve heard of all these tiny little states like Somaliland and Western Sahara and all these different border disputes that are mostly just huge spectacles, but here this seems he’s really trying to do something,” Chao said.

MedStar Georgetown University Hospital began installation of Washington, D.C.’s first superconducting synchrocyclotron proton accelerator, which is used in cancer treatment therapy, in February.
The accelerator, which will be effective for use early next year, makes MedStar Georgetown one of only 13 facilities nationwide to offer proton-beam therapy. The therapy targets and destroys cancer cells while avoiding healthy cells in order to increase the cancer-cure rate, reduce treatment side effects and diminish chances of secondary cancer.
“As the only National Cancer Institute/Comprehensive Cancer Center in the Washington area, we will be able to continue our practice of offering the most advanced treatments whether it be chemotherapy, surgery or proton therapy,” Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Director Louis Weiner, who also chairs the Department of Oncology at Georgetown University Medical Center, wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our clinical trials hold the promise of becoming the next major advancement in cancer treatment.”
The accelerator, which weighs 15 tons, was lowered through the roof into the hospital as a part of the $32 million project. The equipment was installed in a 2,675-square-foot, three-level, cast-in-place concrete vault, which will create a nearly 9,000-square-foot proton therapy clinical office suite.
The installation comes almost three years after the hospital announced that it received Certificate of Need approval from the D.C. State Health Planning and Development Agency in 2013.
“The process that MedStar Georgetown University Hospital went through for approval is quite rigorous and involves obtaining a Certificate of Need from the District of Columbia. This is a multi step process that requires demonstration that an expensive new treatment facility serves the public good,” Weiner wrote.
MedStar Georgetown radiation oncologist and department of radiation medicine assistant professor Brian Collins said the therapy will be especially beneficial for younger patients.
“The technology decreases the amount of radiation required to eradicate tumors resulting in reduced acute and chronic toxicity,” Collins wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is important especially in pediatric cancer patients who face a greater risk of developing a secondary cancer due to their total radiation exposure. We know proton therapy carries a decreased risk of a second malignancy when compared with conventional radiation.”
Weiner added that the proton accelerator will allow for a broader scale of treatment and increased convenience for cancer patients.
“To have this therapy available on our campus is a significant benefit, especially for our patients who can have access to the full continuum of care at the same location where they see their oncologist,” Weiner wrote. “Accessing this cutting-edge treatment close to home will be particularly life-changing for our pediatric patients and their families.”
In addition, developments in proton beam treatment could help physicians target and remove a larger swath of tumors.
“Proton therapy is rapidly advancing so we’ll be on the cutting edge. The newest technologies allow for even greater accuracy for delivering proton beams,” Weiner wrote. “For example, when treating a lung tumor, the proton beam must be incredibly accurate so that healthy lung tissue isn’t damaged. But lungs move when people breathe. New technology now allows us to continually track the tumor during treatment while the patient breathes normally. That’s really quite revolutionary.”
Collins said that the benefits of proton therapy far outweigh those of older or more conventional cancer treatments.
“Proton therapy is only focused on the tumor. Therefore, the systemic side-effects are typically minimal leaving the patient feeling well and able to function normally,” Collins wrote. “Most systemic cancer therapies leave patients feeling sick and unproductive for some time following treatment.”
Weiner also emphasized the equipment’s potential research benefits in allowing for clinical studies and collaboration opportunities.
“Until recently in the U.S., there haven’t been enough proton therapy centers and thus not enough patients to conduct the kind of rigorous clinical trials necessary to determine how to best utilize this extremely advanced technology,” Weiner wrote.
Former MedStar Georgetown President Richard Goldberg highlighted the hospital’s accomplishments, which distinguish it from other hospitals in the area, in a press release initially announcing the approval in 2013.
“Lombardi is the only center in the Washington Metropolitan area to earn the National Cancer Institute designation as a comprehensive cancer center which demonstrates MedStar Georgetown’s strength, expertise and multidisciplinary approach to cancer care to both adults and children,” Goldberg said. “Adding this technology to our already rich array of cancer treatments allows us to offer the greatest range of treatment options to patients.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article indicated that Goldberg is the current president of MedStar Georgetown. He is the former president.

Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee spoke on his political career and unsuccessful 2016 presidential bid in an event that kicked off Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service’s “Reflections on Running” speaker series March 2 in Copley Formal Lounge.
GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee moderated the conversation, which about 75 students attended. The Georgetown University College Republicans co-hosted the event.
Elleithee credited GU Politics Advisory Board member S.E. Cupp, a CNN political commentator, for making Huckabee’s visit possible.
“The goal here is pull back the curtain a little bit and talk about the entire journey, not just this specific campaign,” Elleithee said.
The former governor began by joking about being a conservative speaker on a liberal campus.
“When they told me that I was going to speak at Georgetown, I thought, ‘Okay, all the conservative students at Georgetown will be there, at the small table at the Waffle House. It shouldn’t be crowded’,” Huckabee said.
Huckabee then recounted stories about his ascent to the governorship of Arkansas and experience as a Republican in a heavily Democrat state.
“I’m glad we’re going to talk about some of those campaigns, because the most recent one is not the most pleasurable one,” Huckabee said. “I’m glad we’re talking about some successful campaigns from the past.”
Huckabee highlighted the divisive nature of politics in Arkansas at the time, when the balance in the House of Representatives was 89 Democrats to 11 Republicans, and 31 Democrats to four Republicans in the Senate.
“It was a tough environment to be the fourth Republican elected in 150 years to a statewide office,” Huckabee said. “No state in the country had more Democrats and less Republicans than Arkansas. Being elected in that environment, I know what it is like to be on the endangered species list.”
Huckabee also told a story of how the state capitol received him once he was chosen to be lieutenant governor.
“When I was selected lieutenant governor, the door to my office at the capitol was nailed shut, and that was sort of my welcome. It was a very vicious environment. All of the furniture in the office was taken out and the door stayed shut for 51 days,” Huckabee said. “I worked off of an old table in an old vault until there was enough public pressure to get the door changed.”
Huckabee also recalled his 2008 victory in the Iowa Caucuses, when he was reportedly outspent by eventual nominee and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney ten to one. He reaffirmed his defense of Republican frontrunner Donald Trump in light of the controversy over the current presidential candidate’s comments on the Klu Klux Klan, expressing frustration with Republicans who have spoken out against Trump.
GU College Republicans Vice Chair Samantha Granville (COL ’17), who introduced Huckabee, said she particularly enjoyed hearing the former governor’s account of his private experiences during his political campaigns.
“I enjoyed listening and learning about his off-camera time on the campaign trail. While I do not agree with him on several policy issues, I respect him for his commitment to his state and the country,” Granville said.
According to Granville, the audience was polite and respectful, despite her expectations otherwise.
“I was fully expecting there to be protestors at the event,” Granville said. “I have to say that I am very happy by the behavior of Georgetown students during the session.  I recognized many students there who I know wholeheartedly disagree with the governor, but they were very respectful, and I appreciated the openness to different and opposing opinions that they displayed.”
Following the conversation between Huckabee and Elleithee, audience members were given the opportunity ask the governor questions.
Ryan Yoch (COL ’19) asked Huckabee about his support for Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses after the 2015 Supreme Court decision upholding the right to marriage for same-sex couples. Yoch said he did not agree with many of the governor’s positions, but appreciated hearing a coherent perspective directly from the governor.
“I was definitely not a fan of Huckabee going into the event, mostly because of his views regarding gay marriage, but also because he is so far to the right he wants to abolish the IRS,” Yoch said. “But I came out of the event with a much greater appreciation for him as a person and as a public speaker. He has a talent for connecting with audiences quickly and genuinely, even if the audience disagrees with much of what he has to say.”
However, Yoch expressed doubt at the governor’s response to his question.
“I asked about balancing the rights of individuals to marry with the rights of individuals to adhere to their personal convictions,” Yoch said. “He gave me a very political answer without saying much, but it was still interesting to hear what he had to say about personal liberties.”
Jeff Naft (COL ’17) drove the governor to campus and said he greatly appreciated the opportunity to meet Huckabee and the effort GU Politics, also known as the Institute of Policy and Public Service, put into bringing him to campus.
“Getting to personally meet Governor Huckabee was an amazing experience,” Naft said. “Sophie Kim Goldmacher, Hanna Hope, and the rest of the IPPS team did a phenomenal job giving Hoyas an opportunity to learn from someone who has run for President of the United States.”

The third annual OWN IT Summit, which seeks to connect Georgetown students and other young women to female leaders, will take place April 9, featuring speakers including NASA’s Deputy Administrator Dava Newman, MuslimGirl.net founding Editor-in-Chief Amani Alkhat and CBS This Morning co-anchor Norah O’Donnell.
OWN IT consists of individual sessions, divided into three distinct types, each of which caters to different audiences. Topic-based breakout sessions feature discussions with 20 to 40 people, while workshops aim to teach 20 to 40 people a new skill.
Office hours, the smallest sessions at the summit, select 15 attendees for one-on-one conversations with a panelist.
The summit is based on the tenets of promoting leadership, accessibility, affordability, diversity and feminism. OWN IT’s goal is to fill the leadership gap by giving young women a venue to learn from and connect with women who are leaders in a variety of fields.
Founded by Helen Brosnan (COL ’16) and Kendall Ciesemier (COL ‘15), OWN IT’s inaugural summit was held in 2014 and drew over 40 speakers and 400 participants. Attendance to the summit doubled the following year.
The organization has since expanded nationwide to campuses including Boston College, Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Texas-Austin, the University of Southern California, Universidad Interamericana Recinto Metro in Puerto Rico and the University of Pennsylvania.
Past speakers include Peabody and Emmy Award-winning journalist Maria Shriver and Ambassador Melanne Verveer, the first U.S. Ambassador for Global Women’s Issues.
Tickets are available for $20 to Georgetown faculty, student and alumni and $25 to non-Georgetown affiliated attendees.

The Georgetown Running Club and the Georgetown Center for Contemporary Arab Studies will hold the first Nina Brekelmans Memorial Scholarship 5K on Saturday.
Brekelmans passed away in a house fire in her Dupont Circle home on June 3, 2015, after recently graduating with a Master of Arts in Arab studies from Georgetown and receiving a Fulbright grant to research female distance runners in Jordan.
Race Director Mary Grace Pellegrini said the goal of the event is to continue Brekelmans’ legacy.
“After Nina passed, I think there was a desire among the team to contribute to Nina’s legacy, and one of the most tangible ways we felt we could do this was by putting on an event that would not only support a scholarship in her memory but would also be an opportunity to share her story and create a positive event around her life and her accomplishments,” Pellegrini said.
All of the proceeds from the race will be donated to a Georgetown-endowed scholarship fund focused on female empowerment in the Middle East. The fundraising goal for the scholarship is $10,000.
The race, in which Brekelmans’ family will participate, will begin and end on Copley Lawn. Participants will run through Georgetown’s campus and loop around the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Path. Check-in for the race will begin at 7 a.m. and the race will begin at 8 a.m. There will be a recognition ceremony in the Intercultural Center at 9:30 a.m.
Brekelmans competed for Dartmouth in cross country and track, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in Arabic. After coming to Georgetown for graduate school, she became a member of the Georgetown University Running Club.
Brekelmans planned to live and work in the Middle East. In addition to studying Arabic, she interned in the Muslim Chaplaincy while she was at Georgetown and served as treasurer of Georgetown Women in International Affairs.
