A student residence in the 1300 block of 35th Street NW was burglarized Sunday morning.
At 5 a.m., students were woken up by an unknown male who fled the scene after being approached by one of the students, according to a Department of Public Safety alert.
The doors were not locked and there were no signs of forced entry, but nothing appears to have been stolen.
The male is described as being 5 ft. 9 in. to 6 ft. tall, heavyset, of indeterminate race and wearing a black ski mask and dark blue checker shirt.
The Metropolitan Police Department responded to the incident.
