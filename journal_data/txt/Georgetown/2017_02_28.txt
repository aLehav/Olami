The suspect accused of kidnapping a Georgetown University student three blocks from campus has been arrested in Seattle, Wash., according to local media outlets.
NBC4 Washington has named the suspect as Paolo Aldorasi, 34, of London, England, and said he will face a federal kidnapping charge.
The Georgetown University Police Department confirmed the arrest of the suspect in a campuswide email this afternoon.
“We are grateful for the hard work of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, the FBI, and other law enforcement agencies that led to the arrest of the suspect,” the email reads. “GUPD will continue to work with law enforcement partners to ensure that the campus and surrounding community remains a safe place for students, faculty, and staff.”
According to the Metropolitan Police Department, at around 3:20 p.m. on Jan. 26, the suspect forced the unidentified student into a light gray or silver sport utility vehicle outside of Saxby’s coffee shop. Then, the suspect drove the victim to several stores and ATMs and tried to force the victim to make large purchases or withdraw money.
The victim was released unharmed and MPD released video and images of the suspect.
Due to a communication lapse between the MPD and GUPD, the Georgetown community was not notified of the kidnapping until about 20 hours after it occurred. MPD was aware of the incident the afternoon that it occurred; however, GUPD did not know of it until late the following morning.
This article will be updated as more information is made available.

Students of Georgetown, Inc. is planning to move Uncommon Grounds, its oldest coffee shop, from Sellinger Lounge to within the university bookstore on the second floor of the Leavey Center.
The relocation, which is scheduled to be completed by Aug. 15, marks the first partnership between Barnes & Noble, the university’s new bookstore vendor, and a non-Starbucks company, according to The Corp’s incoming President and CEO Melina Hsiao (COL ’18).
The new storefront will serve as an entrance to the bookstore from the esplanade and will include an outdoor seating area on the esplanade level of the Leavey Center.
The blueprints and mockups for the new Uncommon Grounds show a rectangular space with doors leading into the second floor of Barnes & Noble and a staircase to the new location and seating areas.
According to Hsiao, the new location will feature more study space and a seating area, making the under-utilized esplanade more accessible to students.
“Moving upstairs into a new space gives us an opportunity to really revamp and rebrand what Uncommon Grounds is,” Hsiao said.
Hsiao said the move is significant for both The Corp and Barnes & Noble.
“Doing the partnership with Barnes & Noble is a really big thing for us, it’s a really big deal for Barnes & Noble as well,” Hsiao said. “We’re doing it in-house, so it’s the first time with a student-run business.”
Barnes & Noble College Regional Manager Chris Colbert said the company is optimistic about this new venture.
“We are thrilled that The Corp will begin operating the Uncommon Grounds cafe inside the Georgetown Bookstore this summer. The Corp is an exceptional organization that is similarly dedicated to supporting and creating opportunities for Georgetown students to succeed both in and out of the classroom,” Colbert wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The university announced Barnes & Noble as the new vendor for its bookstore last April, replacing its current vendor, Follett.
After the renovation, the current location of Uncommon Grounds will become additional space in Sellinger Lounge.
According to The Corp’s incoming Chief Financial Officer Jared D’Sa (COL ’19), the move, which is entirely financed by The Corp, will be a large but rewarding investment.
“Though it is clearly a large initial investment, we believe that Uncommon Grounds will be profitable and help propel the company forward in the new year by reaching out to new parts of the Georgetown community,” D’Sa wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Furthermore, I think this gives us a great opportunity to perfect our operations and truly embody our motto of ‘students serving students.’”
D’Sa did not provide exact figures on how much it plans to invest.
Uncommon Grounds is planning to operate normal hours through Senior Week from May 13 to May 18, and will be closed over the summer for renovations before planning to reopen in September 2017, according to a press release sent to The Hoya. The coffeehouse will also likely change its hours after the relocation.
Uncommon Grounds Director Leia Idliby (COL ’18) said although the staff will miss the current location, the move is necessary.
“We love the current space, and we have a lot of memories there, but this is overall an extremely positive move,” Idliby wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s time for us to move, and the best part is that we’re still going to be the same Uncommon Grounds, just a floor up.”

The children had been pulled out of school. Belongings were stuffed into four suitcases and the long flights were booked. After fleeing conflict in Syria and finding brief refuge in Erbil, Iraq, the family — mother, father and six children ranging from seven months to 12 years old — was ready for its new start. On Feb. 6, following years of screening and a long-awaited green light to enter as refugees, they would land in Washington, D.C.
The president of the United States had different plans.
The now-infamous “travel ban” executive order, signed Jan. 27, blocked all refugees from entering the United States, placing this family — and thousands of others — in limbo. Over 6,000 miles away, its sponsoring community, the Holy Trinity parish in Georgetown, scrambled to respond, drawing up contingency plans and lobbying to permit the family’s entry.
Four weeks later, the fallout settled into a happy ending. A federal judge overturned the ban, and the family — whose name is withheld at Holy Trinity’s request to protect its safety and privacy — safely arrived in Virginia on Feb. 16, beginning the task of adjusting to its new home.
However, as the White House plans to release an updated executive order to replicate the ban this week, these family members may be the rare lucky ones. Their story provides a look into the grueling refugee admission process and the desperate uncertainty provoked by the ban, but it also demonstrates the ability of a robust civil society to inspire change in a democracy.
A POPE’S CALL
Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, more than 450,000 people have died. The war has displaced more than 12 million people from their homes, and about 5 million have left the country as refugees.
While neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan house the vast majority of refugees, the extent of the crisis has spilled into Europe and the United States. Concern peaked in summer 2015, particularly when the picture of a drowned Syrian child washed ashore on a Turkish beach featured across the front pages of most major newspapers.
In this fervor, Pope Francis delivered a call to Catholics, asking “every” religious community and parish to take in one refugee family, according to The Washington Post in September 2015.
“Give them a concrete hope,” the pope said in a speech to a crowd gathered in Vatican City last September.
A PARISH’S RESPONSE
At the corner of 36th and N streets NW, the parish of Holy Trinity Catholic Church heard its fellow Jesuit’s appeal.
“I’ve been really moved since the beginning of Pope Francis’ papacy,” Chris Crawford, a parishioner and one of two coordinators of the family’s resettlement effort, said. “We’re called to accompany people in need; not just provide for them, but to be with them.”
A few families in the community contacted Kate Tromble, the parish’s pastoral associate for social justice, who began contacting organizations to orchestrate a response. By summer 2016, the parish found Lutheran Social Services, one of nine resettlement agencies in the United States, and its Good Neighbor program, which allows communities to provide support to refugee families throughout the first year of their arrival in the United States.
“We had a huge response [from our community] and just started organizing from there,” said Lauren Roy, the other coordinator of the resettlement effort. “We picked the highest level [of assistance], which is housing the family and providing 12 months of support, housing, furnishings – everything they need to get started.”
The parish did not know when exactly a family would be assigned to them, but they would have a month’s notice. In preparation, more than 100 volunteers pitched in, organizing themselves into seven teams to provide for needs from transportation to housing to employment.
In early January, they received a call from Lutheran Social Services. The family was ready. But, while Holy Trinity had been preparing for a family of four, this one was larger.
“Six children and mom and dad, and dad has a disability,” Roy said. “They knew it was a big ask, but our team leadership overwhelmingly came back with support. This is our family, and we said, ‘Yes.’”
A GOVERNMENT’S APPROVAL
On the other side of the planet, the family had successfully passed a strenuous application process.
After a refugee family is registered by the United Nations Refugee Agency and referred to the U.S. Department of State, it then undergoes a series of security checks by major law enforcement and intelligence agencies, in-person interviews, biometric checks, a cultural orientation and a final medical check. The process from registration with UNHCR to final approval usually takes 18 to 24 months.
While there are currently 21.3 million refugees in the world, according to UNHCR, the United States caps its annual refugee intake at 110,000 refugees. In the past four months, about 10,000 have been approved from Iraq and Syria.
One of those was the eight-member family sponsored by Holy Trinity. Then came the travel ban.
A PRESIDENT’S BAN
“We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and deeply love our people,” Trump said during the signing ceremony for an executive order that, among other restrictions, indefinitely suspended the Syrian refugee program.
The family had passed every screening and interview, but, in a sudden late-Friday move, it was stranded. It soon became clear that Holy Trinity’s welcoming ceremony Feb. 6 would have no one to welcome.
“We had to quickly prepare for a plan B,” said Fr. Kevin Gillespie, S.J., the pastor at Holy Trinity.
More accurately, plans B, C and D. On the night of Feb. 6, what would have been a celebratory Mass instead turned into a vigil for the family. Earlier in the day, children from the Holy Trinity school — from four to 14 years old — marched through the Georgetown neighborhood, including on university grounds, singing songs and holding signs to support refugees and immigrants.
The next day, 10 adult parishioners — some of whom work for government agencies — attended meetings on Capitol Hill to lobby members of Congress, including Senators Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ben Cardin (R-Md.) and Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.).
“We just laid out the story about how this impacts not only these families but also religious organizations who accompany these families when they come here,” Roy said. “People took the day off work to come together and tell those stories.”
In case the ban was upheld, the parish contacted Lutheran Social Services to find a possible backup country for the family, exploring options in Canada and Afghanistan.
“It was a really sad few days,” Crawford said. “We really felt like we were not going to have this family get here.”
Then, news from across the country: The ban had been temporarily struck down nationally by Judge James Robart (LAW ’73) in the state of Washington on Feb. 4, a decision that was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Feb. 9. Travel was possible once more.
“We were counting the hours and days to get them on that plane,” Gillespie said.
In Erbil, the family took off, stopping over in Amman, Jordan, before arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, where the family went through customs.
“We actually have parishioners who had a law firm in New York City that sent two young lawyers to spy on the arrivals terminal to know that they were able to walk through,” Roy said.
At 11:25 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 16, after 30 hours of travel, weeks of stress and unthinkable months of struggle, the family members landed at Dulles International Airport. Holy Trinity parishioners were there to greet them, and their new life was ready to begin.
A FAMILY’S NEW START
Over the next 12 months, Holy Trinity plans to support the family throughout its adjustment: excursions to the grocery store, meals, explanation of the electronic benefits card provided by the government, transportation to any appointment, English as a second language classes and networks to find employment.
For now, though, the family, which communicates with parishioners through WhatsApp and Google Translate, is resting with a “great sense of peace and joy,” Gillespie said.
“They really can’t believe it,” Crawford said. “They’ve compared [the experience] to being in hell and now being in paradise.”
Currently, they are residing for free in an Airbnb for two weeks through Airbnb’s refugee program as they wait to move into their new house in Virginia. Their lease begins March 1 — Ash Wednesday.
“This is a real interfaith effort for us. It is a Muslim family being processed by Lutheran Social Services with a Catholic parish, and we’re getting potential support from a Jewish temple,” Gillespie said. “There’s a lot of fear in the culture now. And one of the ways to combat fear is with faith and justice, working together.”
After hearing the story, other parishes have gotten in contact about organizing similar efforts; Georgetown University students, through the advocacy group Heed the Call, launched a petition last week for the university to sponsor a family. A well-organized and flexible group is indispensable for resettlement agencies, according to Foy.
“They are processing hundreds of refugees from all over the world,” Roy said of the resettlement agencies. “They can process more if they have more help and volunteer work.”
How many refugees will be allowed into the United States remains an open question. According to POLITICO, the Trump administration is expected to sign a new executive order this week leaving open the Syrian refugee program but increasing the stringency of an already rigorous vetting process.
The overwhelming response to the original travel ban demonstrated the capacity of civil society to organize in response to perceived injustice from its government. At a smaller level, the efforts of Holy Trinity showed something similar.
“It’s the beginning of a new chapter in the family’s lives,” Fr. Gillespie said. “Through them we’re learning so much of how we’re part of a response — a small response but a significant one, nevertheless.”
Correction: This article previously misspelled the name of one of the resettlement coordinators. Her last name is Roy, not Foy.

The university plans to launch a general Student Health/Wellness Advisory Board in the fall semester to replace the Mental Health Advisory Board, which shut down in January, causing some student mental health advocates to raise concerns about the future of mental health policy on campus.
The new advisory board will be responsible for handling mental health issues, in addition to physical health and other concerns related to overall student wellness.
The composition of the board has not yet been decided.
The Mental Health Advisory Board held its final meeting in late January to provide suggestions for the new board and its future members. The board was chartered in fall 2015 by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson to explore and address policy for mental health issues on campus.
Assistant Vice President for Student Health Vincent WinklerPrins, who will lead the new board, said the MHAB was always meant to be a temporary committee addressing key mental health concerns. The new board will exist indefinitely, he said, and will be able to address the matter of student wellness more holistically.
“It was never the intent to have the MHAB exist indefinitely,” WinklerPrins wrote in an email to The Hoya. “My focus is on student health and wellness comprehensively. Siloed discussions of physiologic health versus mental health or wellness are sometimes useful but I believe that a forum for more comprehensive thinking will be beneficial.”
Olson said the MHAB effectively completed its goals over its two year charter.
“The Mental Health Advisory Board has done great work, and helped set the context for important improvements in CAPS and in our work with mental health issues overall,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am grateful for all their work.”
The MHAB advised Emeritus Director of the University of Delaware Counseling Center Dr. John Bishop in his report on Georgetown’s medical leave of absence process, which called for changes including increasing communication between students on an medical leave of absence and the university and increasing training for university staff.
Former student members of the MHAB, which included eight students and eight administrators, have expressed support for the change, although some raised concerns about the future of campus mental health policy with no advisory board dedicated to the issue.
Former MHAB co-chair Ben Johnson (NHS ’17) said the new board could decrease the attention and resources dedicated to mental health concerns by the administration.
“Something that mental health has always struggled with is being mentioned in the same sentence with physical health and being taken with the same seriousness,” Johnson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I only hope that the new board will not decrease resources and attention being paid to mental health on campus as it gets mixed in with the many other topics that fall under student health.”
Project Lighthouse Executive Director Will Emery (COL ’19), who formerly co-chaired the MHAB, said the shuttering of the board will leave a gap in mental health advocacy to be filled by students, particularly the Georgetown University Student Association.
“In the absence of the Mental Health Advisory Board, it’s really the responsibility of the Student Association to really pick up the slack. It’s important that we in the Student Association recognize that there will now be more of a challenge advocating for mental health,” Emery said. “And we will rise to that challenge to ensure that students with disabilities continue to be represented within administrative conversations and within administrative advocacy.”
These challenges notwithstanding, Emery said he supports the transition to a more general approach to student health as a validation of the MHAB’s success.
“While it’s disappointing that we no longer have an administrative board focused on mental health, I think that really it’s a point of reflection in that we accomplished our goals,” Emery said. “There is of course still a lot of work to be done, but now the work that needs to be done needs to be done on a holistic level.”
GUSA Mental Health Policy Team Chair Sylvia Levy (SFS ’18) praised the success of the MHAB, though she said there is still work to be done.
“There is still progress to be made on issues of student wellness and mental health, particularly around cultural competency and staff diversity,” Levy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Mental Health Advisory Board was successful in forming critical relationships between students, administrators, and staff, which will be invaluable as we continue to work to change policies, and improve campus resource awareness and access.”

Frankie Capers, who has served as a cashier at Einstein Bros. Bagels stores on campus for three years, would be turning 57 tomorrow — if tomorrow were Feb. 29.
Even though Capers will have to wait another three years for her official birthday, Unsung Heroes intends to gift her the present of her dreams well in advance.
Unsung Heroes, which recently announced plans to expand to 10 college campuses across the United States by the end of March, set up an online fund through GoFundMe today to finance a trip for Capers and her grandson to visit Disney World.
The trip would be Capers’ first formal vacation in more than 12 years. After a lengthy period of service in the Navy, Capers was forced to leave in order to take care of her mother, who developed Alzheimer’s disease. Her father, too, soon fell ill.
“After I took care of my mom for 12 years, then my dad got sick also. I was flying back from Washington, D.C., to Memphis, Tenn., to North Carolina, to take care of the sick and elderly people. So, that’s what I do, and I’ve never had a vacation,” Capers said. “I’ve never had a vacation in 12 or 13 years.”
Capers’ life fell into a downward spiral. She lost both her parents, fell into debt after being unemployed for a prolonged period of time and separated from her husband. It was her unmovable faith that inspired her to walk on.
“I thought I would commit suicide, when me and my husband separated, but God didn’t see it. And it made me stronger, after that, to see that God was holding me up no matter what,” Capers said.
This belief has provided a constant source of optimism for Capers.
“When I didn’t work for the summer, and didn’t know who was going to pay my bills, or when I took care of my mom for 12 years and I didn’t work for those 12 because she had Alzheimer’s. All the money was gone, and I had no help from nowhere,” Capers said. “I trusted and believed in God, and he’s seen me through, even though I didn’t think I had enough, but what I did have is him stay in me.”
Capers arrived at Georgetown three years ago when her sister, who worked at the university at the time, suggested she look for a job. She has worked at Einstein Bros. Bagels ever since.
“I love the community of Georgetown. It’s a lot of energy with you all. I just love you, every day you make my day,” Capers said. “If it weren’t for you all, I wouldn’t be here, so I just love Georgetown students. You all are my babies, that’s what I call you: my babies, away from home.”
Students who enter the Einstein’s in Car Barn are inevitably greeted by Capers’ warm enthusiasm.
“I tell all of you all when you come in to Einstein’s, ‘Have a great day,’ ‘Good morning,’ just to make your day,” Capers said. “You never know what will make another person’s day. When I see a different face, or frown on their face, I come from ‘round the register and just hug them. And they say, ‘How do you know?’”
Just as Capers looks to motivate students, she is also motivated by them.
“As much as I encourage the students, you all encourage me also to keep my day going,” Capers said. “Just a smile, a smile can just brighten my day up, because standing behind that register every day is not great, sometimes I don’t have a great day, but I do when I just see you all coming in and just smile at me, and I give a smile back.”
Capers’ faith extends beyond the Georgetown community. A minister at New Samaritan Baptist Church, Capers picks up students on Sunday mornings and spends the day’s services with them.
“That touches my heart,” Capers said. “Now, that is the greatest thing of all, to lead somebody to Christ.”
Capers emphasized her belief in a life grounded in faith and a commitment to the good of others.
“I live by integrity. To trust in the Lord, and leave that to thy own understanding, acknowledge him in all thy ways, and He shall direct your path,” Capers said. “As long as God give me the strength to, I keep going, even though my body tired, my feet hurting, but I’m still good with it.”
Capers said she envisions herself owning a funeral home in the future in order to provide families in need with accessible services and spiritual counsel.
“I just love people, and it doesn’t matter about the color of your skin. It’s that we are all people and we are all God’s people, so I would love to own my own business where I can help somebody else,” Capers said. “So if I’m not at Einstein’s, I would love to just own a funeral home, where I can help people in need at all times.”
Despite her ambition, Capers lives life day by day, her faith in God’s word and will unshaken.
“I’m just waiting on another miracle, that’s all, to see what God will do next,” Capers said. “’Cause everything I do I try to do it in faith, in Jesus’s name, not me, I try to walk the right way and do the right things at all times.”

The address to the joint session of Congress will be President Donald Trump’s opportunity to extend an olive branch to democrats, according to two former presidential speechwriters speaking at a Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy Institute of Politics and Public Service event yesterday afternoon.
On the eve of Trump’s address, former presidential speechwriters reflected on their time crafting speeches heard by the nation, as well as discussing how Trump could successfully speak to the American people.
Former President Barack Obama’s White House Director of Speechwriting Cody Keenan joined Marc Thiessen, the White House chief speechwriter for former President George W. Bush, at the event in Old North entitled “Channeling the President: A Conversation on Presidential Speechwriting.”
The two spoke about their experiences preparing addresses for former chief executives and discussed the prospects of Trump’s first address to a joint session, which will take place today at 9 p.m.
Robert Schlesinger, the managing opinion editor at U.S. News & World Report, moderated the discussion.
Keenan, who began his career as a campaign intern and rose to director of speechwriting in 2013, said the State of the Union speechwriting process for Obama usually began around Thanksgiving, when the president and his speechwriters would brainstorm what elements and ideas a perfect speech would include.
Though State of the Union addresses typically occur around this time of year, Trump’s speech will not be categorized as a State of the Union address, which tend to occur when a president is a year into his term.
In a statement released Monday, the White House said the president plans to outline his vision for the future of the country.
The State of the Union speechwriting timeline included research beginning in December, while the actual wording of the speech materialized over Christmas break, Keenan said. The final iteration of the speech would be finalized the day of the address.
“This was probably the most annoying moment of the whole process,” Keenan said. “Tonight would be the part where it’s pretty much done, I would probably only start sharing it with a broad group of staff and with the agencies maybe two or three days before, so at this point now I have to compile everyone’s edits.”
Thiessen, who is a contributor for FOX News and was named one of the 100 most influential conservatives in America by The Daily Telegraph in 2010, said that Bush’s speechwriters stressed teamwork and getting a finished product early in the game so Bush would have sufficient time for delivery practice.
Thiessen said the difficulty of the State of the Union address is maintaining a coherent theme throughout the speech while addressing the concerns of various agencies and keeping the president’s priorities at the core.
“The State of the Union Address is the single most watched speech by the President of the United States, but it is also, unless it’s done really well, the worst speech the president gives, because it is by definition a laundry list of policy initiatives,” Thiessen said.
Thiessen said that as viewership of the State of the Union address decreases year to year, Trump must utilize this venue to communicate his message for the rest of his administration right out of the gate.
“This is probably the most people Donald Trump will be speaking to in his Presidency,” Thiessen said. “He should think of this as an hour-long tweet where he can speak directly to the American people, over the heads of the fake news media.”
Thiessen said this is an opportunity for Trump to mold the minds of those still unconvinced about his policies.
“He can speak not just to his followers, but to those Americans who are still trying to decide what to think of him,” Thiessen said. “He’s got a chance to reach those people who are still deciding where the clay is still soft and he can make an impression.”
Keenan echoed Thiessen’s point that this speech has the capability to sway those who are not otherwise particularly invested in politics.
“This is your biggest opportunity, this is your biggest stage,” Keenan said. “People tune into this, this is your one chance to speak to people who might otherwise not listen to you and might tune you out year after year after year after year.”
This speech also presents itself as an opportunity to put the opposition in a difficult position, according to Thiessen. By extending an olive branch to the democrats, Trump can either initiate bipartisanship or frame the democrat’s refusal to work with him as the reason behind any of his administration’s failures.
“The Democratic Party right now is in a miasma of anger over Donald Trump,” Thiessen said. “What’s the way to harness that? It’s to reach out his hand to the other party and say, ‘I want to make America great again’, and lay out his vision, a positive vision, unlike the one in his Inaugural Address.”
Trump could show an effort to sow bipartisanship by saying he is willing to work together to reform the Affordable Care Act, which he has promised to repeal and replace, and retain the best ideas from both sides of the aisle, according to Thiessen.
“When he is now the least popular incoming president in American history, you have a limited amount of time to shore that up,” Keenan said. “To show people you actually have plans.”

Georgetown University Student Association President-elect Kamar Mack (COL ’19) will be the first sophomore to serve as president since 2009 when he is inaugurated March 18. In addition, his running mate, GUSA Vice President-elect Jessica Andino (COL ’18) will be the third member of the Georgetown Scholarship Program to serve as an executive officer upon entering office next month.
Before Mack, the last sophomore president in GUSA history was Calen Angert (MSB ’11). Angert and his vice president, Jason Kluger (MSB ’11), who was also a sophomore when they were first elected, served two terms. Before Angert, there have been at least three other sophomore presidents.
Mack said the grade difference will not affect what GUSA can achieve.
“I really appreciate the student body for rallying around our vision and having faith in both me and Jessica. Knowing that with our passion and our excitement to work hand in hand with the student body, the fact that I am a sophomore would not inhibit the work that GUSA needs to do,” Mack said.
Andino follows former Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) and current Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) as the third GSP executive.
According to Andino, as a member of GSP, she understands the importance of making the Georgetown experience more affordable.
“That speaks to how much it doesn’t matter where students start, but it’s the journey they go through during their college experience and how much GSP students care about the university and making it a better place for future students,” Andino said.
Maura McDonough (COL ’18) said having someone from GSP in the executive is important for helping the organization better reflect the diversity of Georgetown’s student population.
“It shows that people want other input in the student body,” McDonough said. “It helps GUSA a lot, too. GUSA has an insular culture so it shows that there’s this need to address that.”
The candidates’ backgrounds translate to their initial policy initiatives. Mack and Andino want to focus on affordability.
“If you look at our affordability plan from the campaign, a lot of it was data-centered, so we have a plan for creating what, for lack of better words, will be GUSA’s R&D,” Mack said. “So doing cost-benefit analyses, engaging with groups like Office of Sustainability and fundamentally doing the grunt work of identifying ways we students can save the university money.”
Correction: An earlier version of this earlier stated that Mack would serve as the second sophomore president in GUSA history. He is the second since Calen Angert in 2009; there have been at least three other sophomore presidents since 1998.

Fifteen law professors from across the country, including two from the Georgetown University Law Center, signed a letter sent to the Washington, D.C. Court of Appeals’ Office of Disciplinary Counsel Feb. 20 to file a professional misconduct complaint against Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump.
The law professors cite multiple incidents in which Conway’s public actions have suggested “an inability to fulfill the professional role of lawyers.” These incidents include appearances on network television news shows citing a fictitious terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Ky., claims of supposed immigration bans the Obama administration implemented and her endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s fashion line in interviews with members of the press.
The letter argues that Conway, who graduated from The George Washington University Law School in 1992 and was admitted to the D.C. Bar Association in 1995, violated the association’s rule that lawyers not engage in any public activity of “dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.”
Conway is currently suspended from the association for nonpayment of dues.
Law Center professor Abbe Smith, who signed the letter and whose stationary the letter was sent, said although the rule is interpreted broadly, lawyers should work to maintain professional standards.
“We believe in the integrity of the legal profession,” Smith said. “That, coupled with repeated, clearly intentional falsehoods by high-ranking members of the administration who are lawyers, got us to thinking that there are rules that every member of the legal profession must comply with, and they apply to public office holders as well.”
William Montross, a visiting professor at the University of the District of Columbia’s David A. Clarke School of Law who signed the letter, wrote in an email to The Hoya that the immediate goal of the letter is to request that the District Bar Association conduct an investigation and, depending on its findings, sanction Conway.
“In the face of mendacity and falsehood by lawyers, there is legal recourse. When a public official lies, the opportunity to address that lie rests in a contested election that may not be held for years,” Montross wrote. “But when a lawyer lies, immediate redress is possible because the profession views truth as a principal value.”
Smith said the signees also wanted to inspire other lawyers and law professors to hold lawyers who have membership in bar associations, including those in the Trump administration, accountable to the profession’s ethical standards.
“The current administration has lawyers who hold positions of authority,” Smith said. “There is a handful of lawyers, there aren’t that many, but there is a handful, and we’re hoping that now they’ll be a little more responsible and a little more mindful of the responsibilities of the legal profession. So, maybe it’ll be contagious.”
Montross said that as a professor, it is especially important to outline Conway’s errors as a signal to students entering the law profession.
“We spend so much time and so much effort — as law professors — teaching people entering this profession that there are serious ethical and professional responsibilities in our field,” Montross wrote. “It is shameful when a member of the bar repeatedly stands before the national media and openly misrepresents. So the impetus for my participation in this letter was simple: When you are a lawyer, the truth matters; if the truth does not matter to you, don’t be a lawyer.”
Montross said the role of professors is to model behavior for future lawyers and part of this job entails checking other members of the profession.
“Professors and academics model appropriate behavior to those whom we teach,” Montrose wrote. “It would be odd, to say the least, for law professors to repeatedly preach ethics and responsibilities to our students and, yet, do nothing when one of our colleagues in the bar violates the most basic of professional responsibilities.”

Said professors while the Clintons broke every ethics law known to mankind and then some were conspicuously silent. One wonders why.

So the claim is she violated the rule that lawyers not engage in any “public activity” of dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. And how would they respond to the “private activity” of dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation that lawyers engage in every day. How would lawyers make that distinction? Of all the bi-pedal carbon based life forms on the planet, lawyers are the last that should be questioning ethical conduct. If you want to know how absurd the lawyers oath is, go to this ABA link; they can’t even agree on one oath; they’ve got one for every group that is different and self-serving. https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/resources/professionalism/professionalism_codes.html
