Full-time non-tenure-line faculty will be eligible for expanded parental leave, effective immediately, Georgetown University announced Thursday night.
The announcement comes after petitions from both faculty and students supporting the measure. Last month, 282 individuals signed a petition for equal parental leave for both tenured and full-time non-tenure-line faculty.
Before the university expanded leave, tenure-line faculty members were entitled to paid semesterlong maternal and paternal leave, while full-time non-tenure-line faculty members were entitled to eight weeks of paid maternity leave under a “short-term disability” classification.
“I am pleased to report that effective immediately Full Time Non-tenure Line Faculty (FTNTL) on the Main Campus who will be the primary caregiver of a child (who is in the first year of life or newly homed child of five or younger) will be eligible for New Parent Leave,” Provost Robert Groves wrote in an email to the faculty Thursday afternoon.
More details about the policy expansion are set to be released in the coming days, according to Groves.
Professor Astrid Weigert, chair of the Joint Main Campus Committee on Full-Time Non-Tenure Line Issues, delivered the petition to University Vice President and Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara on Oct. 12. The committee requested that the “issue be resolved” by the end of the semester, according to Weigert.
Student activism followed the faculty petition: Representatives from the Georgetown University Student Association, Georgetown Solidarity Committee, the Academic Councils of all four of Georgetown’s undergraduate schools and H*yas for Choice delivered a resolution to Ferrara in support of expanded parental leave for full-time non-tenure-line faculty members Thursday morning.
A university announcement came less than a day later.
Weigert anticipated that the GUSA resolution and other student support would exert more pressure on the university to respond to the petition delivered to Ferrara last month.
“I was very, very grateful that it was not just GUSA and that GUSA’s involvement and support created more support from other student groups,” Weigert said.
GUSA senate Vice Speaker Patrick Walsh (SFS ’21) and senator Logan Arkema (COL ’20) introduced a resolution to the senate in support of the faculty’s petition.
“We stood in solidarity with those advocating for non-tenure-line issues, especially Dr. Weigert, and this victory is a remarkable one,” Walsh said in an interview with The Hoya.
The parental leave discrepancy has been raised at the faculty town hall meeting each of the past four years and faculty senate meetings before the Benefits Advisory Committee, which advises on university employee benefit plans, drafted a petition.
“Every time, we got the reply, ‘We are working on it,’ but nothing happened,” Weigert said. “We needed to show that there is really a very strong support for this petition among faculty.”
Full-time tenure-line faculty’s responsibilities include teaching, research and university service, while non-tenure-line faculty’s responsibilities include teaching and research, and sometimes service, according to the Faculty Handbook. Before these distinctions were defined in 2001, non-tenure-line faculty members were considered “visiting” professors.
Though student activism played its part in Thursday’s announcement, Walsh said the efforts to push for equal parental leave have been in the works for longer than many current students may immediately understand.
“While the resolution and student activism provided more pressure for the University to rectify this policy, we cannot forget the faculty and student voices that have been working on parental leave equity for the last few years,” Walsh wrote in an email to The Hoya, after the university’s Thursday announcement.
The GUSA resolution called for the expansion of the current tenure-line parental leave policy to apply to all full-time non-tenure-line faculty regardless of gender or “instances of adoption.” The resolution was unanimously approved by the GUSA senate Nov. 4.
When full-time non-tenure-line faculty members were limited to eight weeks of maternity leave, the disparity forced students to adjust to a replacement faculty member midsemester, according to College Academic Council Vice President Casey Doherty (COL ’20).
The practice of eight-weeklong parental leave for full-time non-tenure-line faculty was “not conducive to the academic environment,” Doherty wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The resolution’s success shows the benefits of student-faculty collaboration, according to a Georgetown Solidarity Committee spokesperson.
“This campaign has demonstrated how one of the most effective ways to create change at Georgetown is when students and workers unite in solidarity with one another,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Forty-nine students formed Students Taking Action Against Interpersonal Violence to advocate against sexual misconduct on campus and to create a campus advocacy space that was not previously organized or feasible through official student organizations.
The group, not formally recognized by the university, focuses on advocacy against sexual misconduct, and pursues a more specific mission than other organizations, such as the Georgetown University Student Association, according to STAIV member and Georgetown University Student Association Sexual Assault and Student Safety Policy Chair Grace Perret (COL ’20).
“The point is that there’s no one space that’s taking this issue and saying, ‘This is the main thing that we focus on,’” Perret said. “I think GUSA can help support those students, and I intend to in my role … But at the same time, I think the university tends to respond best when there is widespread student engagement around an issue.”
After sending an open letter to university administrators Aug. 31 demanding action and transparency about the yet-unfilled post of a Title IX coordinator, Daria Crawford (COL ’20), Avery Moje (COL ’19), Kore Stuer (COL, ’19), Andy Turner (SFS ’20) and Susu Zhao (COL ’19) decided forming a large, organized group would allow them to expand their advocacy efforts.
STAIV’s four meetings this semester have produced a number of priorities for the group. Those priorities include addressing changes to Obama-era Title IX rules about how universities should address allegations of on-campus sexual assault due as early as this week; advocating for sexual assault response training for the Georgetown University Police Department; and ensuring completion of recommendations made by the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Taskforce.
The group formed in response to recent events, such as the allegations of sexual assault Christine Blasey Ford levied against then-nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, according to Perret.
“I think the events of this semester made the need for a group like STAIV seem all the more urgent,” Perret wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Many new students were motivated to join because of national and on-campus incidents that occurred this semester, such as the resignation of former GUSA president Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) amid sexual misconduct allegations. No complaints had been filed against Nair through the Title IX office or the Office of Student Conduct, he wrote in a May 28 email to The Hoya. A university spokesperson confirmed that, as of May 2019, Nair was not the subject of any complaints through either office nor had he been found responsible for any violations of the Student Code of Conduct.
“There are definitely some freshmen and sophomores who have heard about what’s been going on,” Perret wrote. “This semester began with the resignation of the GUSA president, with Kavanaugh, we’re in the Me Too moment.”
STAIV’s status as an unrecognized group allows its members to engage in activism on issues related to sexual misconduct, which is not the purpose of existing official student organizations that address sexual misconduct, according to Moje, a Sexual Assault Peer Educator and Bringing in the Bystander facilitator.
“SAPE and these other organizations on campus are limited in what we can do in terms of asking the university to make some changes in how the climate of the university functions and how the policies of the university are put in place,” Moje said. “That’s much more the student activism area, and something that, even though we’re involved in SAPE, something we can’t do through SAPE.”
The group started meeting in early October, with varying but growing levels of attendance. The group runs meetings democratically, by setting the agenda as a group and electing an attendee to lead.
Broadening the group to to include freshmen is intended to sustain its activism even after involved seniors graduate, Moje said.
Students involved in STAIV learned about the organization through word-of-mouth, mostly through organizations on campus that address sexual misconduct, according to Perret. Many members have concurrent involvement in H*yas for Choice, the women’s and gender studies program, SAPE or Women in Faith.
A goal is to include more men in the group, Moje said.
Zhao echoed Moje’s sentiment and hopes to engage communities that may otherwise have less involvement in their advocacy efforts.
“I hope that STAIV continues to grow and engage communities on campus, particularly those that are traditionally excluded from anti-sexual violence movements,” Zhao wrote in an email to The Hoya.
With the Education Department’s upcoming release of a new rule, replacing former President Barack Obama’s guidance, Perret urged the university to communicate to students how the rule will affect its policies and to express their support of survivors.
“STAIV is definitely one of many groups, but we’re trying to bring together organizations on campus and individuals on campus who are invested in pushing the university to make a comment and stand with survivors,” Perret wrote.
This article was updated July 2 to indicate the absence of Title IX or Office of Student Conduct complaints against Nair and to include comment from Nair.

Elevators in Reynolds Hall and Darnall Hall are plagued by persistent malfunctions, as they have fallen between floors and students have been stuck inside them, according to multiple residents of these halls.
Students concerned for their safety have questioned whether the Georgetown University Office of Planning and Facilities Management has adequately addressed these complaints.
Two elevators in residential halls were out of service for repairs in the past two months, according to interim Vice President of Planning and Facilities Management Greg Simmons. Facilities also responded to about 29 minor work requests related to elevators during this time, such as light bulb replacements, Simmons wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Students in Darnall have been experiencing malfunctioning elevators since the beginning of the semester, according to Jack Feingold (MSB ’22).
One of the Darnall elevators fell three weeks ago while Feingold was riding in it, he said. As he was taking the elevator up from the basement, the elevator came to a halt and then proceeded to drop several floors, before stopping and resuming again, Feingold said.
“It’s pretty irritating; I won’t lie,” Feingold said in an interview with The Hoya. “The fact that [the university] let their dorms fall into disrepair is kind of terrible, especially for a university of this stature,” Feingold said.
However, Feingold did not submit a report of the incident, and facilities has not received any reports of elevator malfunctions in Darnall, according to Simmons.
“We encourage community members to report any issues or concerns to Facilities Management,” Simmons wrote.
Morgan Irish (COL ’20) was on her way to class when the elevator in Reynolds suddenly fell from the fourth to the second floor, she said. The elevator’s doors would not open, and after a few minutes, the elevator fell again to the first floor, Irish said.
She tried pressing the call button in the elevator, but it was not operational, Irish said.
Though Irish did not sustain any serious injuries, she reported physical discomfort and expressed concern over what might have happened if the elevator had fallen more than two floors.
“My back and knees hurt a little bit when I ran the next day, because my knees were locked out when I fell,” Irish said. “I could imagine that if somebody fell from the top floor, they could get seriously hurt.”
Irish wrote an email to the Office of Planning and Facilities Management and submitted a work request, she said. Facilities emailed Irish that the elevator was experiencing issues because water had leaked into the elevator system due to a broken pipe, she said.
Anni Xu (COL ’21) experienced a similar issue with the Reynolds elevator, which made her question her safety. The elevator fell to the second floor, shook, got stuck and fell again to the first floor, Xu said.
“The experience was absolutely terrifying,” Xu wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I was scared I was going to die, before I just realized this was a semi-regular occurrence.”
Xu had previously heard multiple students complaining about elevator issues in the Southwest Quad, and she hopes that the administration will take action and address students’ concerns about basic safety on campus.
“The Southwest Quad is relatively new on campus, so I feel like we shouldn’t be experiencing these facility issues,” Xu said. “It’s really frustrating for how much tuition is, yet there are so many basic issues.”
Yash Srivastava (COL ’21) also experienced issues with the Reynolds elevators. The elevator froze up and started back again several times as it was moving down to the first floor, Srivastava said. Despite reporting issues with the elevator, Srivastava said the Reynolds elevator fell two floors when he rode in it again Nov. 14. Simmons wrote that facilities has since addressed the problem with a minor elevator repair.
Elevator repairs might be delayed because the delivery of specific parts sometimes takes longer, and expert elevator technicians are occasionally brought in to conduct repairs, according to Simmons.
Causes for elevator malfunctions vary widely, as do repair times for a typical problem, said Sheryn Villanueva, operations administrative assistant at Potomac Elevator Company. Repairs can take anywhere from a few hours to days or even months, Villanueva said.
“Often, the root problem behind lengthy repairs is lack of availability to needed parts,” Villanueva wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There are elevators out there that were built in 1970 and the manufacturing company doesn’t exist anymore.”
Facilities is working to fix the elevators to ensure safety for students, according to Simmons.
“Safety is a top priority for Facilities Management and we are committed to ensuring elevators are operational, reliable, and safe to use,” Simmons wrote. “We have processes in place to rapidly respond to out of service elevators and work to resolve issues as quickly as possible.”

Student leaders are continuing to push for the Georgetown University Policy Department to lower security costs for club-organized events on campus.
GUPD unilaterally determines whether an event needs security and how many officers to provide and requires the Student Activities Commission to cover this cost. Security is typically required for high-attendance and high-profile events.
The money for security comes from the fund made up of student activity fees — $80 paid by each student every semester; the Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee distributes the funds to SAC and other club boards including the Georgetown Program Board and Media Board. SAC allocates to clubs under its purview looking to host events.
SAC Chair Kylie Navarro (COL ’20) and FinApp Vice-Chair Harry Clow (MSB ’19) believe costs could be lower. Both SAC and the FinApp committee have expanded dialogue with the administration on the issue since April.
GUPD’s policy, which requires student clubs to hire security for their events, was first introduced three years ago. Clubs must submit an event security request that allows GUPD to evaluate risk and determine if or how much security is needed. Criteria include whether food or alcohol will be served, if there is a cost to attend, if there will be amplified sound, and who will be speaking and in attendance.
GUPD provides security to events to ensure student safety, according to Georgetown University Chief of Police and Assistant Vice President for Public Safety Jay Gruber.
“Our top priority is the safety and security of our community,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “When students organize events with a prominent speaker, serve alcohol, collect cash, or amplify sound, GUPD provides a security presence to ensure the safety of our students and campus community.”
The FinApp committee is talking to the Center for Student Engagement about how to lower the security costs, Clow wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Most of the work we are doing now is compiling from the individual funding boards the nature of their space and GUPD costs. Our main goal is seeing the trends in spending regarding these two very costly items and seeing what can be done to bring those numbers down,” Clow wrote. “We are dedicated to the idea that student money shouldn’t go to waste with exorbitant costs for venues and security on campus.”
The CSE cooperates with students on this issue to inform them about security costs of events and assist them with funding, according to the Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs Erika Cohen Derr.
“The Center for Student Engagement shares information about event planning to help groups understand what types of events require security or may require enhanced security and budget effectively for the year,” Cohen Derr wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While event organizers are responsible for the cost of security, no one will be prevented from hosting an event due to the cost of security.”
Still, there has been no change in university or GUPD policy on security costs. SAC has amended its own policies to try to account for unpredictable GUPD security costs, Navarro said.
“While we used to allocate a flat amount of funding to cover GUPD costs, based on what groups thought they would be charged based on previous experience and GUPD’s published funding guidelines, we found that that system of estimation left many groups underfunded when GUPD unilaterally decided events actually needed more security than the groups had requested,” Navarro wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Because clubs cannot always accurately predict the cost of security for their events, SAC commits to covering security costs without knowing their full price, according to Navarro.
The new allocation program requires clubs to submit an invoice to SAC before they receive funds, but Navarro said she believes this process is the most efficient way for SAC to fully cover GUPD security costs for club events.
“In order to avoid situations in which there is a discrepancy between the amount that SAC allocates and the amount that GUPD charges, we’ve moved to a variable funding system, in which we nearly exclusively make motions to allocate GUPD costs in full,” Navarro wrote.

The high percentage of politicians who are no longer in office following allegations of sexual assault represents an unprecedented degree of political accountability, according to a Georgetown University Law Center professor’s research.
Associate Professor of Law Jamillah Bowman Williams and her team of researchers examined the 138 elected and appointed officials accused of sexual misconduct in the last election cycle and whether or not they will still remain in office by January 2019. Of those accused, 18 were accused in the months prior to the start of the #MeToo movement and 120 after the allegations against Harvey Weinstein first broke in October 2017. Of those accused of sexual misconduct in the past election cycle, 75 percent will no longer be in office in January 2019.
These accusations, which were mostly made against male officials, had an impact on the midterm elections, according to the group’s research. Many of those politicians who had accusations made against them stepped down or were removed from office before the elections.
Of those who did not leave office before the midterm elections, many lost their primaries. However, for the officials who did make it to the general election, more won their elections than lost, the research posited.
Bowman, whose research focuses on racial and gender inequality in the workplace, became interested in tracking the impact of the #MeToo movement on political accountability.
“We have been analyzing over 12 million tweets with the hashtag #MeToo to examine the nature of the conversation around sexual harassment and assault on social media, and to investigate the extent to which the movement is leading to lasting social, political, and cultural change,” Bowman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I thought it would be interesting to collect data on the government officials reported for sexual misconduct before and after #MeToo exploded on Twitter in October 2017. I wanted to examine whether the movement was influencing reporting and accountability.”
The group gathered data through the use of online searches of internet archives, according to Bowman.
“Using LexisNexis, GoogleNews and NewspaperArchive, we performed a series of searches based on a series of keyword phrases and indexed subject terms,” wrote Bowman.
The search was limited to online and print newspapers and publications from the United States.
“We reviewed the articles and coded key information such as: date reported, type of allegation, position of government official, state, political party, gender, and employment status.”
Bowman is unsure of the future of this trend, but she intends to continue her research as the #MeToo movement continues to have an impact. Currently, the team is continuing to collect data to determine if the trend was a short-term reporting spike as #MeToo gained momentum or if it will be a lasting trend.
“For example, the volume of accusations hit a low point in October 2018 following the highly publicized Kavanaugh hearings and his subsequent confirmation to the Supreme Court. Victims may have been discouraged by that outcome,” Bowman wrote. “However, the #MeToo movement still has strong momentum overall, so it is very possible that there will be another surge.”

Eleven Washington, D.C. residents filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that the lack of representation for D.C. residents in Congress violates constitutional provisions.
The lawsuit, filed Nov. 5, names 10 plaintiffs, all of whom are D.C. residents, and was filed in conjunction with the D.C. Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, a nonprofit organization that works to address public policy problems in the District. The complaint alleges that Congress’ refusal to grant voting rights to D.C. residents violates equal protection, due process and the First Amendment, as Congress has granted voting rights to citizens living in military bases or overseas territories
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) approved of the lawsuit, citing the current lack of representation for D.C. residents.
“At the heart of this lawsuit is the confidence D.C. residents have had for more than two centuries that the founders, who went to war on the slogan of no taxation without representation, never intended their own nation’s capital to be an exception,” Norton said at a Nov. 5 press conference. “This brilliant lawsuit raises new issues that one does not have to be a legal scholar to understand: Congress can give the District representation in the Senate and House, as it has done, for example, for Americans living overseas.”
D.C. residents’ lack of representation in Congress violates the 14th Amendment, according to Attorney General Karl Racine.
“Denying District residents voting representation in Congress denies us the ‘equal protection of laws’ enshrined in the 14th Amendment,” Racine wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We support the goals of D.C. Appleseed’s lawsuit to give D.C. residents full voting rights.”
Similar lawsuits, Adams v. Clinton and Alexander v. Daley, were unsuccessful in 2000. In the lawsuit, Judge Merrick Garland held that the Constitution does not guarantee its citizens the same voting rights as residents of states.
Later, in the D.C. Voting Rights Act of 2007, Congress determined it has the power to give voting rights to those who do not live in a state under the District Clause and has done so on various occasions, such as for those living in military bases, according to D.C. Appleseed.
Luc Nikiema (COL ’20), a D.C.resident, cited concerns over taxation without representation among his reasons for supporting the lawsuit.
“We pay the highest federal taxes per capita while being denied right to vote and that is unjust. DC residents deserve to have equal rights and representation in Congress,” Nikiema wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The current lack of representation is “frustrating,” according to Maria Cornell (SFS ’20), chair of Georgetown University College Democrats.
“GUCD stands firmly against all kinds of voter suppression, and the silencing of D.C. residents’ political voice is extremely frustrating,” Cornell wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is especially important to consider that a majority of long-term and indigenous D.C. residents are people of color and members of the working-class, and they are the ones not being fully represented.”
Some proponents of voting rights for D.C. residents advocate for even greater representation in Congress, arguing the District should be granted statehood through a constitutional amendment. In 2016, 86 percent of D.C. voters approved an advisory referendum in support of statehood.
The lawsuit may help raise awareness on the issue of voter representation even if it is ultimately unsuccessful, according to D.C. voter Maddy Taub (COL ’18), who founded Georgetown’s Students for D.C. Statehood club during her time on campus.
“It is written in the Constitution that D.C. shouldn’t have statehood, but because the population has grown so much since the founding of America, we’ve really come to a point where there’s a bunch of citizens who are paying federal taxes that are higher than most other places in the country and aren’t getting statehood,” Taub said.
Granting D.C. statehood would be unconstitutional, according to Georgetown University College Republicans President Jake Lyons (COL ’20), but he expressed support for full representation.
“Our country was formed by states with DC being special city — not a state,” Lyons wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “Realizing though the need for full representation — I believe the most tangible and constitutional way of doing this would be to return D.C. to Maryland while keeping the area around Federal Buildings and National Mall as the separate District. Alexandria was included in the District but was given back to Virginia — so a solution like this is not unprecedented.”

Journalists play a crucial role in informing the public and political leaders about international issues, BBC reporter Suzanne Kianpour said at the Rev. James P.M. Walsh, S.J. Symposium on Tuesday night in the Leavey Program Room.
The event was the first in a series of discussions hosted by Georgetown University’s Speech and Expression Committee relating to free speech. The symposium is named in honor of Fr. James Walsh, S.J., a Jesuit priest and theology professor at Georgetown who helped draft Georgetown’s official Speech and Expression Policy and who passed away in 2015.
Kianpour, a Fall 2018 fellow for the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, has written for the BBC since 2011, specifically covering the Middle East. She interviewed Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, reported on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and currently heads the BBC’s coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 election and Robert Mueller’s investigation of it, according to the GU Politics website. Fluent in Farsi and Spanish, Kianpour also reported on the Iran nuclear deal as well as the detente with Cuba.
Kianpour covered the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria’s mass killing of Yazidis, a Kurdish-speaking minority in Iraq, while she was in Iraq.
Former President Barack Obama and his advisers relied on Kianpour and her team’s reporting on the massacre, which offered information that neither the public nor the administration had access to elsewhere, as they developed a strategy to address ISIS, Kianpour said.
“When ISIS was murdering Yazidis on Mount Sinjar, we were on the ground, reporting these stories,” Kianpour said. “Years later, a U.S. official who was in the Situation Room with President Obama when he was considering airstrikes on ISIS told me that he was watching our reports. That really shows the role that journalists have in informing the public on international events.”
Journalists provide critical information to political leaders, according to Kianpour. Reporters’ real-world experiences give them insight that policymakers often lack, she said.
“Coming back from abroad and seeing how little informed U.S. officials were about the places where I had just lived and worked got me thinking about how important it is for reporters to have that kind of experience,” Kianpour said. “I wish more lawmakers would spend a significant amount of time in places that they make policy about.”
Because of the importance of journalism, Kianpour said, writers have a responsibility to report accurately and avoid bias, which she described as one of the most demanding parts of her job.
“I try to make sure not to editorialize in my live shots or my scripts, which is hard,” Kianpour said. “It’s a difficult thing to do, to really make sure that I’m not putting any sort of opinion in a piece of information, but at the same time, I don’t want to do a disservice by watering something down.”
Free speech is key to both journalism and reporting and to a free society in general, Kianpour said.
“There are places in the world where free speech is not something that is afforded the way it is here,” Kianpour said. “Free speech and freedom of the press and the First Amendment is a cornerstone of our society in America. It’s one of the reasons why so many people in the world that I’ve come across love America.”

Graduate student workers voted in favor of unionization in an election last week after a yearlong push to receive official recognition from the university as a union.
A majority of graduate students voted in favor of unionization, with a final count of 555 in favor and 108 against.
Out of nearly 1,100 eligible graduate student teaching and research assistants, 663 participated in the Nov. 5 to Nov. 8 election, which asked whether they would like the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees to be recognized as a union by the university.
The American Arbitration Association, a neutral third party that mediates conflict out of court, conducted the election and reported the election results the morning of Nov. 9.
Provost Robert Groves and Executive Vice President for Health Sciences Edward Healton announced the election results to the Georgetown community in a Nov. 9 email.
“We have a shared belief in the important role that graduate student assistants play at Georgetown and a shared commitment to giving them a stronger voice as members of our community,” Groves and Healton wrote in a joint statement with GAGE and American Federation of Teachers, the national union with which GAGE is affiliated.
AFT expressed its support for GAGE in a tweet shortly after the results were announced Friday morning.
“Congrats to @wearegage for overwhelmingly voting to join AFT today! So proud to have you in our union! #Solidarity #1u,” AFT wrote.
The AAA’s certification of the results of the election will be finalized after a two-week waiting period, during which either party can file objections, according to the election agreement.
If the certification is finalized, GAGE will be able to negotiate on the behalf of all students enrolled in Georgetown University graduate degree programs who also hold service titles as Ph.D. research assistants, Ph.D. teaching assistants, Ph.D. teaching associates, graduate research assistants, graduate teaching assistants, student research assistants and student teaching assistants, Groves and Healton wrote in an email to the Georgetown community.
After GAGE learned graduate students had voted overwhelmingly in favor of unionization, GAGE presented University President John J. DeGioia with a letter announcing its intent to bargain with the administration, according to Chad Frazier, a graduate worker and Ph.D candidate in the history department.
“We’re all excited to enter into this new phase of our campaign,” Frazier wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our goal has always been a legally-binding contract that truly values our contributions to the university as TAs, RAs, and course instructors.”
The university has voiced its support and willingness to bargain with GAGE in good faith.
“When AAA’s certification is finalized, we will assemble the appropriate team to work in good faith with GAGE/AFT to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement,” Groves and Healton wrote.
GAGE does not expect to begin negotiations with the administration until early next year, Frazier said.
“In the mean time, we’ll be reaching out to our members to learn more about what issues that they’d like to see in a contract and to help shape the list of bargaining priorities that we’ll bring to the table in a variety of ways,” Frazier wrote.

The Washington, D.C. Council indefinitely tabled proposed legislation that would have lowered the D.C. federal election voting age to 16 on Tuesday.
The proposed legislation, the Youth Vote Amendment Act of 2018, would have made D.C. the first city in the United States to allow minors to vote in all elections, including presidential elections. The legislation would have granted the right to vote to about 10,455 16- and 17-year-old D.C. residents, according to 2016 data from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
The bill, which passed the D.C. Council Judiciary and Public Safety Committee on Nov. 1, was struck down by a vote of seven to six and is unlikely to pass before the end-of-year deadline. Councilmembers Anita Bonds (D-At Large), who helped introduce the legislation, and Trayon White Sr. (D-Ward 8) flipped positions and cast the crucial votes against the bill. 
Though she initially supported the amendment, Bonds voted to delay the legislation to allow for more conversation on the issue. 
 “It’s more of wanting to inform the public about what this really means,” Bonds said in an interview with The Washington Post. “I just want us to have a little more dialogue in our community. I’m 100 percent behind the legislation.”
Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D-At Large), Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) and Brandon Todd (D-Ward 4) also voted against the bill. Councilmembers who voted to support the legislation include Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7), David Grosso (I-At Large), Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) and Robert White Jr. (D-At Large).
Allen, the chief sponsor of the amendment, introduced the legislation in April with six other councilmembers, including four of the five members of the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety. He also continued to advocate for the legislation in the days leading up to the committee vote.
“At the age of 16, your legal relationship with your government changes. Young people work and pay income taxes. Some are raising a family or helping their family make ends meet. They can drive a car. Ironically, they pay fees to get a license plate that reads ‘End Taxation Without Representation,’” Allen said in an Oct. 31 news release.“But you do not have a voice where it matters most, which is at the ballot box.” 
Allen unsuccessfully introduced the measure in 2015 but revived it this year, inspired by protests against gun violence led by high school students following the Feb. 14 shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. 
While the future of the proposed legislation is uncertain, the movement for youth enfranchisement has gained a large amount of support, according to Erik Salmi, Allen’s director of communications.
“Unless we can get someone who voted to table it to support it, we don’t have a lot of options,” Salmi said in an interview with The Hoya. “But the encouraging thing is that we introduced the same legislation in 2015, and it moved from having no support then to having a lot of support this time in the community.” 
The proposed legislation garnered support from many D.C. residents who would have gained the right to vote if the legislation had passed. A June 27 public hearing for the bill drew dozens of students and members of the National Youth Rights Association. 73 public witnesses testified in support of the bill at the hearing, according to the NYRA.
The NYRA will continue to advocate for youth enfranchisement, according to NYRA Board of Directors member Brian Conner.
“16-year-olds have shown themselves more than capable of voting responsibly,” Conner said. “This is an important issue, and we will continue to advocate for the right to vote for 16- and 17-year-olds and try to push for similar legislation again if it is reintroduced.” 
Salmi expressed hope for the success of future legislation bolstered by ongoing support from young D.C. voters.
“We are so happy about the younger people who were involved through this process, who walked the halls and talked with councilmembers,” Salmi said. “There is almost certainly going to be another chance in the future. Those 16- and 17-year-olds are going to be 18-year-old voters. They’re not going anywhere, and neither is this issue.” 
Maryland jurisdictions Takoma Park, Greenbelt and Hyattsville have already lowered their voting ages to 16, but only for local elections.

E-commerce company Amazon announced Tuesday that it will split its second corporate headquarters between Crystal City, Va., and Long Island City, N.Y., ending the monthslong proposal process and bidding war among major North American cities trying to attract the tech giant.
The decision comes after Amazon analyzed 238 proposals from 54 states, provinces, districts and territories, using 100 different metrics to finally determine that two separate locations for HQ2 would allow the company to tap into the surplus of talent in both regions.
The HQ2 project will entail an investment from Amazon of $5 billion and the creation of 50,000 jobs across the two new headquarters locations, with more than 25,000 employees in each of the cities, according to a Nov. 13 news release.
The selection of northern Virginia as one of the locations for HQ2 solidifies the region’s growing reputation as a stable business environment, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam (D) said.
“The vast majority of the commonwealth’s proposal represents investments in our people and our infrastructure that will align with Amazon’s long-term goal while supporting the growth and competitiveness of businesses all across Virginia,” Northam said in an interview with The Washington Post. 
Virginia officials drew Amazon to the Arlington location with a payout of $573 million contingent on the company creating 25,000 jobs with an average salary of $150,000 for its employees, according to the news release.
In addition, subject to approval by the Virginia General Assembly, the state is set to invest $223 million for transportation improvements, with $195 million put toward nearby Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority stations and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, a project that will include a pedestrian bridge connecting the airport to the company’s hub.
Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said Amazon’s decision will bolster the District’s commitment to addressing transportation issues.
“We know that this opportunity will push us to work together on our biggest challenges like improving our transportation and infrastructure,” Bowser said in a Nov. 13 news release. “We must continue our investment in safety, reliability and capacity at Metro and find ways to enhance service, including late night service.”
The plan intends to take dated and largely vacant government office buildings and transform them into vibrant office spaces, according to The Washington Post.
The H2Q is anticipated to bring about large-scale economic development, including $2.5 billion in capital investments and $3.2 billion in net tax revenue over the next 20 years, according to a Nov. 13 news release. In the agreement between the state of Virginia and the e-commerce firm, Amazon expects to hire 400 people in 2019 and 1,180 in 2020, ultimately generating 25,000 new jobs by 2030.
The addition of Amazon combined with the successful past of Arlington will cultivate an even brighter future for the city, Arlington County Board Chair Katie Cristol said.
“The strength of our workforce coupled with our proximity to the nation’s capital makes us an attractive business location,” Cristol said in a Nov. 13 news release. “But Arlington’s real strength is the decades of planning that have produced one of the most vibrant, civically engaged communities in the world.”
Some opponents of the decision claim that politicians’ catering to Amazon is unnecessary, according to The Washington Post. There has also been concern expressed over potential inequality, as highly skilled potential candidates are expected to migrate to the area, crowding out lower-income civilians particularly by raising housing costs.
This is coupled with the concern that the new development will bring exacerbated congestion in an already traffic-heavy D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area. Many communities protested the arrival of Amazon earlier this year, expressing that the new headquarters will intensify rush-hour traffic and disrupt the livelihoods of many single-family homes in the affluent D.C. suburbs, according to Curbed.
The influx of Amazon workers may place an unintended burden on D.C. communities, said Anna Scholl, executive director of the advocacy group Progress Virginia.
“Thousands of new high-paying jobs could be a boon to our community, but we deserve to know the cost,” Scholl said in an interview with The Washington Post. “Tens of thousands of new workers and their families are sure to strain community resources when it comes to affordable housing, mass transit and traffic, and quality local schools. It’s only right that Amazon pay their fair share.”
Bowser addressed the public housing problem the decision may cause, explaining that the District is actively taking steps to curtail negative consequences.
“We call on elected leaders in the region to come together and agree to a concrete goal for affordable and workforce housing,” Bowser said in a Nov. 13 news release. “D.C. has been leading the way on affordable housing with unprecedented investment in preservation and production. In four years, we have invested $471 million with just one of our locally funded tools, the Housing Production Trust Fund.”

The foundations of Axios, an online media company, are centered on the basic tenets of print journalism while adapting to the new digital era, according to Axios Editor-in-Chief Nick Johnston (COL ’99).
The way in which readers absorb information has shifted with the advent of technology and digital journalism, according to Johnston. He and the three founders of Axios, Jim VandeHei, Mike Allen and Roy Schwartz, who formerly worked for Politico, noticed traditional print formats no longer fit consumers’ demands. In January 2017, Johnston and the three founders launched Axios.
The purpose of creating Axios was to develop a form of online news that eased the burden on the reader, Johnston said in an interview with The Hoya.
“The experience of consuming news on the web was kind of miserable — a lot of websites have a lot of pop-up ads; they make you click through 10 times to find something, and the stories are long and don’t get to the point,” Johnston said. “A lot of what we solved for on our site and our newsletters was, ‘OK, we’ll get rid of all of those annoying things and cut down the information to what the person really needs.’”
Since its launch in January 2017, Axios has grown from 7,000 subscribers for the Future newsletter to almost 60,000, according to Steve LeVine, future editor and adjunct professor for the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown. The online newsletter reached 360,000 subscribers in September 2018, according to the International News Media Association. Johnston attributes the growth of Axios to the “culture of responsiveness” built within the company.
“Tens of thousands of people have taken the time to fill out the survey when we ask them, and that’s a really engaged readership,” Johnston said. “I love that they are really engaged, and I think it’s very incumbent upon us even as we grow to keep those channels of communication open and listen to it.”
Not only do readers regularly engage with the website’s content, but they also play a role in determining article content, according to Johnston.
“It’s a really interesting trip wire for how we’re covering things,” Johnston said. “I’ve assigned stories on the basis of reader feedback — ‘There’s a complicated issue here, and we’re not capturing all of it, and so maybe we need to have someone dig a little deeper into it.’”
Before joining Axios, Johnston served as a managing editor at Bloomberg and covered the White House and Capitol Hill during his time as a reporter. While at Georgetown, Johnston wrote a weekly column for The Hoya on local and national politics.
A former Washington correspondent for Quartz, a mobile media startup launched in 2012, LeVine also served as a foreign correspondent for the Wall Street Journal for 18 years.
LeVine’s experience at a print publication inspired him to develop an innovative platform that preserves journalistic integrity, he said.
“The main thing from print days pulled into Axios is the standards, the expectation that you’re telling something new. You’re not regurgitating what other people wrote; you’re not just stirring the soup and telling the story better,” LeVine said. “You are truly advancing the conversation.”
Working at a print publication provided the standards for accuracy for online journalism, Johnston said.
“Some of what I’ve learned going back all the way to The Hoya when I had editors yelling at me was rigorous journalism,” Johnston said. “It’s being precise and being factually accurate and writing clearly and concisely, not just throwing up words on the Internet and saying that’s good enough. There’s a real traditional newsroom culture of getting it right and, if you get it wrong, owning up to that, and that’s a great way to build reader trust.”
A recent partnership between Axios and HBO has led to a four-part documentary series on current political events, such as the experiences of female candidates running in elections.
Partnering with HBO gave Johnston an understanding of the value of different media in effective news storytelling, he said.
“Sometimes the best way to tell a story is just in text, text and words,” Johnston said. “But often the best way to tell a story is visually, and that can be either through illustration or a chart or a data visualization, but also through video, and the work with HBO has helped us learn a lot about adding that tool to our arsenal.”
LeVine’s teaching experience at Georgetown has highlighted the importance of being consistently accurate and prepared in both journalism and in the classroom, he said.
“Students will call you out. Students have their laptops open; they are searching the internet while you are talking,” LeVine said. “You have to be on top of your game, and because of that, I’m on top of my game in journalism.”
This article has been updated to correct the launch date of Axios.

Observe D.C. held its inaugural nonpartisan election observation effort Nov. 6 at 83 polling locations across Washington, D.C.
In its preliminary report, the observation found that most polling procedures were followed and that voters were able to cast ballots without issue.
The sample-based Election Day observation effort, founded by McCourt School of Public Policy student Ben Mindes (GRD ’19), aimed to monitor electoral procedures across D.C. Observers paid particular attention to polling place accessibility, Mindes said.
“The main takeaway of something like this is that a community of people, of normal citizens, can come together and, without having any background in election observation, or sample-based methodology, or statistical reasoning or statistical background, can come together and provide an oversight over an election administration process that so far is non-existent in the United States,” Mindes said in an interview with The Hoya.
The Observe D.C. effort is the first of its kind in the United States, Mindes said. Although international or other observers may watch elections for brief periods of time, this work is the first attempt to provide a comprehensive and nonpartisan look at the efficacy of a municipality’s voting procedures.
Eighty-three election observers watched at an equal number of polling places from 7 a.m., when polls opened, until 8 p.m., when polls closed. They were paid a $50 stipend for their time.
Using a checklist of about 40 questions, the observers noted whether or not certain procedures had been followed or guidelines were met, like the polling location having an accessible entrance or if magnifying glasses were available.
The observers then phoned a call center on campus staffed with 12 volunteers at a time to report their findings.
With the exception that nearly one-third of polling places had failed to post a “zero tape,” a machine-created printout verifying that no one had voted before 7 a.m., D.C. polling locations largely followed standard election procedures.
Mindes chose to conduct the inaugural observation in D.C. because of the well-funded and well-staffed nature of the D.C. Board of Elections, and because such observations are allowed, he said. Although a last-minute change prevented Observe D.C. from watching polling places set up and close due to concerns about security, 100 percent of the team was able to watch the election for the entire day in their assigned polling place.
The election observers were a mix of those interested in elections and public policy, and included students and others, Mindes said. They ranged from undergraduate students to William Jerome Maxwell, a man in his mid-60s who found Observe D.C. on Facebook and decided to join. Observe D.C. was a way for Maxwell to honor his mother, who was also an election observer, Mindes said.
The final report on the election will be disseminated locally, Mindes said, and every 2018 election candidate in D.C. will receive a copy.
The group is also testifying to the D.C. City Council Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, which oversees the Board of Elections.
Mindes hopes that this effort can be replicated in other communities across the United States, as a way for citizens to begin to take ownership of their local elections. Because every municipality has different rules for election procedures and for election observations, it would not be possible to do it on a national scale without localized subgroups, he said. However, the success of Observe D.C.’s first year in the District may serve as a model for others.
“Citizen observers around the world — and there have been millions — they have the data, they understand their community and they’re there to stay and they’re the ones with the power and the connections and the voice in the community that doesn’t fly away the next day,” Mindes said.

Requirements of a new permit application for dockless vehicle companies operating in Washington, D.C., will restrict electric scooter and bike speeds and require dockless vehicle companies to pay higher fees, the District Department of Transportation announced Nov. 5.
Under the new guidelines, set to go into effect in January 2019, dockless vehicle companies that wish to continue operating in D.C. will have to pay a higher permit fee of up to $5 per vehicle per month. Annual permit fees for the company could reach $36,000.
The new limitations come after recent calls for greater transportation safety regulations by city officials following the deaths of two bicycle and electric scooter riders.
The dockless vehicle guidelines seek to accommodate transportation alternatives while addressing concerns of rider safety, according to DDOT Director Jeff Marootian.
“We are upholding Mayor [Muriel] Bowser’s commitment to fostering innovation and competition among the many operators in this space while also delivering the safest, most sustainable, and most efficient transportation options to District residents and visitors,” Marootian said in the news release.
The permit fee will go toward ensuring the enforcement, evaluation and administration of each program. An additional $10,000 deposit from dockless vehicle companies to DDOT will function as a performance bond meant to serve as a guarantee that a company is meeting the requirements and removing unsafe or abandoned vehicles from public use, according to the Nov. 5 news release.
Dockless vehicle companies must also reduce their electric scooter speeds from 15 miles per hour to 10 mph, per the new guidelines.
Companies will be allowed to increase the number of vehicles from 400 to 600 per electric vehicle permit, allowing companies to have a maximum of 600 bikes and 600 scooters in service. To increase their fleet size, companies must first receive a favorable quarterly evaluation from DDOT. In an effort to encourage adaptive vehicles, dockless vehicles available for use by people with disabilities will not be counted toward the fleet size cap, according to the news release.
Several electric vehicle companies in the District have already expressed frustration with the increased regulations and limited expansion. Other cities implementing dockless vehicle programs like Seattle have already permitted up to 20,000 shareable bikes to operate in public.
The new permit restrictions limit the environmental benefits of electric scooter programs, according to David Estrada, head of government partnerships for scooter company Bird.
“The Department of Transportation’s proposal for its shared e-scooter program would render it impossible for any provider to serve the D.C. community and truly advance the shared mission of reducing short car strips and taking meaningful action in the fight against climate change,” Estrada wrote in a letter to Bowser.
While the potential to increase the number of vehicles in a company’s fleet allows the needs of more customers to be met, the mandated fleet size is insufficient to serve D.C.’s demand, Maggie Gendron, director of strategic development for scooter company Lime, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“We appreciate the District welcoming greener and more affordable shared mobility options and Lime is eager to continue to partner with the city over the long term, though the proposed 600 vehicles are simply not enough to meet the city’s transportation needs,” Gendron wrote.
