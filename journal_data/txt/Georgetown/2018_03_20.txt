This weekend’s annual BRAVE Summit, aimed at creating a space to empower black women, brought three dozen speakers to campus to discuss the intersection of activism and the arts.
The summit included opening remarks by the event organizers and University President John J. DeGioia, two mainstage panels and a keynote address by actress and comedian Amanda Seales in Lohrfink Auditorium, as well as eight breakout discussions. Other speakers included actresses, models, dancers, students and religious leaders.
This year’s theme, “artistically, authentically, unapologetically black,” sought to empower black women to follow the career path of their dreams, whether it be a creative or corporate path.
The BRAVE Summit, now in its third year, was established to create a platform for black women to discuss their experiences, as they are often excluded from the conversation, said Kay Threatt (SFS ’18), one of the event’s organizers. The summit’s name stands for “black, resilient, artistic, vigilant, enough.”
Organizing for the first summit three years ago started “in the living room of the Black House” at the height of the #SayHerName movement, which sought to raise awareness for black and female victims of police brutality in the aftermath of Sandra Bland’s death in police custody, according to Threatt.
“It was in the height of the #SayHerName movement, where a lot of black women were being killed and left out of the greater dialogue around black men being killed.”
In addition to Threatt, Ndeye Ndiaye (COL ’18), Kayla Harris (MSB ’18) and Juliette Browne (COL ’18) organized this year’s summit. They delivered the opening address of the summit in unison, explaining the three facets of this year’s theme: “artistically,” “authentically” and “unapologetically” black.
“Artistically, as the rhythm in the way we walk, poetry in the way we talk and art in the way we carry ourselves in a country that constantly tries to bury us,” Ndiaye and Harris said about the first element of this year’s theme.
“Authentically” and “unapologetically” are the other facets of this year’s theme.
“Authentically, because many want to be like us, but our melanin can never be extracted or replicated,” Ndiaye and Harris said. “Unapologetically, because we have the audacity and power to love ourselves in a world that tries to tell us that we are not worth loving. We are artistically, authentically, unapologetically black.”
The BRAVE Summit has brought a new perspective to the Georgetown community through the art of language, DeGioia said in his opening remarks.
“The act of bringing an imagined reality into being, of moving from a vision to an accomplishment, is a remarkable and bold act,” DeGioia said. “This is what is our BRAVE Summit founders and organizers have done. Today, as you each share your experiences, your stories, your insights, you enable us to understand all that is possible in each of our own lives, and guide us to envision our future in a new way.”
The conference’s eight breakout sessions focused on a variety of topics about building one’s own brand in the workplace, as well as activism’s role within education, media and religion.
One of the event’s mainstage panels, “What’s Joy Got To Do With It: Discussing Black Girl Joy,” centered on the challenge of achieving self-love and joy within the black community. Erika Totten, founder of Unchained, a company focusing on the emotional emancipation of the black community, discussed the need for black women to empower themselves, both in and out of the workplace.
“I don’t believe in conformity or assimilation, however, I do understand that many of us and many of the women who have come before us did that to make it easier for us,” Totten said.
The afternoon mainstage panel, “Power Players” discussed the difficulties women of color face within the workplace, such as navigating the corporate world while maintaining personal values.
Ericka Pittman, the chief marketing officer of the beverage company AQUAhydrate, said people must put themselves in uncomfortable situations to be successful in business.
“The most pivotal or defining moments are when you’re uncomfortable, because you’re learning rather than sticking with the status quo,” Pittman said.
Seales highlighted her experiences as a woman of color within the entertainment industry during her keynote address in Lohrfink, “The Women Who Raised Us.”
Through her podcast “Small Doses,” her role on “Insecure” and as a comedian, Seales has sought to maintain her authenticity by blending together the worlds of academia and comedy, dispelling the stereotype that a black comedian cannot also be taken seriously.
Within her own work, Seales has chosen to not bring her live comedy show, “Smart, Funny and Black” to TV networks in fear that her pure vision will be distorted.
“Black culture, black artistry has been commodified and consumed in so many different ways and so many different facets, and I’m very protective of that,” Seales said. “Especially with a product that is 100 percent innately black, you don’t want to give that to someone who doesn’t want to see that thrive.”
With those choices come hardships, however, and the need to prioritize one’s values and passions along the way. Seales emphasized the need to stay true to oneself, regardless of the initial discomfort and struggle throughout the process.
“All of us are trying to exist in a comfortable space in a world that’s uncomfortable,” Seales said. “A job gets you a check, a career gets you a lifestyle.”

Black women must actively work to create spaces to promote their creative work, urged actress and comedian Amanda Seales at her keynote address for the 2018 BRAVE Summit, an event created in 2015 to provide a platform to bring black women to the forefront of Georgetown’s campus.
The event, which featured a conversation between Seales and Soyica Colbert, associate professor of African American Studies and Theater and Performance Studies, drew on Seales’ experiences as a black woman in the entertainment industry to expose the challenges often faced by black women artists. Seales is also currently working on a podcast, “Small Doses,” and had a recurring role in the HBO show “Insecure” as Tiffany, who is known for her “picture-perfect” marriage.
The BRAVE Summit was founded by three Georgetown alumnae, Alexis Oni-Eseleh (COL ’16), Bserat Ghebremicael (MSB ’17) and Candace Millner (MSB ’16), with the goal of empowering black women.
Seales began her speech by reflecting on her early years as an artist while in high school. As a student at Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, Fla., which has graduated notable entertainers like DJ Khaled and Luis Fonsi, she became involved in the arts and realized that she wanted to pursue a professional career in an art field.
“In high school, it was made clear to me that you can make a real career out of the arts, as long as you understand that there is a true business acumen involved to be a creative,” Seales said.
When Seales began working in a creative career, she was reminded of advice that she received, that there is an artistic side and business side to every profession. To be successful, one must understand all parts of the work, Seales said.
“Every job has three sides: the money, the people, the content,” Seales said, clarifying that a reasonable job tends to offer two out of the three. “I have lived by that.”
For Seales, remaining true to the art that she wanted to produce has affected many of her business decisions, most recently her decision to not sell her show, “Smart, Funny and Black,” to television networks. She ultimately decided that she wanted to be in total control of the production of the show.
“To sell it to a network at this point, I’m selling away the heart of the show, because no matter what, I’m going to now be an employee,” Seales said. “Especially with a product that is so 100 percent innately black, you don’t want to give that to someone that doesn’t want that to see that thrive.”
Part of Seales’ reluctance to sell her show to networks comes from a desire to protect black art and culture from being overly consumed and commodified, which frequently happens, she said.
Seales compared her artistic work to the fictional rare natural resource “vibranium” from the film, “Black Panther,” which has set box office records while casting black actors in lead roles.
“Black culture has been commodified, appropriated and consumed in so many different ways and so many different facets that I’m very protective of that and I’m very protective of what I’m giving to that,” Seales said. “There is no network that has approached me that I felt would be protective of the growing and glowing powers of my ‘vibranium.’”
Protecting black culture in the arts is crucial, Seales said, noting that for this to happen, creators need to forge their own spaces and platforms to express themselves. By creating these platforms and creating room for dialogue about their work, black women are able to create a space that is expressive of black culture, according to Seales.
“A lot of times, we don’t tell each other stuff because we don’t want to offend each other, or we don’t want to look a certain way, or we don’t want to bring another black woman down,” Seales said. “But me telling you something as a way black women can improve is not bringing you down.”
Ultimately, the only way that the greater public will appreciate black culture for what it is will be by black creators publishing their work, Seales said.
If black creators don’t share their own work, then no one will, Seales said.
“Make your own s–t,” Seales said. “I don’t just mean make your art; I mean: You have to make your own spaces for that art to exist; you gotta work with other people to create, because we’re never considered, except for by us.”

Joyful spaces must exist for the black community, where they are affirmed, safe and allowed to express themselves however they wish without fear of consequence, Erika Totten, an activist and co-founder of Black Lives Matter D.C., said in conversation with Deshauna Barber, the first woman to be crowned Miss USA while on active duty in the military.
The two discussed their experiences as black women in pursuit of happiness and validation in all forms during a panel titled “What’s Joy Got To Do With It: Discussing Black Girl Joy” at the BRAVE Summit on Saturday.
Krystal Leapheart, the special assistant and policy associate at the National Organization of Black Elected Legislative Women, moderated the discussion. Leapheart asked both panelists if there had been times in their lives when they felt their joy did not matter.
Totten recalled an incident from when she was 6 years old, when she was playing with a white classmate in her yard. Totten had allowed the girl to borrow her favorite yellow sweater as the two played. The girl was still wearing the sweater when her father came to pick her up, and Totten watched while the two had a brief exchange.
“She took the sweater off and gave it to him and looked back at me and put it in the trash,” Totten said.
Barber discussed her experience as Miss USA 2016 and her decision to wear her hair naturally for her final walk as Miss USA as a nod to her recently deceased mother and to black women everywhere. Barber also recounted a specific time when she was about to walk in a fashion show and the hairstylist commented on her natural hair.
The hairstylist told Barber she was glad she was wearing a wig because her natural hair was “just unmanageable.” In that moment, she decided to push back against the standard of beauty and embrace her natural hair, according to Barber.
“My hair is beautiful, it’s gorgeous and it’s my black hair,” Barber said. “And from that moment, I decided to myself, ‘Gosh, this is something I want to break down in terms of this standards of beauty, whether it has to do with the way that someone looks their skin color or even their hair texture.’”
This realization led to Barber’s decision to take off her wig for her final walk as Miss USA.
“So, for my final walk I had a wig on … and I went backstage, whipped my wig right off, did my little twist out and walked out on stage with an afro,” Barber said. “And that same day, we went on to crown Miss District of Columbia, which was a back-to-back win for D.C. women and for African-American women.”
Leaphart then asked the crowd who had ever been to a protest because they were angry about something, to which most of the crowd raised their hands in response.
“Who’s been to a protest because they were happy about something?” Leapheart asked.
Only a handful of hands stayed raised in response. Leaphart turned to Totten, asking her about the importance of organizing events not only from a place of anger, but also from a place of joy.
Totten described her creation of Black Joy Sundays, a weekly meeting space where black people in the Washington, D.C. area can be affirmed in their blackness, find fellowship with other gorgeous black people and discuss some of the racial stress they experience, according to the event’s Facebook page.
“I remember talking with Aaron and he said, ‘If we aren’t safe in church, where can we be safe?’ and I knew in that moment we needed a space for joy, but also a place where we can reclaim a space where all of our emotions are wanted and valid,” Totten said. “So not just only wanting to be around black people when we are funny and joyful, because that’s dehumanizing as well, but how can we can create a place that reaffirms our entire humanity.”
Totten now organizes a Black Joy Sunday every weekend in Malcolm X Park, a historically black space that has undergone recent changes because of gentrification of the park’s surrounding area. The Sunday meetings offer an opportunity for Totten and the community to reclaim their space and time in the face of environments that are often disempowering for people of color.
“When we go into spaces that are ours, they look at us like we don’t belong here. And so, for Black Joy Sunday, it was just a space for us to every Sunday to gather just to experience joy in whatever that is for you,” Totten said. “Reclaiming and affirming our humanity and being loud and taking up as much space as we want. That’s a part of organizing from a place of joy.”

Professional success comes from commitment to personal ideals and courage to initiate changes that transcend racial barriers, according to the speakers at the “Power Players in a Boy’s World” panel at the third annual BRAVE Summit in Lohrfink Auditorium on Saturday.
The panel was moderated by Monokia Nance, a brand manager and business solutions specialist, and featured a conversation between Ericka Pittman, the chief marketing officer of AQUAhydrate, and Shelby Hall, manager of corporate strategy at Under Armour.
Pittman said that the hardships she encountered in her youth, specifically a lack of black role models, inspired her to serve as a mentor for black youth today.
“There weren’t a lot of people that looked like me or thought like me, and I wish I had a lot more mentorship and guidance in those formative years,” Pittman said. “So, when I started to achieve some semblance of success even early on in my career, I always went back to young people to talk to them and help to guide them.”
Hall said that to remain true to herself and her vision, she does not let race factor into her workplace performance or mentality; instead, she focuses on performing to the best of her ability.
“I don’t constantly think about how I should act differently as a woman of color,” Hall said. “I just do what I know to the best of my ability.”
Both Pittman and Hall emphasized the importance of embracing discomfort on the path to achieving professional growth. Stepping out of comfort zones in professional settings can lead to achievement, according to Pittman.
“It’s really about putting yourself out there, having conversations, being very vocal and vulnerable about your dreams, and then those things will come together eventually,” Pittman said.
Hall echoed Pittman’s sentiment and said that success comes from not being complacent in professional situations and from pushing the status quo.
“If you’re not learning and growing by feeling uncomfortable, you’ll just stay at the status quo,” Hall said. “When you go out on a limb and take a risk, you learn so much that just continues to build on your empire.”
Networking is an effective way to achieve professional growth, and the most effective way to network is to develop an authentic connection with others by putting their needs ahead of your own, Pittman said.
“I don’t make a point of getting to know people for what they can do for me,” Pittman said. “If you’re out there networking, you should lead with being a resource for the people you’re trying to network with.”
Hall also said that putting other people’s needs before her own, specifically through community service work, has led to more fulfillment in her professional life.
“I think that I’m just taking pieces of Under Armour that I can project into the community,” Hall said. “For me, it’s about exposing the fact that a lot of people of color don’t exercise and are at risk for so many diseases.”
Holding executive positions requires adjusting between command and cooperation on a team, both Pittman and Hall agreed. To achieve this balance, both panelists said that effective leadership includes a willingness to learn from the other people on their team.
“One of the things I’ve been able to do in my career is be quiet and listen to the people around me,” Pittman said. “I think that’s helped me a lot to advance in this organization.”
Hall agreed with Pitmann and said that remaining conscious of when she is contributing valuable content to a meeting rather than talking solely to demonstrate her control has allowed her to be a successful leader.
“I speak when I feel like I’m adding true value, whereas I think a lot of people speak at meetings just to hear themselves speak,” Hall said. “So, I really try to find a balance between when I feel like I need to learn and when I feel like I’m adding value.”
Pittman also advised young college graduates to be open-minded about their job hunt and appreciate the value of entry-level work.
“You have to find a job that may not necessarily be your purpose today because it can be a stepping stone towards your ultimate purpose,” Pittman said. “When you think about your purpose and your passions, those things are important, but they can’t be the bullseye of where you’re trying to go tomorrow.”

The term “prison-industrial complex” is not representative of the lived experiences of people in the prison system and should be replaced with the new term “jail-industrial complex,” Mary Fainsod Katzenstein, founding member of the Cornell Prison Education Program, and Nolan Bennett, an assistant government professor at Georgetown, said at an event in the Intercultural Center on March 15.
The discussion, hosted by the Prisons and Justice Initiative, featured the inaugural presentation of Katzenstein and Bennett’s research on the prison system.
The term “prison-industrial complex,” which describes the overlap between government institutions, exploitation and imprisonment as a way to address political and economic issues, was coined during President Dwight Eisenhower’s term to describe the connection between corporations and the privatization of prisons in the criminal justice system.
Katzenstein and Bennett’s research seeks to coin a new term that would help spark a desire for research and discovery in the prison system.
“For some, the term is at best too simple; at worst it verges on the conspiratorial,” Katzenstein said. “Our intention here is to recover the terminology of the prison-industrial complex as an investigatory tool or an investigatory narrative.”
Katzenstein and Bennett began researching the experiences of individuals in the prison system after observing racism in the institutions, they said, prompting them to take a narrative-based research approach.
“Racism has a long historical pedigree that is braced by the codification of racist discourse — the ‘savage native peoples,’ the ‘negro is 3/5 of a person,’ the contemporary criminalization of race,” Katzenstein said. “All these historical periods are connected by a narrative thread.”
With different meanings of the phrase “prison-industrial complex,” transcending through different histories and different communities, Bennett and Katzenstein felt it was time to take a different approach to describing the prison system today.
“Inside prisons and jails, the language of the prison industrial complex is often brandish as the all-purpose explanation for all manner of punitive practice,” Katzenstein said. “On the streets, it is generally deployed as the vocabulary of choice to mobilize activists under the banner of prison abolition; in the world of academics, the prison-industrial complex as a language has not enjoyed much scholarly legitimacy.”
The two scholars cited the prison system in California as a motivation for using the new term.
In California, the Orange County’s Inmate Welfare Fund was set up to provide benefits to the inmates, according to Katzenstein. However, the funds are often directed elsewhere and not received by the inmates, Katzenstein said.
“Most of these services are paid for by the mostly poor families of the mostly poor prisoners,” Katzenstein said. “The money generated, though it is mandated to be spent on inmate welfare, is often spent on the bricks and mortar of prison operations.”
In Orange County, the inmate welfare fund had a balance of about $5.3 million in 1999, according to Katzenstein, but a small percentage of that money goes directly to the inmate programs.
“Over the previous three years, 41 percent of the revenue was spent on jail expansion, 59 percent on inmate programs,” Katzenstein said. “But those inmate programs actually involve a lot of spending that [money] on the salaries of people the jail had hired.”
Basing their evidence on examples like California, Katzenstein and Bennett believe the term “jail-industrial complex” more effectively describes the relationship between legal and financial systems that often impact jails.
“We propose the jail-industrial complex, a narrative about the newly formed and increasingly rapacious extraction of resources from the poor by the transformation of the jail into a market actor,” Bennett said.
For Bennett, the commercialization of jails as for-profit institutions is a cause of the lack of basic rights for inmates and their families.
“The financialization of jails does not simply threaten to corrupt corrections officers or degrade the conditions of jails,” Bennett said. “It focuses the purposes of extraction on the survival and growth of the jail system rather than on the rights and humanity of the imprisoned and their families.”
Bennett and Katzenstein have not yet published their research, but they presented at Georgetown to get input from the crowd.
“This is the first time that we’ve talked about our work, and it is a work in progress,” Katzenstein said.
Both Bennett and Katzenstein agree that replacing the term “prison-industrial complex” with “jail-industrial complex” will require a societal shift, but they hope that a new perspective will at least be considered.
“This term is more of a shovel than a magnifying glass,” Bennett said. “We are seeking to illuminate how private and public actors work together; it encourages [people] to look inductively at the most decentralized areas of punishment.”
