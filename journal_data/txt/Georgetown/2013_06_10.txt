Holy Trinity School received Board of Zoning Adjustment approval for a proposed expansion Tuesday.
The elementary school, located on 36th street near Georgetown’s East Campus, proposed a third floor addition for four new classrooms. The construction, which would increase the number of square feet occupied on the lot, required an exception from the school’s lot occupancy requirements and prompted a BZA review.
As part of the approval agreement, Holy Trinity proposed an enrollment cap of 350 students and 70 faculty and staff members, which matches current numbers. However, no formal enrollment cap is currently in place.
Other conditions set by Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, the District Department of Transportation and the Office of Planning included limits on carpool hours and staff parking.
Holy Trinity plans to begin construction in summer 2014 and conclude by January 2015.
