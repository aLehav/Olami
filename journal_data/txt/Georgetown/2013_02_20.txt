After the names of student and alumni members of the Second Society of Stewards were released through the exposure of an internal message exchange and public tax returns Tuesday night, reactions of university officials have remained largely silent while reactions from stewards have been mixed.
While University Spokeswoman Stacy Kerr withheld comment on the university’s policy regarding secret societies, Center for Student Programs Director Erika Cohen Derr sent a mid-afternoon email to Georgetown University Student Association executive hopefuls urging them to “keep the spirit of theGUSA presidency and vice presidency in mind” and remember that they are “Georgetown students first and foremost.”
GUSA presidential candidate Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) responded to Shavonnia Corbin Johnson (SFS ’14) and Joe Vandegriff’s (COL ’14) retraction of their cross-endorsement of Appelbaum’s ticket, which Corbin Johnson and Vandegriff announced after learning of Appelbaum’s membership in the Stewards.
“I respect Shavonnia and Joe — they’re great student leaders on this campus and I respect whatever decision they want to make. They run a great, clean campaign, and I respect whatever they want to do,” Appelbaum said.
Appelbaum and running mate Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) are still encouraging their supporters to rank Corbin Johnson and Vandegriff as their second choice.
Tyler Sax (COL ’13), a 2012 GUSA presidential candidate, has been a member of the Stewards for one year, joining after he was already involved in GUSA. He said he does not see the leak as significant.
“I think it tries to make a big issue out of something that’s not a big issue. It’s sort of sad to see someone would go to these lengths to make a big deal out of something,” Sax said. “I’m incredibly proud of the way Jack has handled himself. It shows character, though it’s unfortunate that this unfolded at this time.”
Jake Sticka (COL ’13) confirmed his membership in the Stewards but declined to comment further.
Russell Smith (COL ’98), spokesman for the Stewards, declined to comment on the leak itself or the reaction on campus, but emphasized that all tax records leaked were, in fact, public documents.
“We try to keep our affairs private. We, like a lot of groups, do a good job of that, but these things happen,” Smith said.
Smith affirmed his support of the Stewards’ mission and its members.
“I think it’s an organization that allows me to serve Georgetown in a diverse and imaginative way, and I think it is a collection of people who are the finest people I know in the world,” Smith said.
Other alumni and undergraduate members of the Stewards did not respond to requests for comment.

Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) and Maggie Cleary (COL ’14) pledged to enhance diversity, cultural inclusion and understanding at Georgetown on Tuesday.
The Pledge of Action forDiversity and Inclusion at Georgetown University laid out concrete actions that the pair would take if elected as the Georgetown University Student Association executives Thursday, including organizing a town hall meeting with university administrators to discuss diversity, creating a website to highlight the achievements of cultural and heritage groups on campus and reviving the Student Commission for Unity, a student-led initiative from 2007 to 2012 that aimed to enhance the undergraduate experience at Georgetown, and attaining the recommendations laid out in the 2009 Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness.
Movimiento Estudiantil Chican@ de Aztlán, a Chicano cultural, political and service group, drafted the pledge that Appelbaum and Cleary signed.
“I think they are really important proposals for diversity and pluralism on campus, and they are very concrete solutions,” Appelbaum said. “I think MEChA really wanted a concrete approach to diversity issues on campus, and I think we are providing that in the pledge.”
Appelbaum and Cleary’s goal is to foster a stronger sense of community and network of communication on campus between separate factions, according to the pledge.
MEChA decided to write the pledge and approach the candidates after its members attended the East Coast Chicano Student Forum organized by Harvard University on Feb. 17.
“We spoke about issues of diversity as we came back from this conference we attended at Harvard, and we talked about how can we get better attention for issues of diversity,” MECha Co-Chair Antony Lopez (COL ’14) said. “The conversation kind of went with how … cultural groups … like MEChA, are involved with GUSA.”
Lopez said that different candidates approached MEChA seeking their endorsement, but the group decided to endorse Appelbaum and Cleary.
“It kind of came down to a discussion that we liked the platform of Jack and Maggie and their openness to the discussion, that they don’t claim to have the answer, that they’re willing to work with those who are directly involved,” he said.
Appelbaum said that he and Cleary would work with cultural groups to find relevant solutions.
“I think it’s the approach Maggie and I will take of getting as much information and knowledge as possible,” he said. “[If elected, we will be]working with the leaders who are already passionate about these issues and showing a real appreciation for how to address those issues on campus in a way that might be different from what’s been done in the past, to get to more concrete solutions, more concrete changes going forward.”
Lopez said he hopes that Appelbaum and Cleary deliver on their promises if elected, something that previous GUSA executives have not been able to do.
“The last two elections, candidates have approached MEChA before, saying that they would do something, but nothing ever comes about,” Lopez said. “We just felt more comfortable with Jack and Maggie. If they do happen to win, we feel like we have more of a chance of actually getting something done with them.”
Correction: An earlier version of this story identified MEChA as a Mexican cultural group. It is a Chicano political, cultural and service group.

On the eve of the GUSA executive election, vice presidential candidate Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) has confirmed his membership in a private society unaffiliated with the Second Society of Stewards after denying his membership in a secret society the previous night.
After the story broke that rival candidate Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) is a member of the Stewards, numerous people alleged that Ramadan was also in a secret society. Although he and his running mate Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) had denied Ramadan’s involvement in such groups when asked to comment about Appelbaum, Ramadan said disclosure of his own membership was prompted by reflection and the reaction to the Stewards story.
“What I think it comes down to is that if anybody is a part of a group like this, it’s at their discretion if and when to expose that information,” Ramadan said. “When I thought about it more and saw the way it unraveled today, I wanted full disclosure.”
Tisa said Wednesday that he was unaware of Ramadan’s membership until the campaign season had started and that he did not discuss it extensively.
“We never really got into it,” Tisa said. “It’s never really been an important part of our campaign.”
Ramadan apologized for having questioned the motivation of Jake Sticka (COL ’13), who was also listed as a Steward, for supporting Appelbaum’s campaign.
“I do not believe Jack’s — or anyone else’s — involvement in a private organization affects his ability to lead GUSA,” Ramadan wrote in a statement. “I regret questioning Jake’s motives for supporting Jack’s campaign; both have proven themselves able leaders at Georgetown and, like all Georgetown students, are entitled to their own opinions, not least of all during this GUSA campaign season.”
Appelbaum declined to comment on Ramadan’s statement.
According to Tisa, neither he nor Ramadan realized the extent of the similarity between Ramadan andAppelbaum’s memberships.
“We had a discussion today — I didn’t really realize the scope of what was going on,” Tisa said. “Once parallels emerged, we talked about it and tried to come clean with it.”
Ramadan emphasized that his society membership has not influenced his GUSA platform or campaign.
“I apologize for the nature of the secrecy behind it, but the issues are ultimately what matters. I don’t want this to be a distraction from what our campaign has done so far,” Ramadan said.

The following is an official statement issued Wednesday morning from the Second Stewards Society in response to the article “Secret Society Disclosure Brings Focus to Appelbaum Campaign.” It was submitted by Chief Steward Sam Schneider (COL ’13), who is co-director of the Student Advocacy Office and a former member of The Hoya’s Board of Directors.
Every year there is rumoring about my Society in relation to a GUSA election, and every year it all usually teeters out with little to-do. As the Chief Steward and undergraduate leader of the Society, however, I take serious issue with the characterization made of it in the recent Hoya article, where it is said that we are a secret, unaccountable, and untransparent organization. On the contrary, we communicate openly with the university administration when necessary and I am available to answer any questions at any time, as I have now communicated to both The Hoya and the Voice. My society is a private association and a fraternity like many others at Georgetown. While the Society applauds Jack Applebaum’s service to GUSA, the privilege belongs entirely to him. We are not interested in king-making. We encourage our brothers to be honest. Jack disclosed his membership, an aspect of his private life, at the very moment he was asked. His record of public service should be all that matters to any thoughtful person weighing the merits of his candidacy.

An anonymous Facebook profile, “StewardThroat Hoya,” has shaken up the GUSA presidential election less than 24 hours before voting begins with allegations regarding the involvement of presidential candidate Jack Appelbaum(COL ’14) in a secret society.
Documents posted to Facebook, some removed and later reposted on a newly created blog, include Google messages between members of the Second Society of Stewards. Among them are Appelbaum and Jake Sticka(COL ’13), Georgetown University Student Association chief of staff and Appelbaum’s campaign manager. Tax filings for an affiliated charitable trust were also posted.
Appelbaum confirmed his membership in the Stewards in an interview with The Hoya, although he would not provide further information about the society.
“My campaign is separate from the Stewards Society,”Appelbaum said. “They’re entirely disconnected.”
Appelbaum did acknowledge that other members of the Stewards have been active in his campaign, includingSticka, who could not be reached for comment late Tuesday. Appelbaum told The Hoya that Sticka was ill and had received treatment at Georgetown University Hospital Tuesday evening.
Asked if he regretted the decision not to disclose his membership in the Stewards, Appelbaum said he does not believe voters have a right to know if candidates are members in secret societies.
“It’s a private association of mine, just like any of the other candidates might have other private associations,” Appelbaum said. “Because it’s something that I keep private, I don’t think that I have to explain every single thing I’ve been a part of in my history.”
In the wake of the development, Shavonnia Corbin Johnson (SFS ’14) and Joe Vandegriff (COL ’14) announced that they were no longer encouraging supporters to rank Appelbaum and Cleary No. 2 on their ballots. Corbin Johnson had announced the cross-endorsement along with Appelbaum at the Monday presidential debate, and the two tickets promoted it in subsequent social media posts.
“We refuse to align ourselves publicly or privately with any members of an organization that lacks transparency and accountability at Georgetown,” Vandegriff said in a statement to The Hoya early Wednesday morning. “We were saddened to learn that our fellow candidates had withheld such important information from us throughout the run up to the GUSA election.”
“Secret organizations go against our values and are in no way a part of our movement. We cannot allow others to represent us and our commitment to our values when we do not agree with their actions,” Vandegriff added.
This year’s other four GUSA tickets denied responsibility for releasing the information and disavowed knowledge of its source, which remains unknown. The opposing candidates also all said they were not members of secret societies.
The Second Stewards Society issued a statement Wednesday morning in response to this article, in which the group defends its role in Appelbaum’s campaign and the integrity of his ticket.
Other than Appelbaum and Sticka, 2012 presidential candidate Tyler Sax (COL ’13) and formerGUSA director of communications Matthew Hoyt (COL ’12) are the only current or former GUSAofficials identified in the emails. Sax declined to comment, although he acknowledged he was supporting Appelbaum in Thursday’s election. Hoyt could not be reached Wednesday morning.
Appelbaum’s running mate, Maggie Cleary (COL ’14), said Appelbaum told her of his membership when they formed their ticket, a fact Appelbaum confirmed in a separate interview. She added that she does not believe the Stewards have given her campaign an unusual level of support compared to other student organizations, and she denied that the Stewards have influenced the ticket’s platform.
Appelbaum said he was troubled by the disclosure and believes it presents a distraction in the final stretch of the campaign.
 
“I’m concerned that something like this will ruin the legitimacy of an institution that’s been effectively built up over the last few years, and one of the reasons I was running was to maintain that legitimacy,” he said.
The Stewards’ messages, obtained from a Google group called “N.S.S.V.-XXX,” begin in May of last year. In one email, alumnus Eric Wind (SFS ’09) refers to members of the group as “Brothers of the 30th Watch.” The abbreviation “N.S.S.V.” — which also appears on the affiliated charitable organization’s tax filings — is believed to refer to the phrase non scholae sed vitae, Latin for “not for school, but for life.”
The initial conversation posted to the group, initiated by Wind, is a discussion among members of the “Watch” — the society’s equivalent of a pledge line — about purchases of ties and cufflinks for society members.
Sticka responded to the message, while Appelbaum’semail address is included on at least one message, and the candidate is directly referenced in another message. The most recent messages, dated December of last year, revolved around Sticka’s attempt to organize a social event among the Watch.
StewardThroat Hoya also posted a publicly available 2011 tax filing for The N.S.S.V. Corporation, the corporate trustee of the Stewards Charitable Trust (Second). The filing is in the care of Russell Smith (COL ’98), CEO of Chiefist, a Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm.
The filing lists the corporation’s assets at $147,996.93 and notes that it received $16,003.90 in contributions, grants and gifts that year, as well as $2,569.13 in dividends and interest from securities.
At the same time the Facebook page was made public, editors of The Hoya received an email linking to the Facebook group and the now-private Stewards Google group where the correspondence was obtained. The message referenced the upcoming GUSA election and was signed “Steward Throat.”
That name is an apparent reference to “Deep Throat,” an anonymous source at the heart of the Watergate scandal and a central character in the film “All the President’s Men.” The owner of the Facebook account and email address that contacted The Hoya did not respond to messages requesting comment.
Current GUSA President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) could not be reached initially but issued a statement after this article was published affirming her continued support for Appelbaum.
“The idea, raised by some other candidates, that Jack’s hard work and dedication to improving life on the Hilltop is any less commendable or valid because of the recent news is absurd and insulting to me. Jack is one of the most honest, hardworking and caring people I know. I continue to respect his honesty in this matter, which is more than I can say for the other candidates in the race,” Gustafson wrote in an email.
Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) declined to comment, citing a media policy at her current internship.
Carlos DeLaTorre (COL ’13), chair of the GUSA Constitution Council, which is responsible for upholding the student association’s constitution and has done so in contested elections over the past decade, said that there are no rules barring GUSA officials from membership in secret societies.
“I think, ultimately, the student body should be made aware of such information, but I think it is up to the discretion of the candidate themselves on whether or not that information is appropriate,”DeLaTorre said. “I think that in this instance it might have been inappropriate for Appelbaum to put that information forward to the student body, nor do I think it’s a discredit to him for not putting that information forward.”
Reaction among the candidates vying to succeed Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount varied.
Upon hearing the news, presidential candidate and GUSA senate Speaker Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) said he did not see Appelbaum’s membership as a concern in the race unless it dominated his ticket’s campaign.
“I think it’s inappropriate for a candidate to rely on that work alone to win an election,” Tisa said. “I think people are free to associate with whoever they want, but if they rely on a network like that, that raises questions.”
The involvement of the GUSA executive in the Appelbaum and Cleary campaign has been a contentious issue during the race, specifically Sticka’s role as campaign manager.
 
Tisa’s running mate Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) said of the Appelbaum news, “It does raise the question of whether [Sticka] is doing this because he truly believes they are the best ticket or if it is for other reasons.”
“You hear about the Stewards on campus, and you suspect the usual GUSA higher-ups to be in the Stewards, but I was surprised to see concrete evidence about Jack,” Ramadan said.
Cleary had a different take on Sticka’s position in the campaign.
“I think that the reason that Jake supports us is because he knows Jack and he’s worked with him in the executive. He knows me as well, and I don’t think that this alternative group has that much of an impact on his support,” she said.
Presidential candidate Spencer Walsh (MSB ’14) declined comment beyond stating that neither he nor his running mate, Robert Silverstein (SFS ’14), are involved in secret societies.
Current GUSA senator and presidential candidate Cannon Warren (SFS ’14) said he was unaware of the leak but was not surprised that Appelbaum was identified as a Steward. “That’s pretty obvious. I was thinking Appelbaum would be one,” Warren said.
As of early Wednesday morning, the StewardThroat Hoya Facebook profile is deactivated.
Hoya Staff Writers Victoria Edel, Emma Hinchliffe, Ted Murphy, Hiromi Oka, Steven Piccione and Eitan Sayag contributed reporting. 
Update 2:38 p.m.: This story has been updated to include responses from GUSA President Clara Gustafson and Chair of the GUSA Constitution Council Carlos DeLaTorre. 
Correction: An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that Appelbaum, Sax and Sticka were the only current or former GUSA officials included in the Google messages. The article has been revised to reflect that former GUSA director of communications Matthew Hoyt was also included in the conversations.
