A student movement advocating for better university management of sexual assault cases gained traction last week after the Georgetown University Student Association came to an understanding with administrators to increase awareness campaigns and expedite planned initiatives.
Students and administrators made agreements to improve the marketing of campus resources for sexual assault survivors, further educate students about bystander intervention and continue plans to implement a campus climate survey.
The movement began July 21 after Zoe Dobkin (SFS ’16) and Willa Murphy co-authored an opinion piece in The Hoya (“I Stand With Willa, I Stand With Survivors,” thehoya.com, July 21, 2015) that detailed Murphy’s experience with campus administration following her rape. Murphy, claiming little university support, began to struggle in classes and was subsequently expelled. The piece ignited dialogue between students and administrators regarding the university’s responsibilities toward sexual assault survivors in the following month.
Murphy’s story sent waves across the university community upon its publication.
Dobkin launched a social media campaign, “#IStandWithWilla #IStandWithSurvivors,” questioning administrators about their handling of Murphy’s case and calling for a re-evaluation of the university’s sexual assault policies.
The following day, GUSA convened with a group of student activists and requested a meeting with university administrators to address concerns about the university’s sexual assault policies and initiatives, such as the lack of advertising for resources for survivors and limited education on bystander intervention.
Administrators also publicly expressed their solidarity. Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny and Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Jeanne Lord, in their capacities as Title IX coordinators, responded with a viewpoint (“We Stand with Survivors,” thehoya.com, July 22, 2015), recapitulating the university’s continued efforts to create a better environment for survivors of sexual assault.
In an interview with The Hoya, Kilkenny said that her professional duties are driven by her own personal commitment toward ensuring the safety of students.
“As a mother of two children who have gone to college … I am extremely committed and very concerned,” Kilkenny said. “I don’t know one administrator who is not working around the clock to make sure that we have a safe environment for all our students.”
Approximately one week after Dobkin and Murphy’s piece was published, Olivia Hinerfeld (SFS ’17) shared her own experiences as a survivor of sexual assault in a viewpoint (“A Shared Obligation,” thehoya.com, July 29, 2015), encouraging the community to create a more survivor-centric campus.
Hinerfeld said that she decided to publish the piece to encourage the community to collectively take action on the issue.
“I wanted to emphasize the importance of bystander intervention to the average Georgetown student and I wanted to show survivors they are not the only ones that have experienced [sexual assault] on Georgetown’s campus,” Hinerfeld wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Statistics can be exceptionally telling, but sometimes people need to see a face in order for something to be real to them.”
Meanwhile, the #IStandWithWilla campaign gained momentum when approximately 20 students participated in a chalk-up at Red Square on Aug. 7. Students wrote encouraging messages to survivors and further pressured the administration to act upon student concerns.
Prior to the meeting on Aug. 10, GUSA distributed a four-page memorandum to administrators listing its demands, which were the result of weeks of policy research and deliberations amongst student activists. GUSA had a follow-up meeting on Aug. 24.
During the two meetings, administrators expressed their support for more effective awareness and marketing initiatives. In particular, an agreement was made to update the user interface of the sexual assault resources website, with further improvements scheduled for the fall semester.
The groups agreed on the increased promotion of resources for sexual assault survivors by adding campus resource contact numbers and information on stickers in bathrooms and on the back of GOCards.
According to Hinerfeld, several other universities such as George Washington University and American University have already started similar awareness campaigns.
“I believe that both of these tools could easily and inexpensively be implemented at Georgetown,” Hinerfeld wrote.
Students and administrators found common ground in discussing ongoing processes, such as the hiring of a full-time Title IX coordinator by September 2015 and the continued development of a campus climate survey.
Although student activists are pushing for the university to implement the survey by January 2016, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said that care needs be taken in order to create a useful survey.
“We want to make sure [that] when we do the survey it gives us the best information in at least a couple of different ways. One is giving us an understanding of what happens in our community, so we ask questions framed in a way that will do that,” Olson said. “[We want to] be able to compare our responses with other responses with other universities that give us a kind of context that’s valuable.”
Another item on the memorandum was the establishment of an ongoing educational program centered on bystander intervention that serves as a follow-up to the mandatory “I Am Ready” session during New Student Orientation.
Hinerfeld said that the university should continue to engage students in the dialogue in order to effectively promote bystander intervention.
“Research shows that having conversations about sexual assault one time during freshmen orientation will not substantively change a culture,” Hinerfeld wrote. “The concepts brought up in these discussions need to be reinforced on a consistent basis in order to make a real impact.”
GUSA’s final request in the meeting was to streamline the process of gaining re-entry into the university following a medical leave of absence.
In an email to The Hoya, GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) said that this process would be more accommodating to survivors of sexual assault.
“We know through anecdotal evidence that the process for accessing resources and accommodations is often overwhelming and requires survivors to continuously repeat their story to multiple offices, which can be re-traumatizing,” Luther wrote. “We want to make it possible for survivors to be able to work one-on-one with a single staff member who would coordinate all of these services, resources and processes and take the burden off the survivor.”
Overall, both GUSA and administrators were pleased with the outcome of the negotiations.
“Though we may not see eye to eye on every issue, we understand that only through engaging with the administration in a productive manner will we be able to make effective, tangible improvements for the student body,” Luther wrote.
Olson echoed a similar sentiment, noting that both parties shared the same values.
“We care about these issues as much as our students do,” Olson said. “We have that shared commitment and shared goals in this really important conversation.”
Hinerfeld expressed optimism toward making substantial changes in creating a safer environment for survivors.
“I am confident that important and necessary changes for survivors will emerge from these negotiations,” Hinerfeld said.

I didn’t read anything about Willa Murphy’s fate.
Has she returned to GU in good standing?
Hope so!

By all accounts, Nina Brekelmans (GRD ’15) was a brilliant student, an exceedingly proficient Arabic and Spanish speaker and an avid long-distance runner. She graduated with a near-perfect GPA in Georgetown’s Master of Arts in Arab Studies program and planned to study the experiences of female runners in Jordan with a Fulbright grant this fall.
On June 3, Brekelmans, 25, died in an electrical fire in a townhouse on Riggs Place NW near Dupont Circle. The 2:30 a.m. blaze killed one other resident and injured three firefighters.
A Talented Scholar
After high school in Mexico and Kentucky, Brekelmans began to build an impressive resume. She received her undergraduate degree in Arabic from Dartmouth College, where she graduated summa cum laude and ran on the NCAA Division I cross-country and track teams. She matriculated into the Master of Arts in Arab Studies program in 2012, spent a gap year studying in Jordan, ran with the Georgetown Running Club, interned at the Muslim Chaplaincy and served as treasurer of Georgetown Women in International Affairs.
Brekelmans will be remembered in the academic communities of both Dartmouth and Georgetown as a passionate and endlessly talented student. Many professors noted that she exuded a quiet confidence in the classroom.
Dartmouth Arabic professor Mostafa Ouajjani said Brekelmans was one of the hardest workers he has ever taught.
“Nina has always impressed her classmates and me by her sense of perfection, her meticulous work and her total engagement,” Ouajjani wrote in an email. “As I think of this amazing student, I can recall a passionate and smart learner.”
Ouajjani kept in contact with Brekelmans after her graduation. Shortly before her death, she sent him a piece of her own work in Arabic — a fictional short story called “The Mother.”
“This text shows that Nina controls the most complex Arabic structures and feels at home using idioms and understanding cultural nuances of Arabic,” Oujjani wrote. “Indeed, anyone who reads this text would feel that it must have been written by an Arab writer. I intend to use her text in my course on the Arabic short story this fall in honor to her heritage and in remembrance of such an amazing soul.”
Brekelmans developed an interest in writing and translating Arabic fiction at Georgetown, where she audited “Introduction to Fiction Writing” with Professor David Ebenbach.
“She was kind of amazing,” Ebenbach said. “She was a very talented writer, first of all, but I think, most impressively, she was a very generous presence in the class. She gave a lot more than she took. She was really helpful with her peers, giving them feedback on their work, and she was auditing, so she could have phoned it in, but she gave a lot of herself.”
Clovis and Hala Salaam Maksoud Chair in Arab Studies Fida Adely taught Brekelmans in two classes and noted her quiet strength in the classroom.
“She was pretty quiet but very focused,” Adely said. “I have this vivid memory of her in this one class where we had these really passionate and loud students who were debating. It was a small class, and there was a debate going back and forth for 30 minutes between three or four students. At the end she said, ‘Just let me make sure I understand.’ And she summarized the points everyone just made. She was always engaged and participating and absorbing what was going on.”
Brekelmans’ interest in Arabic expanded beyond the classroom, as well, with her internship at the Muslim Chaplaincy. Through the position, she connected with Muslim students and community leaders and organized programming and outreach for the chaplaincy.
“She wanted to practice her Arabic, and she was really determined to study Arabic, to engage in the Arab world and engage in Arabic art and the Arab culture,” Director of Muslim Chaplaincy Imam Yahya Hendi said.
Hendi said that he and Brekelmans connected over their desire to “give a voice to women, a voice to those who are forgotten.”
“Nina was spiritual, a special kind of spirituality. She was connected with her soul, with her mind, with her heart,” Hendi said. “In her, I saw the true vision that God has for the world.”
An Avid Runner
Brekelmans’ second passion in life was running. She walked on to the Dartmouth Division I cross-country and track teams her freshman year and trained hard to keep up with her recruited teammates. Over time, she began to break her own personal records, notching a 5:12 in the mile and 17:57 in the 5K .
“She was a really hard, hard worker. One of the hardest workers on the team,” former Dartmouth Distance Coach Marc Coogan said. “We even acknowledged that as a team at the track and cross-country banquet at the end of the season. She wasn’t the fastest girl on the team, but definitely one of the hardest-working.”
At Georgetown, Brekelmans joined the Georgetown Running Club and became a volunteer for Girls on the Run, a non-profit that encourages young girls to develop a passion for fitness.
“Nina was very, very proud to be part of GRC,” GRC Coach Jerry Alexander wrote on the club’s blog. “She was willing to do whatever it was going to take to hang with the girls, and she was a great teammate in every sense of the word.”
Brekelmans managed to mix both of her passions, Arabic and running, during her gap year in Amman, Jordan. She spent one year there in 2013 through the Center for Arabic Study Abroad and immediately involved herself in the community, running daily at Sports City in Amman. There, she connected with runners with the organization Run Jordan, a non-governmental organization that coordinates races throughout the country. She won her first half-marathon in Jordan on her first-ever attempt at the 13.1-mile race.
Brekelmans made friends with many female distance runners, with whom she trained daily at 4:30 a.m. to avoid the blistering Jordanian summer heat.
“She worked mainly on empowering local women to participate in sports, especially running,” Run Jordan member Lina Al-Kurd wrote in an email. “She tried to help them overcome societal stigma and participate in any sport within the Kingdom. …We lost a great runner and volunteer who had an amazing spirit.”
Fostering Friendships
Brekelmans’ penchant for Arabic was not only helpful in an academic setting, but also in a social one. She had a remarkable ability to make close friends in Arabic, as evidenced by her strong network of runners, coaches and volunteers in Amman.
“We first met Nina here, at Sports City, and we would run together almost daily,” Sharifa and Ashwaq, two female runners, wrote in an email. “Talking about Nina, she brought us together with her persistent, kind spirit that represents a true sportswoman. The smile would never leave her face, no matter her score or run time. As a human being, she is irreplaceable and our loss is great.”
According to her teammates, Brekelmans was a motivating and encouraging force. Many teammates shared their experiences with Brekelmans in a memorial video, and Run Jordan hosted a memorial run in her honor in June.
“We saw Nina at practice almost every day. No one will forget her. Her soul and her spirit is with us and it encourages us,” an unnamed teammate said in the video. “She would always come up to me and encourage me and say, ‘You can, you can.’ I will never forget her telling me that. Whenever I find something to be difficult, I will always remember what Nina told me.”
Brekelmans involved herself in many aspects of Jordanian life besides running. She volunteered at Reclaim Childhood, a non-profit in Amman that teaches sports to refugee children, and aimed to explore historical and cultural sites outside of the city in her free time.
“The will that she had, the strong will led her to really reach out in Jordan,” Hendi said. “She went to the market, she spoke to people on the street, she went to peoples’ homes. She challenged the unchallenged. She challenged her own fears of the unknown.”
Many of Brekelmans’ Jordanian friends did not speak English at all, which Center for Contemporary Arab Studies Program Manager Julie Yelle (SFS ’08) said showcases a truly special talent. Yelle met Brekelmans at Middlebury College during a summer language immersion program.
“One of the things that struck me was what an amazing ability she had to build relationships and nurture friendships in Arabic,” Yelle said. “When I got to know her, we spoke the whole time in Arabic, and I really enjoyed getting to know her that summer. Now, when I’m thinking about how deeply I feel her loss, it’s incredible to think that 99 percent of my interaction with her was in Arabic.”
Hendi said Brekelmans will be remembered in America and in Jordan as a bright force for positivity and change.
“She meant the word ‘inspiration.’ She really inspired so many people she came across without any doubt,” Hendi said. “She meant simplicity. She would sit on the floor and wouldn’t care, would eat anything. And smile, oh my God, smile. Even if she was in pain or torn into pieces inside, she managed to smile.”

The McCourt School of Public Policy will launch the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service this fall, led by former Democratic National Committee Director of Communications Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), to foster public service and civic engagement.
McCourt School Dean Edward Montgomery said he believes that the Institute for Politics and Public Service builds on the historical strength of the McCourt School in policy analysis and management.
“We are going to build a massive data institute and trying to think about how to use a new type of data that’s becoming available to think about public policy problems. That’s one pillar we stood on,” Montgomery said. “The twin to the new data institute is the new Institute of Politics and Public Service, where students and faculties will be engaged with the process of getting things implemented. These are the twin pillars on which the school will rest as we specialize in what to do and how to get it done.”
Drawn by the public service aspect of politics, Elleithee has served in senior positions in four presidential campaigns, including a role as senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, since graduating from Georgetown in 1994. Elleithee said he decided to transition to the academic world to explore different perspectives on politics.
“People who were practicing politics are sort of losing sense about what it’s all about. Too often I think I got so caught up in the daily back-and-forth that it’s easy for me to lose sight about what it’s about,” Elleithee said. “Something that has been weighing on me for a while is, how can it be better, how can we connect better and particularly how can we connect better with young people?”
Elleithee warned against further alienating the younger generation, who no longer necessarily considers politics a noble channel of service. He said it is vital that politicians explore new ways to reengage millennials and seize the learning opportunity to draw inspiration from the younger generation.
“Too often in politics, we demand that people come to us. That’s not how young people communicate,” Elleithee said. “I rather go to them, bring politics to them, hear from them and have a real dialogue where people like me can share our experience, and at the same time we can learn from students.”
The new institute will soon roll out a series of initiatives, which include the flagship fellowship program that will be unveiled this fall. The fellowship connects McCourt School students with prominent political leaders who expressed interest in “going back to school.” Five fellows each semester will take classes, engage in discussions and host conversations with students and student groups. This semester’s group of fellows includes Buzzfeed’s D.C. Bureau Chief John Stanton, former Puerto Rican governor Luis Fortuño and CNN Senior Political Correspondent Brianna Keilar.
“Young people want to see something that’s real, thats authentic,” Fortuño said in a video on the institute’s website. “Everything [in politics] is so rehearsed. It’s like a bad movie where you know what’s going to happen next. There are great people involved in politics that are well-intentioned and trying to change our communities for the better.”
Elleithee envisions the new institute as a place not just for people to “come and tell war stories,” but to genuinely engage.
“We want to have the students actually mentor the fellows as much as the fellows mentor the students,” Elleithee said. “Maybe the fellows then go back to their real life, to their careers, to politics and think about it a little bit differently.”
Both Montgomery and Elleithee believe that Georgetown’s location in Washington, D.C. gives the school a unique ability to connect the students and the campus with those who are engaged in local policy.
“We are very fortunate here that we have got the whole city, and no shortage of people who want to come to speak on campus,” Montgomery said. “In order to get off the stage of Gaston [Hall] and really get in with the students, it’s all about the students leading the way.” Besides the fellowship program, the new institute also plans to introduce a speaker’s program, where public figures are brought to campus to speak with students, according to Elleithee. An internship program is also under discussion. Elleithee mentioned that they will look to the student body when deciding on new initiatives.
Montgomery said he believes the new institute will further enhance Georgetown’s reputation for convening great minds.
“Our university already has a long history and excellent reputation for being able to bring people from all big sectors and international arenas, and now we are adding public policy to that mix”, Montgomery said. “We have that great historical strength that we are adding another piece to — all things that can work together to create a bigger and more comprehensive program which we will just be a piece of.”

Earlier this week, the newly renovated Spirit of Georgetown Residential Academy, commonly known as the Former Jesuit Residence, opened its doors to house 148 sophomores, juniors and seniors as a five-floor Living Learning Community based on Jesuit values.
The FJR consists of 18 apartments ranging from a nine-person suite to a double semi-suite. Fitted with modern furnishing, the residence is more spacious than typical on-campus living.
“The idea was to make this very competitive to off-campus living,” Office of Design and Construction Senior Project Manager Brian Barger said.
The building, composed of Ryan and Mulledy Halls, was extensively renovated over a yearlong period as part of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement to house 385 more students on campus by the fall 2015 semester. The plan also includes the temporary conversion of the second floor of the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center into student dorms this year.
Although the interior construction of the FJR was completed during the summer, work on the exterior of the building has been delayed due to permit difficulties. Exterior construction will continue into early September.
The courtyard is slated for completion for halfway through the fall semester, while other construction on Dahlgren Quadrangle and the building’s historic staircase is expected to be completed around Thanksgiving. Once completed, the courtyard will feature barbecue pits and benches.
Each floor of the FJR has its own lounge area and kitchen. All suites in the building also include a furnished living room and kitchen, while semi-suites do not.
Office of Design and Construction Senior Project Architect Amy Sanderson said the construction team focused on making the dorms more technology-friendly.
“The complaints we hear from students a lot are [that] there’s not enough outlets, there’s not enough power and there’s not enough Wi-Fi,” Sanderson said. “We tried to make absolutely certain that we designed this so that it would allow the students to use all of the technology they wanted to use without being hindered by the building itself.”
The building’s first floor houses the statue of Mary of the Mystic Rose kept from the original building, which was built in 1830 and housed Jesuit priests until 2003.
The first floor also includes a nine-person suite, comprised of four doubles and one single. The laundry room is also housed on the first floor, in addition to the residence hall director’s office.
“This is … an existing building that had really, really nice space,” Sanderson said. “We tried to keep that as much as possible.”
The second floor features the Memorial Hall, a student lounge decorated with historical articles and pictures of the original building.
The hall contains a number of recreational elements, including a billiards table, two large flat-screen televisions and a catering room for special events.
“Memorial Hall was built as a Jesuit dining room, which is a big gorgeous space,” Sanderson said. “We wanted to keep the authenticity and the feeling of the building as much as we could.”
The collection was curated by Connor Maytnier (COL ’17), a resident assistant of the LLC. Maytnier served as the student representative on the design committee for the FJR for the past year and a half.
“My interest in the project goes back almost to the beginning,” Maytnier said. “Becoming a part of helping transform this building is when I decided to return as an RA.”
Other highlights of the building include three private balconies located on the third, fourth and fifth floors. Each balcony looks across the Potomac River toward Virginia, with views of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Thomas Jefferson Memorial and Washington Monument.
Both the building and courtyard are handicap-accessible, conforming to the regulations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Seven of the rooms also incorporate ADA-compliant GOCard swipe locks.
“This whole part of campus … has always been very difficult because of the terrain,” Barger said. “Now I think it will be much better for the students who need barrier-free access.”
New resident Vanessa Chapoy (COL ’18) said that she was drawn to the building because of its historical significance.
“I’m really big into history, and I love all the historic value that this building holds,” Chapoy said. “I love it. I thought [space] would be a problem, but the lofts actually allow you to stand up in them.”
Maytnier said that the RAs will host multiple programs each month for residents, including social and partner events with other campus resources. The LLC also has a focus on Jesuit principles such as ad majorem Dei gloriam, being women and men for others and educating the whole person.
“We’re going to be helping the entire building, as they develop a plan to host a program that is rooted in the tenets of the spirit of Georgetown,” Maytnier said.

I’m continually troubled by Georgetown’s plan to add new housing to campus, mostly because it’s incredibly unfair to a large amount of students. Living off campus is often a cheaper option than living on campus. For me, for example, I pay about 9k-10k to live off campus during the school year, whereas on campus I paid 11k. For a student on financial aid, like me, that’s a huge difference! 
This is also a question of quality and equality. There are horrible dorms on campus, dorms with mold, rats, and flies, yet Georgetown has made little to no effort to changing those dorms. My freshman year in Harbin, I constantly greeted gnats in the shower. My sophomore year, maintenance covered up a section of mold on the ceiling with a piece of cardboard. My junior year, my balcony fell through due to rain and there was a hole in our ceiling. 
There’s plenty of anecdotal evidence. Georgetown has a very difficult time keeping up with their current facilities. Additionally, it’s not fair that some students have to pay for forced triples and tiny, broken apartments while other students, who pay the same amount, get these luxurious living spaces, including the new dorm, the hotel, and this space. 
Were the cost a reflection of the quality of the dorm, however, a class issue would quickly arise, as poorer students would almost certainly be in the lower-quality dorms. 
Georgetown isn’t thinking straight on this issue. They’re rushing to get students off-campus and into dorms while the students who are currently on campus are suffering.

The Bulldog Tavern management team implemented new hiring and programming initiatives over the summer to improve the quality of the restaurant’s service and business operations.
The pub, which is owned by Bon Appetit, hired several new staff members, including two student bartenders, and hosted events to attract customers. In addition, the management launched new promotions and a greater variety of dining options.
The Bulldog Tavern Oversight Committee, a group of students, administrators and members of the pub management team, initially raised concerns about the restaurant’s service last year.
Joshua Shinbrot (COL ’16), a student member of the committee, said he noticed that service at Bulldog Tavern had remained mediocre since its opening in November.
“From the time the pub opened until the end of last year, the service was very poor,” Shinbrot wrote in an email to The Hoya. “If you sit at the bar, service is consistently good. However, if you’re sitting at a table, service is still not great. The food is … delivered to your table within a reasonable, but still above-average amount of time.”
Shinbrot also said that wait staff at Bulldog Tavern are not attentive enough to patrons.
“Servers could be better about refilling waters and drinks. Servers could also check on their tables more frequently. Oftentimes, Bulldog Tavern patrons will have to walk up to their server to request a check,” Shinbrot wrote.
Concerns about staffing were also made when a high-level manager of the pub was removed from his position over the summer. The management did not return Shinbrot’s inquiries regarding the details of the termination.
To overcome problems related to staffing and service, Bon Appetit hired two students to serve as bartenders.
One of the bartenders, Sam Kleinman (COL ’16), said that the restaurant team was accommodating when training new employees and that he enjoyed his experience as a bartender.
“I met several awesome supervisors and managers confronting challenges unique to running a restaurant on a college campus,” Kleinman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “[The team] has done a great job of matching inexperienced student servers and bartenders with experienced staff. For example, I have been trained over the past three months by two bartenders with over 16 years of experience between them.”
Kleinman noticed a higher number of visitors over the summer, following the additional hires.
“Anecdotally, I saw, on average, busier days at the end of the summer, rather than the beginning, and it certainly seemed that I had more tables and more guests as the summer went on,” Kleinman wrote.
“I definitely think that some of the improvements in service at the pub can be attributed to the hiring of the two new bartenders,” Shinbrot wrote. “They are both very attentive, but the other servers are of mixed quality.”
In addition to hiring more staff, the restaurant also hosted a series of events and promotions during the summer, including Sangria Night Thursdays, Friday Game Nights and other food and drinks specials.
According to Shinbrot, although the restaurant has increased its programming, plans to host a beer pong tournament at Bulldog Tavern were vetoed by a university administrator.
Shinbrot said that events such as the tournament would have attracted more student patrons to the restaurant.
“The university has stated that it wants to bring more student life onto campus. I don’t even like playing beer pong, but I just don’t see how the decision to prohibit the pub from hosting certain types of social events for [students over 21] helps bring more of student life onto campus,” Shinbrot wrote.
Many of the initiatives over the summer will be continued throughout the academic year, with further menu changes and promotions planned for the future.
In an email to The Hoya, Associate Vice President of Auxiliary Business Services Joelle Wiese mentioned a variety of the restaurant’s changes.
“Over the summer, we developed new menu items, like the fantastic crab dip, created new drinks and brainstormed [promotions] for the upcoming academic year,” Wiese wrote. “You will see new beers on the menu, new appetizers, a larger pizza and wing offering, along with very creative specialty cocktails in the days ahead.”
A request for comment on the restaurant’s profits over the summer was not returned at press time.
In addition, the restaurant will lengthen its hours of operation for the academic year and host programming on almost every day of the week.
“The kitchen is now open later. We started a pick-up window over the summer, and students can get coffee and awesome breakfast sandwiches in the morning,” Wiese wrote.
Despite the restaurant’s new developments, Shinbrot said that there are still many improvements to be made in order to ensure a high-quality dining experience for patrons.
“Service has improved, but it’s still not that great and if the pub wants to be successful, [it] will need to continue to make big improvements in quality and speed of service,” Shinbrot wrote. “I’m hopeful that early in the fall semester, I’ll be able to say that Bulldog Tavern is definitely worth a second try, or a first for those who have never been.”
Connor Joseph (COL ’16), a former member of the GUSA Dining Committee, said that despite the restaurant’s improved service, the management needs to reevaluate its dining options.
“I think their niche should focus more on down-home, diner-style food. They try to be The Tombs too much,” Joseph wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Bulldog Tavern has miles to go before it sleeps.”

This year’s Hollywood-themed New Student Orientation, “Hoyawood,” ran Aug. 29 to Sept. 2 with the participation of approximately 200 orientation advisors, the largest group yet.
The orientation program featured a variety of activities and events designed to introduce freshmen and transfer students to life on campus, including the mandatory campus sexual assault training session “I Am Ready.”
The program, which was introduced to NSO last year, allows new students to discuss the topic of sexual assault in small groups led by trained peers.
Bridget Morton (MSB ’16), one of the five NSO coordinators, praised the facilitators of “I Am Ready” for their work in educating new students about sexual assault.
“They do a beautiful job of helping ensure that new students have all the resources they need,” Morton said. “We really enjoyed our collaboration last year [and] we’re excited to be partnered with them again.”
Morton also noted some changes in this year’s NSO program, including a redesigned transfer student experience and the addition of student staff dedicated to the family orientation experience.
“That will be a newly revamped experience as well to make sure that all of our new families feel welcome,” Morton said. “This is going to be the best NSO ever. We’re really excited about it.”
One of NSO’s flagship events, the Marino Family International Writers’ Academic Workshop, will continue this year, featuring Sri Lankan novelist Romesh Gunesekera’s most recent novel, “Noontide Toll.” The workshop, which is funded by the family of Frederick Marino (SLL ’68), requires all incoming students to read a selected text by an international author and complete a reflective assignment.
During NSO, students had the opportunity to hear Gunesekera speak before they engaged in small group discussions of the novel and its themes.
Chosen by a committee of Georgetown faculty and staff members, this year’s novel tells the story of a minibus driver’s experiences with passengers in post-civil-war, post-tsunami Sri Lanka.
Coordinator of Communications, Outreach and Programming for Main Campus Libraries Jennifer Ann Smith said that it was a relatively easy choice for the committee to make.
“We found it at once funny and warm while also devastating in certain parts,” Smith said. “We thought it raised some very interesting questions and themes about journeys, history, civil war, privilege, inequality, tourism and truth. We just enjoyed reading it.”
Smith also described the workshop as a low-pressure opportunity for students to be introduced to a new culture and the many different perspectives that they will encounter during their time at Georgetown.
“Having the workshop as part of NSO really emphasizes the importance … of engaging with new ideas, some of which may be challenging,” Smith said.
Since the program began in 1995, each year’s novel has had an international focus to ensure that the text offers unique viewpoints beyond the canon of works that many students read in high school.
“For many students, it introduces not only a new culture, but often a whole new way of looking at the world,” Smith said. “We hope that this will help students look critically at their own lives and be more receptive to the new people and new perspectives they will undoubtedly run into.”
The Marino Workshop and its cousin program at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar are the only experience that directly unite all Georgetown students, as students from both schools read the same book.
Held on Monday night, another signature event during NSO was “Pluralism in Action,” a student performance designed to help incoming students explore issues of race, class, ethnicity, gender, religion and sexual orientation.
The performance is followed by small group discussions to encourage students to engage in dialogue in a comfortable setting.
Across the globe, NSO at the School of Foreign Service in Qatar welcomed 70 first-year students and three exchange students from Aug. 16 to 20.
Led by three student coordinators and 22 orientation advisors, the “Dancing Through the Decades”- themed orientation aimed to familiarize students with the resources available on the Doha campus.
“It will instill the Georgetown values and principles by creating opportunities for them to become independent creative thinkers and responsible global citizens,” student development officer Indee Thotawattage (SFS-Q ’14) said.
The SFS-Q NSO featured information sessions on a variety of services, as well as “Pluralism in Action” and a new student convocation that featured a video message from University President John J. DeGioia and an address by the SFS-Q Dean Gerd Nonneman.
Thotawattage said that one of the more meaningful activities at the Qatar NSO is the Social Justice Dinner, in which students share a meal with service providers and custodial staff.
“This enables students to get to know members of the extended SFS-Q community that they otherwise wouldn’t get a chance to interact with,” Thotawattage wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Such activities … enable new students to grapple with Jesuit values such as ‘women and men for others’ and ‘community in diversity.’”

The School of Foreign Service awarded Cole Horton (SFS ’18) an Improving the Human Condition grant to construct an agricultural plot at an orphanage in Haiti this summer.
Each summer, the SFS allocates grants of up to $3,000 to students whose unpaid internships or research assistantships seek to improve the lives of others. Priority is given to short-term, hands-on projects incorporating international travel, according to SFS Associate Dean Anthony Pirrotti.
“The idea was that the money would give SFS students a little more flexibility for their summer sessions,” Pirrotti said. “They could use the time to pursue good causes, causes that link with the university’s mission to do good in the world around us and to continue our mission to serve other people. It would free them from the constraints of only looking for positions that paid.”
Applications for the grant begin spring semester, and selections are made by a committee by the end of April. The number of grants offered per year varies, as funding is sourced from both the SFS and external donors. Thirty grants were awarded this year.
“This is a really great opportunity for students in the School of Foreign Service, and we would encourage more students to apply,” Pirrotti said. “In the past, students have done projects that range from working with refugees to working on immigration issues to State Department internships. … There’s quite a lot of latitude in terms of what’s available to students.”
As a recipient of one of this year’s grants, Horton led a group of 18 students from his high school, Deerfield Academy, in Deerfield, Mass. to an orphanage in Kenscoff, Haiti during the first two weeks of June. The orphanage, called a creche, is operated by humanitarian organization Chances for Children. Around 60 children live in the adoption center.
“From talking with the staff from Chances for Children, it became clear that they were spending a lot of money on transportation and storage of food,” Horton said. “They’ll buy a lot of rice and beans, which is filling, but not nutritious, and after months of the same diet a lot of orphans end up getting sick. I was trying to think of a project that would either minimize the costs of purchasing food or increase the variety in diets.”
For the past four years, Horton has worked with Chances for Children to construct a tiered agricultural plot at the creche. The plot, which is now 5,000 square feet, aims to decrease the orphanage’s operating costs, increase the nutritional value of the children’s diets and make the center more sustainable.
“They wouldn’t have to transport their food, they wouldn’t have to buy it all, they could just buy the seeds and hopefully cultivate it every growing season,” Horton said. “There’s no electricity or energy that needs to be put into it, just gravity. They’re growing 13 different vegetables. Cabbages, carrots, things like that, which are too expensive for the orphanage to buy in bulk in local markets in Haiti.”
Horton highlighted several issues Haiti faces in terms of food access and his hope that the agricultural plot could serve to alleviate these challenges.
“For Haiti, the key problem is that there’s not enough access to food,” Horton said. “On top of that, it’s the people who need it the most that don’t have enough money to buy it, and Haiti has such a large population in such a small space. … I was fortunately able to design a project that I felt addressed those three issues and provided at least a partial solution to each.”
The majority of the funds allocated by the grant went to purchasing materials for the project, including piping, seeds and gardening tools. Older orphans living at the center will also use these supplies for vocational training.
“The older orphans, who are probably not going to be adopted, will have to leave the orphanage at some point,” Horton said. “The goal is to help them have some sort of skill in gardening so that they can support themselves, if they end up on their own without any money to buy food.”
Claire Koeppel, a rising sophomore at Deerfield Academy, was a member of the group that travelled to Kenscoff this summer. Koeppel emphasized the group’s goal to have a lasting impact on the children at the orphanage.
“It’s like that old adage, ‘If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime,’” Koeppel said. “I think the main goals were to build the vegetable garden, of course, and to give a lot of extra love and hugs to the orphans there — everyone was really excited to see them — as well as to be involved in something that is much bigger than what we experience at home.”

Skizzy Mars and Louisa Wendorff will headline the second annual Kickback Music Festival, hosted by the Students of Georgetown, Inc. in conjunction with the Georgetown Program Board and Georgetown Week of Welcome, Sept. 12.
This year’s event, which will take place on Copley Lawn, will also feature nine student performances, an increase from last year’s lineup of a total seven bands.
Expanding on the event’s billing as a music and arts festival, student art exhibitions will be on display at the festival this year. Submissions will be available through the festival’s website and Facebook page.
Running from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m., the festival will begin with performances from student bands such as Faces for Radio, Sam & Hannah, Giant’s Causeway and Bulldog Alley Alleycats.
Following a headlining performance and 30-minute break, the festival will continue with student acts such as Tigers Are Bad For Horses, DJAllen, Deuce B and Keylow before concluding with the second headliner.
Director of Kickback Cameron Smith (MSB ’16) said that it is important to showcase the student body’s artistic talent at Kickback.
“It is our vision for Kickback to be an outlet into a diversity of student lives [and] to show how awesome and creative our students can be early in the academic year when people are thinking about their place at Georgetown,” Smith said.
The two headlining acts, Skizzy Mars and Louisa Wendorff, will each perform for an hour. A 23-year-old rapper from Manhattan, Mars is best known for his alternative hip-hop EP “The Red Balloon Project,” which was released earlier this year. Meanwhile, Wendorff is a pop singer who rose to stardom with a YouTube mashup of Taylor Swift’s songs.
Like last year, there will be four food trucks at Healy Circle, as well as cupcakes from Baked & Wired.
Attendees will also have the opportunity to receive giveaways from companies like Zipcar and Down Dog Yoga, as well as the chance to win tickets to the upcoming Landmark Music Festival in West Potomac Park.
Smith said that he hopes these new additions will create a more unique festival experience.
“We would love to see people bring blankets, lawn games, signs and wear crazy stuff,” Smith said.
The Corp’s new partnership with GPB and GWOW for this event will help ensure that Kickback has a permanent place in the university’s calendar.
Smith said that the groups provided helpful contributions to the Kickback team.
“We thought this would be the best way to help us solidify a really special event as a tradition in the early fall at Georgetown,” Smith said. “GPB and GWOW have contributed invaluable expertise in event planning and music knowledge to help us put on the best version of Kickback possible.”
According to GPB Marketing Chair Jessica Scoratow (SFS ’18), the organization was involved in planning many logistical aspects of the event, including ticketing, sponsorships, contracting and selecting the headlining artists.
“Kickback is more than just a music festival. It’s a celebration of art and its diversity,” Scoratow wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Before your first essay for the semester, or your first all-nighter, or your first venture into [Lauinger Library], Kickback is the perfect opportunity to relax and welcome a new year on the Hilltop.”
Smith also said that he hopes the timing of Kickback will provide students with a break from academic and professional pursuits.
“We want this date because it will be smack in the middle of recruiting season for every on-campus club and activity,” Smith said. “Maybe someone who goes to Kickback takes time to look at the arts community instead of just joining a club that promises better job placement four years down the road.”
Paul Henderson (COL ’18) said that he will likely attend the event because of its timing at the beginning of the year.
“I think Kickback is cool because it gives students a really fun, high-energy event at the beginning of the year, before schoolwork gets more intense,” Henderson said. “I dig that there’s a concert for me to look forward to from the moment I get to campus, [for which] I don’t have to plan much.”
Tickets are priced at $10 and will be available for sale next week.
Clarification: The university has yet to approve the headlining acts.

The Georgetown Lombardi Cancer Center will collaborate with the John Theurer Cancer Center of Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey to form a cancer consortium through a joint clinical research program.
The idea for the partnership was developed in 2011 during a meeting between executives at the Lombardi Center, the only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center based in D.C., and the JTCC, the highest-ranked cancer center in New Jersey.
“It quickly became evident that significant potential synergies existed between the respective cancer centers,” Lombardi Center Director Louis Weiner, MD, wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These discussions led to a formal affiliation and a plan to create an NCI-approved consortium that unifies the research programs under the auspices of Lombardi’s NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center designation.”
The cancer centers will focus on four broad areas of cancer research and treatment, namely stem cell transplant research, the development of new cancer-treating drugs, immunotherapy and population science.
Weiner emphasized the benefits each cancer center can confer upon the others, highlighting shared expertise in a variety of clinical research areas.
“Lombardi and JTCC share interests and strengths in many areas of cancer care and research, such as gastrointestinal cancers, lung cancers and in harnessing the power of the immune system to attack and control cancers,” Weiner wrote. “Working together, we can accelerate progress and offer our patients tomorrow’s treatments today.”
Hackensack University President and CEO Robert Garrett agreed that both medical centers contribute particular strengths to their joint cancer research and treatment programs.
“Hackensack University Medical Center has always focused on excellence in patient care and investing in research and technology for the future,” Garrett said. “For this partnership, we are combining our strength in clinical care with Georgetown Lombardi’s strong research base that significantly contributes to its clinical excellence. By working together, we will elevate our cancer research to offer more treatment options for tomorrow’s patients.”
The timing of the partnership is ideal due to current innovations in the industry, according to the JTCC’s Division of Lymphoma Chief Andre Goy.
“Together, our institutions carry a tremendous opportunity to be transformative for our cancer patients’ population and beyond,” Goy said. “The timing of this joint effort could not be better given the definitely revolutionary changes occurring in cancer care. The chosen founding projects are well-positioned to take advantage of the synergy between our institutions and illustrate our commitment to discovering better care for the future.”
Through the partnership, the JTCC will achieve NCI designation once the consortium is approved by the NCI, which would allow the center to receive grants from the institute for cancer research.
“The JTCC will be a part of the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center,” Weiner wrote. “The process for approval is quite rigorous and will require that we demonstrate meaningful research collaborations and accomplishments by the next time (2018) we submit our competitive Cancer Center Support Grant renewal to the NCI.”
Clinical Outcomes Tracking & Analysis Platform, a cancer patient treatment and outcomes database developed by the JTCC, will aid the centers in their partnership.
“COTA is able to extract deep and rich clinical and economic data from cancer patients’ medical records and history and organize the data so that clinical research at both institutions can be performed,” COTA CEO Eric Schultz and COTA Chief Medical Officer Stuart Goldberg wrote in an email.
Weiner stressed that COTA will assist both centers on all four of the broad research topics the centers plan to cover.
“COTA is a powerful ‘big data’ tool that ‘sorts’ patients into definable niches to rigorously identify patients who might benefit from defined therapies, to follow the outcomes of these patients and to examine the actual costs of care for these patients,” Weiner wrote. “It thus can support each of the four broad initiatives we have identified.”
COTA’s assistance will be particularly useful in the area of population science, according to Schultz and Goldberg.
“Building on the strengths of Georgetown’s population science division, COTA will facilitate the collection of data at both institutions to support several projects surrounding breast cancer diagnosis, physician attitudes toward genetic profiling, and a proposed collaborative project on financial toxicity from a patient’s perspective in hematologic malignancies,” Schultz and Goldberg wrote.
The formation of an NCI consortium will allow for advancements in cancer treatment that benefit patients of both hospitals, according to Weiner.
“As an NCI-designated consortium we will have the size and scope to effectively compete for access to the most exciting new treatment ideas and agents so that we can have maximum impact to benefit people living in our respective regions of service,” Weiner wrote.
