Many members of the university community have gathered in the wake of the Sept. 22 suicide of a Rutgers University freshman, as part of an effort to prevent instances of anti-LGBTQ bias on the Hilltop.
Tyler Clementi committed suicide after his roommate video-streamed his sexual encounter with another man online.
Rehana Mohammed (SFS ’12), co-programming chair for GU Pride, said that the news of Clementi’s death was difficult to comprehend.
“It’s a horrifying crime that was committed against him and even more horrifying was the fact that he felt that he had to take his own life to get rid of the shame that surrounded him because of the event,” Mohammed said.
Clementi’s roommate Dharun Ravi, 18, and Molly Wei, 18, were both charged with two counts of invasion of privacy and could potentially be charged with bias intimidation, according to CNN.
Under New Jersey law, to be found guilty of bias intimidation, a person must commit a crime with the intent to intimidate someone based on their race, religion, gender, color, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, ethnicity or national origin.
In an email sent out Friday, the LGBTQ Resource Center offered support for students who are struggling with the recent series of LGBTQ-related suicides across the country. 13-year-old Seth Walsh, of Tehachapi, Calif., Billy Lucas, 15, of Greensburg, Ind., and Asher Brown, a 13-year-old from the Houston suburbs, are believed to have committed suicide in recent weeks after persistent bullying by their peers.
“We must stand together to support those individuals who are negatively affected or in crisis because of the words or actions of others,” the email said.
James Saucedo (MSB ’13), co-chair of Leaders in Education About Diversity, a university initiative that seeks to educate about diversity and identity, said that these events are effects of a culture that does not always accept diversity.
“These incidents are linked to the stigmatizing of non-heterosexual people that most American children face growing up,” Saucedo said, “Clementi was taught to be ashamed of his gay identity. That shame was reinforced by his community in the form of his roommate who thought it funny to secretly video his encounters with another man and spread the video on the Internet.”
Saucedo said the nature of the socialization of American youth can contribute to these outbreaks of bias behavior.
“Unfortunately this socialization begins in childhood and by the time folks reach a college campus, that heterosexist thinking is deeply ingrained in the mind and reinforced by structures around us.”
Subbaraman said that she wants students to know there are resources and a supportive community available on campus.
“We have worked very hard on the Georgetown campus to make sure that our students feel heard, safe and included,” the center said in an email.”We can, and we must work toward creating an environment where all members of the LGBTQ community do not feel they are alone, and where bullying, harassment and any form of harm are not acceptable.”
Despite these efforts by the LGBTQ Resource Center on campus, some students said they still feel that Georgetown needs to improve open communication on these issues.
“I think that hate crimes in general – and any other prejudice act – is something that is not really discussed at Georgetown,” Mohammed said, “I think that the administration should take preemptive steps to support the community before we are victim to the same tragedy.”

Economics professor Arik Levinson is taking a break from the classroom this academic year to assume a temporary post on the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers researching environmental economics.
William Jack, an associate professor of economics, will act as the director of undergraduate studies position during Levinson’s sabbatical.
“This is a great position, and [it] reflects the high quality of his policy-relevant research in the field of environmental economics and the high regard in which his scholarship is held in the profession,” Jack said in an email.
Levinson’s students at Georgetown said that he was particularly skilled at boiling down complex economic theory when they had difficulty with the subject.
“He was always able to break things down visually and into simpler concepts,” Todd Liipfert
(COL ’12), who took his Principles of Microeconomics class last year, said. “I thought he was really good at making the knowledge accessible to people who really weren’t that economically inclined.”
The council took notice of Levinson for his scholarship and policy work. Levinson has published 28 journal articles, 17 chapters in books and three working papers, most of them about environmental policy. He is also co-editor of the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and is on the economics advisory panel of the National Science Foundation, among other posts.
The Council of Economic Advisers is an executive agency that gives the president guidance on domestic and international economic policy. Levinson is one of the council’s eight senior economists, most of whom are also university professors.
According to Marcia Suss, administrative officer of the department of economics, the appointment will not be permanent.
While no other Georgetown economics professors have been appointed to the council recently, a number of professors from other departments have received appointments to posts in other agencies. According to Jack, other economics professors have been selected for senior jobs in the Department of the Treasury as well as other agencies.
University spokeswoman Julie Bataille also pointed to professors including Madeleine Albright, Victor Cha, Don McHenry and Viet Dinh who have held White House positions, mostly in the foreign affairs sector.
“Georgetown has a long record of faculty members who take a leave to perform public service and then return to the university upon completion of this work,” Bataille said in an email. “One of the benefits of Georgetown’s location in Washington, D.C., and faculty expertise across a range of policy areas is [students’] ability to take advantage of these opportunities to enrich one’s experiences in and out of the classroom.”
Levinson served as an associate professor at Georgetown from 2000 to 2009, and was promoted to full professor last year. He had previously taught at the University of Wisconsin. At Georgetown, Levinson taught Principles of Microeconomics, Environmental Economics, a tutorial for seniors writing theses in economics and a graduate class in public finance.
Levinson declined to comment due to a White House Council of Economic Advisers policy.

The D.C. health system, which includes the Georgetown University Hospital, has been ranked last nationally in both hospital quality and customer satisfaction by a health care insurance services company, despite the positive reputation of many of the hospitals in the area.
In addition, the Washington-Baltimore metropolitan area ranked 40th among the 50 largest metropolitan areas of the United States in hospital quality, and 42nd in customer satisfaction, according to the Washington Business Journal.
The report was compiled using rankings from the Hospital Quality Alliance’ Hospital Compare All Payer Database and the Hospital Consumer Assessment in overall care, cardiac care, major cardiac surgery, orthopedic care, major orthopedic surgery, neurological care, major neuro-surgery, cancer care and pulmonary care.
The Washington-Baltimore metropolitan area studied in the survey ranked poorly across the board, ranking lower than 30th place in seven out of the eight rankings. The only exception was a 19th spot in neurological care.
Ratings are much higher for Georgetown University Hospital, however. U.S. News & World Report ranks the GU Hospital as 32nd out of 1,472 in the nation for adult gynecology.
The hospital was also ranked highly by customers, with 69 percent of patients giving the hospital the highest or a very high ranking, and only 7 percent giving it a low ranking, according to U.S. News and World Report. Seventy-five percent of patients would definitely recommend the hospital to family and friends, and only 4 percent probably or definitely would not, according to the U.S. News and World Report.
Some possible solutions to improving the D.C. medical system involve upgrading technology, according to the Washington Business Journal. D.C. was rated 49th among U.S. states in the use of computerized medical records, which the Washington Business Journal attributed to medical professionals in the region working in small groups rather than large hospitals.
The journal argued that the costs of installing electronic medical records in such clusters would be extremely difficult due to a loss of efficiency and funds during the installation of technology.
The rankings proved worrisome to some who get treatment at area hospitals.
“[Last in the nation] is a scary number,” Maura Welch (SFS ’11) said. “I’d really like to find out if any hospitals in the area are outliers from that ranking, because that’s really scary.”
Others did not see the ranking as directly affecting their medical status, however.
“I go home for all of my medical procedures anyway,” Melanie Pitkin (SFS ’11) said.
The rankings were compiled by CareChex, a company that ranks hospitals based on health care quality. CareChex is part of Delta Group, the largest private health care information service in the United States, according to CareChex’s website.
The Medical Center’s Communications Office was unavailable for comment.

Born deaf to parents who are deaf and the product of a bilingual household communicating in both English and American Sign Language, Carol Padden is a 1978 graduate of Georgetown, where she pursued a major in linguistics and an minor in psychology. After graduating from the university, she earned a doctorate in linguistics from the University of California, San Diego, and has been a professor there since 1983. Padden’s research focuses on sign language structure and deaf culture and community, and she received a boost recently when she was named a 2010 MacArthur Foundation “genius award” winner, for which she will receive a $500,000 grant to use at her discretion. THE HOYA caught up with Padden over the phone in between conference stops in Indianapolis and Denmark to hear about her time at Georgetown, her work and what she plans to do with the unexpected grant.
 
 
 
You were born deaf to parents who are deaf and say you were raised in deaf culture – what was it like to enter public school for the first time at age 8 and be totally immersed in the hearing world for the first time?
 
 
 
It was a bit of a culture shock, I’ll say that. I had been going to a deaf school where there were small classes before [I attended] public schools. It was just a matter of adjusting to a very different type of educational setting. I didn’t have an interpreter – they didn’t provide interpreters until after I graduated high school. It was [difficult] trying to learn spoken English well enough to get along in a new school, to make friends. My family and I had decided to try it for one year on a trial basis and if it didn’t work out I could go back. But I guess it worked out. I remained at my neighborhood school until I graduated in 1973.
 
 
 
 
 
As a member of the deaf community, what inspired you to devote your professional and academic career to studying deaf culture and signed languages?
 
 
 
I’ve always wanted to explain something that was unusual and show how it was completely ordinary at the same time. I don’t like to describe something as exotic or special. I’ve always wanted to describe a way of life that I think is completely ordinary and explain how a sign language can develop.
 
 
 
What was your favorite aspect of Georgetown while you were here?
 
 
 
Well, I have to say the linguistics department was what I was looking for . solid training in linguistics. It was a fairly new discipline at the time I started in 1974. Ideas were changing about language and cognition. There was a lot more emphasis on thinking about language and mind and the theoretical aspects of language. Not just descriptions of language but on how humans view language, how we acquire competence, and how language changes over time. Georgetown was one of the best places to get training in that area, so I decided I’d move back home, transfer to Georgetown, and I was just delighted I was accepted. I was maybe 19. I was absolutely certain this was what I wanted my career to be, and the training I got prepared me really well for graduate school.
 
 
 
I’ve been in a faculty position at the University of California, San Diego, now for 27 years – it just doesn’t feel that long. It’s just an exciting place to be. I think having the solid background I got from Georgetown made all of that possible.
 
 
 
 
 
What went through your head when you found out you won a MacArthur “genius grant”?
 
 
 
You know I was doing something completely trivial when my phone rang. The interpreter came on and said that a man was calling from the MacArthur Foundation, so I had a few moments of confusion thinking, `Why would they be calling me?’ Then he asked me if I was alone. It felt like a lightning bolt. I was just completely and utterly caught off guard. I didn’t expect it at all. And then when he told me about the award, I couldn’t think of anything to say. The interpreter sat there and I couldn’t think of anything else to say. I was of course very happy and very, very surprised. And they went on and said I could tell one other person and just one person, so of course I had to tell my husband. I couldn’t tell my parents, I couldn’t tell my daughter. So after I hung up, I called my husband and I told him what I had won, and, you know, he threw up his hands and he covered his eyes and said, `Oh my God, I can’t believe this! This is wonderful! This is spectacular!’ And I thought, `That was the reaction I should have had!’ I was completely, completely stunned.
 
 
 
 
 
One of the most unique and important aspects of the grant is that it comes “no strings attached” – there is no reporting to do or hoops to jump through. Does this type of freedom inspire creativity and new ways of thinking or do you find it difficult to manage?
 
 
 
ost people get this grant at the beginning of their career. I’m getting it at what I think is one of the most exciting times in my career, and I can’t think of better timing. I’ve had a lot of ideas about looking at new sign languages in different places. I’m interested in modeling how languages emerge, develop and become conventionalized.
 
 
 
I’ve had a lot of ideas over the years, and I think, `You know, that’s pretty hard to get funding for’ or I don’t have it entirely worked out. You’re given the freedom to write, think about new directions, and maybe poke a little deeper into an idea you’ve just developed. You can even develop an entirely new direction in your work. It’s just a tremendous opportunity, and I’m very glad to have it at this point in my career.
 
 
 
 
 
What do you hope to accomplish after utilizing the MacArthur grant?
 
 
 
You know, I don’t have a grand plan right now. I want to do it step by step. I usually start with an observation or something that sort of captures my eye and I think how does that work? How would I explain it? What kind of theoretical apparatus would I need to make this come to life? So I really do my work step by step.
You really need to make clear about where you’re going and what steps to take next. I’ve always done that, so this is something I saw, maybe out in the field, an unusual way of using sign language and I think: `Why did they do that? Why did something like this come about? What would I need to be able to define it? So I will come back and play in my laboratory and think about who I need to talk to. What do I need to read? What do I need to learn in order to describe these things that I just observed?’
 
 
 
And then I start to put it together and I start to make a story out of it. Sometimes it becomes a book. Sometimes it becomes a series of articles. Sometimes it becomes a grant. I’ve been doing this long enough that I have a lot of instincts about what to do next, what to do after that. I try not to get too far ahead of myself. I really try [to] stay focused on an immediate goal in order to achieve a larger one.

Generally, Facebook relates to school only when students sit in the back of the classroom, smoothly transitioning from laptop note-taking to an in-depth look at friends’ latest updates. But as faculty have learned of social media’s possibilities, a growing number of instructors are asking students to log on for class purposes.
Some professors still see Facebook as strictly a student space, while others say that using Facebook for assignments adds an extra something to the classroom dynamic.
Daniel Porterfield, senior vice president for strategic development and a professor in the English department, has used Facebook regularly since he first registered this summer.
“In the first years I viewed Facebook as a student play-space that professors might visit from time to time but should respectfully leave to those for whom it was designed,” Porterfield said.
Nonetheless, 10 years after it was founded, over 500 million users and a blockbuster film later, Facebook’s versatility has evolved.
“I made the decision to join with the primary purpose of using some of its function as an extension of my teaching and mentoring ” Porterfield says.
Porterfield posts about two or threeitems per week and checks his news feed to keep in touch with young alumni. “It helps me as an educator to be better informed about the ways 18-to-30 year-olds are using social networks,” Porterfield said.
Other professors have experimented with the site to increase student engagement.
Students who have interacted with instructors on Facebook said they benefit from the experience. Last year, Matt Bakios (SFS ’12) took a Chinese course in which his teacher, Juei-Chen Hsiao, asked students to post on her Facebook wall for assignments.
“I was originally a little worried that she had access to my Facebook profile, but it was never a problem. I actually really liked using Facebook and found it not only beneficial but also easier and less confusing than posting on Blackboard,” Bakios said.
While Bakios has never had teachers use Facebook to announce assignments, he said that Facebook’s organizational features would help students track coursework.
“I use Facebook so frequently, and it automatically sends updates to my phone. It would definitely help me stay organized,” Bakios said.
Many others see the potential in Facebook and other social media sites to bridge the student-faculty gap beyond the confines of an academic building.
Andrea Rahardja (COL ’13) said Facebook would be a more efficient classroom supplement than Blackboard.
“While I’ve had teachers use Blackboard as an avenue to generate
discussion outside of class, you only have to take one look at the [numbers] of
students using Facebook to know how much easier it would be for engaging in conversations,” she said.
Yet even with all of the potential for touching base and easing communication flow, many professors feel that it is only appropriate to keep their distance.
Until last year, Bettye Chambers, a professor in the Italian department, used Facebook for class discussion, but she made the switch to Blackboard for pragmatic reasons. Whereas all Georgetown students are registered to use the virtual learning tool, not all of her pupils had Facebook accounts.
Chambers said she regrets becoming “friends” with her students through Facebook.
“I was such a novice to Facebook. Once I was `friends’ with my students, I got all of this garbage from the news feed, and little by little I was blocking everybody,” she said. “I was inundated with all of this stuff.”
University Provost James O’Donnell says that he does not direct faculty on whether or not to integrate social media in curricula.
“I’m all in favor of using all available tools wisely, but I don’t want to dictate particular things,” O’Donnell said in an email. “The same tool can be wonderfully empowering in one class and an annoying distraction in another.”
Professors like Sharon Leon, professor in the American Studies Program, have opted for a third way. Leon began using a blog in her classes in the late ’90s, rather than resort to Blackboard.
“A significant component of
writing for every student for the semester takes place on the blog,” she said.
Although she uses blogs in all her courses, she said that she is conscious of the distinction between Facebook’s social and academic functions.
Leon said she does not connect with her students on Facebook in order to avoid what she calls “the creepy tree-house effect,” a term that describes the feeling in students when they know professors are virtually looking over their shoulders online.
“One of the bonuses of Facebook for undergrads is that it is a space where they can all be safely among themselves,” Leon said.
With the proliferation of professor and administrator accounts, however, Leon’s conception of a students-only Facebook may be a fading
reality.

Pink lahhafs and tables piled with cookies, cakes iced pink and cupcakes rivaling D.C.’s Georgetown Cupcakes filled the SFS-Qatar campus this week in a fundraising event for breast cancer.
Organized by Arwa Elsanosi Mohamed (SFS-Q ’14), a volunteer for Think Pink Qatar, a nonprofit organization that works to raise awareness about breast cancer, the bake sale on Oct. 3 featured tasty treats and head scarves in breast cancer pink.
Mohamed and other Georgetown students and staff, in addition to representatives from Think Pink Qatar, sold the confections to a crowd of students, faculty and staff, kicking off Breast Cancer Awareness Month. At the end of the day, they raised over $270, all of which will go toward the Qatar National Cancer Society. Mohamed’s work is unique, as breast cancer is a taboo subject in some Middle Eastern cultures.
“On a more personal level, one of my strongest motivations for raising awareness about breast cancer stems from the fact that my own aunt passed away three months ago due to the disease. Being able to witness what it felt like for a family to cope when a member got afflicted, I can understand just how hard such an experience can be,” Mohamed said.
Elena Lopez Khoury, who works at the SFS-Q’s Student Wellness and Counseling Center, helped with the bake sale.
“I have been amazed at Arwa’s enthusiasm and commitment to the cause, and I truly feel it has inspired so many others. This was evident in both the outpouring of generosity from staff, faculty and students (some even outside of GU-Q) to bake and provide goods for the bake sale, as well as the extreme generosity of those who not only purchased the baked goods but donated additional money for this worthy cause,” she said.
Apart from the bake sale, Mohamed is gearing up for another Think Pink Qatar event, a walk along the corniche (a walkway in Gulf countries along the sea) with an entire team from SFS-Q. This year, the walk will be held on Oct. 29 with a focus on how breast cancer can also affect men.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has pledged to serve as the legislative roadblock to greater D.C. autonomy, pending a Republican takeover of the House of Representatives this November.
As a ranking member of the House’s Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service and the District of Columbia, Chaffetz has a direct role in drafting legislation affecting the District, but the Democratic congressional majority in the 111th Congress has prevented him from making any major overhauls.
If the Republicans take the majority, however, Chaffetz will become the head of the subcommittee, a title that will allot him the power to silence D.C.’s continuing quest for representation in the federal government.
Though he has only been on Capitol Hill for two years, Chaffetz has already opposed a bill that would give D.C. a congressional vote, opposed a bill that would give the city more autonomy and introduced legislation that would force city officials to put gay marriage up to a referendum vote.
For Chaffetz, the question of D.C. representation is not even a question at all.
“The Constitution explicitly says that voting rights are reserved for the several states,” he told the Washington City Paper in an interview.
Chaffetz believes that the 600,000 citizens of D.C. do deserve to have some kind of voice. However, his proposal is to make a good chunk of residential D.C. part of Maryland.
“Not only could they have two senators, but they could have a voting member and a state legislature,” Chaffetz told the City Paper in the same interview.
Whether or not D.C. residents would be interested in joining the Chesapeake Bay State, Chaffetz’s proposal is not likely to be adopted without bipartisan support. A more likely scenario is that D.C.’s hopes of a congressional vote would be buried under Chaffetz. Though the city does have a House delegate – Democrat Eleanor Norton has held the position since 1991 – the city does not have a vote in House floor votes, and it does not have representation in the Senate. Norton has tried to introduce legislation to change that fact, but each time it has fizzled out, including a bill in 2009 that was passed by the Senate, but not by the House.
When asked for their opinions on D.C.’s bizarre political situation, Georgetown students generally opposed Chaffetz’s agenda for city voting rights.
“They’re citizens of the United States,” Sooji Kim (COL ’13) said of D.C. residents. “They pay taxes and do everything that other citizens do, but they don’t get any representation,” he said.
Stephen Collier (MSB ’12) echoed Kim’s sentiments, adding that he thinks meticulous federal control over the District seems excessive.
“I feel like it’s kind of a waste of federal government attention since D.C. is such a small part of the country,” he said.
Whether or not Chaffetz will gain leadership of the House subcommittee remains to be seen. With Democrats making a charge for their continued majority, Republicans must work hard if they want to take back the House. If they do, though, D.C. residents may have to wait a while before they can claim their long coveted Congressional vote.
According to James Marshall (SFS ’13), this is not necessarily a bad thing.
“If D.C. gets real representation, they’ll have to change everyone’s license plates,” he said.

A trio of leaders in web journalism and marketing – including Arianna Huffington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post – headlined a panel discussion before a crowd of almost 100 engaged audience members in the Leavey Center on Monday.
Huffington, Eric Hippeau, Huffington Post chief executive editor, and Kara Swisher (SFS ’84), co-executive editor of the Wall Street Journal’s “All Things Digital” website, provided their insight on the web revolution and the vitality of the Internet today.
Swisher, a prominent online journalist and former reporter for THE HOYA, kicked off the event by reflecting on her transition from a career as a print journalist to one as a blogger for the Wall Street Journal.
“I thought that newspaper and print journalism cared more about the media than the message,” Swisher said. “Traditional journalism has a fake objectivity.”
With blogging, she said, journalists are able to give reported analysis and express an informed opinion.
Huffington echoed Swisher’s thoughts on news media’s evolution from the page to the computer screen.
“The whole conversation was moving online,” she said when explaining her decision to create the web’s first-ever online newspaper. “Facts are sacred, but facts should not prevent us from clear commentary.”
Huffington went on to cite her mother as her inspiration for blogging and her mission in online reporting.
“She had no sense of hierarchy,” Huffington said. “She just believed that everyone should be able to converse with each other, no matter one’s social standing.”
Professor Gregory Coleman, a graduate professor in the McDonough School of Business, invited the speakers as a part of his class, “Special Topics: Internet Advertising and Marketing,” in the hope that students would form bonds and learn from the speakers’ experiences.
“The human relationship has a tremendous impact on your future,” Coleman said at the start of the event. “The relationships you develop over time are just as important – I personally think even more important – as the things you learn in class.”
All three speakers support Huffington’s ideal of community commitment, which calls for business ventures – specifically on the Internet – to be centered on a passion and a commitment to the worldwide
community.
“It is a constant job to earn and keep the trust of our readers,” Huffington said.
Hippeau agreed. “What is your passion, what is your ideal? Money doesn’t come first. Those questions do,” he said. “Character, personality and timing – these are the keys to starting and impacting business.”
The audience included mostly graduate-level audience members, the majority of whom were students in Coleman’s class. Two different student project groups presented their own ideas and thoughts on Internet business and marketing and received direct feedback from the high-powered professionals.
Even the audience members who are not enrolled in the marketing class said they enjoyed the discussion. Tierney Sneed (COL ’11) said the event was worth attending.
“Though I am not an avid reader of The Huffington Post, I am considering pursuing journalism after college and appreciate the move toward Internet-based writing,” Sneed said. “While what Arianna Huffington had to say was interesting, I found Kara Swisher extremely illuminating, especially when she discussed the trends she sees developing in the world of technology.”
As rain poured outside Monday morning, Swisher summed up the impact of the digital world in humanity. “[The Internet] is a haiku of human emotions, seen in the ubiquity and sharing of information around the globe. Digital access is vital to the advancement of our community.”

The newly elected senators of Georgetown University Student Association marked their official entrance into student government by setting an agenda and goals for the upcoming year on Sunday afternoon.
GUSA’s primary aim for the year will be reforming the student activities fee, a $100 sum charged to students as part of their tuition. When the fee was introduced in 2001 via referendum, GUSA leaders hoped interest would accrue to reach $10 million, but as of now the return has been minimal, according to Interim GUSA Senate Speaker Chris Pigott (COL ’12). This year, GUSA will attempt to reform the fee so that students gain a greater return on their investment. Students will be asked to participate in a referendum in late fall.
Other issues that GUSA plans to address are Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle bus weekend funding, the university’s green initiative, student space, advocacy and student safety, among others.
Pigott, who represents the Nevils district, said that he plans to focus much of his attention on student safety and student activities for this coming year.
“We are going to hit the ground running,” he said. “Regular meetings are important in staying up to date on issues. A big part of this is talking to the administration.”
With new, enthusiastic faces joining their ranks, veteran senators are eager to begin substantive work.
“This is a big year with a lot of good things ahead,” Sen. Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) said. “All the seats are filled, and there is a good crop of freshmen. Maintaining this [level of participation] will lead to a very productive year.”
While the new senators are excited to begin the new term, student turnout in last week’s election may indicate student apathy. In the election for the Village A E-H district, which Zoe Walpole (SFS ’13) won, only about 5.5 percent percent of residents voted. In the Henle 1-48 district, won by Brendhan Haas (COL ’12), the percentage only rose to about 6.5 percent of residents. The highest turnout was in Copley Hall, with roughly 68 percent.

When government professor Marc Busch read in Forbes that his “Business, Government and the Global Economy” was named one of the year’s 10 most innovative business school classes, he said he was surprised – even if there was rumor the honor was on its way.
The first hint at his selection came in August, when Busch discovered the McDonough School of Business administration had nominated the course and requested a syllabus. Next, Forbes magazine requested pictures of the Rafik B. Hariri Building. But it wasn’t until the list’s publication on the business publication’s website that Busch scrolled to find his course, paired with a shot of the Hariri building.
“I was delighted and most grateful to the business school for having nominated the course,” Busch said in an email.
Busch, who designed the class and teaches it himself, explained the concept behind his course.
“I wanted to give students a sense for how politics, economics and law come together in shaping international business,” he said. “There is a big emphasis on trade in the course, the focus being on the opportunities for commerce, as well as the many challenges, particularly with respect to protectionism.”
The course examines the interaction between politics and various market forces, according to the Forbes article.
In the fall, Busch teaches the course for undergraduate students and in the spring it is geared toward graduate students. Taught in module four for the McDonough School of Business, it is also part of the International Business Diplomacy program in the School of Foreign Service.
The class includes an introduction to regional trade agreements and the World Trade Organization and follows up with group debate and individual research on topics such as the U.S.-Vietnamese catfish trade dispute and the role of pharmaceutical copyright and patent rules in HIV and AIDS health care in Africa, according to the Forbes article.
Busch said he enjoys watching students give case-specific presentations in which they are assigned to solve a challenge of globalization for a certain firm or industry.
“The case teams live these
presentations for weeks. It is very rewarding to watch them grapple with issues that many had never given much thought to before the course, all with my onerous expectations in mind,” Busch said.
Yolande Bornik (MSFS-JD ’12), a graduate student who took the class in the spring of 2009, said she enjoyed Busch’s approach to teaching.
“Professor Busch is a phenomenal lecturer. He presents complex concepts in a very tangible way, and adds a good dose of humor as well,” she said.
“I would say Professor Busch was probably the most important faculty mentor that I had at Georgetown,” said Matthew Sharp (SFS ’10).
Busch says students benefit from the class even after taking it, thanks to a support network of students who have taken it in the past.
“Case teams from years past will check in on current teams, offer advice and sometimes come back to watch presentations of the case they gave while at Georgetown. The course has an impressive alumni network, and many of these graduates come back to recruit directly from my class,” Busch said.
