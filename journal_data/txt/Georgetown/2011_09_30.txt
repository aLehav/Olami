With upperclassmen frantically attending info sessions and interviews to secure their future careers after college, the website Jobbook has found its target audience.
The student-run site, intended to help colleges students find jobs that match their interests, garnered over 3,500 members in its first day launch across the United States and Canada Monday.
“Our aim is to provide our members with the chance to find opportunities both locally and globally,” said Zach Newburgh, a site co-founder and vice president for university relations. “Students from the D.C. area will be excited to see jobs that will start to pop up on their profiles within the next few weeks.”
The organization uses a tailored matching system to help students find jobs that fit their individual preferences. The founders compared the process to a dating service, since students select the types of jobs in which they are interested and are then matched to occupations for which they qualify.
For Newburgh, having an entirely student-run site gives the company a better understanding of its target market.
“The benefit is primarily that we know what students and recent graduates are looking for,” Newburgh said. “We are a team of students who want to make an impact on the lives of our friends and family by helping them find internships and employment.”
The launch of the website puts the organization in competition with Georgetown’s Student Employment Office, which also seeks to help current students find employment within the university and surrounding neighborhoods, but utilizes a more general method for listing jobs.
“It’s a resource for students and faculty, but I would say it’s more of a resource to faculty, because students don’t oftentimes get anything. [They] don’t secure a position from applying to a lot of the positions that they see on our websites,” Gretta Digbeu (COL ’13), clinical assistant at SEO, said.
Jobbook also hopes to help provide employment beyond the Hilltop that is geared more toward one’s intended career field.
“This website will give opportunities for students who are really motivated, who really want to find a job by themselves,” Conway Yao (SFS ’14) said. “I think that it’s good that students have tools that, if they have the initiative, they can use them.”

A university partnership with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations will establish a new academic chair of Indian culture and society as part of an initiative to strengthen ties with the country.
The arrangement, which was announced in a talk by Indian Ambassador Nirupama Rao Tuesday night, will create a joint position between the School of Foreign Service and the College’s English department.
“The wealth that education offers is the greatest wealth of all,” Rao said in her talk.
According to Rob Mathis, a communications officer for the university, the initiative has been in the works since 2009. After taking shape during several meetings in New Delhi and at Georgetown, the final agreement will allow a visiting Indian scholar to teach and conduct research on the Hilltop for several years. Mathis said the university is still working out details of the search process, but expects to make a hire as early as next fall.
While the university has programs in Asian Studies and Contemporary Arab Studies, this is the first position specifically dedicated to South Asian studies.
Silky Kadakia (COL ’12), president of the South Asian Society, said that while she was aware that the university was considering such a position, the ambassador’s announcement came as unexpected. Along with other leaders of the SAS, Kadakia attended a dinner with University President John J. DeGioia and the ambassador, where she learned more about the position.
“It was a good surprise,” she said. “It’s a visible step toward what they’re trying to accomplish.”
While introducing Rao, DeGioia discussed the importance of building links between Georgetown and universities in India — a message he has been emphasizing for several years.
“Georgetown will continue to be a leader in forging partnerships with institutes of higher education and learning,” DeGioia said at the talk.
As part of the effort, the university will also hold a government-sponsored summit on U.S.-Indian higher education in two weeks.
Kadakia said that while Georgetown already has many course offerings in South Asian studies, she hopes that the new post and other initiatives will encourage a wider group of students to take these classes.
She also said that she hopes that the new chair will be able to keep up the momentum behind the expansion of Indian studies at Georgetown. For many members of the SAS, the absence of offerings in South Asian languages at Georgetown is one area they would like to see addressed.
“India and Pakistan are huge hot topics right now,” Kadakia said. “It makes sense to develop in this area.”

Georgetown’s faculty of big-name policymakers and public intellectuals has long been an asset in the increasingly competitive game of college admissions.
Now these academic heavyweights are becoming involved in the process beyond their work in the classroom, reviewing applications and communicating with accepted students in an effort to increase yield rates and interest in the Hilltop.
“The faculty is involved in the process from the beginning,” Lia Glavin, senior assistant director for Undergraduate Admissions and Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program advisor, said. “Our admissions programs show that we have such strong faculty-student interaction.”
Though the faculty and the admissions department traditionally occupy separate spheres in academia, the university is now using its professors to compete with other universities in recruiting talented applicants.
According to Glavin, a greater focus has recently been placed on actual interaction between prospective students and faculty.
Students whose essays proved particularly memorable to admissions committee faculty receive personalized emails from the professors. In smaller, more close-knit departments like the Faculty of Languages and Linguistics, each accepted student is personally contacted by a faculty member.
The admissions office also coordinates online chats for each school, allowing prospective students to interact with professors whose expertise falls within areas of their own interest.
Anthony Arend (SFS ’80) government professor and director of the Masters in Foreign Sevice program, has long been involved with this program.
“It’s so much fun to be able to communicate to incoming students what my experiences have been and what their experience is going to be,” Arend said. “I want to show them the excitement and dynamism of Georgetown.”
Arend routinely meets with prospective students individually and took a trip to New York last year to talk to prospective students from the area.
“It’s such an energizing experience,” he said. “It reminds me of why I chose Georgetown.”
The idea of faculty interaction has also been integrated more formally into outreach programs for admitted students.
On GAAP Weekends, a faculty showcase includes lectures by top professors which give prospective students a taste of academic life on the Hilltop.
“My lecture gave me an insight into the kind of classes taught at Georgetown,” Brandon Kwan (COL ’15) said. “It had a small, cozy classroom feeling to it.”
According to statistics provided by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, over half of the class of 2015 attended a GAAP Weekend, giving a significant portion of the freshman class interaction time with a professor before he or she chose to matriculate.
For Matthew Caplan (COL ’15), the decision was sealed after he spoke with a faculty member as an applicant.
“The interaction with [that] professor reminded me of my favorite class in high school which was also my most mentally challenging and stimulating,” Caplan said. “I realized that the faculty at Georgetown would be of that quality and I would be pushed to challenge myself in each and every class I take here.”
Caplan added that he found the intellectual diversity of the professors, including the Jesuits, impressive as a prospective student.
“The Jesuit faculty [members] were actually the tipping point for me. Even though I’m a Jewish student, I found them to be so intellectual and fascinating.”
To allow applicants to view professors’ work firsthand, Admissions also offers the option to sit in on several classes when visiting.
Interested students may sample lectures of varying levels ranging from theology to chemistry.
Professor Rachel Barr, whose General Psychology and Memory classes are open to visitors, said that the in-class experience applicants receive is an important part of their final choice of college.
“It gives them a more realistic and in-depth picture of what class in Georgetown is actually like,” Barr said. “There are all these high school students who are trying to figure out what they want to do and where they want to go. It is useful for high school students to imagine what it would be like to be at Georgetown.”

Medical students may soon be able to trade in their heavy textbooks for lighter, more portable editions.
The Georgetown University School of Medicine is considering adopting Apple iPads and electronic textbooks as substitutes for traditional paper copies of required course materials. According to Dr. Steven Schwartz, associate dean for clinical informatics, the move would save students the money required to print readings and lecture slides while giving them the option to reach their notes virtually.
“[The student] is able to access the educational pieces he needs in smaller nuggets of information,” Schwartz said.
Integrating iPads into the curriculum would add the device to the multitude of other innovations — including SMART Boards, Lecture Capture and audience response systems — already used throughout the School of Medicine.
While the medical school has utilized handheld computers since 2002, the school required it as of 2005. After receiving positive input from students, the school went on to require second-year students to own an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or a device that uses the Android platform.
“The stereotypical images of medical school students or doctors are people who wear white coats with pockets stacked with papers and carry heavy loads of books in their hands,” Schwartz said. “However, now a hand-held device will get them everything they need.”
Schwartz noted that, according to the Georgetown University Medical Center graduate student questionnaire — a survey issued to recently graduated seniors — students have become increasingly comfortable using point-of-care applications for medical references and decision support in front of patients. He added that Georgetown medical students in particular used the technology with more ease than those at other schools.
“Medicine is a profession that constantly changes and evolves. After graduating, students might find half of what they’ve learned was wrong and the other half outdated by the time they start practicing,” Schwartz said. “They need to be able to continuously learn and continuously answer questions with the most updated information.”
Schwartz pointed out that medical students often do not receive enough training in using electronic records and prescriptions. He believes that smaller lessons available on phones and tablets can help solve the problem.
“It is important for students to be trained early to become familiar with hand-held devices, because using them effectively can prevent medical errors and ensure patients’ safety,” Schwartz said.
Brooks Culotta (COL ’13), who has been accepted to Georgetown Medical, said he is excited to engage with the new educational tools.
“It’s a good opportunity to start using technology at the point of learning,” he said. “It’s good to see that they’re trying to stay on the cutting edge. It’s definitely heartening to see that they’re investing in modern technology.”
Janet Russell, associate director for science programs and instructional technology at the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, agreed that if used well, technological devices like the iPad and SMART Boards can benefit students immensely.
“SMART boards allow temporal appropriateness,” Russell said, “Students can see how everything is played out.”
Russell explained that the medical school uses more of these technologies than the undergraduate schools because of its defined curriculum, which makes it easier to integrate such tools.
“In the main campus, you have a broad array of disciplines, so we only see some people spread across different disciplines using these devices,” Russell said.
Schwartz also attributes the wide use of technology to its strong advocates in the medical school.
“Most tools the [medical] school uses can also be used on the main campus,” Schwartz said. “You must be willing to experiment and take some risks and learn what works and what doesn’t.”
Correction: This article initially cited a GUMC report and study. The report was in fact the medical center’s graduate student questionnaire.

The Department of Public Safety recorded 42 incidents in September, 30 of which are still pending investigation, according to the DPS online crime log.
DPS closed five of the 42 cases this month, three of them with arrests. The remaining cases include destruction of property, theft, burglary, sexual allegations and threats, as well as alcohol and drug violations. The most frequently reported crime was theft, accounting for 20 of the incidents this month. A large portion of these thefts resulted after students left items unattended.
Lauinger Library and Harbin Hall were the most common sites for thefts, and other on campus crimes.
Erin Brinig (MSB ’13) was not surprised to hear about the theft rate in the library, as many students consider Georgetown a safe place and often do not worry about safety.
“People leave their stuff there all the time,” she said.
Compared to nearby universities, Georgetown has seen relatively low rates of crime this month. The Metropolitan Police Department reported five incidents within 1,500 feet of the center of campus this month. This is much lower than the 26 incidents reported near The George Washington University and 13 by Howard University and equivalent to the five incidents reported near American University’s campus.
Another commonly reported crime was burglary, with eight incidents reported in September. All of the burglary cases remain open, and MPD is aiding in the investigation of two of the incidents.
Five of the cases were forwarded to Student Conduct after initial investigation, and one has since been closed.
According to the university website, “The student discipline system is not a substitute for the criminal and civil courts, but an additional option for complainants when the alleged violator is an enrolled Georgetown University student.”
If students are found to be responsible for the violation, disciplinary action is taken.

Cell phone service providers will expand coverage to all 47 underground Metro stops within the next few months, according to WMATA spokesperson Dan Stessel.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority project called “Neutral Host” has been a two-year-long collaborative effort with the four major U.S. cell carriers — Verizon, AT&T, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile — to bring better phone service to Metro’s tunnels and stations.
Cell service is currently available in 20 of the system’s biggest underground stations. Rosslyn, Dupont Circle, Metro Center and Smithsonian were among the first stops to receive improvements.
Construction was slowed last fall because it conflicted with necessary upgrades to Metro’s deteriorating rail system, posing the risk that work would not be completed before Congress’ October 2012 deadline.
However, Stessel said that the project is now back on track. According to him, work on the 27 remaining stations is about 75 percent complete.
The District expects to earn about $25 million in revenue from its 15-year contract agreement with the four providers, according to The Washington Post.
The revamp project began in 2008 with federal funding from the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act, which allocated a maximum of $1.5 billion for the project. Cell phone networks were tasked with installing equipment, while WMATA needed to provide safety escorts for the networks’ construction crews.
“Metro’s role [in this project] is to provide access for carriers, help customers track outages and ensure safety and protection,” Stessel said in an interview with The Hoya.

The Law Center’s campus is secure after a man armed with an assault weapon was spotted walking near 2nd and D Streets, a short distance from the campus, at 12:30 p.m.
The Law Center went into “Sheltering-in-Place” mode, ordering the entire campus community to get inside immediately after being informed of the armed threat by the Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police Department and D.C. Protective Services.
At 1:13 p.m., Edward Piper, the director of the Law Center’s Public Safety office, sent an email to the community alerting them of a black armed male’s presence near the campus, urging community members to stay inside and away from windows. According to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh, Law Center Public Safety officers also used bullhorns to direct people indoors.
The Capitol Police and MPD notified Georgetown Law Public Safety that the campus was clear at 1:30p.m, according to Pugh. Piper sent a follow-up email to the Law Center community at 1:47 p.m., stating that all was clear.
“The Law Center wishes to thank everyone for their swift cooperation with the Department of Public Safety,” Pugh said.
On the main campus, the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union and The Corp’s Vital Vittles shut down temporarily as a safety precaution before a university-wide alert informed the campus community that the incident was confined to the Law Center.

Kathryn Olesko and Wayne Davis have many things in common. Both professors hold leadership positions within their respective departments. Both are heavily involved in the campus community. But what many of their students never knew is that they have been married for more than three decades.
There are at least five known professor couples on campus, but according to Georgetown professors, the number of couples among their ranks often remains hidden — for better or for worse.
Olesko teaches in the history department and is the director of the Master of Arts in German and European Studies program. Davis chairs the philosophy department, teaches and has served as president of the Faculty Senate since 2001. Although they have been together for nearly 35 years, Olesko and Davis said that many on campus have no idea they are married.
“Since we had different last names, no one really linked us together,” Olesko said.
For Pietra Rivoli, a professor of finance and international business professor, the Hilltop was where she met her husband, Dennis Quinn, after he started teaching at the McDonough School of Business in 1987. For Rivoli, the benefits of being married to a fellow professor far outweigh the challenges.
“There are many practical benefits,” she said. “You can almost always get a ride to work if you need one, and our vacations always match. Negatives? Not yet. But you can ask us in 2020, which will be our 30th anniversary.”
For reasons of scholarly publication, Olesko explained, many female professors often keep their maiden names. Olesko said that because she and her husband work in separate departments, they rarely eat lunch together. Different schedules also prevent them from commuting together.
Catherine Tinsley, a professor in the MSB and director of the Georgetown University Women’s Leadership Initiative, often finds herself in the same predicament. Although she is married to fellow MSB professor John Mayo, Tinsley said it’s unusual for them to spend time together at school.
“It is surprising how infrequently we can even carpool together,” Tinsley said.
For Olesko though, this is all part of a conscious choice. While she and her husband have served on a few committees together, she said they have worked hard to cultivate separate lives.
Davis began teaching at Georgetown in 1979, and Olesko joined him a year later when a position in the history department opened up. For Olesko, getting her first academic job during that time was more difficult than she expected.
“They asked, ‘What will your husband do if you get the job?'” she said, adding that she took off her wedding ring for the interview. “Nobody asked a male professor that.”
Recounting their early years as a couple, Davis and Olesko described years of long-distance communication and traveling to stay close.
“We supported Ma Bell [a phone company] and Allegheny Airlines,” Olesko said. “Those companies don’t even exist anymore. God, we sound so old.”
Accommodating spouses remains an important part of increasing female faculty in full-time and tenure-track positions at research universities, according to a 2010 report published by the American Association of University Professors.
As president of the faculty senate, Davis spearheaded an initiative to implement more family-friendly policies after Olesko’s experiences highlighted problems with maternity policies at the university.
According to Olesko, she got less than two weeks off for maternity leave under the old policy.
“I’m still tired,” she said, laughing.
At present, the university follows a family care leave policy which also allows for paternity leave, but issues regarding maternity leave remain for Medical School and Law Center faculty, along with graduate students, according to Davis.
Despite the obstacles, both Olesko and Davis said that their family life and their campus lives have become intertwined.
“Occasionally our dinner conversations were interrupted by shop talk,” Davis said.
“Our son grew up hearing the politics of Georgetown,” Olesko added.

Behind every federal government dollar granted to Georgetown is an array of staff and student lobbyists engaged in an ongoing dialogue with Capitol Hill.
The majority of the Office of Federal Relations’ lobbying efforts are directly linked to the financial interests of the university and its students: petitions for more federal aid, letters urging continued funding for the Scholarships for Education and Economic Development Program and statements challenging proposed cuts to foreign language education.
“We focus on issues related to the university,” Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said. “We don’t randomly take a stance on non-issues.”
But in recent years, Georgetown has extended its efforts beyond issues of financial aid and education funding to support a variety of social justice causes.
Fleming and his two-person lobbying specialist team head the efforts while maintaining the university’s official relationships with Congress; faculty, staff and University President John J. DeGioia have all given testimonies to add to the university’s voice.
Most recently, Georgetown became a vocal supporter of the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act.
“President DeGioia has been very engaged in supporting the DREAM Act,” Fleming said, noting that the president is often the university’s most recognizable lobbyist.
Lobbying initiatives often originate in the President’s office, but the Office of Federal Relations is always heavily involved in developing the university’s official stance.
“We work closely with the president’s office to see how we want to position letters and testimony,” Fleming said. “But as soon as we’ve crafted our policy and gotten the necessary sign-off [from President DeGioia or another official], that signature defines our position.”
Fleming stressed that Georgetown’s location in Washington places it in a unique position to influence federal politics, despite the lack of congressional representation for residents of the District.
“We work closely with people on Capitol Hill who might want real live beings who receive student aid to help tell their story. They’re much more accessible than students based in members’ constituencies,” he said.
The strong presence of Georgetown alumni and faculty in the Capitol, which includes 13 House members and six senators, bolsters its lobbying position, according to Fleming.
“They’re representing other constituencies … [but] they tend to be pretty open to hearing our perspectives. They’re cognizant of the fact that they represent people living in the District who can also vote in their constituencies, and they play a constructive role [in our lobbying efforts],” Fleming said.
The Office of Federal Relations also hopes to support political involvement on campus.
Fleming currently advises the Georgetown University Legislative Advocates, a student group that seeks to increase student involvement in the democratic process, by teaching the essentials of lobbying.
“Lobbying is a great educational experience,” Fleming said. “It creates an opportunity for students to understand … how to access government.”

When Mia Ramos, a survivor of sexual assault, spoke about her experience before a crowd of more than 50 students Wednesday night, the statistics on rape became more than mere numbers.
Ramos was the featured speaker at “R U Ready,” an event sponsored by Take Back The Night to spur awareness of sexual violence on campus.
Ramos’ experience is in accordance with a startling national trend — statistically, 20 to 25 percent of women and 3 percent of men experience sexual violence during their time at college.
But unlike in Ramos’ case, most perpetrators of sexual violence know their victims before the incident. They can be acquaintances, classmates — even boyfriends or girlfriends.
According to data released on Sept. 15 by Knowledge Networks and the Love is Not Abuse Campaign, 43 percent of college women who date have endured violent or abusive behavior from their partners. The survey reported that 22 percent of dating, college-aged women have suffered actual physical abuse, sexual abuse or violent threats.
According to Laura Kovach, director of the Georgetown University Women’s Center, dating abuse can be especially harmful because it is difficult to identify.
“Signs of physical abuse can be easy to spot in the form of bruises and broken bones. Emotional and psychological scars are more difficult to see,” she said.
These more under-the-radar forms of emotional abuse include harassment over Facebook, Twitter, text messages, emails and other forms of social media.
Kovach said that when a victim feels overwhelmed or does not know where to seek help, relationships can quickly escalate into violence.
“The victim is not in control — the abuser has the power,” she said.
This is a common problem for victims of abuse: More than one third of respondents in the Knowledge Networks’ survey said that they did not know where to go for on-campus help for the abuse.
Even when support centers are well publicized, some victims of abuse or assault feel guilty about their situation and are reluctant to seek out specialized assistance.
“While the only person who can prevent the abuse is the abuser, as a community we can be aware of the signs, reach out to those who are experiencing this violence and be aware of and knowledgeable about resources in our community,” said Jen Schweer, Georgetown’s Sexual Assault and Health Issues coordinator.
According to Schweer, the Women’s Center, Counseling and Psychiatric Service, Health Education Services and the Department of Public Safety provide such services on campus.
“It is important that we talk about [sexual violence] so victims know that they can get help and are not alone,” she said.
This feeling of isolation is one that Ramos struggled with after she was raped during her freshman year at New York University.
A strange man walked into the local shoe store where she worked and assaulted her in the store’s bathroom.
“I wasn’t prepared for this. I became like a zombie,” she said. “Sometimes it’s not that easy to fight back. … I just wanted to disappear inside myself.”
After the incident, Ramos was consumed by guilt and confusion. She soon developed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and struggled with insomnia, anxiety and an eating disorder — she eventually even contemplated suicide.
“I became more and more aware of exactly how much I lost that day in the bathroom of a Foot Locker,” she said.
“I felt completely alone in my situation. … I felt dirty,” Ramos said. “And I wasn’t getting the counseling I probably should have been getting.”
To enact change, Ramos said that university students and administrations must make an extra effort to reach out to victims and aid their recovery.
“Those suffering rarely wear a sign. Please remember to always treat others with compassion [because] the smallest act of kindness might be a lifeline to someone else,” she said.
