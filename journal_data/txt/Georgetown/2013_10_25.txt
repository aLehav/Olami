Among the musicians, start-up founders and filmmakers at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex., this March will see a new panelist: Georgetown.
The annual music, film and interactive technology conference, started in 1987, attracts 32,000 participants to Austin each spring. It is one of the most high-profile festivals in the country each year, with music acts such as Vampire Weekend and Prince performing in previous years.
Georgetown’s panel, “Designing the Future University from the Inside,” will be part of SXSWedu, the education conference within SXSW.
Although representatives from Georgetown have attended SXSWedu since 2011, this will be the first time that Georgetown will actively participate in the conference.
“We were merely audience participants but knew that there was so much going on at Georgetown that we could share,” Program Manager for Innovation & New Media Strategy Michael Wang (MSB ’07) said. “It was like ‘American Idol’ or ‘The Voice’ — watching these amazing people singing and thinking, ‘Well, we’ve got some singing chops too. Why aren’t we up there?’”
During previous visits, Georgetown representatives were able to learn about new innovations and techniques in the world of education.
“Conversations were happening that we didn’t experience at Georgetown,” Wang said. “People knew that the industry was changing.”
Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis said that the specifics of the panel have not yet been determined, though it will focus on how technology is modernizing higher education. More information will be available in December.
“Our biggest goal is to share with the rest of the community how we’re thinking about the digital campus for the future and what we’re doing on campus to spark innovation and new ideas for teaching, learning and research,” Davis said.
To be chosen, the university had to send in a written proposal that provided an overview of the panel’s topic. After an initial screening process, the university’s proposal was tested through theSXSW PanelPicker, which collects data through social media to account for 30 percent of the final decision. SXSW advisory boards and staff also judged applicants. Despite his excitement for the panel, Wang admitted that the conference, with its focus on the importance of technology within education, will likely be uncomfortable for Georgetown.
“It’s something we’re not used to. It’s a ton of ed tech entrepreneurs talking about how they’re going to unravel education and how there’s going to be 10 universities left in 20 years. It’s not the ground we’re used to being on,” Wang said. “But it’s important for us to move forward as a university and to be smart and nimble and innovative about where we need to go.”
But in some ways, Georgetown’s tradition will serve as an asset.
“Georgetown University has a history of being a convener of thought-leaders around complex and tough questions. This is what we will strive to contribute at SXSW,” Wang said. “We hope to be a leader in convening deeper conversations between universities and thought-leaders on the future of higher education.”

Councilmember David Catania (I-At Large) (SFS ’90, LAW ’94) introduced a proposal last week that would create one of the nation’s most aggressive college tuition assistance programs for low-income public school students.
Under the bill, titled the D.C. Promise Establishment Act, eligible students could qualify for up to $20,000 annually or $100,000 over five years of college, depending on their family’s annual income.
To be eligible, students must graduate from a D.C. public school or obtain an equivalent secondary school diploma on or after Jan. 1, 2015 and enroll in an institution of higher education, at least on a half-time basis, within three years of graduation or diploma obtainment. Students’ family income must be $250,000 or less.
The amount of assistance that a student receives would depend on the length of time that a student was enrolled in a D.C. public school and their family’s annual income.
Catania emphasized the importance of a college education to expanding District economic opportunities and reducing income inequality.
“Great communities invest in their people,” Catania said in a press release. “In every corner of our city, we have incredible talent waiting to be unlocked. The D.C. Promise represents an unprecedented opportunity to invest in our city’s future.”
Catania’s Chief of Staff Ben Young (GRD ’03) stressed the importance of providing low-income families with access to higher education, especially as District living costs continue to rise.
“The cost of college tuition is rising far faster than family incomes. Research shows that students from low-income households are more likely to forgo higher education due to a perceived inability to pay,” Young said. “Research also shows that a person’s ability to enter the middle class is dramatically improved if they have a college education.”
Young admitted, however, that the bill would incur a massive cost to the District government. The appropriations process to fund the bill is still ongoing and will continue for the next few months
“The District … has an $11 billion annual budget and investing in our next generation of residents and taxpayers must be one of our top priorities,” Young said.
The D.C. Council will officially hear the bill Nov. 13, and Young said he hoped the voting process would be completed by early 2014. Chairman Phil Mendelson and mayoral candidate andcouncilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) are current supporters of Catania’s bill.
“Higher education is increasingly important in our society,” Mendelson told The Hoya. “This bill will enable more D.C. residents to access higher education and enjoy greater opportunities for their lives.”
Evans’ General Counsel Kevin Stogner expressed confidence in the bill’s passage, thanks to widespread backing from other members of the council, but said that the terms of the bill would be subject to change before it would be passed.
“Among educators, stakeholders, I can’t imagine anyone is going to say no,” Stogner said. “I think the question will be in terms of, will we need more money or if the income limits for receiving grants are too low or too high.”
To pass, the bill will require seven votes out of ten, after which it will be submitted to Mayor Vincent Gray and Congress for approval.
Correction: A previous version of this story erroneously stated that Catania was a mayoral candidate. Although considered a viable candidate in the upcoming mayoral election, Catania has not officially announced his candidacy.

After news broke earlier this week that The George Washington University had misrepresented its admissions policy as need-blind, GWU responded that it is not able to cover all need because of its relatively small endowment of $1.375 billion.
Despite Georgetown’s smaller endowment of $1.286 billion, university officials maintained that financial background never factors into admissions decisions for Georgetown applicants.
The GW Hatchet reported Oct. 23 that GWU’s stated need-blind policy did not represent its admissions process. According to newly hired Associate Provost for Enrollment Management Laurie Koehler, the process is more accurately called “read need-blind,” a system in which financial decisions are not considered in the first round of applicant review but may be a factor later on. According to The Hatchet, students who would otherwise be admitted but are not among the university’s top choices may end up being waitlisted if they are in severe financial need. According to Koehler, this affects up to 10 percent of applicants each year.
“One of our competitive disadvantages is not having the resources to undergird student aid,” Koehler wrote on the school’s website.
Georgetown Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon explained that Georgetown is able to remain need-blind despite its small endowment by accounting for financial aid in its operating budget. Only 22 percent of financial aid comes from the endowment and annual donations, with the rest incorporated into the budget.
In contrast, a majority of GW’s financial aid is not counted as operating expenses, according to an operating budget report from The Hatchet.
Director of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity Richard Vedder pointed to the fact that Georgetown has a higher endowment per student, thanks to its lower enrollment. At Georgetown, the per-student endowment is approximately $67,000, while it is approximately $51,000 at GWU.
Vedder, however, doubted that Georgetown could be fully need-blind.
“Like GW, it doesn’t have a mammoth endowment,” Vedder said.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh held to the claim that Georgetown’s admissions process is completely need-blind and the university admits students regardless of their ability to cover tuition costs.
“The financial aid office never tells admissions about the financial need of any applicants,” Pugh said. “There is a true ‘firewall’ between the offices on this matter. Georgetown is passionate about our meeting-full-need policy.”
Deacon compared this policy to what GWU does.
“When you say you do need-blind admissions, that means you actually are reviewing all the applicants all the way through to the end and picking the best of them,” Deacon said. “You’re not coming back at the end and being sensitive to need.”
Vedder characterized GWU’s previous claims to be need-blind as dishonest.
“I think it is misleading to say, ‘We have a need-blind system,’ when, to the general public, that term means that financial considerations will not play any role in the admissions decisions,” Vedder said.
GWU spokeswoman Candace Smith, however, said that the issue was a matter of differing definitions.
“It’s still the same process, but it’s a matter of one person defining it one way and one person defining it another way,” Smith told The Hatchet.
Vedder said that the problem in this situation was GWU’s false representation of its policy, not that the school’s admissions policy is actually need-aware.
“I understand completely that GW is not need-blind,” Vedder said. “The problem that GW has — and I sympathize with them — is that they want to be a top-flight university in the first-rate of American universities, and they want to think of themselves as trying to be almost the equivalent of an Ivy League school.”
Vedder added that he did not think that universities should all strive to be need-blind.
“You could make the case that there is room in America for schools that do not profess to have as a top goal accepting any student regardless of financial ability,” Vedder said. “The Neiman Marcus department store is not need-blind, nor is Nordstrom or any up-scale retailer. You accept the fact that some people can afford it and some cannot.”

The past few months have seen ups and downs in the story of Georgetown’s mascot, culminating in the arrival of new mascot John B. Carroll to campus on Tuesday, Oct. 22. Janice Hochstetler, the bulldog breeder who donated both Jack Jr. and the new dog, sat down with The Hoya when she was at Georgetown to help the new mascot acclimate to campus this week. Below is an edited transcript.
What are you looking for during your visit with the new Jack?
I’m here to make sure that John B. Carroll acclimates well to his new surroundings here. With J.J., who is John B. Carroll’s three-fourths brother, Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., actually drove out to my home in San Diego and picked up the dog, so I didn’t have a chance to see how J.J. reacted to the crowds of people. This way, with me flying over with John B. Carroll, I can observe how the Jack Crew handles him and give them tips on how to keep him calm. We’ve already been to many places on campus where there are lots of people moving around, and he has been great around them.
What were the problems J.J. had that led to his removal from campus this summer, and how have you tried to prevent them with John B. Carroll?
J.J. is actually a very well-mannered, calm puppy. He wasn’t used to being picked up by people for pictures and used as a plaything. The incident that happened with him was just a perfect storm, and no one could have predicted it. J.J. has a bit of an excitability issue, but not an aggression issue. Fr. Steck did a great job training him here, and I know that he’s still upset about what happened, but no one could have prevented it. However, we are making changes with John B. Carroll. I’m making sure that his walkers don’t use the high-pitched “cute doggy” voice or pet him too quickly, because that puts the bulldog on edge. Also, we are making sure that when people approach the dog, they don’t intimidate him by leaning over him or picking him up. John B. Carroll has been great to people who have come over and spoken with normal voices and have not made quick movements around him. Also, I don’t think that we’re going to have a huge welcoming ceremony for the new puppy like we did for J.J., because large amounts of people and cameras seemed to scare the dog.
The decision to remove J.J. from campus was made partly based on the assessment that the dog was better suited as a pet than a mascot. How will this distinction play out with John B. Carroll?
I think this puppy as the next mascot won’t necessarily be available to be seen just walking around campus as much as in the past. I know that a lot of students here love having him, and he will be present at all of the games and events, but the bulldog isn’t meant to be a cute photo prop. He’s got a job to do as a working dog. I’ve told the Jack Crew to act like bodyguards for a celebrity in order to prevent people from manhandling and frightening him.
How did you come to the decision to have John B. Carroll live in a townhouse instead of a dorm and be walked by a fewer number of students?
Dorm life can be crazy, and it’s not really the place for a puppy that would be overstimulated by all of that. With the townhouse, he gets some peace and quiet, his own little backyard to play around in and a better set-up overall. Paul [O’Neill (COL ’86), Georgetown’s chief operating officer for advancement and a member of the Bulldog Advisory Committee], not me, has actually been staying with him there, and soon, the new caretaker will move right in. We discussed that it is healthier for the dog to have consistent training. He has grown very attached to me, so it is better for his transition to have as few brand-new faces telling him what to do as possible, at least in the early stages.
What is something that the Georgetown community should know about our new mascot?
John B. Carroll is a really cute, good-natured puppy. He’s just 14 weeks old, but he behaved like a perfect gentleman on the plane ride over here. He loves riding his skateboard, though he can’t quite pedal it yet, and he really seems to like horses. I think that he will grow to love Georgetown.
What do you think that people should know about bulldogs in general?
Bulldogs were originally bred to bait or kill bulls, hence the name. Their entire bodies are built just for that purpose. Many people think of bulldogs as unintelligent and stubborn animals, but in truth, they are just not used to taking orders — they weren’t bred for that — so it takes a lot patience in order to properly train them. While training bulldogs, you find that they are quite intelligent, and since they aren’t frightened by people as much, they are actually great with kids.
Why did you decide to donate two mascots to Georgetown?
My kids loved their time at Georgetown, and since I figured that I can’t quite donate a new building, then I might as well contribute the best way I can, by helping the university continue with its bulldog tradition.

Mayoral candidate and D.C. Councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) promoted his campaign platform at a speech in the Georgetown University Law Center’s McDonough Hall on Tuesday afternoon.
Wells’ speech was the first in a series of candidate presentations sponsored by the Law Center Democrats, who have invited all declared Democratic candidates to speak prior to the primary election in April.
“I’m really running to change government in a way to make it governed by the voters and not just by those who give us money,” Wells said.
Wells, a second-term councilmember who began his career in the District as a social worker in 1985, is currently running without any corporate contributions.
The councilmember stressed his vision to strengthen the District’s neighborhoods through his “five-minute living” plan, in which all basic necessities, such as food, schools, stores, transportation and parks, are within five minutes’ walking distance.
“When I first ran for office, I was thinking, ‘Why do people live here, and why are they moving here?’ and I laid out a vision about creating livable, walkable neighborhoods,” Wells said. “If you want to fix transportation for the country, it’s not about adding more car lanes — it’s land-use planning.”
To make the city more accessible, Wells emphasized the importance of the D.C. public transit system, which he characterized as insufficient.
“Our city does well with a Metro that takes you in and takes you out, but we don’t connect our neighborhoods very well,” Wells said. To solve this problem, he would add streetcars, which hold twice as many people as buses do, and expand the Circulator and shuttle-bus systems.
During the speech, Wells also touched on the topic of budget autonomy. Through the recent negotiations regarding the federal government shutdown, the District won temporary budget autonomy until September 2014. To Wells, however, this is not enough.
“I do know that some members of Congress have said we don’t deserve our own autonomy because we have had a corrupt government,” Wells said. “You have to have a government with integrity. The rights we have as a District should not be based on the behavior of our elected officials.”
Wells took the opportunity to direct attention toward his recent legislative activities. Over the summer, Wells introduced a bill to the D.C. Council that would decriminalize the possession of less than one ounce of marijuana, particularly in response to the supposed racial discrimination present in current marijuana laws. Recently, Wells co-introduced a bill to raise the D.C. minimum wage from $8.25 to $10.25 in the next two years.
Wells closed by urging those in attendance to take ownership of changing the District and to fight against the power of large corporations with deep pockets.
“This is a different kind of campaign,” Wells said. “It hopefully will be something that continues around the country, where voters and individuals take back control of our government, so it is not simply a pay-to-play system.”
Those in attendance seemed impressed by Wells’ plan, particularly his vision for creating livable communities.
“I think he’s an excellent candidate for mayor. His focus on livable communities really hits a chord with everyone in D.C.,” Patrick Simmons (LAW ’14) said. “No matter who you are, we all want to live in a safe neighborhood with access to education. I think he’s the guy that can deliver that.”

To enhance alumni engagement, the School of Foreign Service will launch its first annual alumni print magazine in December.
The magazine will replace the quarterly SFS print newsletter, which will still be sent out online.
“We wanted to switch it up from doing our newsletters to doing a more robust piece,” SFS Communications Specialist Jen Lennon said. “We thought that an interesting way to get to our alumni would be to have a broader piece that would cover more and have substantive pieces about issues in the field as well as profiles.”
SFS Director of Outreach Gail Griffith helped envision the global human development theme of the forthcoming issue.
“Coming up with an overarching theme was one of the most interesting pieces of this for us and one of the most challenging,” Griffith said. “We wanted to be able to speak to where the school is now and wanted to be able to look at where we had been, … what it was really designed to do and how it changed over the decades.”
The first issue will consist of profiles and features on the SFS that broach this theme, including profiles on current undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and alumni. It will also highlight specific programs within the SFS, including the Institute for the Study of International Migration and the new massive open online course on globalization.
While administrators in the SFS Dean’s Office came up with story ideas for the magazine, publishing company Washingtonian Custom Media was hired to conduct interviews, write articles and design it. Funds for the project have come from the communications budget and the discontinued print newsletters.
The dean’s office also sought to incorporate the history and future of the SFS into the magazine.
“We had these nuanced views of where we had been and where we are going that were based on world events, and we wanted to be able to demonstrate that scope and that arc somehow in the magazine,” Griffith said.
The magazine will be sent out to 23,000 alumni after its publication in December and will be available both in print and online.
“I think this gives us an opportunity to reach a constituency we haven’t reached before,” Griffith said. “I hope that it does what our online e-newsletter has done, and that is provoke a conversation among our alumni.”

More than one year ago, the student body overwhelmingly voted in support of raising the evidentiary standard for Student Code of Conduct violations from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing.” Since Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson implemented this policy in February, student leaders say they have noticed a significant improvement in the way cases are adjudicated.
Yet challenges, such as raising the evidentiary standard off campus, persist.
Former GUSA executives Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13) spearheaded the campaign to change the standard, which applies to all disciplinary violations except sexual assault. Their predecessors, Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Greg Laverriere (COL ’12), began pushing to raise the evidentiary standard and laid the foundation for the referendum during their term as GUSA executives.
Effects of the change have been especially visible on the Residential Judicial Council, one of the bodies responsible for handling disciplinary violations.
“With the change to clear and convincing, we had the opportunity to codify within our constitution and within our training materials what exactly we need to find someone responsible for an infraction of the Student Code of Conduct,” RJC councilmember Nicholas Adams (SFS ’14) said.
This included holding an additional training session in which councilmembers worked to define “clear and convincing,” which does not have a self-evident threshold like that of “more likely than not.”
“For me, it’s the responsibility not of the student to prove to me that they’re innocent, but whoever wrote the report to prove to me that they are responsible,” Adams said.
In practice, this has led some RJC members to alter their approach to cases.
“For some members of the council, I have seen a bit of a shift where the bar has been risen. … Students have a greater opportunity to present their own side,” Adams said. “As a body, we have been a lot more united on our opinion on what it would take to prove a person responsible, and, as a result, I think students feel more confident.”
Student Advocacy Office Co-Chair Michelle Mohr (COL ’15) has also seen improvements in the disciplinary process.
“They’ve been a lot better at communicating about incidents. Instead of waiting for three or four weeks, students are getting their emails a lot quicker,” Mohr said.
While there is no data available to judge how many students have been affected by the raised standard since February, one female sophomore has experienced its benefits. After being found with friends in a freshman dorm room last January with a nearly empty bottle of alcohol, the student, who wished to remain anonymous because of the nature of her disciplinary violation, was written up and called before the RJC.
“[The RA] had no reason to knock on our door — and then he sees an empty bottle of alcohol on the floor and says that we need to hand over our GOCards,” she said. “Because we weren’t being loud, rowdy or drunk, they didn’t press charges because it wasn’t clear or convincing that we had been drinking.”
Despite these improvements, students and alumni expressed concern that the raised standard has yet to be extended off campus.
“Having the burden of evidence changed on campus was a pretty big win for students, but there’s still a long ways to go,” Gustafson said. “I think the Student Code of Conduct needs to be equal across the board. I understand that we need to have well-thought-out actions off campus, but I would hope that we would treat other people as well as we treat ourselves. I understand the need to appease the neighbors, but I don’t think that’s enough.”
Despite student pressure on the issue, Olson remained mum on whether the university would move forward with equalizing the standard off campus in the future.
“I do not have any updates on that right now,” Olson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We believe that this heightened standard of proof, in alignment with the clearer layout of the Code of Student Conduct, has brought more transparency to the entire process, and we are pleased with the thoughtful and ongoing dialogue around this issue.”
The sophomore who avoided disciplinary sanctions last year because of the higher evidentiary standard said that the continuation of a “more likely than not” standard off campus is factoring into her decision whether or not to live off campus.
“Just knowing that you can get in trouble with the school for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, I’m leaning more toward staying on campus,” she said.

Loyola Marymount University and Santa Clara University, two Jesuit schools in California, ended faculty healthcare coverage for elective abortion this month.
When these changes take effect in 2014, therapeutic abortions and access to contraception will continue to be covered while a third-party plan still covers elective abortions.
Loyola Marymount dropped elective abortion coverage in 1988, but according to the National Catholic Register, the coverage somehow reentered the university’s healthcare plan between 1988 and 2013 without public discussion.
“We believe that the right to life and dignity for every human being is a fundamental part of Catholic beliefs … and that this vision needs to be evidenced in LMU’s policies and procedures,” LMU President David Burcham and Chair of the Board Kathleen Aikenhead wrote in a letter to faculty members.
But while the Loyola Marymount decision was made by a board of trustees vote, Santa Clara University’s new plan was announced by SCU President Fr. Michael Engh, S.J., in a letter to faculty and staff, which has triggered criticism from SCU faculty members.
“It was a complete shock,” SCU School of Law professor Stephen Diamond told The Hoya. “The decision by the president was unilateral and without consultation from faculty. We weren’t given the courtesy of notice or even the chance to comment in advance. There was simply no due process whatsoever.”
Mary Hegland, an SCU professor, disagreed with Engh’s decision.
“The male Jesuits running Santa Clara University feel they know what God wants regarding women, women’s bodies and women’s reproduction,” Hegland told the San Jose Mercury News. “We have many women working at SCU who are not Catholic or — even if Catholic — do not believe that abortion is against God’s will.”
Although Engh announced that there would be a series of open forums discussing the decision, faculty members questioned why the forums are being held after the decision was already made.
“I viewed the forum as a kind of phony, Cuban-style form of democracy — that is you make the decision, and then we get to vote,” Diamond said. “It doesn’t even appear that the trustees got to vote.”
In response, Diamond resigned his post as a university ethics scholar, although he continues his work as a tenured law school professor.
“I assumed that the commitment that was made to me when I was hired — that the institution was not going to become essentially a seminary — was genuine,” Diamond said. “I sensed a genuine commitment to human rights and women’s rights and diversity, and now it looks like there’s a shift underway. I think they owe [professors] a public statement on where they’re taking or where they’re attempting to take the institution.”
As of press time, 636 people have signed a Change.org petition to overturn the SCU decision.
“We, the undersigned members of the Santa Clara University community, request a prompt and meaningful opportunity to appeal the university’s decision to reduce essential reproductive health care coverage provided by its health insurance plans,” the petition reads. “As community members committed to difficult dialogues about how best to achieve a fair, diverse, and inclusive environment, we are gravely concerned that such an important health care decision was made without consulting representatives of the people who will be adversely affected by this precipitous change.”
According to the official summaries of benefits from Georgetown’s various faculty and staff insurance plans, Georgetown’s current faculty and staff benefits do not cover elective abortions, with no exceptions. Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., declined to comment.
GU Right to Life Treasurer Kelly Thomas (SFS ’15) agreed with the universities’ decisions, expressing surprise that either had originally covered elective abortions.
“It’s a little mind-boggling that they allowed it in the first place,” Thomas said.
H*yas for Choice Vice President Abby Grace (SFS ’16) disagreed with the decision.
“What type of faculty are you going to attract if you’re going to say, ‘Sorry, because of our religious identity, we’re not allowing you choices about your body and your life?’” Grace said.
To Thomas, however, that sacrifice is worth making.
“I wouldn’t say that more diversity amongst beliefs of professors is worth compromising and worth allowing this sort of attack on human life to continue,” Thomas said. “I certainly enjoy diversity among my professors but it’s kind of like saying, ‘If you pay us a little bit more for it, we’ll do what’s morally reprehensible.’”
Grace, however, emphasized that faculty perspectives do not need to align perfectly with that of the university.
“I don’t think anyone asked Loyola Marymount to endorse abortion,” Grace said. “I think they just asked them to recognize that their faculty has different beliefs than them, and it’s certainly sad to see that they chose not to do that.”

The D.C. Council is poised to pass a bill that would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of recreational marijuana in the District.
The “Simple Possession of Small Quantities of Marijuana Decriminalization Amendment Act of 2013” was introduced by mayoral candidate and councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) and councilmember and former Mayor Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) in July. It seeks to eliminate criminal penalties for those caught with less than one ounce of marijuana and to reduce the fine to $100. The current penalty is a six-month jail sentence, a permanent criminal record citation and a $1,000 fine.
The bill is supported by six other council members — Anita Bonds (D-At Large), Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5), Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) and David Grosso (I-At Large) — and needs seven votes out of 13 to go to Mayor Vincent Gray for approval. If Gray signs the bill, it must receive congressional approval.
To collect more information, Barry and Wells, who is chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, held two rounds of hearings this week during which the public had the opportunity to speak on the issue. During these hearings, Gray publically announced his support of marijuana decriminalization for the first time.
“I support decriminalization,” Gray said. “Legalization is another issue. I’m not there on that issue, yet.”
Wells attributed the need for decriminalization to the racial implications of marijuana arrests in the District. According to Wells, approximately 91 percent of people arrested in D.C. on marijuana-related charges are black.
“It’s simply not fair,” he said. “Not only is it not fair, these people who are charged with penalties are unable to find employment because of their criminal record. It’s not smart.”
Grosso, who in September introduced his own legislation to completely legalize marijuana in the District, agreed.
“Racial disparity is high in issues involving illegal drug possession,” Grosso said. “It’s not a matter of being illegal anymore. It’s a means through which decriminalization is funnelled, and it’s a failure of our war on drugs.”
Barry drew from his own personal experiences to support this point.
“[D.C.] made national news headlines in 2010: We arrested 5,000 people, predominantly African-American, for mere possession of marijuana,” Barry said.
Councilmembers expressed particular concern about the consequences faced by those convicted of marijuana possession. As marijuana-related arrests are listed as permanent criminal records, students arrested for possession become ineligible to apply for financial aid, and arrests have similarly grave consequences for adults.
“Thousands of people are being stripped of their healthcare benefits, becoming ineligible to apply for jobs and unable to apply for housing,” Wells said. “This has to change.”
Supporters of the bill pointed to research on the limited effects of marijuana on health.
“Scientific knowledge of the effects of marijuana has increased dramatically over the past few years, and now we know that marijuana is no more harmful and addictive than alcohol,” Deputy Attorney General for Public Safety Andrew Fois testified.
According to Fois, marijuana is the third most used substance in the United States, with alcohol and tobacco first and second, respectively. Fois reported that 25 million people were reported to have used marijuana in the past year.
A Gallup report released Tuesday showed that 58 percent of Americans currently support the legalization of marijuana, a significant increase from 12 percent in 1969, when the question was first asked.
Specifically, D.C. Cannabis Campaign Chairman Adam Eidinger reported that 75 percent of District residents support decriminalization, with 64 percent supporting legalization of marijuana in general.
Furthermore, Grosso pointed to the fact that marijuana decriminalization is quickly becoming a national trend. Over the past 30 years, 17 states have already decriminalized the use of marijuana to some extent. Washington and Colorado passed initiatives that legalized marijuana in November 2012.
Despite this push toward decriminalization, Grosso emphasized the importance of discouraging marijuana use for juveniles and students.
“Above all, we need to educate the young and constantly send the message that marijuana is still dangerous and addictive, even if we decriminalize it,” Grosso said.
Fois agreed and said that although he supported the bill, it needed to preserve some aspects of the original penalties, such as maintaining smoking marijuana on sidewalks, in parks or in other public spaces with children present as a criminal offense.
Nevertheless, Grosso, who has historically been one of the District’s most fervent advocates for the complete legalization of marijuana, said he would continue to push for the legislation he introduced to the D.C. Council in late September.
“The bill is not going to be radical and legalize marijuana, but it’s definitely a huge first step in making legalization happen, and I’m going to continue pushing for that,” Grosso said.

Elizabeth Gromet (COL ’14) and Catherine Gallagher (COL ’14) took the cake Wednesday, winning the inaugural Georgetown University Farmers Market Top Chef competition.
Gromet and Gallagher’s pumpkin cheesecake took first out of 28 entries.
“We never expected to win,” they wrote in a joint email. “We started jumping around and screaming.”
Caroline Cotto (NHS ’14), who serves as the community events co-chair for the farmers market, was taken aback with this year’s participation.
“It was a lot more successful we thought it was going to be,” Cotto wrote about the competition, which required entrants to prepare a dish with apple or pumpkin to mark the coming of fall.
There were five judges on the panel, including 1789 pastry chef Ryan Westover and government professor Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J. Each judge completed a detailed grading form for the dishes, which ranged from pumpkin rosemary bread to a chocolate and pumpkin soufflé.
In the end though, Gromet and Gallagher took home the prize of a free dinner for two at 1789, the swanky restaurant on 36th Street.
The secret ingredient used to secure their victory? Bourbon.
“Adding alcohol never hurts,” Gromet and Gallagher wrote.
The competition, held to honor World Food Day, was the offspring of last year’s Farmers’ Market event, which focused on partnering with 1789 and featured handouts about World Food Day and a brief cooking demonstration by a 1789 chef.
“It was very low key,” Cotto said. “This year it was all about increasing student participation.”
Gromet’s and Gallagher’s preparation for the event was perilous, as Gromet was distracted by medical school interviews and Gallagher was working almost nonstop in the hours leading up to the competition.
“Our roommate Kim, also a contestant, agreed to bring it [to the competition] for us,” Gromet wrote. “We were a little worried she’d drop it, perhaps on purpose to eliminate the competition.”
While Gromet and Gallagher won overall, other contestants won in categories such as “Best in Taste,” “Most Original” and “Best Presentation” with dishes that included maple pumpkin pie and pumpkin-apple streusel cake.
Cotto hopes to do another event in the future with even more student engagement and a more interactive competition.
“But who knows,” Cotto said. “Right now, we are just celebrating the success of a great first try.”

TEDx Georgetown is shifting its focus to the university this semester as it moves from Lohrfink Auditorium to the larger venue of Gaston Hall for its third year.
The conference, which will kick off Saturday, is sponsored by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund in conjunction with the Office of the President, University Information Services and Georgetown College.
This year, the series of short talks given by students, faculty and guests will revolve around the theme of “Changemakers.” The 2012 conference’s theme was “Power” and the first TEDx was themed “Netcetera: the Internet and Everything Else.”
“We learned from what we did in year one and made it better in year two,” Program Manager for New Media and Digital Strategy Michael Wang (MSB ’07) said. “This is the year that … we are ready to truly engage the entire community,”
This year’s conference will highlight university faculty members students may not know outside of academia, including Elizabeth Stanley, a professor of security studies and nonprofit founder, and Francis Slakey, a professor of physics and public policy who is also the first person to have climbed the highest mountain on every continent and surfed every ocean on Earth. The speakers were chosen by an advisory board composed of deans from almost every Georgetown school.
“We wanted it to be Georgetown-focused. … We want to think about what makes TEDx Georgetown a uniquely Georgetown event, as it were, rather than just any other TEDx.” TEDx President Jamie Sharp (COL ’15) said. “We think we can relate it to the values that everyone in the community shares and have people talk about their own experiences.”
The 2013 conference will be composed of three sessions: “Global Human Development,” “The Whole Person” and “For Others.”
In his first time participating in TEDx Georgetown, University President John J. DeGioia is curating “Global Human Development,” for which he chose the speakers himself.
Student speakers include Heather Artinian (COL ’15), Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15) and Rashawn Davis (COL ’14), who is running for Newark, N.J. City Council. Ramirez will be speaking about youth homelessness during the “For Others” session, discussing his own time as a homeless adolescent and his work at the California Homeless Youth Project.
“There are two things I’m attempting to accomplish in my speech. One is education, and two being this idea of owning, owning labels and confronting your shame,” Ramirez said. “I just wanted this purely to be my TED talk, and while I’ve learned so much from others … I’m trying to pull from within.”

The university is currently working to implement new regulations to address inconsistency in faculty joint appointments across departments.
Since her appointment in August, Vice Provost for Faculty Adriana Kugler has created guidelines that standardize the process and encourage more joint appointments. The guidelines are currently under review by the Faculty Senate for approval.
“Basically, the idea is that there are some schools and some departments which really do a great job with these joint appointments,” Kugler said. “But there are many other departments and many other places on campus that do not take advantage of more interdisciplinary appointments.”
Currently all faculty who have joint appointments are considered associate faculty. Under the new guidelines, faculty will be distinguished as affiliate faculty or as courtesy joint appointments.
“Courtesy joint appointments are intended to provide for more lasting and substantial collaboration than affiliate faculty appointments,” President of the Faculty Senate Wayne Davis wrote in an email. “I think we have had both sorts of appointments before, so this change is probably more in the nature of a clarification.”
A complication of joint appointments is the pay system for the faculty.
“For a while, [payment] was handled by both departments that you were employed under,” Harley Balzer, a professor in both the departments of government and history, said. “The number [of joint-appointment professors] has grown so large that we can’t even try to operate like that anymore.”
The primary department that hired the professor is usually in charge of handling the salary of the faculty member, though this was not always the case.
Despite past attempts to address confusion over joint-appointment faculty designation, inconsistency still persists.
Joint-appointment faculty members are subject to the same guidelines of their single department colleagues, including teaching two classes each semester, one in each department for which they work, as well as an interest in the convergence of disciplines.
Typically, faculty members have research and teaching interests in areas between two fields.
“It’s usually a matter of common interest in material covered by two units,” Balzer said. “The SFS, for example, likes to think of itself as elite, so they like to cherry-pick the people they think are the best — the people who they believe show an interest in the other unit.”
Because the revisions of these new guidelines are still being discussed by the Main Campus Executive Faculty and the Provost’s Office, the possible impact of the implementation of such rules has yet to be determined.

The Georgetown University College Republicans and College Democrats have put aside their differences to bring The Can Kicks Back, a campaign focused on solving the national debt crisis, to Georgetown on Tuesday.
“Our generation is really beyond the ideological battles that prior generations are waging. We care more about results than rhetoric,” TCKB Co-founder and Communications Director Nick Troiano (COL ’11, GRD ’13) said.
Based on this non-partisan outlook, GUCD and GUCR are coming together to co-sponsor the event.
“It’s clear that there is a big political gap, and instead of dealing with the issues and trying to bridge the partisan divide, our political leaders are more interested in pushing those bigger decisions off to our generation,” GUCD President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said. “The problem with that is that these are issues that are really going to come to a head by the time that we are in the same seats that they are making some of these big decisions.”
Troiano founded TCKB with four friends in 2012 as a result of the government’s failure to address the growing national debt, even as crises like the debt ceiling limit and the fiscal cliff dominated political discourse.
“We got sick of watching that can get kicked down the road, and we realized that our generation is the can and we need to do something,” Troiano said.
A goal of the tour is to harbor support for the INFORM Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that encourages fiscally sustainable solutions to the debt crisis by increasing transparency in the federal budget. The act has bipartisan supporters in both houses of Congress and is endorsed by more than 900 top economists and 14 Nobel laureates.
While it is notable that the GUCR and GUCD are coming together to sponsor the campaign, it is not out of the ordinary.
“We already cooperate quite a bit,” GUCR Chair Alex Cave (COL ’15) said. “Obviously there’s differences between us and there’s differences between our members … but we’ve always had a good sense of cooperation. We do debates together; we do voter registration together.”
Representatives from TCKB will have a booth with information about the debt issue and possible solutions in Red Square on Tuesday afternoon. Speakers scheduled for that night include Stanley Druckenmiller, a philanthropist and former chairman of Duquesne Capital; former AARP CEO Bill Novelli; former Comptroller General David Walker; and Stephanie Ruhle of Bloomberg News.
“The event has panelist speakers from across the spectrum,” Cave said.
Throughout the tour, which stopped at 25 colleges in 20 states, TCKB collected tin cans on which students wrote messages urging Congress to stop “kicking the can down the road” and to deal with the debt issue.
“I think the most popular message is ‘Grow up,’” Troiano said. “Young people are wondering why we’re the only adults in the room having this conversation about our future.”
The tin cans from the 25 colleges will be delivered to congressmen after a rally on Capitol Hill Thursday morning.
“We need to show our leaders that we care,” Troiano said. “We’re actually willing to show up and say, ‘Enough is enough. The can stops here.’”

The United States Agency for International Development recently awarded Georgetown’s Institute for Reproductive Health $19.8 million for a five-year research project.
The project, Fertility Awareness for Community Transportation, aims to spread awareness in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia about reproductive health and family planning methods. According to a university press release, in those developing countries, the risk of a woman dying due to pregnancy and childbirth is currently one in 75, which is nearly 100 times the level in developed countries. Thus far, IRH is considering conducting research in Rwanda, India, Uganda and Nepal, but the list of countries has not yet been finalized.
“Family planning, in general, has been shown to have a significant impact on the world,” IRH Director and Founder Victoria Jennings said. “What we do know from the research is that if women are in a position to be able to avoid pregnancy when they don’t want to get pregnant, and if they have other options in their lives, it really does create a better world for everybody.”
“It helps women’s education. It helps the health of the family. It helps their ability to educate their children, and helps their economic lives. So it’s really the best poverty reduction intervention that there is,” IRH Deputy Director Rebecka Lundgren said.
For the FACT project, IRH will conduct research through implementation science, which involves gathering information through surveys, focus groups, interviews and panels to determine the results of increased education. As a result, the research will provide evidence on any direct benefits of increased knowledge and understanding of sexual health among men and women.
“I’m really excited about trying to come up with some ways of really raising awareness and understanding, especially among younger, newly married couples who are not very well reached by programs that are out there already and to reach [them] in a large enough scale that we can really make a difference,” Lundgren said.
Over the last 25 years, USAID has given IRH nearly $150 million in funding, which Lundgren attributed to the institute’s record of success.
“We have a long track record of successful interventions or projects to help women, men, and also adolescents to understand their fertility and make decisions to protect their health based on that,”Lundgren said.
For example, IRH developed the Standard Days Method, which scientifically tracks and monitors women’s reproductive cycles and has been proven to be successful through independent studies.
“Under Victoria Jenning’s leadership, IRH has demonstrated critical contributions in creating receptive environments within communities around the world so they can embrace evidence-based reproductive health programs,” Georgetown University School of Medicine Executive Dean HowardFederoff said in the press release. “These programs make a significant impact not only on individuals but entire communities. We’re proud that IRH is one of many groups making a global impact by addressing this challenge.”
The project is expected to enter the field by January.

Georgetown announced 11 opportunities for students to discuss design plans for the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall on Tuesday, the first two of which have drawn limited engagement so far.
No students attended an open Planning and Facilities Management meeting Thursday afternoon. Approximately 40 students stopped by Thursday evening’s forum about the Northeast Triangle’s first floor, which was held in the New South lobby. The online forum, which allows users to comment on various threads, has thus far received uneven traffic. The most recent comment on the online forum is from 10 days ago.
Associate University Architect Jodi Ernst said that she has seen interest wane since original designs were presented in July.
“[Students] may be burnt out,” Ernst said. “There was a lot of interest, and we’re at a stage where we closed the exterior engagement, and we’re opening engagement at a more detailed level.”
Noreen Sajwani (NHS ’15), who sits on the Northeast Triangle Engagement Committee, exhorted students to contribute their thoughts.
“This is hopefully going to be successful in getting more student feedback, getting them to say what they want, because then there’s really no excuse for what they see in the end because they were a part of the process,” she said.
Responses to the design from alumni and students proved to be influential in the design of the building’s exterior.
“The architects have done a really good job incorporating student feedback, and I think that’s clear if you look at the concept drawing that came out in the summer of the [exterior of the] residence hall and then look at the concept drawing that was presented at the most recent forum,” Georgetown University Student Association Director of Student Space Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) said. “There are significant changes, and all of those changes came directly as a result of student
feedback.”
While students are encouraged to express any concerns they have about Northeast Triangle, upcoming forums will focus on the building’s interior, as there is little opportunity for change in the exterior.
“At this point, we are presenting the exterior to different zoning boards, and they need to approve our design. It’s very difficult to go back in the process and start again,” Katia Lucic, a principal architect at Sasaki Associates, said.
The university expects to next present the residence hall design at the Old Georgetown Board meeting in December.
Each of the upcoming open houses throughout the semester will focus on a specific topic, such as the use of study space or the role of technology in the residence hall.
In addition to these open forums, administrators are working with specific groups of students, such as resident assistants and Residence Hall Office managers, to get feedback on what they hope to see in the building’s interior.
Architects are currently about halfway through the design process. They have concluded the schematic design stage, which included laying out the building and detailing the exterior, and are entering a stage of design development.
“For the next three months, we’re going to be adding details,” Justin Finnicum, a senior associate for Sasaki Associates, said. “At the end of design development, you have the design really nailed down.”
Architects will focus on the building’s mechanical systems, plumbing and electricity during this stage of the design process, as well as the cost of the building. In January, they will do a cost estimate before moving on to a four-month-long process of construction documentation.
Andrew Meshnick (COL ’17) attended the evening engagement forum Thursday.
“It seems like they are very amenable to students’ suggestions,” he said. “My concern is that it’s going to be too much in too small of a location, but I understand that there is also a necessity for us to bring students onto campus for housing. … I think that the flexibility of the first floor is really interesting.”
By early December, the opportunity for student contributions to the design will mainly have passed.
“We’ll have to close the book on many of the topics [after Dec. 9] because the design [of the interior] will be set,” Ernst said. “There will be ample opportunity to still give input about the finishes and the furniture and other elements that aren’t so eminent.”
Appelbaum called on students to offer design feedback while they still could.
“We want to get as much student engagement as possible, but it’s up to the students to engage when the opportunities are available,” Appelbaum said.

To gain insight into students’ perspectives on the role of social media at Georgetown, the Office of Communications is creating a Social Media Advisory Committee.
“I really feel that Georgetown students are heavily engaged in social media and the way that social media can be a powerful tool for communication and collaboration,” Communications Officer Rob Mathis (GRD ’14) said. “Georgetown students know that it’s not just something that can be used as a tool within the university, but it has a worldwide impact.”
SMAC, which will be composed of students, will work with both university administrators and student groups to improve their social media strategies. At the administrative level, SMAC will offer insight into how students are using social media and how they want to see the university using it.
“A lot of that is going to the traditional, roundtable feedback, with what’s working well and what isn’t,” Cody Cowan (SFS ’14), who has been working closely with Mathis in developing SMAC, said. “The university has a great social media presence … but I think there’s always ways to improve.”
SMAC will also advise student groups on how to enhance their use of social media in order to best communicate both internally and with the rest of the world.
“I think almost every single student organization has a marketing or PR person that is in charge of social media, but they probably don’t have a lot of tools or help that will allow them to do a better job and to interface with all the other communications people,” Mathis said. “It’s my hope that this group will allow all of them to come together and amplify their collective use of social media for outreach and engagement.”
For example, Hoya Blue does not currently have a cohesive social media strategy. Rather, it primarily concentrates on Twitter, which is now complemented by a new Instagram account and a sporadically updated Facebook page.
“My hope for social media with Hoya Blue is to be able to grow it because that’s where people are getting their news about the athletic teams,” Hoya Blue Communications Officer Eddie Bradley (MSB ’14) said. “Having this committee to help with that would be good; it would definitely be helpful.”
In particular, Bradley suggested an online hub in which students could engage with social media from various campus organizations.
InterHall Vice President of Public Relations Libbi Ethier (COL ’16) agreed and said that InterHall would be open to learning about new techniques to promote events and to facilitate in inter-group interactions.
“I know most students are tired of the usual Facebook events posted on the GAAP groups and tweets about advocacy issues in the works, so I think it would be important for this committee to work on new ways to reach students,” Ethier said. “Also, I would like to see this committee exploring how to increase the use of HoyaLink on campus and how each student group can help make that happen.”
According to Cowan, the committee will focus on issues based on members’ interests, backgrounds and goals, although the details of the committee’s operations are still uncertain and will depend on student feedback. If interest is limited, the committee will likely meet in person, whereas if student interest is very large, the committee may manifest as an online forum.
“I don’t know what the questions are going to be, but it’s incredibly useful for us to have a group that could potentially answer them,” Cowan said.
The student committee is modeled after the Social Media Working Group, a cross-departmental group of staff members tasked with harnessing social media to benefit Georgetown.
The working group organized Georgetown’s 400 disparate social media accounts into a branching “hub-and-spoke” model with the Office of Communications at the center. From this center, each school branches off into departments and initiatives, allowing back-and-forth communication.
“This allows us to take our campaigns to the next level because now we’re interacting with each other and helping each other as opposed to competing for a share of voice with the same number of students and followers,” Mathis said.
The working group proved to be successful when Georgetown was ranked the 18th most influential university in social media by Klout, a social media analytical company, this year. Mathis said that the Office of Communications hopes to further this success through student involvement in SMAC.
“I think there’s going to be a lot of experimentation and working our way through it, some stumbles along the way, but I think that’s what’s exciting about this,” Mathis said. “There are a lot of opportunities for students to create their own think tank on the use of social media and how youth view social media as a communications platform but also a worldwide engagement tool.”
