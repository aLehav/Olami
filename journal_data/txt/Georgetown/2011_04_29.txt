After a “Vox Populi” blog post last month ranked the most offensive Tombs Trivia team names, several Georgetown women’s groups have joined forces to raise awareness of campus issues they say the teams trivialized.
Creators of the I Am Jane Hoya Campaign for Change said they aim to raise awareness of sexual assault and the marginalization of women and the LGBTQ community.
“A lot of us forget that it’s a real problem,” said Clare Flanagan (COL’11), one of the founders of the campaign. “You might make jokes and not realize that you are hurting people around you.”
The blog chose the names “No means yes, and yes means anal” and “Number of stairs I kicked my girlfriend down when she told me she was pregnant” as the most offensive. Runners up included jokes about women’s basketball and homosexuals.
The post sparked a long discussion on the blog, and it has received 93 comments to date. Some of the comments were written by individuals who said they found the names more humorous than offensive.
“The comments especially were really upsetting,” Flanagan said, adding that her friends who were victims of sexual assault or members of the LGBTQ community were particularly hurt.
As a result, she reached out to Georgetown’s Take Back the Night and the United Feminists to coordinate the campaign, which has since sponsored a Facebook event intended to raise awareness. The event currently has more than 300 students attending.
The group also tabled last Friday for Denim Day, a day designated to raise awareness about rape and sexual assault after the Italian Supreme Court overturned a rape conviction because the victim had been wearing jeans.
The group eventually hopes to hang posters around campus to spread the message.
“I think any visible campaign that addresses gender-based violence and other forms of harassment on campus are critical in creating a safe environment for every [student],” Laura Kovach, director of the university’s Women’s Center, wrote in an email.
“The Georgetown community needs to know that sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking and other forms of gender-based violence happen on the Hilltop,” she added.
At Georgetown, between five and 10 incidents of forced sex are reported every year. Associate Director of the Department of Public Safety Joseph Smith told The Hoya earlier this year that these represent only a small fraction of the total assaults that actually occur.
Flanagan said the complacency they hope to eliminate is common across many college campuses.
The “No means yes, and yes means anal” slogan adopted by one of the trivia teams was chanted by a Yale fraternity on their campus last October. The incident was one of many that led to a recently announced investigation of Yale’s policies in dealing with sexual assault and harassment, the Yale Herald reported.
“As Yale has seen, joking about sexual violence is not harmless,” Take Back the Night co-chairwoman Danielle LoVallo (SFS ’11) said.
LoVallo and Flanagan said that the I Am Jane Hoya campaign is a chance for students to express their opinions about a culture at Georgetown that demeans the campus as a whole.
“Humor says so much about a culture and is so specific to a culture,” Flanagan said. “In joking about sexual assault, we accept sexual assault as a natural part of our culture that isn’t going to change.”

While Georgetown professors’ salaries are on the rise, some faculty members say the increase may not be enough to combat the high cost of living in the nation’s capital.
Over the past ten years, the salary for all levels of professors has increased: Salaries have jumped by $51,500 for full professors, $33,000 for associate professors and $35,000 for assistant professors, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
The increase matches or tops the boosts in salaries at Georgetown’s peer institutions.
According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, full professor salaries at the University of Pennsylvania have increased by $18,600 in the past five years, while Georgetown saw a $19,000 increase over the same period of time. Cornell University saw only a $16,000 increase, Vanderbilt University a $15,900 bump and Harvard University a $16,400 rise.
Dartmouth College, The George Washington University and Duke University saw greater increases than Georgetown, but according to a graph on the Chronicle of Higher Education’s website comparing Georgetown to peer schools, the university has seen an above-average increase.
University officials said that Georgetown aims to offer competitive salaries in order to attract the best candidates.
“Deans set salaries, looking at what other faculty here are already getting paid for comparable records and at what the market is paying for faculty in a certain field,” University Provost James O’Donnell said in an email.
He added that while Georgetown’s tuition has gone up steadily and the endowment is rebounding after the recession, how much money Georgetown has available does not influence how much faculty are paid.
“Sources of funding are not so important: How much money we have determines how many we can hire, but we try to pay everyone we do hire as competitively and as well as possible,” he said.
Georgetown’s pay has increased more for assistant professors — most new hires fit into this category, according to O’Donnell — than at many peer institutions. Since the 2007-2008 academic year Georgetown’s pay for assistant professors has jumped by $15,200. Yale’s comparable pay increase only rose by $9,600.
“We’ve tried to make sure that when we hire people to start, we are as competitive as we can be, to get the best,” O’Donnell said.
But these high numbers are not enough to ensure that all quality candidates come to Georgetown. According to O’Donnell, Georgetown recruits about 20 to 25 candidates per year. But ensuring competitive pay is difficult, as D.C. is one of the most expensive cities to live in nationwide. According to a Huffington Post article from July 2010, D.C. is the eighth-most expensive city in the United States. Of cities with peer institutions, only Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco ranked higher.
Compounding this problem, the neighborhoods near Georgetown carry some of the highest living costs in the district. As of February, a house in Georgetown cost $787,900 to own, while one in neighboring Burleith cost $827,500. In comparison, the cost of a house in Foggy Bottom, where GWU is located, is $308,500. The average cost to own in the District is $348,600, according to the real estate site Zillow.
These high living costs make it difficult for professors to buy homes near campus. James Vreeland, an associate professor in the government department, rents an apartment in Georgetown. He is in the minority, however.
“There is a tradeoff in between renting and walking to work or buying a home and commuting,” Vreeland said.
Most professors that he knows do not live near campus. Some live in other parts of D.C. and have a 20-minute commute, and the majority of professors buy homes in nearby Virginia or Maryland and travel about 40 minutes to work each day. A small minority live more than an hour from campus.
“I decided to live near campus, because I prefer walking due to my interest in the environment, and because I don’t want to drive,” Vreeland said.
Walking may be a preferable option with the District’s history of clogged roadways. According to an article in the Washington Post from January, D.C. is tied with Chicago as having the worst traffic in the nation.
Many choose to drive for the sake of buying a home for their family, however. Thomas Banchoff, an associate professor in the government department and director of the Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, said that he chose to move to Arlington, Va., with his family because of the excellent public schools. According to Banchoff, the commute does not bother him significantly.
His wife also works at Georgetown in the German department, and buying a house in Arlington on two professor salaries is feasible, he said. While he said he was attracted to Georgetown in part due to its location in D.C. and is satisfied with his salary, he admitted it can be difficult for professors to finance living costs.
“Younger professors in particular sometimes have trouble making ends meet,” he wrote in an email.
Vreeland said that Georgetown gives little support to professors searching for housing in the area. At New York University, he said, professors receive large subsidies and are able to rent apartments in Lower Manhattan for $2,000 per month — well below average market value. Similarly, at Yale University, where Vreeland taught before coming to Georgetown, the school offers professors subsidies to buy houses in New Haven. This initiative was started in the late 1990s when the university decided to improve its relationship with the surrounding communities.
Georgetown could benefit from a similar policy, Vreeland argued.
“It is in the long-run interest of the university to get more pro-university people to move into the neighborhood. D.C. and the caliber of the institution can attract great faculty, but we are so constrained by the neighborhood,” he said.
As a renter, Vreeland said he does not have the same voice as a homeowner in local politics. Having more professors living in the surrounding area would help the university when trying to gather neighborhood support for items such as the campus plan.
“When I walk to work, I see all these signs saying ‘Our Homes, not GU’s Dorms,'” Vreeland said. “I would like to see less of these red signs, and more blue and gray ones.”

“Crazy Hair” was a candy that couldn’t be found on Long Island — unless, of course, you were buying it from Andrea Constantine (MSB ’12).
At only 13-years-old she had started her first business, selling candy that was formerly only for sale in Queens, located half an hour away.
Now a junior in college, Constantine sits at a table covered in jars of peanut butter as she recalls her first venture into the world of business.
“One day I was in the lunch line, and a girl came up to me and asked if she could buy some candy from me. I didn’t have the flavor she wanted, so we started walking out of the lunchroom to get to the locker, when two guys came up to us and asked for candy,” she recalls.
Within minutes, kids waving dollar bills and asking for the candy surrounded the two girls.
“By the time we left the lunchroom, my bag was empty,” she remembers, laughing.
According to Constantine, that’s when she realized that entrepreneurship was something she really loved.
That love has continued to grow as she prepares to launch her first company, a gourmet peanut butter venture called “Natively Nutty, LLC.” Constantine plans to launch the website in the beginning of June.
As a student in the McDonough School of Business, she seems to have the business model covered.
“I’ve already done spreadsheets. I have a couple more costs to consider — it’s not absolutely finalized,” she says.
She’s already found a supplier, estimated costs and is beginning to consider possible philanthropy. However, she stresses that she couldn’t do it alone. Her parents and a group of very supportive friends are backing Constantine, and she insists that they’ve helped her with whatever she needs along the way.
Sometimes lending a hand had a tasty payoff. Constantine has needed a number of taste testers, because she isn’t just selling peanut butter, she’s making her own flavors, including white chocolate and honey.
Constantine first came up with the idea while attending Villanova last year. Her boyfriend, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich connoisseur, got bored with the old standard and decided to add a new ingredient. One day, he spread cream cheese on his sandwich and offered it to Constantine. Surprised at how good it was, she decided that she could get more creative.
“Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches seem to be a staple in many households, especially with younger kids. So why not bring them gourmet peanut butter sandwiches?”
After determining that making unique sandwiches would be more difficult, Constantine decided to combine the ingredients right inside the jar. She’s taken the idea much further, however, writing a series of narratives, one for each flavor and even one for the nutrition information. The company has a mascot, too — an Amazon parrot named Patty.
Currently, Natively Nutty offers a total of seven flavors, each with a unique taste, name and story. Peppermint patty features peppermint flavoring and Oreo cookies, accompanied by the story of a girl who used to be a picky eater. The other flavors include Drunken Nut, Dreams in White Chocolate and Bee Nutty.
On a Tuesday evening, Constantine gathers a group of friends to sample the flavors that she has ready. Her friends are supportive but also critical, offering advice on both her recipes and her business plan.
Camilla Han-he (MSB ’13) chews thoughtfully after trying one of Constantine’s more unusual flavors: sour cream and cheddar chips peanut butter.
“There could be more chips, that could help with the contrast,” Han-he chimes in as the group discusses how to improve the flavor and texture.
Han-he, who is from a Chinese household, admits that she didn’t eat much of the American staple when she was growing up. However, she likes Constantine’s variety of flavors and calls the honey cinnamon peanut butter her favorite.
Once each of the flavors has been sampled, the group has ranked them all. White chocolate, peppermint patty and honey cinnamon come out on top, while almost everyone agrees that the sour cream and cheddar chips peanut butter needs some work.
“That just needs to be revisited,” Cody Ling (MSB’11) says after retrying the flavor. “I don’t know if it needs to be more crunchy. Have you thought about using Sun Chips?”
Once the tasting session is over, Constantine begins to clean up the kitchen, and a few friends stay to help. According to her friends, Constantine is known for baking frequently and always has food when they come over.
The more she talks, the more impossible it seems that she has any time for schoolwork, let alone baking. In addition to classes and starting her own company, Constantine is a Welcome Week coordinator and a member of the Georgetown chapter of National Society of Collegiate Scholars. She can also play the piano and violin, is fluent in Romanian and English and proficient in Spanish and French. She even used to play club volleyball at Georgetown but had to stop after a semester because it interfered with her LSAT class.
Despite her love for entrepreneurship, Constantine’s ultimate goal is actually law school. “Georgetown Law School in particular,” she specifies. “It’s always been a passion of mine as well.”
In the meantime, Constantine hopes to launch her company and help it to grow. She doesn’t want her products to be sold in supermarkets, preferring to reserve them for the gourmet market.
“Our ultimate goal is to open a store of our own, to open a Natively Nutty somewhere in Georgetown,” she said.

Despite recent turmoil in the Middle East and natural disasters in Japan, next semester many Georgetown students will pack their bags, grab their passports and continue their studies overseas.
According to students, a combination of painstaking, precautionary training by the Office of International Programs, a good dose of common sense and lower levels of danger in reality than in perception make studying abroad in possible danger zones safer than might be expected, making possible risks worthwhile.
Director of Overseas Studies Laurie Monarch stressed that Georgetown does not send students to potentially dangerous regions without proper preparation.
“All students who have been nominated to study abroad attend a pre-departure orientation during the semester prior to being off-campus,” she said. “OIP has developed a special process that students must complete if they are applying for permission to study abroad in countries with travel warnings from the Department of State.”
Permission to study in these countries is granted only when participation in the program doesn’t contradict the advice provided in the travel warning and only in exceptional circumstances.
According to Monarch, students must provide “compelling academic rationale” for studying in such dangerous countries along with demonstrating a high level of preparedness for the risks involved.
Hilary Gallo (COL ’11), who studied in Rabat, Morocco, last year, said that an awareness of cultural standards helped her avoid the troubles females commonly face when traveling in the Middle East.
“As a female, I would say that I encountered more ‘risks’ than my male friends, but that being said, those risks could all be mitigated by knowing the culture and taking steps to respect it,” she said.
Many students said that Western perceptions of the hazards in certain study-abroad destinations are outdated and overblown by regional stereotypes.
“Cape Town is fairly safe. I do not know anyone on my 150-person program that has had a violent crime committed on them. There certainly are dangers, but if you are aware of them and act smartly then you should be fine,” said Eric Valchuis (COL ’12), who is currently studying abroad in South Africa’s second-most populous city.
“Talking with a veteran of the program from seven years ago, she said that most people got either a knife or gun pulled on them while studying here. So I think that there is a lag in perceptions and also a lot of Americans lump Cape Town in with [Johannesburg] or other cities in Africa which do have stronger threats,” he added.
Raymond Fortin (SFS ’12), who is studying in Rio de Janeiro, echoed Valchuis’ views.
“I think that the American perception of safety in Brazil is largely based on the safety of favelas [Brazilian slums]. …As long as you stay in the safe parts of town, you’re OK,” he said.
Students attending universities in Jordan said that the area is largely immune to the recent unrest in the Middle East.
“I have never encountered a risk to personal safety. American perceptions of safety risks in Jordan are very much overblown,” Eric Hoerger (SFS ’12) said. Hoerger is studying in Amman this spring.
“Jordan is a different political situation from Egypt, Syria, Tunisia, Yemen, et cetera. The monarchy has been very receptive to the people, and no one is calling for the deposition of the monarchy,” he said.
Students stressed that common sense played a major role in ensuring their safety, drawing parallels between safety precautions they took overseas and those they take in Washington. Abroad, students said they try to travel in groups, stay with their local friends as much as possible and refrain from wearing flashy attire.
Alejandro González (SFS ’12) said that there are certain measures he takes to stay out of harm’s way while living in Rio de Janeiro.
“A lot of it has to do with common sense, something that many people don’t really have. I am very careful to not wear any jewelry or be flaunting around my camera or cell phone when I am in the streets,” he said. “I do not go out alone and always try to stay in a group. If I am returning home in public transportation, I try to stay as quiet as possible to not cause any attention. However, I feel like these are fairly common measures that need to be taken everywhere.”
Michelle Saks (COL ’12), who was relocated from Cairo to Rabat as a result of the revolution in Egypt, agreed that Georgetown students already have much of the knowledge that they need to survive in a foreign city.
“Wherever you study or travel, you have to make sure to know the places to avoid and appropriate behaviors of conduct that will allow you to avoid potentially dangerous situations. For instance, every Georgetown student knows that it is not necessarily safe to walk alone late at night even close to campus. Also, we all know that taking a stroll through Anacostia at any hour of the day is not the greatest idea,” she said.
Many students said that any threats they did experience were minor.
“To be frank, I never felt like my life was in danger. I knew that in Morocco if I was threatened, it was because people wanted my money, not my life,” said Jonathan Jacobs (MSB ’11), who studied abroad in Ifrane and Manchester, England, last year.
Monarch said that OIP does not support programs where potential dangers are likely to outweigh the academic benefits. She added that her department works closely with the State Department to determine if students should be evacuated from cities that become centers of violence during their stay overseas.
OIP determined that it was unsafe for students to continue studying abroad in Cairo this January.
Sarah Sealock (SFS ’12), one of the evacuees from Cairo, applauded OIP’s decision.
“I do believe that Georgetown made the correct decision. The situation was unpredictable. … I personally believe that while in some instances studying abroad in a potentially dangerous place may be warranted by a student’s area of study, studying abroad in a dangerous place would most likely prohibit the student from having as many experiences as a student studying in a stable environment,” she said.
According to Gallo, who acknowledged the risks of studying in Rabat, a sense of unease can sometimes facilitate international understanding and self-growth.
“Part of studying abroad is expanding your comfort zone, and I’m so glad I was able to do that in Morocco. I came away loving the country and the culture and cannot wait to go back,” she said.
Saks also stressed that potential dangers should not prevent people from exploring new cultures.
“Everyone from New York City to Rabat must roll out of bed and walk into the street each and every day with the understanding that there is the potential for violence, danger, natural disasters and terrorism. Should this prevent us from living our lives? From traveling and exploring new countries and cultures? I think not,” she said.

Once the epicenter of a clandestine drug lab that grabbed national attention, Room 926 in Harbin Hall sits empty this semester, its one-time residents and a campus visitor on three different paths after their Oct. 23 arrests.
John Romano (COL ’14), who has returned to campus for the spring semester, was cleared of all charges after Smith told officials that Romano was not involved in any illegal activityof manufacturing the illegal hallucinogenic dimethyltryptamine according to The Washington Post. Former SFS freshman Charles Smith and former University of Richmond first-year John Perrone, who was visiting Smith at the time faced greater legal ramifications, however.
Using dry ice, chemicals, a turkey baster, ammonia, acetate and paint thinner, Smith and Perrone began concocting the endogenous hallucinogen, which can mimic a near-death experience or a dreaming state by being smoked, inhaled or ingested.
The manufacturing of a Schedule 1 drug such as DMT can result in 20 years in prison and fines of $1 million, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s federal trafficking penalties. However, Perrone and Smith were sentenced March 18 to three years of probation and 200 hours of community service.
The pair avoided any jail time under the District of Columbia Youth Rehabilitation Act, which allows for a more lenient decisions for defendants under the age of 22.
Though the implicated students’ memory of October’s incident still remains, their lives have begun to restart.
According to his Facebook page, Smith will be attending the University of California, Berkeley in the fall as a member of the school’s class of 2015.
As for John Perrone, the 18-year-old is not currently enrolled at Richmond. Under his probation, he is allowed to return to Richmond’s campus only for educational reasons.
The pair was recently allowed to opportunity to reunite after United States District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled on April 13 that the two defendants could associate with each other but not with any other convicted felons. Typically, convicted felons by law are not allowed to associate.
According to a memorandum by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Smith was forced to withdraw from Georgetown after an onslaught of media attention centered on the Hilltop following his arrest. Perrone and Smith went back to live in their hometown of Andover, Mass., after a hearing in October. Both were responsible for passing a substance abuse program there.
Smith has been serving out his sentence at Lazurus House, an emergency center shelter in Lawrence, Mass., under the supervision of his parents. He also was attending the Middlesex Community College and taking a class at the Harvard Extension School in Boston.
“Since his arrest, Mr. Smith has taken every action available to him to show the court that he understands and accepts responsibility for the wrongfulness of his conduct,” Smith’s lawyer Danny Onorato said in a statement after Smith’s court date on March 18. “He asks the court to consider as mitigating factors that it was an isolated event and that Mr. Smith has moved swiftly and decisively to acknowledge his wrongdoing and re-establish himself as a productive and law-abiding young citizen.”
The Lazurus House declined to comment on his time there. Onorato also declined to comment, and Smith, Romano, Vice President for Facilities and Student Housing Karen Frank and Associate Director of DPS Joseph Smith could not be reached for comment.

Funding frameworks for campus groups saw sweeping change this year, with SAFE reform more than doubling the funds available to organizations and a new Student Activities Commission bulk allocation system irking many club leaders.
Greg Laverriere (COL ’12), current vice president of the Georgetown University Student Association, led the reform of the Student Activities Fee Endowment in December when he served as chairman for the Finance and Appropriations Committee. In a campus referendum passed in December, students signed off on a gradual hike of $50 in the fee, which is tacked on to students’ tuition bills.
Reflecting on the build-up to the student body vote, Laverriere said it was difficult to convince the undergraduates that an increase in tuition fees was necessary.
“The hardest part was selling the activity fee [raise],” Laverriere said. “Administrators had questions, but students had more questions. … But ultimately it will have a profound impact.”
Under the reform, the $100 fee — once allocated evenly between club funding and the Student Activities Fee Endowment — was raised to $125 for next year and $150 for the 2012-2013 academic year. After that, the annual fee will increase by the rate of inflation.
The changes also halted any allocation of the fee to a languishing endowment that was once projected to accumulate enough funds to finance student activities in the long run. A student committee was apointed to suggest major projects to be funded with the remaining $3.4 million in the endowment, and the entirety of the student activities fees each year will now go to more immediate club funding needs.
The spike in the amount of money now at the disposal of campus groups — an increase from $380,000 this year to $800,000 next year and $1 million the next — will put Georgetown in the middle of the pack compared to other universities’ club funding numbers, Laverriere said.
Jason Kluger (MSB ’11), GUSA vice president at the time of the reform push, said the largely positive reaction reflected what he determined were tangible rewards for students.
“Giving students more money, giving them more control over their money — it makes the university a student-centered place,” he said.
But with a rise in usable funds following SAFE reform, many club leaders under SAC said controlling this money as they see fit has not come as easily.
“Our biggest complaint isn’t not having enough money, but the way the money is allocated,” said Eitan Paul (SFS ’12), former chair of the International Relations Club and a vocal opponent of changes to SAC funding procedures this spring.
According to Paul, the frustration stemmed from SAC’s transition into a bulk allocation funding process and an initial lack of conversation between club leaders and the funding body. While SAC had previously allocated money on an event-by-event basis, it began issuing money based on semester-long programming arcs in the spring semester. The goal of the new system, according to SAC Vice Chairwoman Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13), was to streamline the club funding process for everyone involved.
The backlash from the transition resulted in two open letters signed by representatives of nearly a third of the clubs SAC oversees, according to Chen. The letters highlighted shortcomings that SAC had previously noted but had not yet ironed out while faced with the new system, she said.
“It’s a whole new process for our groups and for us,” Chen said.
The letters largely demanded that students be able to chime in on the new allocation system set forth by SAC.
“A lot of the frustration that clubs had been having was because there wasn’t really consultation,” Paul said.
The letters led to a SAC-sponsored town hall, and club input has led to a number of proposed amendments to the allocation process. Many clubs, such as Georgetown University College Democrats, see the reforms as a step in the right direction.
“The reforms recognize what we have been arguing all along: that club programming is flexible,” Jake Sticka (COL ’13), College Democrats vice president, said. “I also applaud SAC for being less punitive and more focused on advocating for students and student groups. I do worry that some members of the commission continue to feel paternalistic toward their student groups.”
According to Paul and Laverriere, there is still work to be done, especially to ensure that clubs receive the funding that they need on a rolling basis.
But Paul and Chen acknowledged that the dialogue this spring has been a uniting force, even if contentious at times.
“I think we’ve started to see a cultural shift both within SAC and in terms of the relationship between student groups and SAC,” Paul said. “A lot of people are just more in tune or at least having more types of conversations about what types of funding guidelines would be good for students.”
For Chen, the funding changes and the way they’ve come about have shown that GUSA and SAC have common goals.
“All of us want to contribute to student life and to the Georgetown community,” Chen said. “This year has proven that we can work together.”
For those who worked to implement these changes, the anticipation of the effects is exciting, yet bittersweet.
“I’m absolutely proud, but I think proud is a weird word,” Kluger said. “Just happy to have been able to get this money loosened up and into the hands of the students and sad more than anything that I won’t be able to truly observe the results it’s going to bring.”

The 2010 Campus Plan debate and a contentious amendment to the D.C. disorderly conduct statute spurred a rise in student activism and involvement in neighborhood and city politics this academic year.
“This year has certainly seen greater student response,” said Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), a Georgetown University Student Association senator and a co-founder of a student activist group called Stop Crime, Not Parties.
The Disorderly Conduct Amendment Act, which went into effect on Feb. 1, made it unlawful for residents to make loud noise between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., instituting a punishment of up to 90 days in prison and up to a $500 fine.
“It’s definitely something students are angry about,” said Scott Stirrett, chair of DC Students Speak, a student rights advocacy group in the District.
While many students originally feared that the amendment would result in a crackdown on off-campus parties, there have not been many reports of party busts since the order was put into effect.
Stop Crime, Not Parties has a website that allows students to submit complaints about encounters with police and other authorities over noise levels, but Malkerson said that there have not been many cases reported.
According to him, the changes may have incited more of an outrage than was necessary.
“I think a bit of the concern over the noise law was overblown at first,” he said.
Ron Lewis, chair of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, said the amendment was a clarification to the statute — not meant to be purposefully targeted at students.
Even still, Stirrett said he thought that the warm weather and a new school year could usher in greater MPD action on the amendment.
“We think it’s an issue students should be really aware of, especially going into the month of September,” he said.
While not many arrests have been made, the amendment got students thinking about city politics and the role they could play, according to Malkerson. He added that the group had over 50 orders for lawn signs that read “Stop Crimes, Not Parties.”
“We’re just trying to show the neighborhood and surrounding community that students aren’t going to sit idly by anymore,” he said.
The focus of Stop Crimes, Not Parties will shift toward an educational role, as there is not enough student awareness and activism, according to Malkerson.
“A lot of students don’t know necessarily what their rights are,” he said.
Stirrett said the increased interest in DC Students Speak and in the District policies affecting students has been encouraging. The group established a blog in January, which has since received over 10,000 hits. Students also have supported their petition opposing the disorderly conduct amendment and a petition backing the university’s campus plan. According to Stirrett, of the 85,000 students in D.C., 40,000 live in Ward 2, where Georgetown is located.
DC Students Speak is encouraging students to register to vote in D.C. and has put on campus voter drives.
“We encourage students to vote where it affects them the most,” Stirrett said.
Stirrett cited a historic basis for Georgetown students’ activism in D.C., especially in the late 1990s. He said that after a drop-off in participation between 2002 and 2010, students are reviving their involvement. DC Students Speak is looking to capitalize on this interest and facilitate greater student participation in city politics.
Lewis emphasized the positive and important role that students play in neighborhood politics, stating that his experience with student commissioners on the ANC has been positive.
“They have been absolutely terrific,” he said. “It’s perfectly important for student voices to be heard.”
According to Lewis, the community and students have many of the same concerns, such as better space on campus and increased safety.
“I think there are a lot of issues where student interests and the community’s interests are the same,” he said. “There are a number of areas where we can and do work together.”
Adam Mortillaro, co-founder of Stop Crimes, Not Parties and GUSA senate speaker, said he hoped that students and the neighborhood can work together more in the future.
“We live together,” he said. “There’s absolutely no reason why we can’t all get along.”

After a semester wracked with international challenges, Laura Monarch, the director of the overseas studies in the Office of International Programs, got a breather this week to discuss how she orchestrated the safe removal of students from the upheaval in Cairo and natural disasters in Japan.
“Under the circumstances, things functioned well,” Monarch says, leaning back in her chair, as she calmly details the decision-making process behind Georgetown’s evacuation of 15 students from Cairo on Monday, January 31. The weekend before the forced departure was anything but stress-free.
“We had conference calls scheduled at regular intervals throughout the day on Sunday, where we would give any updates we had on the students’ situation and brainstorm about ways of getting them out,” she says. Senior university officials like Provost James O’Donnell, the general counsel’s office and the risk management team were consulted for advice.
Between calls, Monarch adds, she and OIP Executive Director Katherine Bellows would contact the parents of the students to keep them in the loop. At the same time, several people were in contact with SOS, an international helpline service, while looking into various flight options out of the city rocked by riots against Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year regime.
Revolutionaries first gathered in the streets of Cairo on Jan. 25. Initially, students expressed excitement at witnessing such an historic event. But as the violence escalated when Mubarak refused to heed the calls of the protesters and step down, the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning on Jan. 30, telling citizens not to travel to Egypt. In the wake of the warning, Monarch says, OIP did not delay a decision about the future of the semester’s program.
“We worked all day Sunday to coordinate and look at options for getting the students out. We were looking for the fastest possible way.”
That way turned out to be on a commercial flight Monday afternoon to Doha, Qatar.
The students took a bus to the airport the following morning and were on a plane that afternoon to Qatar, where the School of Foreign Service has a satellite campus. In an email on Jan. 31, one of the displaced students, Michelle Saks (COL ’12), said that Georgetown’s quick action was remarkable.
“We are now safe and sound at a beautiful complex next to the SFS Qatar Campus and have been greeted by dozens of Georgetown staff members. … We were extraordinarily fortunate to get out of Cairo today. I would be surprised if any other American students could say the same.”
Monarch explains that while Georgetown did not necessarily start planning for an evacuation earlier than other schools, its ties to Qatar made for a smooth transition.
After a few days in Doha, the students were given four options to fill the rest of the semester: return to the main campus, stay at SFS-Qatar, study in Morocco under the auspices of the AMIDEAST program or go to Koc University in Istanbul, Turkey.
Saks picked Rabat, Morocco.
“I was in love with Egypt and would go back in a heartbeat,” she wrote via email. “However, I have tried my best not to think about what I am missing in order to truly appreciate the amazing opportunity in front of me.”
Monarch explains that the students chose where to spend the rest of the semester after consulting with their deans. “It was a pretty significant delay to their semesters and we took that into account when recommending options.”
With the crisis-induced lag behind them, all of the students are on track to finish the semester and receive credit.
Another group of students forced to cut short their study abroad this spring were not so lucky, however. The spring semester had not yet kicked off in Tokyo when a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami ravaged Japan on Friday, March 11.
The following Monday, OIP sent students in Japan an email urging them to leave the country. Six students were in Japan at the time, five of whom were full-year students preparing for their second semester in the island nation. The other seven students scheduled to study there had not yet arrived or were traveling at the time.
“We recommended that students leave Japan because of the fluid nature of the escalation and the pending nuclear crisis. Things were developing rapidly, and not in a good way. We wanted to make sure they could get out before it became difficult,” Monarch says.
All six complied with the university’s warning. OIP later sent a follow-up email saying that the university had decided to cancel the spring semester program.
According to Monarch, this meant that the students’ academic status was left up in the air. With the semester already winding down on the main campus and in all other study abroad locations, they had little choice but to return home.
The students are now working with their deans to determine how to best make up for an entire semester’s worth of credits. Advisers have suggested the students take summer classes either at Georgetown or at universities close to home.
“This puts me in a difficult position in many ways. I have no summer work or internship plans, as I thought I wouldn’t need them,” Michael Goulet (COL ’12) wrote in an email to The Hoya in March. “I have paid tuition and taken out loans to pay for a semester that I am now not going to have. Also, I am now missing a semester’s worth of classes.”
According to Monarch, tuition for the semester was refunded.
Monarch admits that Goulet was not the only student upset by the abrupt end to the study abroad experience. “But our foremost concern is the safety of the students, and we were faced with a nuclear situation, the possibility of significant aftershocks, power outages and the burden the situation was placing on our partners in Japan,” she explains.
The fall semester in Japan is set to go on, she says, as the situation has stabilized and the travel warning lightened. The summer program in Alexandria is also set to take place unless there is more upheaval in Egypt. A final decision on the Cairo program for the fall will be reached by the end of May. Monarch says that hopefully future programs won’t be affected, but the safety of students abroad is always OIP’s top priority.
For OIP, dealing with the crises this year while still advising students traveling to less vulnerable regions has been challenging, but according to Monarch everyone in the office has pitched in.
As Monarch tells it, “It’s been a rough semester.”

Alan Ardelean has a fire in his belly.
For eight years, Ardelean channeled it into his work with the Marine Corps. He deployed twice, guarded several embassy posts and was on a number of security details for top government officials.
Now Ardelean has a different outlet for that fire: university lobbying.
Ardelean is part of a core group of former soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that have worked vigorously with the university to better the benefits available for military veterans. Unlike many major universities, Georgetown does not have a full-time veterans office for undergraduates during the academic year. It provides scant funding for veterans projects and scholarships, and it did not include a question about military service on its application until this year.
“We are not attractive to veterans at all,” Ardelean says.
After three years of work, though, campus veterans are starting to see formidable changes on campus.
The process began tentatively in 2008 when Luke Lagera (MSB ’10) and several other students founded the University Military Association at Georgetown University. According to a national defense committee document, the organization was meant to “promote a positive military presence on university campuses, while providing a supportive social network for veterans, active duty and reserve personnel; thus, furthering the interests of our national defense community.”
Little had changed by 2009. In order to quicken the pace of progress, Spanish professor  Barbara Mujicabegan coordinating with campus veterans during the fall of 2009, and a new organization emerged during the spring semester the Georgetown University Student Veterans of America. As a chapter of the national SVA organization, the student-run club had the guidance it needed to effectively gain exposure, and under the leadership of president Erik Brine (GRD ’11), vice president Colby Howard (SFS ’12) and Mujica, it began to lobby the university for financial aid.
Mujica, whose son is a Marine officer, recalls how the university had almost no policies in place before GUSVA intervened.
“We have made a lot of progress in terms of better visibility for veterans,” she says. “Compared to where we started, it’s amazing that we have anything at all.”
The first success was the university’s decision to increase its spending on the Yellow Ribbon Program, a voluntary scholarship endeavor in which the university donates money that is then matched by the Department of Veterans Affairs. University officials agreed to up their spending to $5,000 per undergraduate student, providing the student with $10,000 after the VA contribution.
Unfortunately, Ardelean says, the program is by no means perfect. Some veterans with increased Yellow Ribbon benefits saw their university financial aid package drop, meaning that their gains were minimal.
At the graduate level, though, the Yellow Ribbon scholarships have been a great help to students since the university does not provide them with any need-based financial aid. The School of Continuing Studies, for example, now provides $12,675 to student veterans through the program, over double what the undergraduates receive.
But GUSVA needed much more than just Yellow Ribbon funding. It needed a centralized veterans office.
For most veterans, GI Bill education benefits are complicated and befuddling. In order to facilitate communication with the VA, as well as to help students transition into civilian life, GUSVA began lobbying hard for a full-time office.
The School of Continuing Studies was able to establish a full time post for next year, but the university was unsure if it could provide one for undergraduates. Finally in February, a part-time office was arranged. It wasn’t the full-time position that GUSVA wanted, but it was a start.
“The administration is not hostile,” Mujica explains. “They are willing and open and nice. But there is a money problem.”
David Shearman (SFS ’11), a veteran of the Army, was selected to head up the new office, and he has worked about 15 hours per week through the spring semester. His primary focus has been to make connections within and outside of the university, and already he has been able to help prospective students navigate the application process and understand the financial aid that would be provided through the VA.
Still, he says, the office really needs to be a full-time endeavor. This summer, he plans to make it one, though in the fall he will resume his part-time work while taking graduate classes at the university.
Right now, Shearman’s office is on the third floor of Healey Hall, but the university will be moving it to a lower level room in the Car Barn in the coming weeks. The location isn’t as nice, but Shearman says that it will be better to finally have a set office space.
Howard was certainly pleased to see the part-time position established, but he says that the job really requires a full-time staff like the one The George Washington University has founded.
“The big shortfall really is that full-time position,” he says. “We need that.”
With the strides that it has made this year, GUSVA feels that it is in a good position to continue its push for benefits next year. It merged earlier this year with the UMAGU, and the focus now will be on turning the part-time undergraduate office into a full-time deal. It’s the waiting, Mujica says, that can be the most frustrating.
“It is slow. It is frustratingly slow, and I sometimes want to pull my hair out because the university will find money for other things that I don’t think are as urgent,” Mujica says.
The university says that it is looking forward to working with GUSVA in the future.
“We are committed to establishing services to meet the needs of our student veterans and have taken a number of important steps to better support our student veterans at Georgetown,” said university spokeswoman Rachel Pugh in an email. “Moving forward, we hope to continue to take appropriate steps to meet the needs of our student veterans.”
Across the hall from the future veterans office, Mujica says that there is an empty room that she would love to turn into a lounge. So far, she has not received university approval, but GUSVA is hoping to get its hands on the space if it is available.
“I can’t just go in there and claim it,” she says. “If it were [Ardelean], he would. He’d roll in with a tank or something.”
For the time being, however, GUSVA has its eyes set on the more immediate goal of campus exposure to the military, which the organization believes will help it garner more university support.
“There’s a whole lot more to do,” Mujica says. “I think we need to educate the university. I think there’s still some anti-military Vietnam sentiments in some corners of the university.”
Though the process has seemed painfully slow to some, Howard is ultimately pleased with the gains that he and his fellow veterans have made this year. He says that though he wishes the process would accelerate, the university is moving quickly on its own timetable.
“What seems to us a snail’s speed,” he says, “is to the university a breakneck speed.”

They say Nevada is the “Silver State,” but for political junkies this week it’s been golden. A tumultuous chain reaction of political events has just rocked the state, creating serious implications for 2012’s critical elections in which Nevada might be the country’s top swing state.
Republican rising stars didn’t get much brighter than John Ensign. A young, telegenic and personable politico, he was elected to the House at 36 and to the Senate at 42. In a politically competitive state, his 14-point reelection in 2006 over Jack Carter, the former president’s son, heralded his bright political future. Running for the presidency became a real possibility.
Then the walls came tumbling down. The Evangelical, family values-touting Ensign humiliatingly revealed that he had been having an affair with Cindy Hampton from 2007 until 2008. Her husband, Doug, was one of Ensign’s top staffers and close friends. The story got even more grisly when it was discovered that Ensign’s parents paid Doug Hampton $96,000 in an attempt to buy his silence. His hypocrisy and sleaziness now expanded to include federal ethics violations.
Ensign, like most political egos, took his sweet time in coming to terms with the full extent of his sins. As Senate Ethics Committee investigations against him raged, he maintained he would seek re-election to the Senate in 2012 until announcing his retirement on March 7 of this year.
The candidates to replace Ensign immediately exploded out of the gates. While primary competition is a possibility, the general election candidates are virtually locked in. The Democrat will almost surely be Congresswoman Shelley Berkley, who has represented urban Las Vegas since 1999. A reliable liberal and favorite of the grassroots and party establishment, Berkley hopes to latch onto the robust re-elect effort made by President Obama in Nevada, as well as Senator Harry Reid’s top-notch political machine.
Her Republican opponent will be Congressman Dean Heller, who represents the massive Second District, which covers virtually all of Nevada outside of Las Vegas. A former member of the Nevada Assembly, three-term Secretary of State and popular congressman, the young and dynamic Heller is well known, well liked and well financed. While Republican primaries in Nevada have been internecine affairs in the past, Heller immediately locked down the endorsements of Governor Brian Sandoval, Lieutenant Governor Brian Krolicki and the state GOP’s top brass.
A marquee 2012 Senate race was kicked up a notch just a few days ago when Ensign shockingly tendered his resignation, effective May 3. The move came in light of the fact that the ethics case against the senator had grown overwhelming. For his personal sake, and for the good of his family and constituents, he made the right choice in stepping aside.
The spotlight turned to Governor Sandoval, who announced Wednesday he was appointing Heller to fill the remainder of Ensign’s term. This move is a coup for the GOP. Heller will elevate his statewide profile, be able to tap into more funding and can avoid controversial House votes as he heads toward a general election face-off with Berkley next November. A Public Policy Polling survey of the race, conducted April 21-24, had Heller at 47 percent to Berkley’s 43 percent, with a 4.4 percent margin of error. The race will surely be tight, and while it is too soon to call Heller the overwhelming favorite, his effort was boosted by his early elevation to the upper chamber.
For the first time in Nevada’s history, the state will be forced to hold a special election for Heller’s soon-to-be vacant Second District seat. Already, a rambunctious field has been announced. 2010 failed GOP Senate nominee and Tea Party darling Sharron Angle soaks up much of the limelight. But she will face tough competition against the Republican company, including State Senator Greg Brower and former U.S.S. Cole Commander Kirk Lippold. State GOP Chairman Mark Amodei and Lieutenant Governor Krolicki are all rumored to be entering the race as well.
Unfortunately, election law is unclear. Secretary of State Ross Miller must decide whether an all-candidate primary should be held, or if parties should pick their nominees behind closed doors. The latter would shut out Angle to the delight of the GOP establishment. Miller’s decision could affect either party’s ability to win the seat. However, all is moot considering Nevada will redistrict, which will add a fourth seat for the state in 2012. For the time being, Nevada’s delegation in the House of Representatives will be nothing short of chaotic.
Stay glued to Nevada throughout 2011 and into 2012. The state is almost a perfect toss-up, and developments before the presidential election next year could be telling signs of the direction in which our country is heading.

As the number of Jesuits decreases at universities across the country, many institutions are renewing their focus on the Jesuit identity and developing innovative ways to maintain Jesuit culture — the Hilltop included.
The New York Times reported that the number of Jesuits has fallen by 70 percent since 1954 and that several Jesuit colleges have been forced to confront the real possibility that the order might soon disappear from their campuses.
The Jesuits, formally known as The Society of Jesus in the United States, have been an integral part of the Georgetown community since the school’s founding by Archbishop John Carroll, S.J. Dedicated to learning, service and faith, they play active roles in the educational, religious and social facets of the university.
But even Georgetown’s highly visible and involved Jesuit community has been impacted by the recent downward trend in the number of new priests joining religious orders.
Georgetown’s Jesuit community has seen an almost 50 percent decline in members in the past 36 years, dropping from 122 in 1975 to 64 today, according to The Washington Post.
Fr. Howard Gray, S.J., special assistant to President John J. DeGioia, entered the Society of Jesus in 1948 following his high school graduation. For him, the decline in the number of new members is very visible in the community.
“There were about 10 to 12 of us that entered the Jesuits out of high school,” he said. “Times have changed now.”
He added that this dip in numbers poses several challenges for the future of the order.
“When you have a decreased population you count on and that population is aging, that affects your mobility and flexibility,” he said.
“The question for me is, ‘How do we give our scholars, who may have been lawyers or students, the time and space that they need to study?'” he added, noting the academic role that Jesuits have filled within the Catholic Church.
While Gray and many of his fellow Jesuits note the change in demographics, they believe certain measures can be taken to keep their legacy alive.
“Some universities have had a much greater decline in the number of men in active ministry whereas others still have significant numbers,” Fr. John Siberski, S.J. said. “We cannot afford to spend much time mourning diminishment or reminiscing about the good old days. The focus is the present.”
There is a silver lining to the problem of the diminishing size of the Jesuit order: The decline in numbers has sparked renewed efforts by institutions to connect their Jesuit communities to their general campuses.
Georgetown’s Wolfington Hall, completed in 2003, provides a centrally-located residence for campus Jesuits and has been an important tool for increasing student access to Jesuits and creating spaces where community members can meet.
“The new residence was specifically designed to be more open and inviting to the Georgetown community,” Fr. Otto Hentz, S.J., said.” And the impact on campus has been dramatic. Students, faculty and alumni are there all the time, and we’re constantly hosting events, meetings and dinners for all sorts of groups.”
Many Jesuits are not worried that their reduced numbers will lessen Georgetown’s Jesuit identity because their core ideals of knowledge, service and compassion still animate professors, students and administrators.
Gray said that the order must foster its traditions and ideals through their lay brethren.
“More and more we see ourselves moving into collaborative leadership,” he said. “We need professionally competent lay colleagues that can express the Jesuit heritage.”
But students worry that Georgetown wouldn’t be the same without a Jesuit presence on campus.
“The Jesuits dedicate their entire lives to finding God through knowledge and passing that along to us. I think it’d be impossible to ever replace them,” said Alexa McCue (SFS ’13).
Whatever happens to the order in the future, a number of Georgetown Jesuits and students seem determined to maintain the traditions of Jesuit scholarship and service in a constantly transforming campus community.
“Change happens. It is the basic reality of life for individuals, groups, universities and nations. Predicting what those changes will be, how they will be affected, and what kind of impact they will have is always a losing proposition,” Sibenski said.
“The Jesuit presence at Georgetown has been evolving since 1789. That, at least, isn’t going to change.”

Georgetown was recognized Monday as the 13th highest-rated university in the nation by Ratemyprofessors.com for 2011. Many faculty and students received the news with the same cloud of suspicion that surrounds the website’s popular professor rankings, however.
Ratemyprofessors.com provides the largest collection of college professor rankings online and is visited by over three million students each month. The national rankings were based on a combination of average professor ratings and campus ratings, a recent addition to the website. Brigham Young University and Florida State University placed first and second, respectively.
The rankings show no correlation to size or prestige. Of the top 25 schools in the Rankmyprofessors.com rankings, only two appear in the highly regarded U.S. World and News Report 2011 national university rankings: Georgetown, which is 21 on the list and the University of California at Berkeley, which is 20th on the list.
Georgetown boasts a 4.3 overall school rating on Ratemyprofessors.com, while BYU has a 4.5. Harvard University — the highest ranked school on the U.S. World and News Report list — has a 3.7 overall rating on the website and was not included in the rankings.
This issue draws into question whether ratings for each school’s professors are determined relative to other professors at that institution or to professors nationally.
Undergraduates interviewed said this uncertainty prevents a valid national comparison.
“The ranking has little to no bearing, importance or value as far as assessing a college,” Zosia Dunn (COL ’14) said. She was joined in dismissing the results by Ian Villeda (SFS ’11), who said he stopped using the website to help choose classes because he feels the validity of students posting is unpredictable.
“The rankings mean nothing,” Villeda said. “All it means to me is that Georgetown students really love their professors and are willing to post about it more than other students.”
Yet many students, including Dunn, said they rely on Ratemyprofessors.com heavily when selecting courses. Jess Hubert (COL ’12) said he uses the website frequently but is wary of students who use the forum to vent frustration.
“When I’m looking at the ratings, I’m looking more at specifics like the class and how it’s structured more than I am opinions about the professor,” Hubert said.
Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., an assistant professor in the government department, expressed concern with the website’s numerous statistical drawbacks.
“The people who go there are going to be the ones who are highly motivated either because they loved a class or even more likely, because they absolutely hated a class. So you are going to get a sample that is going to be skewed,” he said.
To combat this, Carnes encouraged students to post their opinions online.
“For it to be a useful device for students every student should participate for every class,” he said. “If not, they are going to be enslaved by the people who are motivated enough to do this.”
Stefan Zimmers, a professorial lecturer in the history department, said he too takes the results with a grain of salt.
“The very easy professors tend to get high marks,” Zimmers said. “It all depends on who has a bone to pick. To me that’s not necessarily any kind of real evaluative tool to decide where Georgetown is in the overall scheme of professors.”
Of students interviewed, none were familiar with the campus ratings component, which was added to the website and rankings formula this year. To date, only 53 students have completed this survey for Georgetown.
“If students are aware that it’s going to be used for a national comparison, they are going to rate their school better,” Hubert said.
Most professors interviewed said they favor the faculty evaluations conducted by the university for gauging student feedback.
“I find the faculty evaluations much more crucial and much more critical because you have a wider sample,” Zimmers said.
Despite frustrations with the validity of the website’s statistics, faculty and students seemed unsurprised that Georgetown would receive this honor.
“There are some very committed and talented professors at Georgetown, and they really shine through,” Carnes said. “So that students would recognize that on Ratemyprofessors doesn’t surprise me.”

Students flocked to Healy Circle to taste fresh produce, buy organic foods and view cooking demonstrations at the pilot opening of Georgetown’s first farmers’ market Wednesday afternoon.
The event, organized by two Georgetown students and funded by a ReImagine Georgetown grant, marked the launch of what will be a regularly occurring farmers’ market next semester.
According to Bre Donald (NHS ’12), co-founder of the market, the eight vendors present were surprised at the turnout.
“All of the vendors had high profit margins, and many of them sold out of their products,” she said.
When the market officially kicks off in September, vendors will return to sell their products at Georgetown each Wednesday for six or seven weeks. Donald and Gadsden say they hope to secure a few more vendors, and all of the current vendors have agreed to return in the fall. They also plan to get more students involved in the market.
For the students who attended, the market piqued their interest.
Sarah Christiano (COL ’13) usually attends a farmers’ market at home and was impressed by the one on campus.
Chirei Chang (SFS ’13) was also supportive.
“I’m really excited to buy some apples,” Chang said as she stood in line for produce.
The market attempted to gauge the campus’ reaction by handing out surveys to those in attendance. Donald said the results indicated that the vast majority of campus would be interested in attending the market again in the fall.
The pilot, which ran from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., featured eight vendors, including Beechwood Orchards, Les Caprices de Joelle, TeaCo, Panorama Bakery, Wollam Gardens and Sweet Nut House. The merchants hocked their organic goods, pastries, teas, flowers, fresh fruit and honey.
The market also featured cooking demonstrations by Whole Foods and an appearance by the Sweetflow van.
Donald and Melissa Gadsden (NHS ’12) first came up with the idea for a market for a class project but decided they wanted to take the idea further. They then applied for the ReImagine Georgetown grant.
With the help of the grant, the Georgetown University Student Association Fund and student groups like The Corp, EcoAction and the Gastronomes, Donald and Gadsden were able to plan the market they hope will continue to serve Georgetown.
“It’s cool that it seems the entire campus community has really embraced this idea and has provided part of the motivation to make sure that the event came together in the end,” Gadsden wrote in an email.

Students from environmental groups at Georgetown and five other D.C. universities met on campus to collaborate on promoting eco-friendly programs on college campuses.
The first meeting of the D.C. Green Student Organization Forum, organized by members of The Corp and EcoAction, was held in the Leonard Seminar Room of Reynolds Hall on Tuesday night.
“This was a chance for us to get together and talk about what works and what doesn’t on campuses, specifically with college students. The idea is to include student groups at D.C. universities and see what other schools talk about and are doing,” said Bettina Bergöö (COL ’11), Corp Green Initiative member and one of the organizers of the event.
Bergöö held the forum along with fellow Corp Green Initiative member Scott Breen (COL ’11) and EcoAction Co-president Claire Austin (SFS ’12) to allow attendees to learn from each others’ successes and failures.
The forum opened with a brief talk by guest speaker Sarah Murphy, an employee of the DC Project and alum of the Sierra Student Coalition. Murphy stressed the importance of campaign planning, strategizing and organizing to create effective events and groups on campuses.
Members of green student groups from American University, Catholic University, The George Washington University, the University of the District of Columbia, Georgetown’s Law Center and the main campus then discussed their own challenges and accomplishments.
While American University’s and The George Washington University’s student groups described a number of eco-friendly initiatives they have undertaken on their campuses in the past several years, the University of the District of Columbia discussed how their Sustainability Program just launched this year. Representatives from Catholic University’s Green Club joked that the three members present at the forum represented a “healthy proportion” of their club membership.
Madeline Howard (COL ’12), a member of Georgetown’s fledgling Community Garden organization, said the exchange of information between student groups with similar goals was a valuable experience.
“I feel like it really is important for us to talk to each other, because even on campus it can be hard to communicate,” she said. “There’s strength in numbers.”
Groups said the coalition plans to continue the dialogue next year, possibly meeting once a semester. Breen said that he hopes Georgetown will be able to improve its own green programs by looking to the examples set by other local schools.
“I’m jealous of what other universities are doing,” he said. “I feel like some are doing a lot more, doing a lot of outside-the-box thinking. It was good to hear about these things and think: We could be doing this at Georgetown.”

The McDonough School of Business announced that it will partner with Bank of America to form the Global Social Enterprise Initiative, a program designed to prepare students to conduct successful socially conscious business.
The Bank of America Charitable Foundation has donated $1 million to Georgetown to support the initiative. The gift is among the largest donations given to the university by the banking industry, according to an MSB press release.
According to former AARP CEO and MSB professor of the practice William Novelli, who will head the initiative, the program plans to integrate its socially minded focus into the business school’s curriculum and research. It is Novelli’s hope that every student that graduates will leave prepared to conduct a new form of business that he calls “doing well by doing good.”
“We want to … create the leaders of tomorrow,” Novelli said.
The integrated effort will also work with campus organizations such as Net Impact and Compass Partners.
Neil Shah (MSB ’10), co-founder of Compass Partners, says the group has been in talks with GSEI and is excited to interact with the new initiative. There is no formal relationship currently planned between Compass and GSEI.
“We’re working toward the same goal, we’re in the same school, and I’m sure we’ll cross paths in future,” Shah said.
The university approached Bank of America about the partnership, drawing on already existing initiatives by the bank, according to Novelli.
“They are very interested in tackling economic development and job growth, so it was a big issue that fit within our model,” he said.
GSEI plans to partner with the government, non-profits and corporations to help creatively solve global problems. According to the initiative’s website, it will focus on the areas of global health and well-being, responsible investing, clean energy technology, international development and economic growth.
“The initiative aims to tackle the big social and economic issues of the day,” Novelli said. “Businesses have to create economic value for their stockholders, but they’ve discovered that they can do that by creating social value.”
GSEI aims to collaborate with the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, Edmund Walsh School of Foreign Service, Georgetown Law Center, School of Nursing and Health Studies, Center for Social Impact Communications and other university programs, according to a flier used at the kick-off panel.
“We are thrilled to partner with Georgetown’s new Global Social Enterprise Initiative to explore new ideas in solving our most pressing social issues,” James Mahoney, global public policy and corporate communications executive at Bank of America, said while announcing the donation.
Novelli said that eventually GSEI will look to grow beyond the United States as it seeks to fulfill its mission.
“We mean this to be global. Georgetown is global. The companies and organizations are global. The problems are global,” he said.
Correction: This article originally stated GSEI stood for Georgetown Social Entrepreneurship Initiative. The correct name is the Georgetown Social Enterprise Initiative.

Senators Bob Casey (D-Penn.) and Patty Murray (D–Wash.) introduced legislation this week designed to reduce sexual assaults on college campuses.
The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act would amend the Jeanne Clery Act, which requires colleges and universities that participate in federal aid programs to keep and disclose information about crime on and around their campuses. Under the SaVE Act, colleges would be required to more clearly set out their policies regarding sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking.
Colleges will now have to include a statement of policy regarding sexual harassment and violence in their annual security reports along with giving students who report incidents a written explanation of their rights.
The legislation also supports bystander education, which teaches college students ways to respond to witnessing violence. It also provides for collaboration between the Departments of Justice and Education to gather best practices information about preventing and responding to sexual violence.
The act is vague about the specifics of how colleges and universities would need to change the way they report crimes of sexual violence and harassment. However, advocates for better awareness of sexual violence on campus believe that the law could improve reporting and understanding of the issue.
Georgetown’s Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Services Coordinator Jen Schweer said that the proposed changes could better inform students about sexual assault while dispelling the stigma surrounding the issue.
“I believe the Sexual Violence Elimination Act is a positive step in the direction of helping us to continue and expand the dialogues and programs that we already have in place,” she said. “The more education we can provide, the easier it can be to dispel myths and victim-blaming.”
Danielle LoVallo (SFS ’11), co-chair of the on-campus anti-gender violence group Take Back the Night, believes that the proposed legislation could help make college campuses more secure.
“It is a big step in the right direction,” she wrote in an email. “In light of Vice President Biden’s recent campaign to address sexual and domestic violence on campus, the SaVE Act represents a whole-of-government approach. Georgetown University should follow suit.”
LoVallo added that the push for sexual assault awareness by universities themselves might reduce the frequency of this type of violence.
“Hopefully with mandatory education for all new students and employees, those numbers will no longer be too high.”
The act has been endorsed by more than 15 advocacy groups, including Security on Campus and the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence.
“We’ve come a long way since sexual violence on campus was first recognized as a national challenge,” S. Daniel Carter, the director of public policy for Security on Campus, said in a statement on the organization’s website.
“The numbers prove we still have a long way to go, however, and SaVE will move us closer to eliminating the scourge of sexual violence on campus,” he added.
Schweer echoed his sentiments, localizing them for Georgetown.
“Creating this as a part of legislation shines an important light on a topic that impacts all of us in some way.”

At least three Georgetown students were turned away at the polls when they tried to vote in yesterday’s special election for at-large member of the D.C. Council.
The students’ names were not on the list of registered voters, and they did not have the required documents — government ID and proof of residency — for same-day registration.
The students were not given a provisional ballot and a chance to prove their residency at a later date, however.
After traveling to her polling place with a group of students from DC Students Speak yesterday afternoon, Sarah Christiano (COL ’13) was unable to cast a ballot.
“I was really upset,” she said. “I just hope it didn’t happen to a lot of other people across the city.”
Christiano later called the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics to report the incident. The BOEE called her back at about 7 p.m., an hour before the polls closed.
At that point, she did not have time to return to the polling place and pick up her provisional ballot.
“It was even more frustrating to know I should have been able to vote but couldn’t,” she said.
Alice McLaughlin, a public information officer at the District’s BOEE, said that poll workers should have allowed students to cast a ballot and instructed them to return to the BOEE office with the proper identification.
“[After receiving complaints,] I called the precinct captain and instructed her that those ballots needed to be cast,” McLaughlin said.
Additionally, the BOEE issued a memo to poll workers outlining the additional forms of ID and proofs of residency that could be accepted.
McLaughlin added that she hoped that students were able to return to their polling places when the issue was resolved. She also encouraged students to report future problems while still at their polling places.
“Whatever kind of problem people have in a polling place … we prefer to be able to resolve issues on the spot,” she said.
Christiano attributed the problem to miscommunication about the voting procedures for special elections.
Scott Stirret (SFS ’13), the chair of DC Students Speak, agreed that the mistakes were due to a misunderstanding but stressed that the effects were still serious.
“I don’t think this a concerted effort to minimize student involvement, but it is an example of how sometimes errors can be made that minimize first time voters’ involvement with the political process,” he said.
Yesterday would have been Christiano’s first time voting in the District. She switched her registration to D.C. two months ago because she felt her vote was more important here.
“I think my vote pulls more weight here,” she said. “If [students] care about our issues then we need to show that we care [by voting],” she said. “We need to go out there and vote to prove we’re committed to Georgetown and D.C.”

After several months of negotiations between Congress, the White House and the Department of Education, Pell Grant funding and other federal sources of financial aid have emerged from the budget process relatively unscathed.
The negotiated continuing resolution allocates $23 billion to the program and maintains the maximum annual Pell Grant award at $5,550. Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant funds, another program from which Georgetown students draw federal aid, was slated to be entirely eliminated in earlier House versions of the budget. The program was only modestly reduced, however, after it was allocated $780 million, a reduction of $20 million from last year.
This budget battle was watched closely by Georgetown officials, as some 830 students received Pell Grants totaling $3,478,197 in the 2009-2010 academic year. Georgetown also utilized $1,864,796 in SEOG funds last year in financial aid packages for 467 students.
Not all aspects of the Pell Grant program survived the process. A part of the program that allows qualified students to take out a second Pell Grant in a single year, usually for summer study, was eliminated for 2012.
The elimination of the summer Pell Grant was expected, as both Congress and the White House agreed that the program had ballooned well beyond its initial projected costs.
Initial estimates for the summer grant put it at one percent of the total Pell budget, but demand far exceeded expectations, and projections for 2013 put expected costs of these grants at $5 billion, or 14 percent of the total budget.
Despite some cuts, university officials and administrators were satisfied overall with how the chips fell.
“Obviously, the absence of summer Pell will have an impact on some students,” Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said. “Beyond that, however, the maintaining of the maximum Pell Grant at $5,550 and the maintaining of most of SEOG funding will mean our student aid programs will not be hindered.”
Fleming’s response echoes that of University President John J. DeGioia.
“We were very pleased that the [Obama] administration was successful in protecting the $5,550 maximum Pell Grant award. … In the face of the severe cuts proposed in the initial House-passed Fiscal 2011 Continuing Resolution, the outcome was very welcome,” DeGioia said in an April 20 letter to Education Secretary Arne Duncan,
When asked what caused the turn in favor of higher education aid programs, Fleming pointed to the top.
“I believe … [in] large part, it was the [Obama] administration’s forcefulness in saying education was an area that was important,” he said.
Even though summer Pell Grants were eliminated by the continuing resolution, both the Office of Federal Relations and the Office of Student Financial Services confirmed that the 55 Georgetown summer 2011 Pell Grant recipients, who have received a total of $79,000, will keep their aid. More students are expected to be confirmed for summer grants in the coming weeks.
Even though Pell Grant and SEOG funding were largely spared this time, the continuing resolution covers Pell Grant and SEOG funding only through the 2011-2012 academic year. Battles over the future of these programs have already begun. Both Fleming and the dean of the Office of Student Financial Services, Patricia McWade, expressed some concern over the Republican Party’s budget plans for the next year.
Fleming pointed to the plan, proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), that targets Pell Grant funding, citing a report saying that increases in Pell Grant funding lead “almost dollar for dollar” to increases in tuition.
Both Fleming and McWade said this is categorically untrue for Georgetown.
“For Georgetown that’s just a bogus argument,” McWade said.
“We spend at least eight institutional dollars for each federal grant dollar,” Fleming added.
Though Fleming acknowledged that the United States faces a serious budget problem, he remained firm in his support for the Pell Grant program.
“At this date, that would be a huge mistake in my view, budgetarily a mistake,” he said, adding that investments in higher education lead to a fiscally stronger country and that cutting aid would hurt the country financially in the future.
McWade said that institutional grant money would have made up any differences for current students if Pell Grant funding had been reduced as initially proposed by Congress. She added that potential future cuts to Pell Grants are not likely to hurt Georgetown’s competitiveness against peer institutions in attracting a socioeconomically diverse applicant group.
The lion’s share of aid included in the packages of students with high financial need comes from institutional dollars. Twenty-three percent of scholarships are funded by specific endowments, and gifts with many more millions in funding come from the university’s general endowment. For the 2009-2010 school year, $70 million out of $96 million in total aid was provided by Georgetown. The remaining $26 million came from federal aid and external awards.
“Quite frankly, the federal government is the small player here … but at the end of the day, we don’t want the bottom cut out from under us,” Fleming told The Hoya in a February interview during the height of the budget battles.
Despite concerns, both Fleming and McWade were hopeful about the future of the Pell program.
“I’m optimistic because I think that supporting higher education is a priority for both [political] parties,” McWade said. “I hope when it’s all over, they choose something other than education to cut.”
