Recently released 2010 census data show that the population of individuals of black or African-American descent in D.C. has dropped 11 percent since the year 2000, representing a major change in the District’s status as a predominantly black city.
 
About 51 percent of D.C. residents are black or African-American, compared to 70 percent in the 1970’s, according to data publicized by the U.S. Census Bureau Thursday.
 
The  District’s population also increased by nearly 30,000 residents since 2000. Associate professor of history Maurice Jackson said that the nation’s capital is going through changes as a result of the rise in population, specifically saying that whites are moving into traditionally black neighborhoods.
 
“Ten years ago you could get on the 16th Street bus, and from here to 16th Street the bus would be lily white. When you get to the other side the bus would be ‘coal black.’ Now it’s not the same because the white population has moved all over the place, where people would not have moved 10 years ago,” Jackson said.
 
The number of African-American and black residents has been decreasing since the 1970s, and Jackson said that people are leaving because they have to, rather than because they want to.
 
“It is quite simple: housing, jobs, education, health care,” he said.
These necessities are often easier for white families to acquire than for black ones, he said. According to Jackson, the average family income for whites in D.C. is $101,000 per year, while the average black family in the District makes only $39,000 annually.
 
“The number one concern the rich and poor have alike is education and the welfare of their children. Many people in D.C. are moving out for free education in the suburbs,” Jackson said. “It all goes back to economics.”
 
Jackson said there are also other causes for the changing demographics such as the longer average life span of the white population in comparison to that of blacks, as well as the range of jobs available to each group and the training involved in obtaining those jobs.
 
“In service-industry jobs (nursing, pharmaceuticals) few African-Americans have the training for them,” Jackson said.
 
Associate professor of public policy Mark Rom predicted that there will be an even smaller percentage of black and African American residents in D.C. by the next census.
 
“This trend has been occurring for a while now, the outflow of blacks often moving for reasons of safety or more space, cheaper housing in the suburbs. This outflow of blacks and inflow of whites is probably going to continue.”
 
Rom also predicted changes in public policy stemming from demographic change.
 
“When you have one demographic of the African-Americans declining and whites growing, Latinos growing and Asians growing, that shifts some of the political balance of power to those groups. We may see a more diversity of candidates [in local elections]. Candidates who will be successful in the district will need to be able to appeal across racial lines,” Rom said.
The original version of this story stated that Jackson said ” …  from here to 16th Street the bus would be literally white.” He said “…  from here to 16th Street the bus would be lily white.”

The re-emergence of an on-campus pub in Healy Hall, not seen since the late 1980s, proves a popular — topic of conversation among students.

Democratic rising star Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) spoke with about 80 students in Riggs Library on Monday night.
McCaskill, who is widely regarded by some political pundits to have presidential potential, addressed the crowd in an hour-long session, fielding audience questions for most of the visit. The event was co-hosted by the College Democrats, who made up much of the audience, and the Office of Foreign Relations.
McCaskill took classes at Georgetown in the summer of 1974 while interning on Capitol Hill. Today she is known as one of the most media-savvy members of Congress. McCaskill is said to be only senator who directly controls her Twitter page, boasting over 50,000 followers on the website.
Mark Stern (COL ’13), events director for the College Democrats, said McCaskill’s youth appeal was attractive to the group when they pursued her as a guest.
“Senator McCaskill is one of the most youth-friendly members in the chamber,” Stern said. “We felt that as young democrats we had a good chance of getting her, and sure enough as soon as we contacted her office they were really enthusiastic about getting her out here tonight.”
Speaking just a few hours after President Obama outlined his policy on Libya, McCaskill said she is “very nervous” about the conflict.
“My hope is that the length of involvement is very short, and the scope of involvement is very limited because we don’t know what is around the corner in that part of the world.”
In the wide-ranging discussion with students, McCaskill also expressed concern over an increased partisan gridlock in Congress, budget cuts and immigration issues.
The first-term senator made headlines recently after it was alleged that she had used $76,000 in taxpayer money to pay for a private plane owned by her family. On March 21, more allegations claimed that McCaskill had failed to pay over $287,000 in property taxes on the plane.
Last week, the Cook Political Report moved her re-election prospects from “lean Democrat” to “toss up.” Although McCaskill alluded to her tough bid for re-election during her speech, the tax issue was not discussed.

Medical responders treated 50 percent more alcohol-related incidents per student at Georgetown than at nearby The George Washington University last semester.
When adjusted for the relative sizes of the undergraduate student bodies, Georgetown saw a rate of 1.53 calls per 100 students involving alcohol. GWU sported a lower rate of 1.02 calls per 100 students. The numbers do not necessarily indicate a higher drinking rate at Georgetown, however, since the two schools have different alcohol tolerance policies.
“If you are ‘EMeRGed’ twice, you get kicked out of the school. [This policy] discourages kids from calling,” said Sara Emamian, a sophomore at The George Washington University.
The Georgetown University Emergency Medical Service has worked with the Department of Public Safety and the Office of Student Conduct to ensure that there are no repercussions for students who need medical assistance, despite the lack of a formal policy.
“Our experience has been that students are willing to call GERMS to have a friend evaluated when they are in doubt,” said Colin Brody (COL ’11), president of GERMS.
According to GERMS, the number of alcohol-related calls last semester was consistent with numbers from the year before. The percentage of all calls related to alcohol has remained constant annually, as The Hoya reported in January.
At GWU, it has been a different story. While the university policy still discourages students from calling, changes are being made to create a safer space for students. In the 2009-2010 academic year, calls spiked by 14 percent, from 238 to 271. According to The Hatchet, administrators attribute the rising number of calls to the university promoting alcohol education and touting their reformed alcohol amnesty policy.
Amnesty is meant to protect students who dial for medical help for another student from being prosecuted for underage drinking under the code of student conduct.
“I hope that students are feeling more comfortable about calling for help when needed and are less worried about getting in trouble,” Tara Pereira, assistant dean of students and head of Student Judicial Services at GWU, said in an interview with The Hatchet.
According to GERMS of the 114 calls the service responded to last semester, 77 patients were transported to a hospital. At GWU, the Emergency Medical Response Group, a GERMS-equivalent, saw 110 calls but transported all patients to the hospital as per their policy, according to The Hatchet. EMeRG does not allow patients to refuse treatment.
“When alcohol is involved, we must balance the desires of the patient with the responsibility to ensure that the patient receives the best care possible. Sometimes, that means consulting with physicians in the Emergency Department and allowing the student to refuse transport,” Brody said.
“On the other hand, in some cases, it is a violation of our clinical operations protocols and a danger to the patient to not bring him or her to the ED for evaluation and more advanced care,” he added.
The original headline of this story stated that Georgetown’s alcohol-related calls were double those at GWU. They are 50 percent higher.

In his first State of the District Address, Mayor Vincent Gray spoke of progress in the District, while calling upon its citizens to work together to inhabit a more livable and prosperous “global capital.”
The address was held in the theater of Eastern Senior High School in northeast D.C., which Gray touted as an example of the “stunning transformation” that he said was underway in the D.C. public school system.
Quality education was a main focus of Gray’s speech, along with goals such as fiscal stability, community safety, economic opportunity and self-determination.
Gray boasted of D.C.’s successes in the past year, including an increase in school enrollment for the first time in 41 years, the opening of an on-demand treatment site for those diagnosed with HIV — the first of its kind in the U.S. — and the recent recognition as the fastest-growing retail market in the country.
Yet he acknowledged that these limited successes have not been enjoyed by the whole city and that acute challenges remain.
“We must consider a painfully obvious fact: The city that wins these accolades isn’t the same one that many of you wake up to each day. The truth is that the growth in our city has been a miracle for some — and a mirage for others,” he told the audience.
He cited the heightened number of citizens living below the poverty line, high unemployment rates, low high school graduation rates and D.C.’s status as the U.S. city most infected by HIV/AIDS as evidence of the divide in progress.
“I do believe that too many of us have operated under the false assumption that a rising tide therefore would lift all boats,” he said.
Gray attributed the disparity between rapid economic growth and high unemployment rates to a skills mismatch. He promised to expand workforce development and job training and stressed the need to train construction workers in anticipation of an “upswing” in the revival of the real estate market in D.C. He also said that expanded vocational education institutes such as the University of the District of Columbia are gearing to train graduates to work in the city’s fastest-growing sectors: technology, hospitality and health care.
Gray said that expanded vocational education is an important step toward eliminating the “culture of dependency” that has been cultivated in parts of the city.
“Public assistance should be a hand-up, not a permanent handout,” he said. “I’ve learned that when people are able to make their own way, when they become responsible for their own uplift, they become better providers, better parents and better people. That is why we cannot tolerate double digit unemployment.”
Gray pledged to prepare the District for this by increasing effective community policing, facilitating the reentry and reintegration of former prisoners into society and working closely with Homeland Security.
“We no longer can take our collective safety for granted,” he said “We must and will be prepared.”
Though Gray warned of steep budget cuts of up to $325 million in the coming year, he assured the audience that D.C.’s financial situation is less dire than that of most cities.
“Fortunately, we are better off than most. The District’s rebounding commercial real estate market and higher projected tax revenues mean that our cuts will be less severe than we had initially anticipated,” he said.
Still, he promised to trim government spending by improving the coordination of construction projects, consolidating capital of projects into a new department and implementing creative cost-saving measures.
Gray reminded the audience that citizenship is a “two-way street” and urged citizens to reach out to their government and become involved in the community.

March 29, 2011 by Alternative Spring Break Planning Committee Leave a Comment 
To the Editor:
 
During this past spring break, 211 students and staff from across campus had the opportunity to live in and learn from communities throughout the U.S. Whether hanging drywall, engaging labor leaders and day laborers or watching a Mardi Gras parade, we were privileged to reflect on our experiences and see how they interact with our lives at Georgetown.
Many participants will find ways for their spring break immersion to affect greater change in our own community. Yet before we can make that impact, the Alternative Spring Break program must express our gratitude towards so many who have made these trips a reality.
The Center for Social Justice Advisory Board for Student Organizations is the rock on which the entire program is built. ABSO encourages student leaders to create innovative experiences within a framework of immersion, solidarity, service and reflection. Our adviser, Morgan McDaniel (SFS ’13) spent hours answering questions and supporting the planning committee and trip leaders.
Partnerships with Campus Ministry and the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor have allowed the Center for Social Justice to offer transformative trips with the Kino Border Immersion Experience in Arizona, and Worker Justice DC. Their expertise and shared mission show us avenues for still greater growth in our program.
The Corp and the Georgetown University Student Association Fund gave generously to make sure our experience was an option for any Georgetown student — multiplying by many times our capacity to offer participants scholarships towards their trip fee.  Their support built on donations from young alums, who had already contributed so much through past work as students, and whose vision and continued commitment inspire us.
Finally, to the anonymous person who paid for one student’s entire trip fee — thank you. Giving without counting the cost is a Jesuit maxim we sometimes overlook; your example humbles us.

Georgetown’s first on-campus farmer’s market will launch on April 27, offering fresh fruit, flowers and cooking displays in Healy circle for the organically inclined crowd. The pilot market, the project of the ReImagine Georgetown grant won by Bre Donald (NHS ’12) and Melissa Gadsden (NHS ’12),will gather about six local vendors from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.
The displays will feature cooking demonstrations, sampling of organic produce and opportunities to interact with the local community.
Donald and Gadsden hope the event will be a success and will lead to the market’s becoming a more permanent fixture on campus.
“This is something that we really wanted to do,” Donald said. “It was difficult at first because there were a lot of administrators that we needed to talk to, but we received a lot of support.”
They first thought of a university farmers’ market while working on a project for their Health Promotion class. Under the guidance of Joan Riley, an assistant professor in the Departments of Human Science and Nursing in the School of Nursing and Health Studies, and Katy Anderson, who had started a similar project at Princeton, the students decided to work on bringing a farmer’s market to the Hilltop.
“Bre and Melissa are wonderfully energetic, creative and determined students. They implemented their class project to make the Farmers’ Market a reality, increasing GU students’ access to locally produced, healthy foods,” Riley said. “Their work improves the quality of life on our campus.”
In addition to improving access to fresh, locally grown foods and educating others about healthy eating, Donald and Gadsden hope that the market will strengthen the relationship between Georgetown and the surrounding community.
Georgetown’s farmers’ market plans to collaborate with the Glover Park — Burleith Farmers’ Market. Lauren Biel, the director of that market, is optimistic about working together.
“Our market has had difficulty in reaching out to Georgetown students and letting people know that it’s there. I’m really hoping that we can help inform each other’s markets,” she said. “It’s a perfect opportunity to build bridges.”
So far, Gadsden and Donald have received additional funding from the Georgetown University Student Association, along with the support of The Corp, EcoAction, the Georgetown Gastronomes — a student group dedicated to culinary appreciation — and other student groups.
In order to promote the market, the pair also collaborated with the university’s Off Campus Student Life, the Office of Sustainability, the Office of Communications, the Office of Risk Management, the Office of the Vice President, the Department of Public Safety and others outside of the university community, such as Nic Jammet, one of the founders of SweetGreen.

Although reproductive rights are not typical fodder for lunch conversation, H*yas for Choice hopes to bring these talks to the forefront this week with a series of gatherings aimed at raising awareness of the issue.
“Choice Week,” sponsored by the pro-abortion rights group, will include a panel discussion on religion and abortion, as well as a condom giveaway at a table in Red Square. On Monday, the group sponsored a program encouraging students to write thank you cards to abortion providers.
“We’re hoping to make choice issues and reproductive health issues something that students feel comfortable talking about,” said Morgan McDaniel (SFS ’13), vice president of H*yas for Choice. “We’re really just trying to let pro-choice students know that there is a place where they can discuss their ideas and that their ideas are valid.”
Not all students agree with the message H*yas for Choice presents.
“Right to Life evidently disagrees with the fundamental abortion issue which H*yas for Choice advocates,” Mary Grace Reich (SFS ’13), the group’s secretary, said in an email. “However, we recognize the value of having an open dialogue about the disagreement. The best way for us to strengthen the effectiveness of our argument in reaching our opposition is to understand and address their concerns.”
Life Week, an annual event held by the group, will take place April 10-16.
On Monday morning, H*yas for Choice’s, thank you card program began in Red Square, and the group will give out condoms starting Thursday morning. Programs like the group’s thank you card event are important, McDaniel explained, because abortion providers often face threats to their personal safety.
“We believe it’s a really important service they’re offering, and it’s a really thankless task, especially considering that so many abortion providers face violence and risk their lives,” she said.
H*yas for Choice will also hold a panel discussion Wednesday on the role of religion in the pro-abortions rights movement. The event will include speakers from the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, a collection of pro-abortion rights religious groups from across the United States.
Throughout its history, H*yas for Choice has often maintained a rocky relationship with the Georgetown administration, primarily because its views supportive of abortion rights conflict with church doctrine. The university has denied funding for the group since 1992 on the grounds that the organization’s advocacy violates Catholic teaching.

A revised Liberal Arts Seminar will return for incoming freshmen this fall after leaders of the program put it on hiatus for a year to revise the curriculum.
LAS in its past format was a year-long, multidisciplinary 18-credit course devoted to a comprehensive study of the 19th century and offered by the Georgetown College from 1968 until its year off starting in fall 2010.
Fr. William McFadden, S.J., a longstanding professor for the seminar who served on the restructuring committee, said that one longtime professor’s retirement and another’s sabbatical allowed for consideration of changes and improvements to the program this year.
Different departments were asked this year to submit proposals in a competitive process to teach the new Liberal Arts Seminar. The chosen plan focuses on developments in Europe from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment periods.
History professor Tommaso Astarita, one of the four professors who will teach the new seminar, said that the mechanics of the program have not changed much.
Although it will now count for six credits per semester rather than nine, LAS will continue to be taught by four professors to a group of 30 students over two semesters while fulfilling the general education requirement for history and humanities and writing.
Astarita also said the focal time period would shift away from the traditional 19th century spotlight.
“The focus for the four of us teaching it next year will be European culture …with special focus on Europe’s encounter with the New World, on the struggles of faith and science, and on the links between literature, society, music and the arts,” he wrote in an email.
Bryan McCann, a history professor, and Anthony DelDonna, a professor in the music department, will teach the group of students in the fall and focus on the impact of the New World on European culture and mindset.
Astarita and English professor Patrick O’Malley, who was a faculty member of the previous LAS, will teach during the spring semester and focus on the broader historical implications of the transition from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment.
McCann said that students who join the course will experience a challenging, worthwhile learning process that will create a cohesive group of students.
“I think the principal selling point is the sense of cohort and shared discovery this will foster. Students will experience an intense year-long bonding process as they work through the intricacies of these texts and debates together,” he wrote in an email.
James Pickens (COL ’12) participated in LAS during his first year at Georgetown. He said after spending three hours a day, three days a week with the same group of students, he formed close friendships with all of the members of the seminar, one of whom is now his roommate.
“My experience with the LAS was it was an amazing educational experience that has formed the background for all of my education at Georgetown,” he said.
Pickens was disappointed, however, to hear that the focus had shifted from the 19th century to the Renaissance to the Reformation,
“I personally would advocate that they return to the 19th century, because while many of the writers of the 19th century reference the past, it’s also the start of many institutions of the modern world. I think that by shifting the focus further into the past you lose the direct connection to so many other courses that I have experienced,” Pickens said.
Incoming first-year students may apply to LAS over the next few months and will be notified of their acceptance in July.

Counterpoint magazine — a publication that tackles political and cultural issues from a progressive standpoint — became Georgetown’s newest student publication Friday.
Eric Pilch (COL ’12), Kara Brandeisky (COL ’12) and Cole Stangler (SFS ’13) said that they designed Counterpoint to challenge readers to seek social transformation. The magazine is funded by a grant from the Center for American Progress.
“We have all had previous experience writing,” Pilch said. “What is different about Counterpoint is that now we are focusing on breaking out of the limits and conditions on time and space.”
The editors said the format of the magazine differs widely from other campus publications and encourages readers to pay attention to the world outside the gates. Counterpoint showcases long-form pieces and includes one feature-length story each issue.
Brandeisky said that the idea for the project began with a longstanding desire for a news source that would publish longer and more in-depth commentary.
But the actual creation of the magazine came quite suddenly.
“The boys called me at 1 a.m. and told me to meet them at the business school,” Brandeisky said. “‘We have an idea,’ they said. I was hooked.”
Brandeisky said the work they have put in so far has been rewarding.
“Counterpoint has given us an opportunity to express thoughts at length, to focus on conceptual development and to improve the quality of our work,” she said.
In their mission statement, the editors write that they hope to provide a forum for new ideas and reforms. Stangler said that the target audience for the magazine is the politically inclined section of the student body.
“Positive change in American history has been brought about by those who are unafraid to challenge the prevailing status quo,” the statement reads.
The editors aim to publish two issues this semester. The first issue is currently available online at counterpointmagazine.org, and editors said they hope the print version will be available soon. A second issue is expected in late April. The editors have also created a blog, which they plan to update on a daily basis.
So far, the staff of the magazine has been limited to the founders and about 12 other members, but the editors said they hoped that they will be able to raise awareness and recruit more members when the first issue appears Friday. The staff will distribute about 700 copies to locations in Healy Hall, the Leavey Center, the Rafik B. Hariri Building, Lauinger Library, and the Intercultural Center.
The publication is also planning a launch event sometime in the next two weeks featuring The Nation’s Washington D.C. Editor Chris Hayes and  Matt Yglesias, a fellow at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.  The planned panel discussion is titled “Advancing the Progressive Vision,” which will include  perspectives on the Obama administration and the new Congress from a diverse group of professional journalists.
“The foundation of almost all our articles has been discussion among the team members,” Brandeisky said. “We plan to stay true to our mission statement, while inviting others to participate in the reflection.”

The Georgetown Program Board announced the Spring Kick-Off Concert lineup on Friday, and while some students are likely to excitedly enter McDonough Arena on April 9, others said they were disappointed that Georgetown did not score a major headliner.
Kevin Rudolf tops the list of performers and will be accompanied by Dev and the Cataracs, Jason Smith, Shwayze and Cisco Adler.
“I kind of remember seeing them on the list, and I kind of remember voting for them last,” Tom Sturma (COL ’14) said. “I didn’t recognize the name, but Dev sounded like a cool [person].”
Rudolf is known for his singles “Let It Rock,” “Welcome to the World,” and “I Made It (Cash Money Heroes),” which peaked at No. 5, No. 58 and No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, respectively. Dev and the Cataracs topped the chart in the fall with their feature in Far East Movement’s “Like a G6.”
“I’m excited for the concert, but I wish a more famous band was playing,” Jen Purks (COL ’14) said.
However, other students said they are thrilled by the upcoming visit of Rudolf and the rest of the performers.
“They’re just a really fun group to listen to,” Eric Bulakites (COL ’13) said. “I think there’ll be a lot of excitement and a lot of dancing. I imagine that most of my friends are going, so I expect that it will super fun.”
Student reactions to the announcements of past concerts have also been varied, although the artists have been generally more well known.
“The past ones you had … big names,” Nitesh Rana (COL ’08, MED ’13) said. “[This year’s artists] are still big names, but not at the same level as in the past.”
Headliners at the Spring Kick-Off in past years have included T-Pain in 2009 and Third Eye Blind in 2010. Both years, rapper Lupe Fiasco beat out the chosen performing artists in the poll put to Georgetown students. He was only contracted, however, for the revival of the fall concert sponsored by the Senior Class Committee, GPB, What’s After Dark and The Corp Philanthropy Committee last semester.
Rana suggested that GPB try to secure more renowned hip-hop and currently chart-topping artists in order to boost student attendance.
“Stuff that is really popular right now would be more interesting,” he said, but he also expressed doubt that the university could afford such artists.
The acts were selected after students were polled on their preferences earlier this semester. The initial candidates were provided by a middle agent and determined based on GPB’s price range and the artists’ availability.
“There’s not a set-in-stone list. [It is] more generating ideas and getting input from the student body,” GPB Concerts Chair Amelia Whitehead (SFS ’14) said.
GPB originally contracted a different headlining artist, who cancelled unexpectedly and whose name cannot be revealed due to contract laws. Much of the event’s lineup remains unchanged, however, and Whitehead was able to quickly secure another performer.
Kat Outlaw (COL ’13) said that Georgetown’s Spring Kick-Off performers were not as strong as those headlining at other universities.
“I feel like, as one of the more prestigious schools, we should have a better Spring Kick-Off,” she said.
Outlaw said that when comparing the spring concert to University of Pennsylvania’s Spring Fling, which will feature Lupe Fiasco, Flo Rida and Ratatat this year and attracts students from schools outside Philadelphia, Georgetown falls short.
Whitehead said that she expected student reactions to be mixed.
“I know a lot of people like to complain about the artists,” she said.
Whitehead remains optimistic for a high turnout, however, citing the success of last spring’s concert.
“I’m happy with the choices we’ve made,” she said.
The concert will be part of Spring Fest, a new campus-wide festival being planned for the same weekend, according to Whitehead.
“We’re trying to constantly revamp what we’re doing with the concert,” she said.
The festival, which will run Thursday through Sunday, will include laser tag, a movie on Copley Lawn, a Battle of the Bands and a carnival.
“We’re working really hard to make this into a really fun weekend for everybody,” Whitehead said.
Whitehead emphasized the importance of student participation in the execution of the festival, and GPB began recruitment on Monday. Outlaw agreed that the festival was a good idea and might have the potential to become a tradition.
“Honestly, last year as a freshman, I completely missed it,” Outlaw said. “It completely passed me by. … It’s not an event people spend all year looking forward to, like Georgetown Day.”

Last semester, a group of students pushed to introduce gender blind housing on campus. While the university does not plan to formally amend its housing policy, officials say that they are working to address concerns through more private means.
A variety of student groups and administrative sources have raised concerns about a lack of alternative housing options for individuals with medical and non-medical needs, especially those of LBGTQ students. They suggest increasing the number of single occupancy rooms and creating upperclassmen housing options for mixed-gender living arrangements.
The university does not plan on making any significant changes to the traditional housing system in the near future, but will, however, continue to work with students on an individual basis.
“We had productive conversations and agreed it’s important that our campus housing system is welcoming to all our students,” Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson wrote in an email. “There is not a plan to add specific gender-neutral housing options at this time, but there is an ongoing interest in assuring that students are aware of the options so that we can provide a safe and welcoming place to live on campus.”
The Georgetown University Student Association’s Senate Student Life Committee drafted the Alternative Housing Options Bill to address the housing concerns of members of the LGBTQ community. In response, the Georgetown administration assured GUSA that the university is making serious efforts to work with students on a case-by-case basis.
According to Josh Mogil (SFS ’11), the GUSA Senator who introduced the bill, the proposal hopes to provide safety and comfort for LGBTQ community members concerned with the current residential living options.
“Every year there are a few students — not all of you know about this — that call the school, before they even get here, who are nervous about housing for X reason, and these are normally LGBTQ students,” Mogil said. “There is very little that just one office can do, so our goal was to bring together a ton of other offices to make everyone aware that maybe there are better things they can do outside the box.”
The administration also called a meeting that included leadership from the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Resource Center, Georgetown University Housing Services, Academic Resource Center, Women’s Center and the Office of Residence Life.
Campus departments are currently making smaller-scale changes and taking greater efforts to make the housing selection process more accommodating.. The LGBTQ Resource Center works continuously to foster greater awareness of housing-related issues and to create more of an outlet for concerned students according to Sivagami Subbaraman, director of the LGBTQ Resource Center.
“What we are trying to do at our level is to work with offices to put the message out that we are open as a [Catholic] university to having these conversations, and that we will work with [students] to do what makes them feel safe,” Subbaraman said.
Both Mogil and Subbaraman hope that the Campus Housing Roommate Selection System will allow incoming students to connect with and chose a roommate regardless of gender, sexual identity or sexual orientation in the future. The new version of the survey would include more questions to test roommate compatibility. The  invitation for students to contact the university if they have any concerns will also be featured prominently.
A second follow-up meeting is also planned for later this semester. Campus administrators acknowledge that while the housing system still has some work to be done, the process has improved.
“Students have to find out or negotiate, but it’s gotten better to a point where now we work with some students, and we help them navigate the system,” Subbaraman said. “They are no longer on their own; before they were.”

Despite a lack of official university funding, the revocation of its SAC charter and leadership crises, the Southern Society will organize several events this semester for Southerners and South-aficionados.
For over 15 years, the club that goes by the motto of “Hoyas by choice, Southerners by the grace of God,” has offered Southern students a means of staying connected to the traditions they left at home. It also aims to give the general Georgetown community the chance to appreciate and learn about Southern history, culture and diversity.
The loss of its senior leadership and a drop in involvement left the group almost inactive last fall. The Southern Society also was cut from the list of Student Activities Commission-sponsored clubs after they failed to present a budget for this academic year. The society had its charter revoked and lost all access to official funding, advertising privileges and the right to use the Georgetown name.
The club is determined to not let its unofficial status prevent it from growing or hosting  events however.
“It has forced us to be self-funded and informal but has also made us more creative in terms of fundraising and recruiting,” society board member Tyler Sax (COL ’13) said.
The club has been busily building a word of mouth campaign through Facebook and email since members are unable to flyer on campus. In addition, the group is selling Southern Society T-shirts to raise money and build buzz on campus.
The society plans to broaden the scope of its activities as well as regain SAC funding.
“In the past, our events were mainly cultural and social, but we’re hoping to expand our focus to networking with Southern alumni associations and recruiting new students by helping to spread interest in Georgetown throughout the Southern states,” explained Mary Willis (COL ’13), a society board member.
The Southern Society is also determined not to neglect its core traditions, including holding crawfish boils and barbecues, gathering to watch SEC football games and attending the Foxfield Races in Charlottesville, N.C., in April.
Members have differing opinions on what attracts people to the society.
“It can sometimes be an ‘I miss home’ reaction,” Willis said. “Personally it would have been a lot tougher staying connected to what I grew up [with] without the people I’ve met.”
“Home state clubs are great to have around campus, especially one as diverse and international as Georgetown,” Abigail Smith (SFS ’13) added. “Being surrounded by so many different backgrounds and cultures and trying so many new things, it’s sometimes easy to forget your roots.”
In addition, members pride themselves on bringing a bit of Southern flavor to a campus that can seem dominated by the Northeast.
“We all know the misconception some people from the North have of southern culture, that it’s all deep fried food and NASCAR,” Smith said. “Southern Society is a fun way to correct the stereotype.”

Budget season is grinding on the nerves and the patience of Americans everywhere. The staggering figures thrown around on cable news programs and reported in newspapers exist in the unintelligible range of billions and trillions of dollars. Reigning in spending and deficit reduction has been in vogue since the November elections. The prognosis for the problem has been neatly presented to the American people in surgical terms: an aggressive treatment of spending cuts and tax adjustments.
 
What the Washingtonian elites and media blowhards neglect to acknowledge are the actual effects the budget has on the diverse communities that make up the nation. A budget as large as the one used by the federal government truly hides the tangible effects it has on its diverse constituencies. As with the deficit, we tend to spill gallons of ink and create a lot of hot air arguing about a budget that is so abstracted from the people and places it represents that it is merely a figment of our imagination.
 
My hometown of Litchfield, N.H., has just recently experienced its own budget crises, similar to those sweeping through all parts of the United States. The crisis facing my town stems from the loss of $2 million in state funding due to tough decisions and the reworking of funding formulas. While this does not necessarily compare with the incomprehensible numbers thrown around on Capitol Hill, a $2 million reduction in a $20 million operating budget in fiscal year of 2010 is a 10 percent reduction in expenditures to be used on education.
 
With just around 9,000 residents, the lack of money for education and an already small municipal budget isn’t going to make the front page of The New York Times or The Washington Post. The process of balancing a budget where the effects are immediate and visible, however, presents a far greater crisis than the one painted by the faceless and placeless national media outlets. Local governments and school boards provide the most critical daily services to most Americans nationwide. The people that actually constitute a community like the teachers at my high school or the police officers and firemen who ensure our safety in my town will now be affected by these changes in serious ways.
 
Naturally, tough decisions had to be made. The area to best begin cutting spending in is the area of largest spending. For example, 53 percent of the school operating budget is salaries alone; when combined with benefits, nearly 71 percent of the entire budget is spent on public education. The proposed budget presented to the voters on Tuesday, March 8,  called for approximately 31 staff positions to be eliminated district wide. A small school district that serves just over 1500 students in grades K-12 is a substantial cut.
 
In addition to these staff and benefit cuts, other areas like co-curricular activities, adult education and special education have taken substantial hits. Special education lost nearly $400,000 due to the cost of extra staff members incurred. Likewise, with unemployment at 5.8 percent, the complete elimination of night courses for adults will hurt the prospects of many trying to find jobs and restart careers. Even with spending reduction, the city had to propose a 5.08 percent tax increase to help make up the cash shortfall.
 
I don’t mean to bemoan or criticize the areas where cuts are being made. Every job eliminated and every program slashed was required to balance the budget, something that local government, unlike their larger counterparts, must do.
 
My qualm is that major media outlets and nationally elected officials neglect to cover the real effects of this round of budgeting in the content of their debates. The abstract ideas of a national budget and a growing deficit are argued about by pundits who are connected with no place or interest and criticize officials so far removed from the people and places they are bound to. The realistic costs that should be debated are the livelihoods of teachers that receive pink slips and are sent packing.
 
National uproar is focused on nebulous ideas devoid of direct connection with any people or places; mere concepts such as collective bargaining, the deficit, the national debt and other common catch words all lack any real connection to the reality on the home front. True democratic self-governance exists where people make conscious decisions and can see the tangible impact upon everyday life. The emphasis too often ignores and obscures the real impact democratic decisions have on people.
