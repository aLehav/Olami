Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vice President Vail Kohnert-Yount(SFS ’13) were inaugurated Saturday, ushering in a new staff and a new set of initiatives.
The pair chose to maintain a similar cabinet structure to that of their predecessors but altered some staff positions to better reflect the unique goals of their campaign platform. The roles of director of strategic development and director of career services were replaced with directors of social justice, academic affairs and special initiatives. The GUSA senate approved the staff and cabinet structure unanimously Sunday.
According to Gustafson, these new positions align with specific projects she and Kohnert-Yount included in their platform, such as the creation of an academic research symposium and the implementation of a permanent director for the Center for Social Justice.
Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount also appointed directors to continue many of former President MikeMeaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President Greg Laverriere’s (COL ’12) initiatives.
GUSA senator Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), chair of the Finance and Appropriations Committee, will resign from his senate seat to serve as director of student activities fee and endowment implementation.
Jake Sticka (COL ’13) was appointed chief of staff, and Senator Yupang Chang (MSB ’15) will serve as director of special initiatives. The finalization of the executive cabinet and staff leaves five senate seat vacancies. Other cabinet positions will be announced this week.
Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), chair of the Student Activities Commission, will serve as director of Student Life Report implementation.
According to Appelbaum, fulfilling every recommendation by the end of his term is not a realistic goal. Instead, he believes that smaller recommendations can be implemented quickly and that publication of the report is as important as its execution.
“It’s about implementing the recommendations but also creating a larger conversation on campus about the importance of student engagement,” he said.
Appelbaum plans to first prioritize the recommendations listed in the report and then delegate them to members of the executive cabinet. He emphasized centralizing the space reservation system and increasing student access to the administration as important goals.
Hiring a permanent CSJ director, a process which has stalled over the last two years, was a central focus of Gustafson and Kohnert-Yount’s campaign. One complication that GUSA faces in its pursuit of that goal, however, is that the CSJ director reports to the provost, and the search to replace current Provost James O’Donnell, who is leaving at the end of the semester, is ongoing.
At the inauguration ceremony, Gustafson expressed her excitement about her term.
“Vail and I have an incredible opportunity to really make a meaningful change here at Georgetown and hope that we will serve all of you well in the next year,” she said.

Some student employees have not been paid this semester due to problems with the university’s transition to the Georgetown Management System, a new employee organization portal.
Students who work two on-campus jobs or who receive work-study payments have particularly noticed glitches in the new system. Although GMS, which was implemented over winter break, is intended to be more user-friendly, students’ paychecks have been taking a hard hit.
“It is an upgraded system. Anytime you transfer that much data there are certainly going to be kinks,” university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said. “The important thing to note is as soon as university officials were made aware of the problems, we … devoted [a] significant amount of resources to making sure the students’ problems are corrected.”
Kirsten Harris (SFS ’14), who works for the Residence Hall Office and for the Office of Campus Activities and Facilities, has been receiving her paychecks but in inconsistent amounts.
“The problem is that the system is flawed. I’m getting paid, but things are really messed up,” Harris said. “They can’t figure out where the hours are coming from.”
Harris noted that one of her co-workers was only receiving 12 cents an hour earlier this semester.
According to Kerr, the Department of Human Resources has increased the training for personnel responsible for related data to address problems for those working multiple jobs and receiving work-study payments. Some students who were hired at the beginning of the semester have also reported problems with the system.
“As soon as the administration became aware of these issues, we immediately augmented the resources, sent out information directly to the students with directions to go to the Student Employment Office and get some of these cases resolved,” Kerr said.
However, several students have yet to receive compensation for any hours worked this semester or only recently received payment.
Julie Negussie (COL ’14), who works both as a student guard and for the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, said the lack of centralized communication between her two departments was the most frustrating.
“Each of the departments I worked at would send over the payroll sheets, and I could never actually get to both offices. They left it all to me as the middle man,” she said. “I kept being told that it was an issue that no one understood.”

Former Chief of Staff to the McDonough School of Business Dean Jeffrey Franke has been appointed the school’s first associate dean for external affairs, a new role that will focus on engagement and the school’s development.
Franke, who joined the university in 2006, will now also serve as special advisor to the dean.
In his new role, Franke will manage the MSB’s alumni, corporate and community relations, Board of Advisors and Parents Advisory Council. He will also serve as the school’s liaison with the Office of Advancement and oversee certain school-wide projects.
“Our goal is to make all of our external partners — alumni, corporate, and community — feel engaged with the school and to steward that engagement efficiently and effectively,” Franke said in a statement released by the MSB Monday. “A key priority of the school is to build a community of philanthropic support, not only to raise funds for our capital campaign, but to actively involve external constituents in the life of the school through service.”
Franke has previously worked in the private, non-profit and government sectors. Before coming to Georgetown, he served as chief of staff at Investors’ Education Foundation, an organization that promotes financial literacy, and, before that, an officer with the Pew Charitable Trusts, a non-profit dedicated to improving public policy and civil society.

Students struggling under heavy student loan debt may be able to apply for loan forgiveness within 10 years of graduation, thanks to a new piece of legislation drafted by Rep. Hansen Clarke (D-Mich., LAW ’87).
The Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012, which was proposed March 8, would create a 10/10 loan repayment plan; graduates could have their loans forgiven in 10 years if they pay 10 percent of their discretionary income each year. Graduates already repaying loans would likely be able to have their loans forgiven in less than that time.
The law would also create incentives for graduates to enter public service professions such as teaching and firefighting, and medical professionals would be rewarded for working in underserved communities. In these cases, debt would be forgiven in five years instead of the usual 10.
Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations, lauded the proposed legislation.
“Anything to reduce students’ debt obligations is very desirable,” he said.
Countrywide, student loan debt currently exceeds credit card debt and is expected to reach $1 trillion by the end of 2012.
If the bill passes, Fleming said the proposed bill would have a relatively small effect on Georgetown students because of the generosity of the university’s financial aid packages. Georgetown students also have a strong track record in paying off debts, with a default rate of about 0.8 percent in 2009, the most recent year for which data is available.
“Our financial aid office has a policy of trying to hold student loan debt to about $17,000 by packaging in grant aid and work study,” Fleming said. “Georgetown has a very low student loan default rate … which means our students end up doing well and are able to pay off their loans.”
However, according to Fleming, the act would be helpful to students facing heavy debt loads and seeking jobs in lower salary industries, such as those in public service.
“Incentives that do result in loans being forgiven are obviously helpful to our students who graduate with student loan debt,” Fleming said. “We have a lot of students who do want to do public service work. For those, loan forgiveness is a particularly important option.”
However, Fleming emphasized that the most important objective of the act is creating a long-term plan to keep student loan interest rates low. Interest rates on student loans are currently at 3.4 percent, but when the College Cost Reduction and Access Act expires July 1, rates are set to rise to 6.8 percent.
“Congress tends to deal with things at the 11th hour. When it comes to this provision the 11th hour is fast upon us,” Fleming said.
Fleming also warned of potential difficulties with such legislation.
“There is a cost associated with keeping the interest rate down,” he said. “That would also have to be tackled.”
Fleming added that Clarke’s proposal reflects his commitment to helping those in need.
“Last Friday, Clarke joined a group of Georgetown students who did an Alternative Spring Break in Detroit working with them at a soup kitchen,” he said. “It is clear that Clarke is serious about doing everything he can about helping needy people in our society, and I think that is reflected in his legislative proposal.”
