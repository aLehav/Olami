Students can now register to vote in federal, state and local elections, request an absentee ballot and find other election-related material through a voter portal on MyAccess, according to a Nov. 4 announcement by GU Votes. 
GU Votes, a student-run group that works to promote voting at the university, collaborated with the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, the Office of Federal Relations and the university registrar to implement the online portal ahead of the 2020 presidential election and local fall 2019 elections. Though the service was announced Nov. 4, the portal officially went live Oct. 29.
The integration of the portal into MyAccess provides a convenient way for students to engage in their civic duty, according to Andrew Straky (COL ’20), co-president of GU Votes.
“Now, registering to vote or requesting an absentee ballot can be just as easy as updating your telephone number or registering for classes,” Straky said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Since January 2018, GU Votes has worked closely with the Andrew Goodman Foundation, a national group that aims to increase student voting across the country, to make the initiative possible at Georgetown, according to GU Votes.
The foundation was responsible for developing the new online platform, which includes multiple resources to increase students’ participation in the electoral process, according to Karena Cronin, program director at the Andrew Goodman Foundation. 
The portal gives students access to information on election deadlines, candidate platforms and how to navigate the absentee voting process, according to Cronin.
“We are thrilled to see Georgetown University embrace this resource as a way to increase access to voting for their students,” Cronin said in a GU Votes news release. 
Among eligible Georgetown students, overall voter participation in midterm elections increased from 20.1% in 2014 to 49.0% in 2018, according to GU Votes. The overall national average voting rate among college students increased from 19.7% in 2014 to 39.1% in 2018, according to a 2018 report by the Institute for Democracy & Higher Education at Tufts University.
Launching the online platform to increase civic engagement among college students is an important step to ensuring greater participation in the democratic process, according to Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), executive director of GU Politics.
“Part of the GU Politics mission is to encourage every student to participate in building the democracy they want to see,” Elleithee said in the news release. “We are really proud of our students for working with a wide range of stakeholders at Georgetown to help their classmates have a voice in the decisions of their nation and support our fragile democracy.”
The timing of the MyAccess initiative is valuable because students at Georgetown planning to vote in the 2020 election primaries come from a wider diversity of states than students at other schools do, Straky said. 
“The unique thing about Georgetown versus, say, the University of Michigan — where they’re worried about a one-state voting system, we worry about 50,” Straky said. “We have students from all across the country, and most often students choose to vote from their home state if they’re eligible to do so, so we have to facilitate that.”
GU Votes is also working to make the absentee ballot request process easier for students, according to the announcement. The organization already runs a Voter Dropbox Program, which provides prestamped envelopes and secure dropboxes with nightly mail service.
GU Votes focused on creating a streamlined process for students to have access to various voting resources in creating the portal, according to Straky.
“Students are worried about finding their classes; they just got to college — they don’t want to be thinking about that,” Straky said. “By integrating it directly into MyAccess, it makes it that much easier for students to have access to these voting tools.”
Hayley Grande (COL ’21), president of Georgetown University College Republicans, expressed support for the ease of use the voter portal provides to students.
“The new voter portal in MyAccess is a fantastic way to help increase accessibility to voting materials while away at school to make sure that students have a voice in the upcoming 2020 election,” Grande wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21), chair of Georgetown University College Democrats, hopes the new system can be incorporated into future GUCD meetings and increase participation among members.
“I’m going to encourage the next GUCD board to do a tutorial and exploration of the new system, and as always, we want to make sure all of our members are registered to vote,” Hollister wrote in an email to The Hoya. “GU Votes has made it easier for students to do so, and we are very excited and grateful at the success of their project.”

Michelle Xue (MSB ’19), 22, died from injuries sustained in a rock falling accident while rock climbing on Red Slate Mountain in Mono County, Calif., on Oct. 29. 
Xue, who was originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, graduated this year from the McDonough School of Business with a major in operations information management and a minor in economics. She began her career as an acquisitions analyst with RealTerm in Los Angeles this September.
Xue was a member of the Global Business Fellows and served on the board of the Georgetown University Public Real Estate Fund. Xue was also safety captain for the club rock climbing team, according to a university statement.
She was a skilled athlete and a warm presence on the club rock climbing team, according to the team’s treasurer Ben Falley (COL ’21). 
“Michelle was an accomplished climber and good friend to many of us on the team,” Falley wrote in an email to The Hoya. “She always brought dedication and a sense of adventure to the sport which was both admirable and an inspiration. She will be dearly missed.”
MSB professor Dennis Quinn taught Xue in a business-government class during her sophomore year. Xue had a strong sense of courage, humor and compassion for everyone around her, according to Quinn. 
“She actually sort of warmed up a room,” Quinn said in an interview with The Hoya. “She warmed up the people around her. She brought a lot of laughter and spontaneity. She had a rare skill — academically very gifted, very courageous, but very sensitive to the feelings and expectations of others.”
Xue was also closely connected with the Georgetown’s Buddhist community and served as co-president of the Georgetown Buddhist Student Association in her time on campus. The group hosted a Buddhist memorial service for Xue on Nov. 4.
Her uplifting attitude will be sincerely missed by members of the Buddhist community, according to a BuSA Facebook statement. 
“Michelle was an incredible person, and her passion, work ethic, and unbridled enthusiasm towards the Buddhist community at Georgetown will be deeply missed,” the statement said. “During her time on campus, Michelle took it upon herself to deeply engage with Georgetown’s Buddhists, and her actions left a positive impact on everyone she encountered.”
Xue’s dedication to faith moved others to examine their own spirituality, according to Director of Dharmic Life and Xue’s former “Problem of God” professor Brahmachari Sharan. 
“In one of the initial meetings we had, she spoke about the beauty of the outdoors, and the feeling of true freedom, saying that the meditation she practiced and the liberation of immersing herself in nature were, for her, one and the same,” Sharan said in a statement from the university. “It was her commitment to the Buddhist community, even though she considered herself very new to the depth of the teachings, that inspired so many of her peers to give their own spiritual journeys a little more thought.”
Members of Xue’s family launched a GoFundMe on Nov. 3 to collect donations for the Mono County Sheriff Search and Rescue team, which found and recovered Xue and her climbing partner, Jennifer Shedden, who also died from the rock slide accident. The fundraiser surpassed its $10,000 goal in just two days.
“We are forever thankful for their brave service and believe this is how Michelle would have liked us to remember her adventures,” the fundraising page said. 
Xue was an avid traveler and climber who was enthusiastic about the outdoors. Her pursuit of these passions inspired many, including Daniel Minot, her MSB advising dean.
“She is and was the type of student who inspires me to do what I do each and every day,” Minot wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I was always struck by her passion for exploration, her spontaneity, and her unyielding optimism. There was no challenge too difficult and no obstacle too great – Michelle persevered through everything with a smile and a love for life that was unmatched by her peers.”
This article has been updated to clarify the nature of the rock climbing accident.

She was climbing technical alpine ice, not rock climbing.

Including leaders from diverse backgrounds is critical to reestablishing the Catholic Church’s credibility as it works to address the clergy sexual abuse crisis, panelists said at a Nov. 4 event.
The panel included Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean survivor of clergy sexual abuse who challenged Pope Francis to take decisive action on the crisis; Bishop Steven Biegler, the bishop of Cheyenne, Wyo., who reopened an investigation into one of his predecessors for child sexual abuse; Christopher White, a journalist who reports on the crisis; and Patricia McGuire, president of Trinity Washington University, who is vocal about the lasting costs of the crisis. 
The Gaston Hall event, “Where Are We Now? Where Do We Need To Go?”, was moderated by John Carr, director of Georgetown University’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, and Kim Daniels, associate director of the initiative and an adviser to the Vatican.
At the event, Daniels shared the results of the report from the June 2019 “National Convening on Lay Leadership for a Wounded Church and Divided Nation,” which gathered over 50 invited Catholic leaders, survivors, journalists and others. The National Convening was organized by the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life and focused on strategizing responses to the clergy sexual abuse crisis. 
Daniels shared the report’s 10 essential directions for reform and renewal in the wake of the twin crises in the Church: sexual abuse by Catholic clergy and coverups of this abuse by church leaders. The directions’s recommendations include pursuing a survivor-centric response, holding leaders accountable, insisting on transparency and promoting diversity within the Church.
“You’ve heard of the Ten Commandments; well, now we have the ten directions,” Carr said. “If you’re looking for the road ahead, this can provide a path.”
The panel criticized clericalism, the expectation that Catholics be obedient to the clergy hierarchy that fosters a sense of entitlement and superiority among clergy members, according to Daniels. 
McGuire described the isolating effect of clericalism and recounted conversations with Catholic primary school principals about the sexual abuse crisis. These principals overseeing schools deeply impacted by the sexual abuse crisis did not receive direct contact from the Church, McGuire said. 
“Nobody, throughout this whole scandal, nobody in an official capacity in the church ever reached out to them,” McGuire said. “Every letter that came out from the cardinal was addressed to ‘Dear brother priests.’”
McGuire spoke about her mother, a devout Catholic, who spent the final years of her life concerned that her children, raised as active Catholics, may have been survivors of abuse. McGuire assured her mother that they were not, but her mother’s fear was emblematic of the way the scandal has harmed the relationship between lay people and clergy. 
“She was the quintessential woman who was the pillar of the church,” McGuire said. “The betrayal of trust of the faithful in the center is the worst collateral damage of the scandal because that is the support for the church.”
A problematic separation exists between Catholic men and women, who were largely educated in single-sex institutions, that makes it difficult to foster understanding among diverse groups in the church. Clericalism leads clergy leaders to focus solely on how to solve the crisis within the church, without being inclusive of Catholic women and others impacted by the crisis, according to McGuire. 
“This is the problem of clericalism, and it’s the place where the dialogue has completely broken down,” McGuire said. “How can the bishops lead and talk to each other and not talk to the rest of us?”
The panelists acknowledged the specific steps forward that the Church has taken in reckoning with the crisis, especially vos estis lux mundi, an addition to church law implemented by Pope Francis in May 2019. Vos estis created new procedural rules to prevent and respond to sexual abuse, including protecting whistleblowers, expanding assistance to the families of survivors and increasing the role of non-clergy members in investigations, according to Catholic News Agency. 
While vos estis provides a framework for keeping clergy members accountable, making the formal changes a reality is still a serious challenge, according to White.
“The challenge, of course, comes with implementation,” White said. 
While the United States is making progress on accountability, the Catholic Church is a global institution, and there could be a disparity in the implementation of vos estis, Cruz said. 
“How do we police that? Vos estis — how do we make that happen?” Cruz said. “In the United States, many things are happening and we have advanced, but if you look at the rest of the world, it has not even begun. The tip of the iceberg — we have only seen that.”
The church has begun to identify the ramifications of sexual abuse and the ensuing coverups, according to Biegler. However, the further steps needed to encourage healing with the church must still be taken, Biegler said. 
“We have identified the twin crises. We have a much clearer understanding of the statistics of sexual abuse. The victims are beginning to find their voice. Those are real positives,” Biegler said. “But it’s not just that we need to know the statistics of abuse — we need to see the reality of that sexual abuse with eyes wide open, and let it really pierce our hearts.”

Georgetown College is offering new undergraduate course opportunities in American Sign Language and interdisciplinary studies for the Spring 2020 semester as well as developing a new medical humanities major to possibly launch in coming years. 
Upcoming spring one-credit courses “Living and Dying,” “Medical Non-Fiction and Journalism” and “Medicine and Mystery” will preview the medical humanities major, according to Daniel Marchalik (GRD ’16), director of the literature and medicine track at the Georgetown University Medical Center and collaborator on the new undergraduate major. The interdisciplinary medical humanities major would place medical studies within a historical literature and cultural context.
Marchalik will serve as a professor for the “Medicine and Mystery” course. He completed his surgical residency at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital while obtaining a master’s degree in literature. Combining the disciplines of literature and medicine with the new major would catalyze a dialogue between medical and college students at Georgetown, he said.  
“It is my vision to create more opportunities for this type of interdisciplinary work,” Marchalik wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As such, these courses are designed to have both medical students and college students in the same room, taking the same course work.”
The medical humanities major would use social science and humanities to better comprehend medicine, according to Lakshmi Krishnan, a diagnostician at Johns Hopkins University and an affiliate professor of English in the College.
“Medical humanities is the growing interdisciplinary field which puts medicine back into its social, historical, and cultural context,” Krishnan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It encompasses the humanities and social sciences, and argues that the methods of the humanities and social sciences should be used to understand, critique, and enhance medical practice.” 
Faculty and deans from the Medical Center and the College met consistently to develop new courses, according to Sue Lorenson, vice dean for undergraduate education.
“Medical Humanities is an example of a boundary-crossing initiative,” Lorenson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “How might the study of the humanities, in all of its forms, inform the study of medicine, and vice-versa?”
The university will also offer a new three-credit interdisciplinary course in the Maker Hub titled “Making Matters.” Students who take the class will engage both with their classmates and the Maker Hub tools, according to the Maker Hub manager Don Undeen.
Students have been able to utilize the Maker Hub on the first floor of Lauinger Library to explore personal and academic creative projects since 2016. The space features tools ranging from 3D printers to sewing machines to power drills. 
The layout of the Maker Hub, with tools along the perimeter and a long central table, will be conducive to interdisciplinary work, according to Undeen. 
“It’s about the impact of making culture, and learning about how to use the tools of the space,” Undeen said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’ll be thinking more reflectively about what makerspaces mean in the broader context of global impact.”
New one-credit classes including “History of the Book,” which will examine the evolution of the printing process, and “Digital Research Methods,” designed to introduce students to new research techniques, will also be offered in partnership with Lauinger Library. 
Georgetown has also partnered with with Gallaudet University, a local university in Washington, D.C., for the deaf and hard of hearing, to expand ASL programming. Currently, ASL I and ASL II courses are offered on campus and taught by visiting Gallaudet professors. 
Next semester, Georgetown students can take higher level ASL classes directly at Gallaudet, according to Sylvia Wing Önder, professor in the department of Arabic and Islamic studies and director of small program languages. 
“We wanted to bring the opportunity to more Georgetown students,” Önder wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Students who want to continue to upper levels of ASL are able to go to more classes at Gallaudet through the Consortium arrangement.” 
The past arrangement with Gallaudet has been popular among students, and the expanded programming will give students more chances to improve their ASL skills, according to Lorenson. 
“It’s my sense that this has been a great success; our friends at Gallaudet have been extremely generous with their time (including travel time) and our students have filled the classes,” Lorenson wrote.
This article was updated Nov. 7 to reflect the timeline of the launch of the medical humanities major and to clarify that the Georgetown College will oversee new programming.

Do ASL classes fulfill the foreign language graduation requirements at Georgetown?

Strong United States leadership alongside grassroots activism in Germany were key factors in the fall of the Berlin Wall, speakers said at an event in Gaston Hall on Nov. 6. 
The event, titled “30 Years Later: Lessons from the Fall of the Berlin Wall,” featured three different panels of notable experts as well as introductory remarks from former Secretary of State James Baker. The panels focused on the events leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall, events that occurred on the day the wall was torn down and policy implications for the future. 
After World War II, Germany was divided into four military occupation zones by the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union, with the eastern section occupied by the Soviets. From 1949 to 1961, about 2.5 million East Germans fled from East Germany to West Germany. In response to this mass immigration, East Germany erected the Berlin Wall in 1961 as a barrier to prevent skilled East German workers and intellectuals from leaving the region.
The fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989 remains a remarkable event to this day because of its historical impact, according to Baker.
“I am confident that today’s lessons from the fall of the Berlin Wall will be an informative and useful examination of an historic event that led to the peaceful conclusion of the Cold War,” Baker said. “What happened three decades ago this week fundamentally changed the world.”
Panelists held varying views on the causes of the fall of the wall and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, crediting the division’s end to domestic and foreign efforts.
President Ronald Reagan’s administration took a more hardline approach to American-Soviet relations compared to the previous George H.W. Bush administration, according to panelist Jeffrey Engel, founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. Reagan’s more aggressive rhetoric caused political leaders in the Soviet Union to become concerned, Engel said at the panel.
“Soviet policymakers heard Ronald Reagan, heard him talk about a crusade of fire, heard him talk about purging the world of communism, heard him talk about the communist state as being an evil empire and were genuinely worried that he meant what he said,” Engel said. 
The United States played an important role in spreading liberal values to other parts of the world, according to Baker.
“Both President Reagan and President Bush realized that a large component of American strength was that we were the promoter and champion of a liberal world order,” Baker said.
In 1989, a series of revolutions in nearby European countries spurred East Germans to begin demonstrating for liberalizing reform. After weeks of sustained civil unrest, the East German government announced that citizens could begin visiting West Germany. Following the announcement, thousands of Germans gathered on both sides of the wall and guards at the wall opened the gate.
The grassroots action of individuals in East Germany and neighboring Soviet countries contributed to the fall of the wall, according to Baker.
“It was the indomitable spirit of those citizens of the captive nations that made possible our victory in the Cold War,” Baker said.
Both the Reagan and Bush administrations focused on developing strong relations with other foreign leaders and attempted to promote America’s interests and values around the world, and the current executive administration should do the same, according to Baker. 
“The lessons that presidents Reagan and Bush provided during that critical window of history remain as pertinent today as they were back then,” Baker said. “As our nation continues to confront many daunting challenges, the foreign policies of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush remain models that all American presidents would do well to follow.”
The event was part of the Georgetown University German department’s series of programming celebrating the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall from Nov. 4 to Nov. 9. Events include a weeklong poster exhibit in the Intercultural Center, student and faculty presentations and a “Tear Down This Wall!” cake party. 
Ideologies transcend physical barriers, according to ambassador and former Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky.
“The power of ideas can really make a difference, the moral narrative, the fact that fundamental human freedoms cannot be buried or blocked by any kind of wall or barrier,” Dobriansky said.

After a more than 14-hour Washington, D.C. Council hearing on a bill that would take steps to decriminalize some sex work in D.C., the Georgetown University Student Association Senate voted in favor of a resolution supporting the bill at their meeting Sunday.
The GUSA resolution endorsed the D.C. Council Community Safety and Health Amendment Act of 2019, a bill that would decriminalize prostitution for individuals over 18 years old and create a working group that would examine how to decriminalize other types of sex work. 
The bill is awaiting a vote in the Council’s Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, but the Council’s chair, Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), indicated he does not plan to bring the measure to a full committee vote in the near future, according to DCist. 
The GUSA resolution supporting the D.C. Council bill passed in a 20-6 vote. During a debate period about the resolution, many senators who supported the bill highlighted higher participation rates by the LGBTQ community in the sex work industry. The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that 19% of all transgender people have participated in sex work.
The GUSA-sponsored D.C. Council bill would support current and future members of the Georgetown LGBTQ community as well as students currently working as sex workers, according to freshman senator Eric Lipka (COL ’23), who introduced the GUSA resolution. 
“With the resolution, I hope that it also sends this message to the queer community on campus: We see you. We stand with you. We support you. You are valid, and your interests are our interests, and we will continue to fight for you and your rights on campus,” Lipka said in an interview with The Hoya. “I feel that it is my duty to let them know that they belong here and should not be criminalized and dehumanized for their work.”
Opponents of the GUSA resolution cited personal beliefs and a lack of research on the number of students involved in the sex work industry as their concerns. Sam Dubke (SFS ’21) voted against the resolution over the potential implications of supporting the bill, which he argued during the debate period.
“I think decriminalization is a conversation that we can positively have, but as this piece of legislation stands, I think it is too urging of the act itself,” Dubke said during the period of debate on the GUSA resolution. “I also have personal morality; I think that I can’t vote on something that encourages this kind of work.”
The D.C. Council bill met similar opposition to the GUSA resolution after a committee hearing on the topic Oct. 17. After originally introducing the bill to the Council in 2017, Councilmember David Grosso (I-At-Large) reintroduced the measure on June 4. After hearing the testimonies of sex workers, which included D.C. college students, Grosso concluded that sex work should be decriminalized and drafted the bill, he wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“It is overdue for D.C. to change how we address commercial sex in our city,” Grosso wrote. “By decriminalizing sex work between consenting adults and retaining prohibitions against force, coercion, and human trafficking, we can take sex work out of the shadows, reduce violence, and improve the provision of health and other services to sex workers.”
Tamika Spellman, who serves as a policy and advocacy associate with HIPS, a non-profit that provides medical services, education, and support to drug users and those in the sex industry, testified before the D.C. Council in support of the bill.
Spellman has personally faced discrimination by local police as a sex worker in D.C. because of sex work’s illegal status, she said. The D.C. Council bill would be a positive step toward preventing similar experiences for certain sex workers whose work would be decriminalized under the bill in the District in the future, according to Spellman.
“We’re asking for a relaxing of some laws so that people can work more efficiently, work safer and not be pushed around by the police holding the criminality over their heads,” Spellman said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Sex workers are going to be ultimately safer; we will feel a lot better about reporting crimes that do happen to us.”
Last year, H*yas for Choice, a pro-reproductive rights organization, alongside the Georgetown Black Student Alliance and GU Queer People of Color, co-hosted a conversation with Spellman as a part of their sex work series. 
The D.C. Council bill would directly support Georgetown student sex workers, according to HFC leadership.
“H*yas for choice is strongly in support of sex work decriminalization, as we believe everyone should be free to make decisions about their bodily autonomy and that decriminalization makes sex work safer,” the group wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “There are Georgetown students who are sex workers and whose lives would be directly improved by decriminalization.”
Hoya Staff Writer Riley Rogerson contributed to this reporting.

The Student Activities Commission held its semesterly Budget Summit last weekend to allocate approximately $300,000 to over 130 clubs for spring 2020.
SAC is a funding and advisory board that distributes money to student organizations. It is part of a wider system of funding at Georgetown University controlled by the Georgetown University Student Association senate finance and appropriations committee. The FinApp committee received $1,092,000 this year from the $84 Student Activities Fee that all students pay each semester. 
This club funding system is complex but has a major impact on club programming, campus visibility and student life. While many clubs fall under other advisory boards with slightly different processes, SAC allocates the most funding to the most groups. 
How Does Club Funding Work, Really? 
The FinApp committee divides $1,092,000 among nine bodies, including seven advisory boards: SAC, Georgetown Program Board, the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, the GUSA executive, Media Board, Performing Arts Advisory Council, Campus Ministry Student Forum, Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service Advisory Board for Student Organizations and Advisory Board for Club Sports.
Advisory boards work with the vice president for student affairs to oversee student organizations and their role on campus. These advisory boards act as umbrella organizations that distribute funds among various kinds of student groups.
SAC received roughly $320,000 from the FinApp committee for the 2019-20 year, according to SAC Chair Max Curschmann (COL ’20). SAC also received additional funding of approximately $84,000 from the vice president’s Office for Student Affairs and approximately $8,800 in a Coke grant. 
Of the nearly $400,000 in funding that SAC receives, roughly $300,000 is allocated for its budget fund and roughly $100,000 goes toward ad hoc and travel funding. Student organizations can request ad hoc funding for larger, more expensive events, according to Curschmann.
Any club with Access to Benefits  — which means it is university-approved to receive campus resources — is able to apply for SAC funding via a Google form sent out at the start of each semester. Clubs have until 5 p.m. on the Thursday before the Budget Summit to submit their funding requests. 
Fourteen student commissioners serve on SAC, and each commissioner works directly with a portfolio of seven to 11 student groups. The commissioners serve as a resource for student groups and inform them of their final budget allocation. 
SAC works to be transparent with its funding process by publicizing its weekly meetings and Budget Guide, which lists SAC policies, according to SAC Commissioner Jake Galant (SFS ’20). 
“While many students think SAC is a black box, we actually have a very open process, and students can look at our weekly minutes or see our Budget Guide where we lay out all of our policies,” Galant wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
How Does SAC Decide How Much Funding to Give Student Groups?
When deciding how to address each club’s budget requests, SAC looks at the club’s previous two semesters of approved funding. SAC places each organization into a funding tier, taking their prior funding history into account. 
Each tier represents a range of funding and each club’s funding is labeled as low, no designation or high. These tiers correspond to the 25th percentile, 50th percentile and 75th percentile of funding, respectively.
The tiers give SAC an effective safety net during the budget summit by preventing the possibility of allocating more funding than is in the total budget. 
These tiers provide flexibility for SAC to adjust the final funding allocation for clubs. But SAC has not recently run into this issue, as it has received adequate total funding, according to Curschmann.
A club’s upper funding limit is determined by the highest budget a club received in that time. The highest spring 2020 budgets allocated at last weekend’s summit were $6,000, granted to Georgetown Midwest Club, the Asian American Student Association, African Society of Georgetown and the Ballroom Dance Team. 
SAC takes a holistic view when considering higher than usual funding requests from clubs that historically have larger budgets in one semester over another, according to Curschmann.
“So we get that their Fall 2019 budget is like a lot lower, but historically their spring budget has always been a lot bigger,” Curschmann said. 
SAC may conduct budget cuts when organizations applying for funding do not follow the Budget Guide. 
How Can Clubs Receive More Funding, If Needed?
Often, clubs may not initially receive funding for certain large events because SAC can address these events with its ad hoc funding, Curschmann said. 
“We say come back for our ad hoc funding, and then they’ll get full funding then,” Curschmann said. “We just found historically that when groups do come in for ad hoc funding, it’s more accurate, the dollars are used more efficiently and that’s just more transparent as well as where all the student body’s money is going.”
Clubs are notified of their allocated funding for the following semester via an email from their assigned SAC commissioner. Clubs have one week after being notified of their funding to appeal the allocation amount.
This semester’s budget summit adequately addressed the needs of Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network, according to GREEN President Amelia Walsh (SFS ’20).
“We usually request about the same amount each semester, and we usually budget for about 7 events of about $100, and then extra money for general maintenance (with teams working on bees and gardening, we often have a lot of maintenance needs),” Walsh wrote in an email The Hoya. “We have been happy with our interactions with SAC this year.”
Students should have a vested interest in the work that SAC does in allocating club funding, according to SAC Commissioner Clay Volino (SFS ’22).
“Ultimately I believe the purpose of SAC funding is to give clubs the resources they need to build community within Georgetown. Students who care about that should care about SAC funding,” Volino wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Presenters and participants at the second annual Working to End Rape Culture Summit highlighted the importance of taking an intersectional approach to sexual misconduct prevention and advocacy Nov. 2.
Participants from Georgetown University and across Washington, D.C., attended the daylong summit, listening to lectures and participating in breakout sessions about the different factors of sexual assault and misconduct. The Georgetown University Sexual Assault Peer Educators, which facilitates student education on sexual assault, hosted the conference held in the Intercultural Center. 
The summit underscored the ways rape culture and sexual misconduct affect marginalized communities, according to WERC Summit Fundraising and Partnerships Chair Morgan Robinson (NHS ’20). 
“One of the main things that we talked about over the summer when we began the planning process was having the WERC Summit not cater to, but specifically emphasize marginalized communities and how survivorship is impacted and what it looks like within those communities,” Robinson said in an interview with The Hoya.
The summit’s organizers wanted to draw attendees already active in sexual misconduct prevention advocacy and non-activists who value eliminating campus sexual misconduct, according to WERC Summit Logistics Chair Sinclair Blue (SFS ’20). 
“People who are doing the work are already really committed and tend to know a lot, but how do we target your everyday Georgetown student who might not necessarily be a sexual assault activist, but would if they were equipped to?” Blue said in an interview with The Hoya.
The summit’s keynote speaker was Sameera Qureshi, the director of sexuality education and training at HEART Women & Girls, an organization that promotes sexual health and confronts sexual violence in the Muslim community, according to its mission statement. 
During her talk, Qureshi highlighted how sexual abuse can go unaddressed in marginalized communities, citing the results of the 2019 Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct, noting the low 39% response rate. 
“Who is responding to the survey? And, for me to give time and energy to a survey, I’m going to believe that I’m invested in the cause, that I think the institution represents me and what I need and that I trust the institution to do something with my answers,” Qureshi said in her speech. “If we think about this 39%, I’m going to think that they are probably the most privileged part of this campus, those who see themselves represented by the institution and those who feel like they’ll do something if they are harmed.” 
Although students independently advocate to combat sexual assault, Georgetown has not provided adequate resources for activists and survivors, according to Blue. 
“Students are leading a lot of this work, but the university has the responsibility to support students and also to support staff,” Blue said.  
After a yearlong search for a Title IX coordinator, the university named former Title IX investigator Samantha Berner as coordinator in July. Berner’s promotion vacated the investigator role, and the university has not filled the position, although it is actively seeking applicants. 
Student attendees came from universities throughout the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area to learn more about how to curtail rape culture on college campuses, including Reah Vasilakopoulos, a senior at Johns Hopkins University who is active in student sexual abuse prevention. 
“I particularly came to this conference to navigate that line between intervention and more root cause structural change,” Vasilakopoulos said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Other attendees said the breakout sessions introduced them to facets of rape culture that are not as commonly talked about. Alex Steitz, a junior at Goucher College, attended the breakout session “Queer Students & Title IX: Know Your Rights.” 
“I really liked the workshop that I went to about Title IX rights for LGBTQ students and what those rights have looked like, what they are potentially going to look like and what they are currently looking like; it was really informative and interesting,” Steitz said in an interview with The Hoya. “When we talk about Title IX, we usually talk about sexual and relationship violence and not as much about the way that it applies to discrimination.”

The Steve Fund, an organization advocating for mental health support for people of color, held its Young, Gifted & Advancing conference at Georgetown University on Nov. 1 to discuss how to address challenges in addressing the mental well-being of students of color on college campuses. 
The daylong conference, which included a keynote session and two breakout sessions, focused on the role of institutions and peer relationships in creating inclusive environments for supporting university students of color affected by mental health issues. The conference, which was organized through the Office of the President, held several panels ranging in topics from the role of faculty in supporting mental health to the influence of intersectional identities on mental well-being. 
Microaggressions, which are unintentional or intentional phrases that send a derogatory message, are mental health obstacles students of color face while navigating their college experiences, according to panelist and associate professor of nursing Edilma Yearwood. 
“I think racial bias across one or more environments serve as microaggressions, which over time is caustic and detrimental to health, self-esteem and self-confidence,” Yearwood wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Marinating in these feelings over time creates doubt and wears down any initial excitement and hope of success in college, especially in primarily white environments.” 
The Young, Gifted & Advancing conference was the seventh conference in the Steve Fund’s Young, Gifted & @Risk series and the first to be held at Georgetown. The series will also include conferences in the fall at the University of Michigan and the City University of New York. 
Attendees received a pamphlet at the conference titled “The Equity in Mental Health Framework,” which lists 10 strategies to bridge the gap between students of color and mental health services. The strategies include recruiting and training a diverse body of faculty, offering workshops on mental health services and creating discussion groups dedicated to promoting mental well-being resources for students. 
The Equity in Mental Health Framework provides leaders and allies with strategies to better provide equitable access to resources for college students, according to Deidra Dain, senior advisor for programs for The Steve Fund.
“University leaders and stakeholders can use it to make proactive decisions – based on their unique campus needs and conditions – to improve racial climate, prioritize student mental and emotional health, and foster a thriving learning environment,” Dain wrote in an email to the Hoya.
In addition to the breakout sessions, the conference also included keynote speakers Sherry Molock, associate professor of clinical psychology at The George Washington University, and David Rivera, associate professor at Queens College, City University of New York. Molock and Rivera spoke in a session titled “Macro and Micro Climates: Challenges to and Protectors of Mental Health for Students of Color.”
The conference highlighted the importance of recognizing the distinct barriers marginalized groups face to accessing mental health treatment, such as provider bias and stigma, according to conference panelist and LGBTQ Resource Center Director Shiva Subbaraman.
“Many students who face mental health challenges also face further barriers to access and to belonging if they come from other marginalized identities,” Subbaraman wrote in an email to the Hoya. “We all have a right to be taken seriously; to be validated; to be seen; to feel secure; and to feel engaged.”
At Georgetown, the university’s Counseling and Psychiatric Services offer individual services, group therapy and workshops to the student body. In 2018, the university contributed $10,000 toward a student-run pilot program of off-campus therapy stipends for students demonstrating financial need.
While the university has made efforts to improve mental health resources through CAPS, faculty engagement with programming needs to increase, according to conference panelist and Georgetown associate professor of biology Heidi Elmendorf.
“My critique of the current situation is simple, though not easy,” Elmendorf wrote in an email to the Hoya. “We need to ensure that more faculty take part in the programs we already offer, that we incorporate participation into our expectations of faculty.”
The Office of the President’s sponsorship of the conference brings hope to the idea that the issues students of color face at Georgetown will be properly addressed in the future, Subbaraman wrote.
“I think the day-long conference both highlighted the enormity and prevalence of this issue across the country; and since it was held in conjunction with the Office of the President, we hope this will bring a lot of more understanding,” Subbaraman wrote in an email to The Hoya.

This year’s annual Jesuit Heritage Month includes an event honoring the 30th anniversary of the murders of six Jesuits and two associated lay people at the University of Central America in El Salvador as well as weekly prayer services and lectures to promote Jesuit values among students, faculty and staff.
The annual Jesuit Heritage Month will run programming on campus throughout the month of November. The keynote event, “Remembering the Jesuit Martyrs 30 Years Later: A Conversation with Congressman Jim McGovern and Fr. Matt Carnes, S.J.,” was hosted Nov. 6 by Carnes, the director of the Center for Latin American Studies, and McGovern (D-Mass.). McGovern was involved in the Congressional Moakley Commision, a special Congressional panel led by Joe Moakley (D- Mass.), which investigated the deaths in El Salvador in 1989.
The Congressional Moakley Commision found the Jesuit murders were committed by the American-backed Salvadoran military, according to the event’s description. The event reflected the University of Central America Jesuits’ commitment to standing up to the Salvadoran military and featured discussion on Georgetown University’s role in bringing attention to human rights issues in El Salvador, according to Carnes. 
“The commitment of the Jesuits at the University of Central America to challenge the oppression and violence of the regime, and to work for peace and justice, continues to inspire us today,” Carnes wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown played an integral role in raising awareness about the atrocities committed in El Salvador.”
Jesuits in El Salvador were advocates for a negotiated settlement between the Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, a guerilla group that opposed the government during the Salvadoran Civil War, according to a UN Truth Commission report. The Salvadoran military considered the Jesuits at the University of Central America as being allied and supportive of FMNL operations, and that affiliation with the FMNL rebels made them a target of the Salvadoran military, according to the report.
McGovern worked with Fr. Charlie Currie, S.J., who led the Georgetown response that brought  awareness to the murders, during the time of the investigation.
This event aligned with the month’s goal of highlighting Jesuit and Ignatian values in daily life and work, according to Director of Ignatian Programs Rev. Jerry Hayes, S.J.
“The theme of remembering the martyrs and their legacy is threaded through many of our events this month, and we hope that members of our community who attend them will deepen their understanding of how our Jesuit and Ignatian values can animate one’s life and one’s work,” Hayes wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Jesuit Heritage Month will also include an installment of the Faith and Culture Lecture Series, featuring professor of English Carolyn Forché in an event titled “What You Have Heard Is True: A Memoir of Witness and Resistance” on Nov. 18. A Dahlgren Chapel Sacred Lecture titled “Ignatius and Companions: Their Quiet Revolutions” and led by Rev. John O’Malley, S.J., will occur Nov. 20. 
As well as larger lectures and events, multiple smaller events will take place. Weekly Examens, a fundamental prayer of St. Ignatius, will occur on each Wednesday of Jesuit Heritage Month in Dahlgren Chapel, according to Hayes. 
“Each week we are hosting an Examen, which is the foundational prayer of St. Ignatius (founder of the Jesuits) and his spiritual practice, in order to give members of the community time to reflect–an essential component of our values here at Georgetown as contemplatives in action,” Hayes wrote. 
Jesuit Heritage Month programming provides the Georgetown community the opportunity to dig deeper into Jesuit history and reflect on the role of Ignatian values in daily life, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) wrote in a campuswide email.
“These events, among others, are hosted in collaboration with faculty, student groups, and departments across our campus and provide an opportunity for our community to engage with our Ignatian heritage, reflect deeply on the commitments and values that animate the mission of our University,” DeGioia wrote.

The 14th annual Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month at Georgetown began last Friday with a new education-focused Halloween event and will include a Vietnamese Language Dinner, a first ever Langar Night and other programming throughout November.
The Asian American Hub for Organizing, Movement and Empowerment, a residential space for Asian American students on campus founded this year, held the first program of API Heritage Month on Nov. 1 with a trick-or-treat event in collaboration with the Womxn in the Arts Magis Row house. Asian American HOME members distributed candy and Halloween o’grams highlighting issues involving immigration, socioeconomic status and health education, according to Asian American HOME resident and Asian-Pacific Islander Leadership Forum member Heejin Hahn (COL ’20).
Through Halloween o’grams focusing on areas of concern within Asian communities, attendees were able to observe the diverse issues that these communities face, Hahn wrote.
“These were some that I picked to remind people of how intersectional Asian American identity is and how our movement is multi-issue and multi faceted,” Hahn wrote in an email to The Hoya. “At the Asian American house, we try to be as intersectional as we can to address people and identities who are pushed to the margins of our own communities.”
The Sikh Student Association, which was founded last year, will also be hosting their first ever Langar Night on Nov. 13. Langar Night will celebrate the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak Dev Ji, and his practice of Langar with free vegetarian food served to all visitors regardless of religion, caste or gender, according to SSA President Rimpal Bajwa (SFS ’22).
This year will be the first time the Asian American Student Association will host its annual Fall Ball and Asian Diversity Dialogue Conference in the same weekend to increase traction and awareness, according to AASA Co-President Julia Lo (MSB ’21). Event attendees will have the opportunity to learn about diversity within Asian communities and how these individuals exist beyond common stereotypes, Lo wrote. 
“I hope students, through attending these events, realize that API culture is not monolithic,” Lo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I hope the various conferences and showcases allow our peers to experience our culture past the stereotypes and mainstream ideals.”
Although API Heritage Month at Georgetown takes place in November, the celebration occurs nationally in May. The university decided to celebrate API Heritage Month in November due to the student body being out of session for most of May, according to Hahn. 
Celebrating API Heritage Month in November presents a problem in its dislocation of National Native American Heritage Month at Georgetown during its traditional timing, Hahn wrote.
“Of course, APILF is not exactly thrilled that the president’s office declared API heritage month to be in November which is actually the national Native American heritage month in the US,” Hahn wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We do not mean to displace other students’ heritage months just because we cannot hold ours in May in accordance with the National calendar.”
Other events for this year’s celebration include a new Vietnamese iced coffee fundraiser hosted by the Vietnamese Student Association on Nov. 6 to raise money for Blue Dragon, an organization that fights to end human trafficking in Vietnam, according to VSA Director of Public Relations Megan Huynh (NHS ’22). The group will also host a Vietnamese Language Dinner on Nov. 15, where students can eat traditional Vietnamese food while learning Vietnamese vocabulary.
Additional programming for API Heritage Month includes Club Filipino’s Barrio Fiesta on Nov. 9 and AASA’s Asian Diversity Dialogue Conference on Nov. 10. 
Rangila, South Asian Society’s annual dance showcase, will be one of the closing events of API Heritage Month on Nov. 22 and 23. Rangila, which is the largest student-run dance showcase at Georgetown, represents how Georgetown can support South Asian communities, according to SAS President Saumya Shruti (COL ’20).
“Although Georgetown is a predominantly white institution (PWI), I have always seen Georgetown through the lens of diversity,” Shruti wrote in an email to The Hoya. “To have the largest student run showcase be that of South Asian culture and one that is dedicated to supporting South Asian communities both in Georgetown and also in South Asia through its philanthropy efforts is a sight no where else to be found.”

Religious communities inadequately confront sexuality, alienating their members, students and religious leaders said at a Nov. 6 panel hosted by the LGBTQ Resource Center and Campus Ministry. 
The event, “Desire, Pleasure, & Faith: A Conversation,” featured the Director for Dharmic Life Brahmachari Sharan and Senior Research Fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs Jerry McGlone S.J. Students Mariah Johnson (COL ’21) and Saisha Mediratta (SFS ’20) shared their perspectives on sexuality, abstinence and chastity in the Healey Family Student Center Herman Meeting Room. 
The event was a part of OUTober, a month-long set of programs sponsored by the LGBTQ Center during LGBTQ History month in October and November. Other events coordinated with Campus Ministry included a tea with Campus Ministry chaplains on Oct. 1 and a Mass of Belonging held at Dahlgren Chapel on Oct. 20.
Mediratta, whose family is Punjabi, said that early cultural experiences shaped her understanding of sexuality.
“Growing up we did not talk about sex, pleasure, the in-between, or even really dating,” Mediratta said. “My deepest struggle with navigating a journey around my life, my body and my choices is my very Indian family where faith, tradition and culture are so deeply intertwined, but it was self-policing in a tradition where we do not talk about these issues openly yet obsess over them covertly.”
Dharmic traditions, which include religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, have a wide range of beliefs and teachings on sex. Those beliefs have changed throughout history because of colonial influences and changing social norms in South Asia, according to Sharan. 
Johnson, who was raised Catholic, did not engage in conversations about sexuality with family and was encouraged to practice abstinence throughout childhood, Johnson said. 
“I didn’t really process what I was taught about abstinence and dating super deeply throughout adolescence but these views did stay with me, largely unquestioned, until college,” Johnson said. “When I started to learn more and more about myself here at Georgetown I started to question more and more why I believed so strongly in abstinence.”
Rigid Catholic teachings on sexuality present a dilemma for people who support the LGBTQ community, according to McGlone. The struggle for many Catholics is how to disagree thoughtfully with the aspects of doctrine that one feels are not essential to the faith, McGlone said.  
The event was organized to facilitate a dialogue between students and religious leaders, according to Shiva Subbaraman, the director of the LGBTQ Resource Center. Provoking discussion around issues of sexuality is especially important for building trust with members of Campus Ministry, Subbaraman said. 
“Part of the struggle they have as monks and priests is students look at them and they don’t trust them,” Subbaraman said in an interview with The Hoya. “Part of my hope was not only to have the students think through this but to demystify them to say they’re human, they struggle, they have always struggled and it’s okay to ask them these questions or share with them.”
Contemporary norms around sexuality have been shaped by antiquated religious teachings, Sharan said. 
“The way we were socialized was to look at books made expressly for nuns and monks and make people think that was how we were supposed to be, which is ridiculous,” Sharan said. 
Lack of familial and societal conversations around sex and spirituality can be harmful to well-being, according to McGlone.  
“We understand the role religion can play in harming individuals but also the possibility of making and supporting health,” McGlone said. “This is not just a faith problem — this is a societal problem if we don’t talk about sexuality in this open and honest way enough.”

Republican and bipartisan input belong in conversations on climate change solutions, conservative climate advocates said at a Nov. 7 panel hosted by the Georgetown University College Republicans and Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service.
The event, “Conservative Solutions: Common Sense on Climate,” held in White-Gravenor Hall, featured four republican panelists who discussed conservative initiatives and solutions to climate change. The speakers proposed solutions to issues like a carbon tax, a fee on the burning of carbon-based fuels, among other free market alternatives to Democratic policies addressing climate change. 
Ryan Costello, a former Republican Pennsylvania congressman and member of the Climate Solutions Caucus, a bipartisan group in the House of Representatives that explores policy options to address climate change, served as one of the panelists. The Republican Party needs to prioritize working on solutions to climate change to win elections, according to Costello.
“For Republicans to maintain its space in our two-party system, we need an environmental agenda,” Costello said. “If we’re not out in front with a climate solution — and climate is a top one, two, three issue for a voter — even if you are aligned with the Republican party, you may well not vote Republican because you don’t see the Republican party offering solutions to the significant issues of this time.”
Policymakers need to create bipartisan solutions to successfully address climate change, according to Costello.
“If it’s just one party doing something, those solutions tend not to be durable,” Costello said. “They tend to be politicized; it’s very difficult to get something through really transformational unless you get buy in from both political parties.”
Other panelists included Jim Tolbert, conservative outreach director of Citizens Climate Lobby; Nick Lindquist, national policy director at the American Conservation Coalition; and Alex Bozmoski (COL ’08), managing director of republicEN, a conservative group supporting efforts to reduce the risk of climate change. 
The event was organized in association with the American Conservation Coalition, a group that educates conservative individuals on environmental issues, the Citizens Climate Lobby, a group that facilitates dialogue with elected representatives to form environmental policies, and Students for Carbon Dividends, a bipartisan group dedicated to creating policies to solve climate change. 
Certain democratic proposals such as the Green New Deal, a congressional resolution to address climate change, are not optimal plans to solve the climate crisis, according to Bozmoski. Without an alternative, however, the Green New Deal will continue to gain popularity, Bozmoski said.
“When this country has decided that it wants something, in our case, climate action, it will take the only option offered over none at all and if the only thing on the table is the Green New Deal, then buckle up for the Green New Deal,” Bozmoski said. “You should say this is a big problem and conservatives for free enterprise have solutions that are more powerful than the GND.”
The carbon tax has received bipartisan support and is a forward-thinking free market solution, Costello said.
“Putting a price on pattern with the revenue derived from that price going back into the pocket of the taxpayer to the tune of about $2,000 for a family of four by my way of thinking isn’t a tax because, number one, we’re not taxing you, we’re putting a price on those who pollute with the revenue going back to the American taxpayer,” Costello said.
In opposition to the Climate Forum 2020 held at Georgetown University on Sept. 19 and 20, GUCR hosted a panel of climate scientists and policymakers called “Climate Forum: A Rebuttal,” on Sept. 19. The GUCR event was interrupted by protesters who characterized the invited speakers as climate deniers and skeptics. The Georgetown University Police Department arrived at the event to break up the interrupting demonstrations. 
At Thursday’s panel, GUPD officers asked students to present their Georgetown identification and conducted bag searches upon entry. 
GUCR aimed to present students with more viewpoints on climate change through the event, according to GUCR Director of Campus Affairs Dalton Nunamaker (COL ’22).
“Tonight was a way for us to recommit to our values of free speech that we hold so dear, that the other side oftentimes doesn’t seem to hold to,” Nunamaker said. “This is a way for us to introduce some really important policy ideas and to have a big debate and discussion.” 
Several Republicans have been active proponents of climate change solutions as Republican values and environmental activism are not mutually exclusive, according to Lindquist. “I realized I can be a Republican and care about the environment as well, and there are solutions out there that Republicans can advocate for,” Lindquist said.

November 8, 2019 by Gabriella Raphael 3 Comments 
A campaign for tougher electric scooter safety laws was reignited by a Georgetown resident this November, organizing with his fellow residents through the new Groups.io neighborhood listserv.
Edward Segal launched the petition and a corresponding website in May demanding that Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and the D.C. Council pass and enforce laws banning scooters from sidewalks and penalizing riders for unsafe use of scooters, but the petition has only garnered 188 of its 1000 signature goal at the time of publication. Segal, who has lived in Washington, D.C., on and off for 30 years, is currently a public relations consultant, gas safety advocate, public speaker and author.
Segal’s concerns and petition center around unsafe and improper usage of the scooters by riders, according to Segal.
“I am not against e-scooter riders or drivers. I am against how they are driving dangerously and hazardously and how they are putting the lives and safety of pedestrians and car drivers in jeopardy,” Segal said in an interview with The Hoya.
The District Department of Transportation proposed new rules for electric scooters for 2020 in a statement Sept. 25, limiting the number of companies authorized to operate in the city but ultimately allowing for an increase in the number of devices each company can deploy. The regulations were released for public comment from Sept. 25 to Oct. 30.
The new regulations would mean there could be up to 10,000 more scooters in D.C. as soon as January, which worries residents like Segal. His petition asks the D.C. Council to implement new penalties, including stiff fines for riders who do not wear helmets, use cell phones or wear headphones while riding. Segal also proposed a $100 fine for every rider who leaves their electric scooter in an unsafe place on sidewalks or streets, according to the petition.
Bikes and scooters are already barred from sidewalks in D.C.’s downtown central business district around the White House, but Segal wants this rule to extend throughout the rest of the city, too.
Segal noted that Georgetown’s brick sidewalks and cobblestone streets make for unsafe riding.
“Our infrastructure is bad enough as it is and is not conducive to new technologies,” he said. “Some of the sidewalks are uneven, they are barely safe to walk on. I see people tripping all the time, and then to ride an electric vehicle on top of that — it’s adding danger upon danger upon danger, and it’s simply not safe.”
Other District residents outside of Georgetown are concerned about scooter safety as well. D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) chaired a D.C. Council hearing Nov. 4 on dockless vehicles. The hearing addressed electric scooter regulation and safety in the city and expanded on the Electric Mobility Devices Amendment Act of 2019 introduced by Cheh and other councilmembers June 25. 
During the hearing, Cheh confirmed that a proposed ban on overnight electric scooter use from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. would be taken off the table after advocates argued for the importance of late-night dockless vehicle usage.
Cheh has spearheaded a project to add parking spots for scooters across D.C. to keep sidewalks clear, which gained funding this fiscal year beginning in October 2019.
Cheh agreed with Segal that scooters pose a public safety hazard when left on sidewalks.
“This legislation is a broad and comprehensive approach to establishing common sense electric scooter and electric bike rules that will help keep our streets and sidewalks safe while also enabling these services to continue to operate in the District,” Cheh wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Electric scooters were first introduced in spring 2018, making D.C. one of the first U.S. cities to allow the dockless vehicles. Scooter usage in the city has increased in the past year, with nearly one in six residents having used them in the past year, according to The Washington Post. 
The newness and widespread use of scooters necessitated legislation, according to Cheh.
“We have established bike culture in the District, but, because this technology is relatively new, we don’t have a safe electric scooter culture—resulting in many users neglecting to follow important safety rules,” Cheh wrote. 
Segal advocated for more severe consequences for reckless riders.
“They should be arrested or taken in,” Segal said. “I’m for anything that will improve the environment, lessen the carbon footprint and make it more easy and convenient for people to get around the city but not at the expense of the safety of pedestrians and drivers.”

Great article and insight into the complex issues dealing with the electric scooter. While the article is very well written, I am morally compelled to disagree with Segal due to large range of  opportunities and possibilities this mode of transportation introduces to the residents of DC.

Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E unanimously passed a motion urging the Council of the District of Columbia to ban the sale of flavored electronic smoking devices at its monthly meeting Nov. 4. 
ANC 2E, a local government body of elected officials, represents Georgetown, and two students serve as commissioners. Commissioner Matias Burdman (COL ’21) introduced the motion endorsing the passage of D.C. Council Bill B23-0453, the “Flavored Electronic Smoking Device Prohibition Amendment Act of 2019,” which is still under council review. The legislation would ban the sale of all flavors of e-cigarettes except tobacco and menthol.
Burdman drafted the motion after being contacted by Flavor Hooks Kids DC, a coalition of organizations including MedStar Georgetown University Hospital that lobbies against e-cigarette sales.
The bill aims to protect children, in particular, according to Burdman.
“I think this is important to do and push through to the D.C. Council because you have children getting addicted to this,” Burdman said in an interview with The Hoya. “They are using nicotine in a way that affects their brains, and in a way where they literally cannot lose, or it’s very difficult for them to lose, their dependency afterwards.” 
The rise of vaping among young people is in part due to the attractiveness of flavored products, according to D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3). 
“Over the past few years, e-cigarette use has exploded among young people and continues to rise at an exponential pace,” Cheh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The e-cigarette industry has built this youth market by targeting children through advertising and widely available flavored products—taking a note from the playbook of the closely-aligned tobacco industry.”
In August, U.S. health officials announced that they were investigating over 90 cases of severe lung illnesses associated with vaping, which has skyrocketed among teens and young adults and in recent years. In 2018, 37% of 12th graders reported having vaped in the past year, compared to 28% the year prior, according to a survey conducted by the National Institutes of Health. 
Cheh introduced the bill in the D.C. Council, which is co-sponsored by Councilmember Trayon White (D-Ward 8), on Sept. 17 along with nine other councilmembers, including Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), whose ward includes the Georgetown neighborhood. 
Although many people, students included, may not be pleased with a ban, the benefits outweigh the costs, according to Burdman. 
“Georgetown students, or anyone who’s looking for those products, would not be able to buy one within the District of Columbia,” Burdman said. “Obviously not everyone’s going to be really happy with that, but I think overall it’s a balancing act.”
For Burdman, public health must be weighed against consumers’ demands.
“The question you have to balance is the public health benefits of introducing this legislation and then at the same time the negative effect,” Burdman said. “I think that in this case, given the fact that it’s reached epidemic proportions in children, literally, I think that it’s in my view at least simple to see that something should be done.” 
Although the issue is relevant for college students, the potential ban is focused on eradicating the use of e-cigarettes among middle and high schoolers. Local parents’ concerns about children becoming addicted was a motivating factor in passing the motion, according to ANC 2E Commissioner Kishan Putta. 
“As an ANC commissioner I represent two public schools, Hardy Middle School and the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, and the parents at both schools are very concerned about this, the health implications of vaping and flavored e-cigarettes,” Putta said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, another group lobbying for a ban on e-cigarettes, marched to the White House on Nov. 4 with children and families to deliver a petition urging the ban that garnered over 110,000 signatures, according to The Washington Times. These types of demonstrations are crucial in drumming up support for the ban, according to Putta, who was involved in the march. 
“The White House, we’re not sure what they’re proposing yet,” Putta said. “We know that they’re under tremendous lobbying from the e-cigarette industry, as is the D.C. Council, which is why it’s important to show that we have numbers. We have grassroots support as well to counteract all the money that is coming in from the other side.” 
Cheh said the proliferation of stores selling e-cigarettes across Washington, D.C., including near schools, is a result of the products’ popularity. Inaction by the federal government on the issue motivated the D.C. Council to consider a bill prohibiting flavored e-cigarettes, according to Cheh.
“The federal government has recently indicated its intent to also ban flavored e-liquids, but we cannot wait for the federal government to act while flavors such as cotton candy and gummy bear e-cigarettes remain on District shelves,” Cheh wrote.

I agree. It’s time consuming but you can definitely learn about this website. Thank you for sharing this wonderful information. Here’s my idea about this – The nicotine in e-liquids is readily absorbed from the lungs into the bloodstream when a person vapes an e-cigarette. Upon entering the blood, nicotine stimulates the adrenal glands to release the hormone epinephrine

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) issued the season’s first hypothermia alert Nov. 1, as the wind chill dropped the temperatures into the low 30s overnight.
The city issues hypothermia alerts when either the temperature is forecasted to fall below 32 degrees Fahrenheit — taking wind chill into account — or if it is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit with more than a 50% chance of precipitation, according to the D.C. Department of Human Services. D.C. residents experiencing homelessness are most affected by cold temperatures, so the city opens extra shelters overnight for the duration of a hypothermia alert.
Organizations at Georgetown University and in the neighborhood coordinate to assist people at risk in the cold. The Georgetown Ministry Center on Wisconsin Avenue is a day center open to those experiencing homelessness every day. The center looks for long-term solutions, such as connecting them with longer-term stable housing, rather than short-term fixes to homelessness, GMC Interim Executive Director Wanda Pierce wrote in an email to The Hoya.  
“GMC’s overall mission is to seek lasting solutions to homelessness, one person at a time,” Pierce wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown’s Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service team partners annually with the GMC for the Hypothermia Outreach Team. This team walks through Georgetown on cold winter nights and helps protect those experiencing homelessness from hypothermia by directing them toward safe shelters and distributing blankets.  
Participation in the outreach team requires attending one of Georgetown’s training sessions which will be offered this November and December. The outreach team operates throughout the hypothermia season from Nov. 1 to March 31.
D.C. designated two public spaces to serve as extra shelter space for the Nov. 1 alert — Malcolm X Opportunity Center on Alabama Avenue SE and Sherwood Recreation Center on 10th Street, NE — opened their doors to accommodate those experiencing homelessness following the Nov. 1 alert, according to DCist.  
In anticipation of this year’s hypothermia season, the mayor’s office opened a new center downtown where those experiencing homelessness can access critical services during the day, when many other shelters are closed. New York Avenue Presbyterian Church will house the center, which will be managed by the DowntownDC Business Improvement District, according to D.C. Curbed. It will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Every year, the D.C. Interagency Council on Homelessness publishes a winter plan to direct city government actions to protect residents during the cold months of the year. The plan highlights the danger posed by hypothermia. Since 2016, there have been eight hypothermia deaths among people experiencing homelessness, the report said.
The temperatures were low on Nov. 1 and will only continue to fall. The coldest temperatures yet this season are expected to hit the District on Nov. 8, according to National Weather Service Meteorologist Andrew Snyder. 
“The first really cold night, probably one of the coldest nights of the fall season so far, will be Friday night, with fairly widespread temperatures in the low 20s,” Snyder said in an interview with The Hoya. “Overall, very cold for this time of year.  For reference, the average low temperature for this time of year is 44 degrees.”
Georgetown students can help aid those experiencing homelessness during the winter by training and walking with the outreach team or by bringing various donations to the Center for Social Justice in Suite 130 of Poulton Hall. Donations can include new socks, gloves, winter hats, scarves, unopened emergency blankets, hand warmers and nonexpired, prepackaged granola bars, according to the Georgetown Homelessness Outreach, Meals and Education Program.
