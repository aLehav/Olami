Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) has been elected Student Activities Commission Chair for the 2012 calendar year.
“I appreciate the support of SAC student groups and am excited to continue working on their behalf. I think SAC has an enormous opportunity next semester to better cater to the larger concerns of our student groups,” Appelbaum said.
Appelbaum will be the second elected SAC Chair, replacing Andy Koenig (COL ’12). He ran against two other SAC Commissioners, Carlos DeLaTorre (COL ’13) and Dalvin Butler (COL ’13).
Each student organization received one vote for the position in the election, which was administered by the Georgetown University Election Commission. Student organizations across campus received official notice of the results by email early Saturday morning.
The new chairman, who takes office in January, will work on the implementation of a new comprehensive budget system, a draft of which was unveiled at last Wednesday’s town hall meeting.
“I want to improve communication between commissioners and their student groups so the commissioners can be looked at as advisers and supporters of programming rather than an obstacle to overcome in the approval process,” Appelbaum said. “By using the authority SAC and its decisions have, we can make progress on helping student groups create the strongest possible programming on campus.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article misspelled Jack Appelbaum’s name as Applebaum in the headline and article.
