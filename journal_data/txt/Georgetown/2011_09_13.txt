Capital Bikeshare plans to open rental stations on the National Mall despite previous opposition from the National Park Service.
While the National Mall is the District’s prime tourist destination, the National Park Service has resisted the addition of Capital Bikeshare stations to the Mall for months, saying that the stations would tarnish the park’s historical integrity.
While there are rental kiosks surrounding the Mall on Constitution and Independence Avenues as well as 14th Street, none of the bike network’s 114 stations are located on the property itself.
“If you look at the downtown area, there’s a big gap right in the middle where there are no stations, and that’s the Mall property,” spokesperson John Lisle said.
Bill Line, spokesperson for the National Park Service, told the cycling magazine Spokes that the agency was worried that bike dispensaries would detract from the patriotic and historic nature of the park.
“The National Park Service reflects an American heritage and what a particular park means to American citizens, not at [the] convenience of select individuals,” he said.
Additionally, the agency would be required under the National Environmental Protection Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to conduct an environmental assessment to determine whether a bike station would be harmful to the park’s environment or historical purpose.
According to Line, this legislation has previously prevented the Park Service from considering installing a bike station on the Mall.
“Congress passed laws so they cannot be sidestepped,” he said.
But it now seems that the Park Service has experienced a change of heart after it announced that it hopes to install new Bikeshare stations on the mall as soon as it can raise the funds.
“There are still a number of issues we need to work out, but we are hoping we can resolve those issues so we can start it up early next year. Earlier, we were looking at whether they can get on the Mall, but now we are looking for a way to get them on the Mall,” Parks Service Spokesperson Carol Johnson told The Washington Post.
The project would probably be jointly funded by the District Department of Transportation and the Park Service. Each 10-bike station costs around $50,000 to build and has an annual maintenance cost of almost half that amount.
“We believe it would benefit visitors and residents. The Bikeshare would be a great way to cover the distance between the mall and the memorials,” Lisle said. “For the folks who are on the mall, it gives them another way to get around. Anyone who has walked on the mall knows how distances can bedeceiving.”
Chris Holben, the Bikeshare project manager for DDOT, expressed high hopes for the new station.
“I think that the potential for visitor use is quite high in that region,” he said. “Also, there [are] loads and loads of people who work around the Mall, as well as in those federal buildings surrounding thearea.”
There are three Capital Bikeshare rental stations located in the neighborhood around the Hilltop, including a kiosk immediately outside the university’s front gates.
According to data provided online by Capital Bikeshare, the Georgetown station has received a steady number of users in the past months with 934 departures in May, 993 in June and 933 in July. For the same months, the kiosk on 34th and Wisconsin Avenue counted 567, 649 and 649 rentals, respectively.
For many students, the bike service provides an affordable alternative to taking a taxi cab or the Metro service.
“I know that I’d like to go into D.C. more often, and maybe if there were a more accessible way to get to the Mall I’d go there more often,” Allison Theveny (COL ’14) said.
According to Lisle, no specific plans have been confirmed for the project at this point, thoughBikeshare’s leadership has scheduled a meeting with Park Services to talk about potential locations for the new bike stations. The rental service hopes to have provided over 1 million rides by the time of its first anniversary on Sept. 20.
“[Putting stations on the Mall] is something we’ve been interested in all along and we’ve been talking about it with the Park Service now. It sounds like there’s some movement and that it’s really headedsomewhere.”
Holben agreed that the DDOT sees providing full access to the city’s citizens as a top priority.
“We’d like to provide access city wide. We’d love to get people to the area and back by Bikeshare,” he said.

Ninety cartons of cigarettes worth more than $1,000 were stolen from Vital Vittles last week.
According to Michael Crafts (COL ’13), director of Vital Vittles, two employees discovered on Sunday, Sept. 4 that the cigarettes — numbering over 18,000 — had been stolen while they were restocking their inventory.
“One of the kids was the person who had placed the order, and when he went to get more cigarettes he noticed that [out of] everything he purchased a significant quantity was gone, and they weren’t in stock in the store,” Crafts said.
The employees contacted Crafts, who verified that the cigarettes were missing and contacted the Department of Public Safety.
According to The Corp’s Chief Operating Officer Brooke Heinichen (SFS ’12), DPS is now leading the investigation into the theft. Neither she nor Crafts could comment on whether DPS has identified any suspects.
“We’re working with DPS to figure out more about this isolated incident and figure out what this reflects about our security policies,” Heinichen said.
She added that The Corp has been working to strengthen its security since the incident.
“This is an opportunity to increase our security measures, and that’s something we’re doing across our services, despite the fact that it just occurred at Vittles,” she said.
This is not the first time The Corp has dealt with a serious theft. According to Heinichen, there have been a few incidents during her tenure with the company in which cash was stolen, with each of the incidents representing a loss of about $2,000. Vital Vittles and Hoya Snaxa also cope with petty theft on a more regular basis, she said.
Crafts said he does not expect the loss to have a significant impact on The Corp’s finances, though it will affect The Corp’s ability to donate to scholarships and other philanthropic causes.
“Something like these cigarettes really affects how much we can give back to the Georgetown community. Every carton of cigarettes that gets stolen is X amount of dollars that can’t go back into the Georgetown community,” he said.
In May, The Hoya reported that The Corp has struggled with its finances in recent years. In its 2010 annual report, The Corp posted net losses of $10,418 and $181,745 for fiscal years 2010 and 2009.
However, Heinichen stressed that last week’s incident would not pose a threat to the company’s bottom line.
“The Corp is not in a financially unstable position, and we are insured against theft,” she said. “The Corp is financially stable and will remain financially stable.”
Still, Crafts said that the incident was demoralizing to his staff.
“It’s disappointing for us to lose anything this valuable, whether it be monetary or in supplies or in inventory,” he said. “Looking forward I’d say that people have sort of a heightened sense of security, and people realize that this is a real threat that can affect our profits.”
According to Heinichen, whether the Corp gets reimbursed by its insurance company is contingent upon the progress of the DPS investigation.
Representatives of DPS could not be reached for comment.

Forty courses were cancelled since pre-registration in April and the close of the add/drop period, affecting about 400 students’ fall schedules according to the university registrar.
Modified faculty plans or undersubscribed sections of certain courses forced faculty and administrators to eliminate some classes, according to University Registrar John Pierce. The number of courses cancelled, forming a small percentage of the total number of courses offered, is not unusual, Pierce said. “The departments make every effort not to drop classes after students have registered for them, but in some cases they have no choice.”
Most sections cancelled were under-enrolled, and the changes affected a small number of students. Thirty of the classes cancelled had enrollments under 10 students, while 19 of them had fewer than five. According to Pierce, a department closes courses that are too small to utilize teaching manpower efficiently.
“Faculty resources are the most valuable thing we have,” Pierce said.
Other cancellations generally hinge on professors whose availability can change unexpectedly, such as a professor’s leave being extended.
“When a class must be cancelled, we ask the chair [of the department] to write to each student and to offer assistance finding another class,” Pierce said.
According to him, two of the most challenging cancellations to handle were the classes taught by the late professor Christopher Joyner, who fell ill last week and died suddenly on Saturday. The government department actively sought to help students affected find different courses to fit their schedules.
As add/drop drew to a close last week, students with sudden cancellations faced tough choices as limited availability added difficulty to the registration process.
Matthew Westlund (SFS ’14), who was in Joyner’s international law class, said the change, though inevitable, made registration more stressful.
“I really had to scramble and message as many people as possible,” he said. “A lot of teachers I talked to were really understanding, but they had already turned away other students who had been attending class.”
Westlund was able to complete his schedule in the end, but for those that fail to find a full course load during add/drop, the process continues behind the scenes. The registrar’s office worked with the last few students who need to add classes to fill their schedule.
“It goes to show how much Georgetown professors care about not only their students, but also their potential students. They go to great lengths to make sure their students are accommodated,” said Elizabeth Coulter (SFS ‘13), a student in one of Joyner’s classes.
“I am confident that there is no one out there who wants to be full time and isn’t,” Pierce said.
Indeed, according to data, the number of students left with incomplete schedules has stayed similar to the number this time last year.
Save one or two, students who choose to be part-time are seniors who do not need to take a full load to meet graduation requirements. Students can petition their dean’s office to obtain this designation.
According to Pierce, 54 students currently remain part-time — meaning they take fewer than 12 credits­ — and he expects that number to decrease to fewer than 50 in the coming week. This fall’s numbers are in line with last fall, when 46 students were part-time students.
Pierce stressed that making sure that all those that need to carry a full course load can do so is the administration’s principal goal.
“One of the things we are most proud of is our four-year graduation rate,” Pierce said. “In order to maintain the four-year graduation rate, we must make appropriate progress each year.”
A place where the office of the registrar and deans’ offices pay extra mind is first-year registration. According to Pierce, first-years are not as knowledgeable about the registration process and may not know how to fix an incomplete schedule. The university also tries to match supply and demand by constantly monitoring enrollment numbers, especially for freshmen.
This semester, for instance, an extra 120 seats in Introduction to Philosophy were needed. The registrar then worked with the philosophy department to add more sections.
“Add/drop is a stressful time for students, but a lot of people in the dean’s and registrar’s office pay close attention,” Pierce said.

In spite of the temptation to cheat that iClickers provide, Georgetown professors say that they have seen few signs that the tools are being misused in their classrooms.
A recent Chronicle of Higher Education report found rampant iClicker cheating in more than 1,000 colleges across the country. Over 2 million students nationwide use the devices, which have emerged in several classrooms this semester and have sold out of the Georgetown bookstore; the McDonough School of Business Tech Center currently has a batch on back order to supply the growing demand this fall.
The Georgetown instructors say that dishonest use of the gadgets is minimal on campus.
Matthew Hamilton, associate professor in the biology department, said that in his early years of using theiClicker, he noticed that students would bring multiple clickers to class and respond on behalf of their peers. Ever since he began making clear in his opening lectures that misuse or a failure to report misuse of the iClickerconstitute violations of the Honor Code, however, students have cut back on cheating.
“I found that it was just a case of needing to communicate to the students in question and be very clear,” Hamilton said.
Hamilton has also adapted his syllabus to highlight the fact that illicit use of the iClicker translates to a violation of the honor code.
One student, who wished to remain anonymous to avoid being found guilty of such an honor code violation, said he had seen evidence of clicker cheating in his economics class.
“I have seen people do it for each other in class, but most of the time I don’t see it happen. But I’ve never done that,” he said.
Even still, he said that his professor had not clearly established that clicking for others is a form of academic misconduct.
Some students agree that if professors make it clear in their syllabus that clicking on behalf of a peer constitutes a violation of the honor code, cheating is less likely to occur.
Gregory Miller (SFS ’14), who has had three courses with iClickers during his time at Georgetown, has never seen a student click on behalf of a peer.
“I’m sure there are people who try to or actually do that. But I’ve never seen anybody do it,” Miller said.
He added that all of his professors have made it clear that clicking on behalf of another student would be a violation of the honor code.
“My professors have all said that … it would be a violation of the honor code. Sometimes they will randomly call on you to find out if you’re there. … You’d definitely be in trouble, because clickers are linked to your name,” he said.
Mark Rom, associate professor of government and public policy, undertook an informal investigation last fall in which he counted the number of students present in his U.S. Political Systems class and compared it to the number of iClicker respondents. The results of his experiment, which he conducted on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving — a time students are less likely to show up to class — revealed little to no cheating in his classroom.
“In both [U.S.P.S] classes I had more students present than clickers,” he said. “I’m pretty confident that there was a zero cheat rate in both classes.”
Charles King, professor of government and international affairs, expressed confidence in the ability of the honor code to police cheating in all its forms.
“There is always an opportunity for dishonesty in any class, regardless of the technology a professor chooses to use,” King said. “[But] if we can’t rely in part on the Georgetown ethos, we’re sunk.”
Rom said that if he ever discovered iClicker-based cheating he would treat it the same way as any other dishonorable academic conduct.
“Cheating with clickers is possible. Yes that is cheating, yes that should be avoided and yes that should be punished,” he said.
But he added that the anonymity facilitated by the iClicker has allowed him to eliminate other forms of cheating from his classes.
Last year, he administered frequent closed-book online quizzes, relying solely on student integrity to protect against cheating.
Curious about whether students were indeed opening their books to take the tests, he set up aniClicker quiz with anonymous settings to encourage students to report evidence of cheating.
“About a quarter to a third of the class acknowledged direct evidence [of cheating]. This was an honest report,” he said.
Rom, King and Hamilton stressed the widespread benefits of the iClicker, claiming the device makes a large classroom more intimate and interactive.
Hamilton said that the tool allows students to take ownership of their learning.
“You need to get people engaged and involved in some problem solving. [The iClicker] is a good way for all of us to be reminded about how we can be in the moment in the classroom and to be really engaged and participating,” he said.

The rehabilitation of O and P Streets in Georgetown, a project meant to improve the historical character of the neighborhood, is well underway, leading to transportation woes for neighbors and students alike.
The repairs, which are set to conclude in fall 2012, include the replacement of 100-year-old water mains and local water service connections, the pavement of the roadway and the restoration of streetcar tracks dating back to the 1800s.
Advisory Neighborhood Commission District 2E Chair Ron Lewis stressed that the repairs are meant to highlight the historical significance of the streetscape.
“The streets are in terrible shape, and the trolley tracks have great historic significance. This has to be done right,” he said. “They’re doing this to a high historic standard, which is great.”
John Lisle, spokesman for the District Department of Transportation, said that the project was undertaken in light of community safety concerns and a widespread desire to preserve the historical integrity of the tracks.
“The condition of the roads [is] considered to be dangerous. The street is not level anymore, and it’s slick, particularly when it’s wet and if it snows. Residents wanted the roadway to be redone, and at the same time, there were some folks who were concerned about preserving the tracks,” Lisle said.
Lewis said that the rehabilitation has been painful for neighborhood stakeholders because of the disruption it has caused commuters during rush hour. He also acknowledged that it inconveniences Georgetown students because it diverts the G2 Metrobus from its normal route. The construction has also led to service cuts at several corners along O and P Streets, including the bus shelter near the front gates.
“[The contractors] are doing their best to only work on a couple of blocks at a time. But scheduling with so many interests is just very difficult. It’s a very complex project, but when it’s finished, it will look great,” Lewis said.
Maria-Theresa Sanchez (SFS ’14) said that her commute was disrupted by the construction.
“Last week it took me a lot longer than it should have. The construction has been a bit of a pain for me,” she said.
According to the DDOT website, the project is slated to cost $11.1 million.
Lewis said that the federal government will foot up to 90 percent of the project cost.
“That is a usual arrangement for projects of historical significance,” he said.
The conduit-style streetcar tracks on O and P Streets are the only remaining vestiges of this type of system in the United States. The D.C. system ceased operations in 1962.
In addition to the core repairs to the roadway, the rehabilitation will improve the streetlights and drainage system, install new crosswalks, curb ramps, tree boxes and tree rails and reinstall boxes that allow pedestrians to call police and fire departments.

Beginning with a moment of silence and the tolling of the Healy bells, a vigil ceremony on Sunday commemorated the attacks of Sept. 11 through moments of silence, reflection and prayer.
At the memorial, held by Welcome Week, Hoyas for Troops and the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, the bells rang at 8:46 a.m. to honor the lives lost in the first attack on the World Trade Center in New York City. Another moment of silence followed a second ringing of the bells at 9:03 a.m., marking the time a hijacked plane hit the second tower.
Personal reflections began around 9:30 a.m., when members of the campus community shared their personal stories. The ceremony paused again at 9:37 a.m. to honor those killed by the attack on the Pentagon.
Following the reflections, the Tunnel to Towers 5K, sponsored by Hoyas for Troops, began at 10:03a.m., the time that United Airlines flight 93 — originally intended to hit Washington, D.C. — crashed into a field in western Pennsylvania. The 266 registered runners followed a path that wove throughout campus in memoriam of New York fireman Stephen Siller, the uncle of graduate student Patrick Scullin(GRD ’12), who was killed as he tried to help people escape the scene of the attacks in lower Manhattan.
Before the run kicked off, Alejandro Zendejas (SFS ’14) spoke of how his small Texan town on the U.S-Mexico border was rocked by the attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. He hoped to combat misunderstandings that he believes people often have about that day.
“I feel that there are two misperceptions … one — [that] even though we were really, really young … we don’t remember, but in reality we do,” he said. “The other misperception is that only people of a certain area were affected, but the whole nation was in shock or awe that day.”
Marilyn McMorrow, a visiting assistant professor with the School of Foreign Service, spoke of the overwhelming support she felt on campus the day of the attacks. She recalled watching from the Village A rooftops alongside students as the Pentagon burned across the Potomac. Soon after the strikes, she said, free phone banks were set up so that students could call their families. She spoke about the five interfaith services held that day — all attended by University President John J. DeGioia.
“The whole day was a day of total support of students on campus and of student support for one another,” McMorrow said.
Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., vice president for mission and ministry, noted that while the tragedy initially put the nation into a tailspin, it ultimately inspired an overwhelming sense of unity.
“Ten years ago, terror and violence had [their] day,” he said. “Life and community and compassion will [have the last word].”
O’Brien also led the attendants in a prayer to honor those who lost their lives and to ask for peace for those still grieving.
Afterwards, Scullin, Siller’s nephew and a student in the Master of Arts Program in Conflict Resolution, told of how his uncle had just gotten off his night shift and was on his way to play golf with his three brothers when he heard on his fire department radio about the attacks.
Siller drove back into the city and ran through the closed Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel to the scene of the destruction, where he gave his life helping others escape the scene. Siller left behind five children.
His family established the Tunnel to Towers Foundation in order to help other children who lost family members in the 9/11 attacks. Since its inception, the charity has built an orphanage in Staten Island, assisted victims of Hurricane Katrina and built ‘smart’ homes for quadruple amputee war veterans.
The Sunday vigil was a continuation of a weekend of remembrance begun on Friday, when students and faculty gathered to share prayers for those impacted by the attacks.
The prayer service, held in Gaston Hall, was co-sponsored by several Georgetown organizations and featured representatives from nine on-campus religious groups as well as from the Georgetown Interfaith Council.
“It is our faith [that] helps give meaning to the events of history, the events of our lives,” O’Brien said at the beginning of the ceremony.
The service featured readings and prayers from the different religious traditions, followed by a recitation of the names of Georgetown community members who were killed in the Sept. 11 attacks. After a moment of silence in honor of the victims, DeGioia spoke to the crowd of Georgetown’s tradition of solidarity in times of crisis.

Focusing on peace and ending the culture of violence, Arun Gandhi — grandson of Mahatma Gandhi — led a dialogue with Georgetown and American University students to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.
“Peace has always been the foremost hope in my lifetime. I would like to inspire all of you to continue working for peace,” Gandhi said at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs.
For Gandhi, the image of two planes striking the World Trade Center marked a new and deeper level of violence in the world. But he stressed that the continuous War on Terror is not a solution.
“To avenge the deaths of some 3,000 people who died at the World Trade Center, we have sacrificed more than 7,000 of our young men and women,” Gandhi said. “It just doesn’t make sense to me.”
Gandhi developed his philosophy of peace while growing up in a volatile South Africa. Amid the oppressive system of apartheid, Gandhi was discriminated against by whites for being too black and by blacks for not being black enough. As a teenager, these formative childhood experiences traveled with a teenaged Gandhi to India, where for almost two years he was mentored by his grandfather.
“My grandfather used to tell us that every morning we should get up and make the resolution that, ‘Today I am going to be better than I was yesterday,'” he said.
In recalling his past, Gandhi also addressed the tension between Pakistan and his grandfather’s India. Gandhi related his firsthand experiences in the wake of the 2008 Mumbai bombing, conducted by a Pakistani terror group.
For Ghandi, the crux of the Indian-Pakistani relations, as well as the 9/11 attacks, rests in the divisiveness of religion.
“Humanity has learned enough from religion to hate, but not enough to love,” Gandhi said, quoting his grandfather on interfaith tension.
For Ghandi, religious practice, in its many forms, should lead one to truth and inner peace.
Gandhi stressed that the challenge to transcend issues of ethnicity and faith can be confronted on college campuses as well. He noted that the divisions within the student body can reflect the divisions of society at large.
“Why can’t we look at this as one human family and break down those prejudices and come together and learn from each other?” Gandhi said. “Education is not just what you read in textbooks and what the professors tell you in class. It’s what you learn from your own experiences.”
After taking part in the dialogue, students proceeded to the Washington Hebrew Congregation to participate in the seventh annual Unity Walk, a demonstration of plurality. The walk down Massachusetts Avenue stopped at a number of worship spaces and featured a Muslim call to prayer, meditation and the singing of “Amazing Grace,” as well as speeches from noted figures such as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
On a day marked with memories of violence, students such as Julie Ogonis (SFS ’14), reflected on the last 10 years.
“To go from being a little girl in fourth grade to being an undergraduate … and having the chance to make some sort of impact and affect some sort of change, that is the most important part of the dialogueto me.”

At her newly opened martial arts studio near Metro Center, Luminous Warrior founder and owner Sara Salam (GRD ’01) is combining self-defense and healing practices to empower clients to push themselves beyond their physical limits.
The studio offers a range of classes for clients with varying levels of abilities and interests.
“This is an amazing place, you just have to step in and try it out,” Salam said.
Salam became interested in self-defense because of safety concerns that stemmed from her time living alone in D.C. as she completed her MBA on the Hilltop.
“Living alone, studying late at night and having to walk home, hearing about women being attacked, date rape, rape drugs and the like, I wanted to learn more about self-defense and how I could empower myself to stay safe and learn to fight back if I ever had to,” Salam said.
After experimenting with several styles of self-defense, she decided to learn Krav Maga, a self-defense system first developed in Israel that relies on participants’ leverage, instead of their strength or size.
Luminous Warrior’s clients include mostly young professionals and college students.
A typical class at Luminous Warrior includes a warm-up, combative-style punching and kicking techniques, and drills to practice the techniques such as headlocks in a co-ed class and breathing exercises.
Salam said that she wishes to empower her clients and help them believe that they can defend themselves in any situation.
“Kickboxing is more about a workout. [Self-defense] is more about confrontation and if you can knock [your opponent] out,” Salam said. “Choosing to fight is an option. Self-defense gives you that option.”
Salam also believes that college students can benefit from her classes.
“Many college students are out on their own for the very first time. Luminous Warrior … provides self-defense, safety and risk reduction training,” she said. “It also offers a community in which college students will be able to pursue their own paths, void of peer pressure or other people’s opinion.”
Encouraged by the success of Luminous Warrior, Salam hopes to expand her business and services in the future.
“I think big all the time. My goal is always to be a service. What we offer is a service enough to have a very large group and absolutely we will grow,” she said.

School of Nursing and Health Studies professor Laura Anderko will soon be working toward a cure forD.C.’s health care problems as part of a new position on the District’s Regional Health Equity Council.
Anderko was nominated by the Region III Health Equity Council for the National Partnerships for Action to End Health Disparities, an initiative of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Minority Health. She is set to begin her work this month with a focus on social justice in the health care field.
“It is an honor to be selected to participate in this innovative approach with the overall goal of achieving health equity nationally,” Anderko said. “My career has focused on the reduction of health disparities, from my early work in public health nursing to my current work in values-based health care.”
The project, which has created 10 geographical regions as foci for council members, seeks to align national, regional, state and local efforts to reduce health disparities through the support of a network of partnerships. Each regional council will seek to equalize access to health care within its respective region.
Specifically, Anderko will help enhance the D.C. region’s response by developing the Regional Blueprints for Action and working with members of the public, nonprofit and private sectors.
“It will provide me with an opportunity not only to apply knowledge from previous practice and research experiences into working with the poor, underserved and disenfranchised populations, but to apply the values of NHS into policy and social action initiatives that will benefit these populations,” Anderko said.
In the NHS, she has conducted research on providing health care to impoverished populations. She said that she hopes to utilize her knowledge of the field to further develop the work of the Region III Health Equity Council.
“My experiences in public health, building community partnerships and the study of how social and environmental determinants of health can influence disparities will be instrumental in my work to develop Regional Blueprints for Action,” she said.

A new push by the Georgetown University Student Association aims to smooth communication and misunderstandings between the administration and students.
The Student Advocacy Office, an initiative headed by co-directors James Pickens (COL ’12) and Ace Factor (COL ’12), will offer free, confidential advice to students on a variety of issues related to student conduct, while also helping students who are in touch with the university because of Code of Student Conduct violations, honor code changes and other matters that affect campus life.
“Meeting with hall directors and administrators can be inherently intimidating and the dense code of conduct can be confusing,” Factor said. “SAO offers confidential advice in the hopes of providing students with foundational confidence heading into a serious, punitive meeting.”
GUSA plans to send an email to undergraduates later in the week advertising the opportunity to become a trained representative of the Student Advocacy Office.
Factor and Pickens, who are both members of the GUSA Executive Cabinet, have worked seriously on the program over the summer and expressed optimism regarding the application responses and pool.
“Really, we are looking for applicants with a real passion for student rights,” Pickens said. “The ideal applicant is the student who is excited about working with others in order to make things at Georgetown better.”
SAO advisers will be responsible for holding office hours in the GUSA office for two hours per week.
“The advisory process is a highly individualized process,” Factor said. “Each SAO advisor undergoes an in-depth training regimen, because each will have such a high degree of responsibility. In many cases, we’re dealing with students’ disciplinary futures. Our goal is to give good advice in good faith.”
Factor and Pickens agreed that since the program is so new, they will be forced to advise using hypothetical answers and general rules as opposed to past, empirical evidence. Factor explained, however, that the program has been working closely with hall directors and administrators, specifically Director of Student Conduct Judy Johnson, in an effort to outline circumstances that may arise this semester.
They have also met extensively with members of American University, which has a similar, very effective program.
Factor and Pickens emphasized the important role the program will play as a buffer between the administration and the student.
“Our role is to help students and the administration here at Georgetown collaborate to find appropriate, expedient solutions to the problems that may arise throughout the semester,” Factor said. “A larger breadth of information can only improve our disciplinary process.”
