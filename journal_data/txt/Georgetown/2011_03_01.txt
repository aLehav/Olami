When at a business mixer, where should you stick your name tag? Is it appropriate to have an alcoholic beverage during a job interview in a restaurant if you’re over 21? Is it all right to introduce yourself in a professional environment with only your first name?
Students from Georgetown’s professional foreign service sorority Delta Phi Epsilon received the answers to these questions — on your right side, probably not and never — and more at an etiquette and protocol training session by hospitality consultant Alexandra Kovach Sunday afternoon.
Kovach, a former Georgetown program manager who ran the Baker Scholars Program, heads Alexandra & Company, LLC, a company that offers event planning and hospitality consulting services.
Kovach’s lecture was the first of several events and speakers DPE has lined up for the semester.
Her presentation “How to Hold a Fork,” focused on proper etiquette in professional settings. Kovak offered DPE sisters a range of advice on how to conduct themselves to make a favorable impression on potential employers or future business associates.
“More and more now, job interviews are happening at the dinner table or they’re taking you out to lunch. And I can promise you that if you have the most fabulous resume, you’re extremely well educated, top of your class and you drink out of the guy’s water glass, you’re not going to get the job,” Kovach said.
DPE Vice President Wendy Wang (MSB ’11) said that while some might consider the information presented common sense, it is important for students looking to become professionals to educate themselves on etiquette specific to their fields.
“I spent one summer interning in China, and even though my parents are Chinese, I didn’t know how to behave in a professional environment,” Wang said.
Professional Chair of DPE Dena Sholk (SFS ’13) said she found the lecture particularly relevant to Georgetown students trying to secure a spot in today’s highly competitive job market.
“All of us do internships, we’re all very good students, we’re all very motivated and accomplished in our own fields, and I think there’s very much that [question of] how do you market yourself and how do you work on little things like etiquette that you don’t think of but that are actually incredibly important,” Sholk said.
Sholk said that she thought the lecture provided DPE members with important insights that they could apply to many professional situations, whether at an event on campus or while pursing career opportunities abroad.
“People, let’s be honest, they judge you,” she said. “You’re making a first impression, and knowing these things [makes a difference]. I think everyone got a lot out of it today.”

The Student Activities Commission voted Monday to make several changes to its constitution and funding guidelines, including plans for a town hall, which met the demands of an open letter signed by 46 student leaders last week.
The commission also voted to alter their allocation procedures so that this semester’s process can stay on schedule, allowing campus groups to book spaces as planned. Under the new system, SAC will draw on its reserves to dole out funds before their budget request is officially approved by the Georgetown University Student Association Senate.
The meeting was held amid a push by club leaders for changes to SAC’s budget allocation process. After the commission revised its funding guidelines on Feb. 20 without soliciting formal feedback from student organizations, the International Relations Club — a SAC-funded group — spearheaded an effort demanding an opportunity for student input.
“I think it’s a good first step,” SAC Commissioner Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13) said.
At the meeting, SAC first made several changes to their constitution. They voted to appoint a secretary, who will be responsible for taking and posting minutes of SAC meetings. They also approved an appeals process for student groups to challenge allocation decisions.
They further voted to approve an amendment that will allow for future revisions to the funding guidelines during the fiscal year, when called for by the SAC commissioners. Previously, funding guidelines were binding for the year once approved.
The constitutional amendments must now be approved by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson. Despite Olson’s pending approval, the group went on to revise their funding guidelines — a process allowed by the amendments.
Because the GUSA budget will not officially be passed until after spring break, SAC commissioners expressed concern that the allocation would take place too late after the start of the campus space reservation process, set to begin today. Space concerns were a major reason that SAC set an early deadline for student groups to send in their plans for next semester.
“The truth of the matter is that we have to do whatever is necessary for our groups,” SAC Commissioner Carlos DelaTorre (COL ’13) said during the meeting.
After debate, commissioners voted to pass a resolution that would allow SAC to spend its reserve funds in an attempt to keep the allocation process on schedule. Under the revised system, SAC will use the budget that GUSA’s Finance and Appropriations Committee will pass on March 15 as an estimate to determine allocations. They will then use the funds actually allocated by GUSA when the senate passes the budget to replenish their reserves.
Although many commissioners said they were concerned about the risk and uncertainty involved in pre-budgeting the funds, a desire to avoid delays in the allocation process won out in the end.
“I think this is what the reserve is there for,” SAC Commissioner Amanda Lanzillo (SFS ’13) said.
The proposal will allow groups to begin booking spaces during the third week of March.
The town hall that the signatories of last week’s open letter called for is scheduled for 8 p.m. on March 29. Commissioners did not determine whether or not the funding guidelines would be put to a vote at the town hall, which the letter also called for.
Eitan Paul (SFS ’12), chair of IRC and principal organizer of the student movement, said that while the changes were a great first step, he thinks SAC still has more work to do.
“It’s great that they’ve made some strides, but unfortunately I think it’s too little, too late.”
For example, Paul said he was dissatisfied with the provision for an appeals process. The process SAC approved would allow clubs to resubmit their funding applications to the commission. Paul said that he had hoped that the commission would establish an appeals process through a different organization, such as the Center for Student Programs.
He also said that while he was glad SAC decided to hold a town hall meeting, he still thinks it is important for the guidelines to be put to a vote among campus clubs.
“We still don’t really have any guarantee that they would take into account feedback. The commissioners could still choose to ignore club advice.”
Chen, however, said that she wants to continue working with students to improve the funding process in the future.
“I hope that in the future we won’t need an open letter to get done things that should have been done in the first place,” she said.

The Department of Education hosted the first ever Voices in Action: National Youth Summit on Saturday to discuss how to make U.S. college graduation levels the highest in the world by 2020.
The summit gave high school and middle school students from around the country the chance to engage in discussion and listen to leaders in U.S. education.
Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who gave the keynote address, said that the White House believes that improving post-secondary school graduation rates and increasing the percentage of Americans with degrees are vital to the country’s future economic success.
“[Today’s young Americans] are competing for jobs with people from India, China, South Korea, Finland,” Duncan said.  “The President believes the countries out-educating us today will out-compete us tomorrow.”
Duncan and other government officials offered up solutions to potential obstacles facing this goal.
One concern revealed in surveys collected during the National Youth Listening Tour in 2010 was the affordability of higher education.
Low-income families who participated in this Education Department initiative expressed frustration with the steady rise of college tuition fees across the nation, according to a video summary of the results shown at the opening of the summit.
In the past decade, many universities, both public and private, have had to increase the price of tuition to deal with inflation and to increase the quality of their programs.
Georgetown’s tuition rate rose by 3 percent from 2010 to 2011 and will increase again by 2.9 percent from 2011 to 2012, according to a Feb. 11 press release. The total cost for two semesters of an undergraduate education, complete with room and board, will reach $53, 910.
Duncan said that students who cannot pay the tuition at traditional four-year universities do have other options. Students might pursue less expensive degrees at three-year programs, community colleges or trade schools.
“I can’t tell you how critically important it is that you make sure we are invested in education, because education is not an expense — it is an investment,” Duncan said.
Other speakers at the event said that to reach the president’s goal, college education and skills advancement must become popular among the nation’s youth.
Kalpen Modi, a well-known actor and the White House liaison to Young Americans, the Arts and Asian American and Pacific Islander Communities, said that today’s students have the power to improve the U.S.’s current educational ranking.
“With the Democrats and Republicans [in Congress and the government] going back and forth, it is easy to forget how young people can change things,” he said.
Modi and Kaya Henderson, interim chancellor of D.C. public schools, both told young people to be unafraid to express their ideas to government leaders and to enact change themselves.
“You know who the best teachers are. You know what curriculum is meeting your needs and getting you ready for the world of college and careers,” Henderson said to the summit. “Demand that from [the government and educators].”

The newly elected Georgetown University Student Association executives Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) outlined their goals for the upcoming year at Saturday’s Senate meeting, ushering in a new era in student government.
According to Meaney, funding reform and student space are the two biggest issues that the pair plans to tackle.
“I really hope that we continue to improve upon the funding reform from the last two years and make sure that is allocated efficiently and that more students have access to it.
I think student space is a big concern that we are going to working actively on. There are already a lot of good things in progress that we hope to continue,” Meaney said.
At their swearing-in ceremony, the duo spoke with enthusiasm about their new responsibilities and their hopes for the coming year.
“Greg and I are excited to hit the ground running.  Part of the reason why we ran is that we have the appropriate amount of experience on the inside and outside of GUSA,” Meaney said in an interview with The Hoya.
“It still hasn’t fully set in, but I am incredibly humbled that Mike and I have this opportunity to work on behalf of the students, and I’m confident that we won’t let them down and we’ll be their largest advocates, and fight the hardest on their behalf,” Laverriere said.
Former GUSA Vice President Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) was in attendance and expressed his enthusiasm for the new candidates. He and former President Calen Angert (MSB ’11) formally endorsed the pair in a viewpoint published on The Hoya’s website last week.
“I’m really excited about Mike and Greg, and I think they will be able to do a lot for the students,” Kluger said.
Kluger also stated he trusts Meaney and Laverriere to continue his and Angert’s legacy.
“I think GUSA still needs a lot of work for the inside, and I think it needs to keep moving in the direction where it is a credible organization where others can look at it, trust it and support it as it continues to try to make changes to help the student body,” Kluger said.
Other members of the Senate also expressed their support for the new executive team.
“Mike and Greg fundamentally deserve to win with their experience and years that they put in,” Steven Taft (SFS ’13), a member of the Meaney-Laverriere campaign, said.
“I think this is a great step for the future for GUSA.  I’m so excited to be working with Mike and Greg, and I’m looking forward to doing great things in the future,” Senate speaker Adam Mortillaro (COL ’12) said.
The GUSA Senate elected Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), the senator for Reynolds Hall, as the new chair of the Finance and Appropriations Committee, a position formerly occupied by Laverriere. Matt Morris (SFS ’14) also joined the committee in order to fill Laverriere’s vacant seat.

Members of the university chapter of STAND, an anti-genocide coalition, are hoping to spark a groundswell of campus support for the Libyan uprising.
Though STAND was founded to protest genocide in Darfur, the Georgetown chapter has now diverted its attention to the violent unrest sweeping through Libya in protest of longtime leader Moammar el-Qaddafi.
“Raising awareness is the first thing that needs to happen,” club member Sarah Marie Ryan (COL ’11) said. “Before you can do the advocacy, you need to increase awareness.”
The group had planned to have a protest in Red Square on Monday, but the inclement weather forced a change in location to the Leavey Center. The group is enlisting students to sign a petition, sponsored by its parent organization the Genocide Intervention Network, to Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The petition asks Rice to support a no-fly zone over Libya, preventing possible air strikes on protesters.
Additionally, a coalition of students from Georgetown, The George Washington, American and Catholic Universities participated in a joint rally outside the U.S. State Department on Friday.
Daniel Solomon (SFS ’13), national advocacy coordinator for STAND and one of the organizers of the protest, said he hoped it made the campaign more visible.
“We are trying to augment the behind-the-scenes campaigning,” Solomon said. “We want to put a public face on the grassroots effort.”
Ryan and Bridget O’Loughlin (SFS ’11) agreed that STAND was emboldened by the actions taken by the United States and U.N. Security Council over the weekend.
“I’ve been impressed with the speed and the unity of the international community and the U.N.” O’Loughlin said.
The U.N. Security Council issued economic sanctions against the Libyan government at its meeting Saturday.  Its member states also agreed to investigate possible human rights violations and war crimes committed by the Libyan government during the popular protests.
“I feel like something will happen sooner rather than later, because now we have the entire international community against [Qaddafi],” Ryan said.
Libya is one of a group of nations in the Middle East — including Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain, Algeria, Iraq and Yemen — that have experienced political upheaval in recent weeks.
In early February, protests opposing Qaddafi’s autocratic rule emerged in the country’s coastal city of Benghazi and quickly spread to other urban centers and the capital city of Tripoli.
Qaddafi’s refusal to step down from the seat of power has spurred violence between government forces and the demonstrators.
Qaddafi has been a hot button issue at Georgetown in the past.  In 2009, the controversial leader addressed students in a live video speech sponsored by the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies. The invitation to speak was marked by the protest from a former World Bank official who argued that the lecture legitimized Qaddafi’s past abuses of power. In addition, families of the victims of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 asked that the event be cancelled.  Ultimately, the event continued as planned without major disruption.

Copley Hall will be the latest dorm on campus to receive wireless Internet access when University Information Services activates the new services on March 11.
According to an email sent to residents by Associate Director of UIS Donna DeLay, Internet services in Copley Hall will experience occasional outages between the hours of 6 a.m. and 5 p.m on that day. The installations will affect all internet access, including computers available in the building’s computer labs.
Contractors will continue to work throughout the building while students are on spring break, DeLay said in the email.
Residents are thrilled that they would no longer need to rely on Ethernet cords to access the internet from their rooms.
“I’m really, really excited. I didn’t think [wireless Internet in all Georgetown dormitories] would happen in my time as a Georgetown student,” Copley resident Catherine Mullarney (COL ’13) said. “The idea of having no Internet access as a student is daunting, and the cords are just really frustrating to deal with, so not having to worry about them is awesome.”
UIS plans to install wireless internet service in all of Georgetown’s residential facilities by the end of the academic year. DeLay confirmed that UIS is on track to meet the goal set by University President John J. DeGioia in a Sept. 1 interview with The Hoya.
AirHoya, the wireless network that Georgetown students can access on campus, now provides full or partial wireless coverage for all academic buildings on campus as well as certain residential buildings — including parts of New South and the Southwest Quad. Students still use Ethernet cords in most dormitories.
Copley residents are pleased that their dormitories will be the next recipients of wireless internet access.
“I just saw the email and I posted it on my Facebook,” Mary Lim (SFS ’13) said. “I think [the wireless installation] is a sign that student affairs are listening to what students want, and I understand that Copley is an older building, but you hear about other schools already having wireless, so it’s nice to see progress being made.”

Student group requests for funding at GUSA’s annual Budget Summit on Sunday totaled $1.6 million, a figure double the amount the student association has on hand to allocate for the upcoming year.
Representatives from more than 30 student organizations, up from 10 last year, submitted requests at the summit, which drew greater numbers following last year’s Student Activities Fee and Endowment reform. The funding shake-up, passed in November, enacted an increase in the Student Activities Fee from $100 to $150 over two years and boosted the amount of funding available to student groups.
Most of the five advisory boards requested double to triple as much as last year, with the Performing Arts Advisory Council asking for six times last year’s request. Many clubs and organizations that had not approached the Georgetown University Student Association last year also made their voices heard at the summit.
“Although we received $1.6 million in funding requests and only have $800,000 to allocate this year, it’s clear that student organizations got the message of SAFE reform,” said Colton Malkerson (COL ’13), the newly elected chair of GUSA’s Finance and Appropriations Committee.
“Although more money was asked for than we have to give, we will still be able to substantially increase funding for the advisory boards while funding new initiatives important to students previously out of reach,” Malkerson said.
Clubs are hoping to cash in on the possible funding jump by sponsoring events they have not been able to in the past. The Senior Class Committee, represented by Chair Andrew Malzberg (COL ’11), requested $22,000 in order to fund a Homecoming tailgate and Traditions Day.
According to Malzberg, funding the tailgate would bring the price down from $15 to $10.
“This just makes the tailgate more accessible to students,” he said.
The current student activities budget is more than double the amount it was last  academic year, which saw about $360,000 allocated to student activities. This amount was enough to meet about 84 percent of the requests submitted by 10 student organizations and the advisory boards last year.
The Fin/App Committee will issue a draft budget this week, a document that will be open to comment by clubs and the public. The GUSA Senate will then ratify the finalized budget after spring break.
This year, the Student Activities Commission requested $125,500 from GUSA, up from the $37,000 it requested last year. Last cycle, SAC received $25,000.
According to SAC Chair Andrew Koenig (COL ’12), the amount SAC requested at the Budget Summit along with the commission’s other sources of revenue would be enough to cover the $1.6 million requested by student organizations.
“The amount requested at the Budget Summit was calculated with the goal of being able to have the resources to fund 100 percent of what is stipulated in the SAC funding guidelines for the coming academic year,” Koenig said.
Despite SAFE reform’s wider reach, Fin/App Committee members said they will not be able to fully fund every club’s request, however.
“It’s important to remember that SAFE reform was designed to be implemented gradually with $200,000 more available for next year. This ensures that the advisory boards aren’t overwhelmed with new money this year and that there’s time to adjust,” Malkerson said.
Malkerson predicted that GUSA would be able to allocate about $1 million for the 2012-2013 academic year.
One organization not requesting more funding was GUSA itself. The newly appointed GUSA executive pair requested $28,000 — the same amount of funding allocated to GUSA last year.

University President John J. DeGioia announced Monday that Timothy Barbari, the dean of the graduate school of arts and sciences since August 2006, will not carry out a second term in his position. Barbari’s current term will conclude at the end of this semester.
Gerald Mara will serve as dean of the graduate school for a two-year term after Barbari steps down in May. Prior to his appointment, Mara served as an associate dean in the graduate school of arts and sciences. Mara also has already served as interim dean once before, after former Dean David Lightfoot left the position for a leadership role at the National Science Foundation.
DeGioia and the Office of the Provost will embark on a formal search for a long-term successor for Barbari during Mara’s term,
DeGioia said that he was thankful for the dedication and leadership Barbari displayed during his tenure as dean.
“I am truly grateful for Dean Barbari’s service to the Graduate School and our entire community,” he said in an email to the university community. “I look forward to being together with many of you in the months ahead as we find ways to celebrate and thank him for his many contributions to Georgetown.”
During his term as dean, Barbari oversaw the creation of nine new graduate programs, including the doctorate in computer science, the doctorate in global infectious disease and the master’s in global history. Barbari also worked with Vice President of Student Affairs Todd Olson to establish a working group dedicated to improving graduate student life at Georgetown. He was also highly involved in the planning of the new Science Center.
Barbari, also an associate provost for research for the university, will continue to hold his position as a tenured faculty member.
Prior to accepting the position at Georgetown, Barbari worked as director of the National Science Foundation REU site and a professor in the department of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the University of Maryland at College Park. He also served as a professor in the department of chemical engineering and associate dean for academic affairs at Johns Hopkins University.

After a four-year hiatus, Harvard University and Princeton University reinstated an early action admissions option Thursday. Both schools’ early action applications are non-binding but require that students apply early to only one school.
The switch back was made largely due to growing demand among students and their parents for more security earlier in the admissions process, Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust said in the Harvard Gazette. She said that single-option early programs allow students who are committed to attending a specific university eliminate some of the stress that comes with applying to college.
Both schools eliminated their early admissions programs in 2007 due to concerns that it complicated the admissions process and put some students at a disadvantage, particularly if they were from underprivileged areas that might be less prepared for the early deadline, according to the Harvard Gazette and Princeton’s website.
The early action application allows students to weigh financial aid options before committing to a school because they can apply to other schools during the regular admissions period.
Both Harvard and Princeton said on their websites that they are committed to admitting a diverse pool of students.
Georgetown offers a similar early admissions program, giving prospective students the option of hearing an admissions decision in the fall without having to commit until the regular May 1 deadline. Unlike that of Harvard and Princeton, it is not a single-choice option, allowing students to submit multiple early applications.
When Harvard and Princeton dropped their early admissions option they hoped other universities would do the same, moving to a single admissions process, but only the University of Virginia followed their lead, then reversed its choice last year, according to the Princeton website.
Georgetown’s early admissions option has remained the same for decades.
“Our policy has been unchanged for more than 20 years and we have no intention of changing just because those around us continue to do so,” Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said.

An all-star panel of D.C. media elite dissected the pace and direction of news and media in front of a group of about 40 students last night in Copley Formal Lounge.
As the political field evolves, so do the news and media industries according to first-hand accounts from panelists including Politico’s chief White House correspondent Mike Allen, FOX News chief Washington correspondent Jim Angle, recent Director of Communications at the Democratic National Committee Karen Finney and former Deputy Assistant to President George W. Bush for Communications Scott Sforza.
Students pursuing a Masters of Professional Studies in Journalism, and visiting students from the Semester in Washington Program also attended the event moderated by Professor Bradley A. Blakeman, who served as Deputy Assistant to the President for Appointments and Scheduling, Vetting and Research, Correspondence and Surrogate Scheduling under President George W. Bush.
All four commentators agreed that the new role of journalism is to interpret news, rather than tell it. The conversation, according to them, is not about the role of politics in journalism anymore, but about the role of journalism in politics.
“The White House communications staff are now the content creators,” Allen said. “Now the president announces something, one side will do a ‘pre-bundle’ to it, the other side will respond, and all of this will be available to you in real time. The morning paper is almost a drama critic ruling who’s won in this great tussle.”
Allen and Sforza, who worked as an insider in the White House communications department, both spoke about the number of innovations put in place after the conclusion of the Obama campaign to control
would see the president first, but now those outlets have been shut down in deference to White House television. According to the pair, the forced yield to White House-controlled information through press releases and the White House’s own news website has changed the pace and style of political journalism.
The panelists recalled the Reagan years, when the nightly news on the three big networks — ABC, NBC and CBS — would constitute a person’s daily dose of news.
Now, there are hundreds of networks, with five national ones in the official White House press corps. Each has as equal access to the latest news as does any citizen who utilizes the White House produced media.
“Not only is there video and audio, but viewers can click on just what the president said about jobs or about the war,” said Allen. “People can drag that and routinely make news on their Twitter feed.”
The panelists agreed that everybody is trying to find the craftiest ways to get audiences to come to them.
“The key is to find a unique way to get your message out,” said Sforza. “That’s going to take outside-of-the-box, creative thinking.”
Panelists also touched on how to cover controversial topics without misconstruing facts, while still serving as public informers.
“We really act as aggregators of news,” said Finney, one of D.C.’s leading democratic strategists. “The real power of the next generation is that you decide what is news. You don’t have to read the front page if there isn’t something that you’re interested — you can go online and read what you want to know about. The news organizations don’t decide your news for you anymore.”
Each panelist seemed enraptured by the power of electronic media to determine popularity, but even more so by the effect it could play on the 2012 election. Every panelist was eager to see how candidates will try to penetrate social networking and figure out who can top the other online.
The panelists predicted that this campaign season will feature the traditional slipups, but they will be watching intently to see how politicians, news organizations and voters deal with this new technology.
“The Obama camp was rightly credited of being at the forefront of using technology — they were at the cutting edge — and they didn’t tweet,” Allen said. “The pace of change is not slow, so that tells you by [the] next campaign, there is going to be some new media we can’t even imagine.”
With the speed of communication comes an even greater obligation for accuracy. The panelists reiterated that once a piece of news has gone out, it is out there and tends to spread quickly through the digital world.
But Allen pointed out at least one element of political reporting has stayed the same:
“Half of news is what’s happening — what they’re saying — and the other half is peeling back the curtain to what it means and what it can do for the public.”

The nonprofit world took center stage at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute’s annual public policy conference for academics, policymakers and public policy students on Capitol Hill on Friday.
GPPI Dean Edward Montgomery said in his introductory remarks that nonprofits — or “The Third Sector,” this year’s theme — comprise a rapidly growing segment of the economy.
“As many as 10 percent are employed by nonprofits. That’s about 13 million people, and half of those work in health care and social systems,” Montgomery said.
He also said nonprofits are “vital allies in restoring damaged economies.”
Sophie Delaunay, executive director of the U.S. sector of Doctors Without Borders, gave the conference’s keynote address.
Speaking about Doctors Without Borders and her work, Delaunay emphasized the importance of the organization’s neutrality.
“We avoid funding from governments that are actively involved in conflicts,” she said, which includes the United States.
A Q-and-A session followed the address. Audience members asked Delaunay about the accountability of the organization, and how it maintains a bird’s-eye view on the possible negative effects of its actions.
She said that Doctors Without Borders is constantly scrutinizing its actions and has adopted evaluation techniques to collect data and observe the effects of its programs.
“[Doctors Without Borders is] an essential component of society that has to adapt to a developing environment,” Delaunay said.
The conference was held in the Rayburn House Office Building. A lunch was served and several panels were hosted throughout the day, covering topics including social entrepreneurship, nonprofit organizations and collaboration.
