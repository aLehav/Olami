Germany will have to decide its future after elections that will replace former Chancellor Angela Merkel, a panelist said in a Sept. 29 event. 
The event, titled “Roundtable on the German Elections — Looking Forward, Looking Back,” focused on the record youth turnout that powered Germany’s most diverse election results to date and the future implications of the outcome of the vote. The event was hosted by the BMW Center for German and European Studies (CGES), a School of Foreign Service (SFS) center for the study of European affairs and the transatlantic relationship in the United States.
On Sept. 26, Germany held its federal elections to choose the 20th German parliament. The Social Democrats (SPD) won the most parliamentary seats with 206 elected officials, followed by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Greens. The new chancellor who will replace Merkel, a member of the CDU, will be announced after the new parliament meets and votes.   
When Merkel chose not to run for office, her decision resulted in a paradigm shift in which new voters could imagine a different chancellor, according to panelist Joyce Mushaben, an expert in European Union (EU) citizenship and migration policies, women’s leadership and welfare state reforms.
“This is the first time in 16 years that there was no Merkel running for office, so for young voters, for anyone under the age of 20, they only knew Angela Merkel as chancellor,” Mushaben said at the event. “They did not know somebody else could be a chancellor, much less a man becoming a chancellor.”  
The youth vote was particularly influential in this election, with the Free Democratic Party (FDP), who prioritize free market economic principles, and the Greens, who are environmentalists, gaining the most support and votes from young people voting for the first time.
According to Eric Langenbacher, who specializes in German and European memory politics, it was surprising that the German youth voters aligned with the FDP over the Greens, as the youth tend to care more about climate change and environmental issues than older individuals.  
“The younger cohorts, they prefer the liberals — the FDP — slightly more than they did the Greens,” Langenbacher said at the event. “I guess what I would say is that although climate issues are very important, younger Germans are also pragmatists.” 
The election featured the country’s most diverse field of candidates running ever, reflective of Germany’s demographic makeup, according to Mushaben. 
“We have the highest number since the foundation of the federal republic of candidates under the age of 35 running for the Bundestag, and an unprecedented number of women candidates as ‘Spitzenkandidaten,’ or lead candidates,” Mushaben said.
According to Mushaben, Merkel left a legacy as a leader who established Germany’s role as a key player in European politics.
“I think Merkel’s really gonna be missed at the European level, and I think that’s the most important point because, when you talk to Germans, they don’t quite understand what we’re saying,” Mushaben said. “I said that Merkel had moved Germany from the regional stage onto the global stage.” 
Regardless of who ultimately becomes the new chancellor, they will inherit some of Merkel’s energy decisions, including Nord Stream 2, which is a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany running under the Baltic Sea, according to Jeff Anderson, an expert on on European integration, transatlantic relations, global cities and postindustrial reconstruction.   
“I don’t think, however, there will be a reversal on Nord Stream 2,” Anderson said at the event. “I think that is a done deal not just because of what’s been already accomplished on that project in Germany but also because of the U.S. position now, which is basically to let it go forward.”
According to Mushaben, Europeans have high expectations for the new German chancellor, as Merkel served as a steady force on a German, European and global level.
“I think the world is going to miss her as that balancing force,” Mushaben said.

Since Sept. 16, four break-ins to campus buildings have occurred, according to student testimony, university confirmation and police logs, prompting student security concerns. 
Students initially voiced concerns this semester after an intruder with a pocketknife entered New South Hall in the early hours of Sept. 19. After the event, many students and organizations called on the university to improve communication. After the Sept. 19 incident, the university said there was no active safety threat to students.
However, between Sept. 16 and Oct. 8, three separate intrusions occured on campus, according to both police logs and student accounts of the incidents. On Sept. 16, an intruder entered Reynolds Hall, sat down in a first-floor common room and interacted with students. Almost three weeks later, an unknown person entered a classroom in Healy Hall and interrupted a lecture. Four days later, an intruder entered Kennedy and McCarthy Halls and walked around the dormitories.
The university only informed students living in affected dorms after the intrusions in New South and Kennedy, according to emails obtained by The Hoya.
Further, the university never alerted the student body at large, leaving many students confused about the details of the break-ins and concerned about campus safety.
The Intrusions
Around 8 p.m. on Sept. 16, an unknown person entered Reynolds Hall and made their way to a first-floor common room. Once in the common room, the individual began interacting with students who were studying, including Erin Powers (SFS ’24). 
“We were just sitting there doing homework and this guy walked in and he asked where the bathroom was and we told him,” Powers said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “He came back, and then he sat down and took off his shirt and sprayed cologne on himself. And then he put his shirt back on, and then we left after that because it was creepy.” 
The group of students did not contact the Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD), according to Powers. However, GUPD has said it learned about the incident and identified a suspect. 
After an investigation, GUPD added the incident to the September daily crime log, classifying the individual as an unlawful intruder. GUPD added the incident to the crime log Sept. 17, according to a university spokesperson. However, the log lists the incident as happening on Sept. 17.
Around 12:30 p.m on Oct. 4. during an “Intro to Economic and Political Development” lecture, an unknown person entered a classroom in Healy Hall and began disrupting the lecture by talking over students in the class, according to multiple students in the course. The intruder sat down, and the professor requested that the intruder leave the classroom. However, the person stayed and continued to disrupt the lecture.
The university is not aware of the incident in Healy and there are no GUPD records related to the incident, according to a university spokesperson. There is additionally no record of the incident on the GUPD October crime log. However, a student in the class said that they submitted a report of the incident on GUPD’s website.
Four days later, at around 10:00 p.m., an unknown person reportedly gained access to Kennedy Hall. The individual entered the elevator as students were exiting, according to Powers, who was also present for the incident in Kennedy.
“We were going on the elevator from floor eight to the first floor, and then when it opened on the first floor, this guy — he just ran in before we could even get off. And then we ran out,” Powers said. 
After Powers exited the elevator, she encountered a crowd of students who had seen the intruder in the building. 
Eric Lipka (COL ’23), who was in the crowd of students and had previously seen the intruder enter Kennedy Hall, called GUPD to report the incident after speaking with Powers and other students in the lobby.
GUPD was first informed of a “suspicious person” on the fifth floor of Kennedy Hall at approximately 10:15 p.m., according to an Oct. 9 email from the Office of Residential Living sent to residents of the Southwest Quad complex obtained by The Hoya. GUPD located the suspect in McCarthy Hall, which is connected to Kennedy, and “took appropriate action” to remove the individual from campus, the email said.
A university spokesperson said the university is aware of the Kennedy incident, and there is a report of the intrusion in the GUPD October crime log.
In total, since Sept. 16, there have been four reported intrusions on Georgetown’s campus, an increase in the typical number of known events in a similar timeframe. Between Sept. 16 and Oct. 13, 2019, the last fall semester students were on campus, there were no reports of unlawful entry in the GUPD monthly crime logs.
A Lack of Communication
The university only sent communications to students living in affected dorms related to two intrusions on campus. The Office of Residential Living sent two emails to New South residents regarding the New South incident on Sept. 19 and Sept. 20. The university also emailed students in the Southwest Quad on both Oct. 9 and Oct. 13 regarding the Kennedy incident.
Residence halls are secured by a dual swipe entry system, where students are required to swipe their GOCards both to enter the building and to enter a specific floor. Students should be cautious of their surroundings to ensure non-university-affiliated individuals do not enter residence halls, according to a Sept. 20 email from the Office of Residential Living to students in New South obtained by The Hoya.
“We encourage all students to be aware of their surroundings when entering and exiting their residence hall, to avoid allowing individuals to enter without swiping their own GOCard and to check that doors fully close/lock upon entry and exit,” the email reads.
The university has not sent a HOYAlert, an emergency notification message sent to students, about an intrusion this academic year, according to several student sources. 
After both the New South incident and the Kennedy incident, the university announced in the Oct. 13 email to residents of the Southwest Quad that it would increase GUPD patrols in and around the student residence halls on campus. In response to the Kennedy incident, the university also announced plans to increase student guard presence in the Southwest Quad and New South, according to the Oct. 13 email.
Recent studies show that an increased GUPD presence is unlikely to deter crime, according to NPR. Additionally, many students have voiced concerns around GUPD’s police presence on campus, as university police officers have hyperpoliced students of color. 
GUPD also hung posters around campus residences as part of a public campaign encouraging students to be more aware of their surroundings, according to a university spokesperson.
In response to the student concerns and the national “defund the police” movement, a push spurred by the police murder of George Floyd to decrease police department budgets in cities across the United States, students in the Georgetown University Student Association launched the Georgetown University Police Department Abolition Working Group to abolish the police department’s presence on campus completely.
Students should continue reporting any incident to GUPD, according to a university spokesperson.
“We recognize incidents like these can be distressing to members of our community, and we urge students and all members of the Georgetown community to report issues of concern to GUPD,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Regardless of possible changes, the incidents have left many students, including Powers, with concerns about campus security. 
“It just makes me feel less safe,” Powers said.

Regional coordination and transparent communication are necessary biosafety procedures to successfully combat the COVID-19 pandemic, biosafety expert Sacha Wallace-Sankarsingh said at an Oct. 14 event.
The event, titled “Biosafety and Biosecurity: A Foundation for Regional Health Security in the Caribbean,” featured a discussion with Wallace-Sankarsingh, a biorisk manager at the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA), around biosafety and biosecurity practices to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Lisa Indar, director of CARPHA’s Surveillance, Disease Prevention and Control Division delivered opening remarks. The event was co-sponsored by Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security, the Global Health Initiative and the Elizabeth R. Griffin Program in honor of October being National Biosafety Month.
CARPHA is the sole integrated regional public health agency in the Caribbean, responsible for preventing disease and promoting health in the Caribbean through leadership, innovation and partnerships. Established in 2011 by Caribbean Community Member States, the organization currently serves 26 countries and is leading the region’s health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, CARPHA has hosted national training sessions on biosafety and virtual sessions for laboratory professionals, according to Wallace-Sankarsingh. The organization has also trained more than 1,500 law enforcement officers from 17 member states in the proper use of personal protective equipment.
“It was interesting for me to see the way we used to do our training sessions,” Wallace-Sankarsingh said at the event. “With the proper use of respirators, for instance, using personal protective equipment — these are things that were more or less in the lab and now it is mainstream as part of COVID-19 response across sectors.” 
CARPHA works with various nations and organizations on projects to increase and improve resources. CARPHA announced a donation from the Japan-CARICOM Friendship and Cooperation Fund in order to build up COVID-19 testing capacity earlier this month and launched a collaboration with the Public Health Agency of Canada to build infrastructure in response to the pandemic in April.
Organizations like CARPHA aid in bridging capacity gaps developing countries face because of global inequality, according to Wallace-Sankarsingh.
“You cannot speak about biosecurity and biosafety without addressing issues of equality, preparedness for health emergencies and the use of networks,” Wallace-Sankarsingh said. “It is because of networks that we are able to leverage resources and have that resilience among countries operating in highly strained environments.”
Training programs such as CARPHA’s create a ripple effect of knowledge and cultural priority; in 2018, CARPHA trained 17 experts in Belize, who took the information and spread it to nearly 60 people in their laboratories, according to Wallace-Sankarsingh.
“So that makes me excited that the knowledge sharing continues, that our participants don’t just keep it to themselves and of course that means that the culture of biosafety and biosecurity continues to grow,” Wallace-Sankarsingh said.
Policy makers need to prioritize biosafety and biosecurity in order to adequately address modern public health issues, according to Wallace-Sankarsingh.
“We need leadership. We need this to remain a priority with decision-makers,” Wallace-Sankarsingh said. “For me, the time is now because of the pandemic, and how all we were doing in the background with labs and biosecurity and biosafety has come to the forefront to show the importance of how quickly we have had to come up to speed with how to respond to these public health emergencies.”
Collaboration is the key to ensuring countries have the tools they need to tackle public health crises, according to Wallace-Sankarsingh.
“As a whole, there is a reliance on solidarity,” Wallace-Sankarsingh said. “Really in the Caribbean, we do embrace that term. No man is an island. In terms of promoting and advocating for health security at the regional level, if we don’t have the ability to leverage our resources, we would be in a much worse position during the pandemic.”

For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic closed their doors, the Georgetown University Art Galleries opened to the public Oct. 7 with new modern art exhibitions available for all students.
The Maria & Alberto de la Cruz Art Gallery and the Lucille M. & Richard F.X. Spagnuolo Art Gallery, located on Prospect Street NW in the Walsh Building, have been closed since March 12, 2020. As part of their reopening, the galleries are featuring new art exhibits from modern artists and hosting programming for students, such as the Oct. 14 “Cookies with the Curator” event, which introduced the new exhibits at the galleries.
Nationally renowned art is now fully accessible to students willing to venture only a few blocks off campus, according to GU Art Galleries Founding Director and Chief Curator Al Miner.
“Since all Georgetown students have been vaccinated, everyone with a GoCard is free to come without preregistration,” Miner said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Students don’t have to go to the Smithsonian to see Smithsonian-quality art.” 
Non-Georgetown visitors without a GoCard are required to preregister before visiting the exhibits, as well as show proof of vaccination, according to the GU Art Galleries website.
Attending the galleries in person will make viewing artwork much more impactful for students, according to student artist Amelia Myre (SFS ’25).
“The physical artwork is so moving in itself, and for students to be able to see that in person — not through a screen — is going to be crucial for them to see how academics and art come together in so many ways,” Myre said during an interview with The Hoya.
The de la Cruz Gallery’s exhibits are hosting works from artist Teresita Fernández, a MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant recipient and Guggenheim Fellow. Fernández’s exhibition, titled “Dark Earth,” will be open to the public until Dec. 12 and will explore historical and cultural perspectives through landscapes with natural phenomena.
Being able to feature Fernández’s works is an exciting aspect of the galleries’ reopening, according to GU Art Galleries intern Emma McMorran (GRD ’22).
“Fernández is a notable figure in contemporary art, and we are excited to share her work with the public after our closure,” McMorran wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In order to show students the significance of this art, the gallery will host a talk and panel discussion with Fernández starting Nov. 11, according to the GU Art Galleries website.
The Spagnuolo Gallery is displaying a new exhibition by Joseph Grigely, a deaf visual artist and Guggenheim Fellow. Grigely’s exhibit, titled “Songs, With and Without Words,” explores the role of language in daily life and will be on display until Dec. 12.
Grigely’s works portray photos of famous vocalists as they perform, using the noise of the scene to contrast his own silent experiences.
Before reopening in-person exhibits, GU Art Galleries held virtual events, including public discussions featuring artists and curators. Now that the galleries have reopened to the public, the art galleries plan to host more in-person events.
The new exhibits can provide a source of positivity for students during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to McMorran.
“We want to provide safe opportunities for students to engage with the arts,” McMorran wrote. “We hope that students from across campus, not just arts-related fields, will take advantage of these programs.”
Now that both galleries have reopened, Miner hopes more students will enjoy and engage with the artwork on display.
“I want students to realize that this is not an exclusionary space. It is your campus, your house, built for you,” Miner said. “The galleries can just be a more beautiful walk between classes or on the way to Car Barn.”

District Chicken and Gyro (DCG), a halal street food restaurant, has closed its Georgetown location following a leasing dispute between the restaurant’s owner and its landlord.
DCG was evicted Sept. 29 from its Dumbarton St. NW location after missing 18 months of rent payments, according to eviction notices posted on the restaurant’s window. While DCG will no longer operate from its former location, it is actively looking for a new storefront in the Georgetown area.
According to Tariq Saylab, owner of DCG, the eviction was motivated not by missed rent but by long-standing disagreements with the landlord.
“He saw the success that I had there, and he wants to open his own gyro spot, so he wouldn’t re-sign and I wouldn’t leave,” Saylab said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “He was trying to kick me out for two years, and we’ve been battling in court back and forth.”
Raul Silva, the landlord for the former DCG location, declined to comment when contacted by The Hoya.
DCG formally announced the closure of its Georgetown location through an Instagram story post last week, in which the company thanked its loyal customers and committed to finding a new Georgetown storefront within three months.
DCG will open a new Georgetown restaurant when a location becomes available, according to Saylab.
“I’m looking for a vacancy,” Saylab said. “Once a vacancy is open, I can get a spot immediately going back to Georgetown.”
In response to the news of the closure of the Georgetown location, some Georgetown students, like Kate Fundis (MSB ’22), who went to DCG every other week, have expressed disappointment that they will no longer be able to frequent DCG for a reliable food option with close proximity to campus.
“I loved how they always hit the mark; I knew I could count on a great, affordable meal just a short walk away,” Fundis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It was definitely my comfort meal in Georgetown.”
Saylab said the support from customers at the former Georgetown location was invaluable to DCG’s business, and he is hopeful that those relationships continue in the new location in Georgetown. 
“I couldn’t ask for better customers, and everyone was very supportive throughout my tenure in Georgetown,” Saylab said. “It was awesome, and I made a lot of good relationships with people.”
The previous location was a staple for Georgetown students because it was cheap and close to campus, according to Matthew Joy (NHS ’22), who frequented DCG four times per week when it was open.
“I also love how accessible DCG is to all Georgetown students both in terms of location and financially; the platters are $11 and for the amount of food you get it’s always worth it,” Joy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The hours are also great because they were open extremely late on weekends.” 
While Saylab is searching for a new location in Georgetown, he will open a storefront in Tysons Corner, Va., at the end of the month. The menu in Tysons Corner will be expanded to include increased food options not previously offered, and the restaurant will be larger than the Georgetown location, according to Saylab. 
While the closure of the Georgetown storefront is disappointing, Joy hopes the new Georgetown location will have more space to accommodate the restaurant’s typically high demand.
“I hope that the new location has more staff, kitchen space, and maybe even some dining space,” Joy wrote. “Throughout this year, I have noticed that DCG has gotten a lot more business, and the lines have been extremely long every time I’ve gone now which creates a long wait time.” 
In the meantime, customers are eager to support DCG wherever it is, according to Fundis.
“I was devastated to find out that DCG had closed and I didn’t even get to have a final meal there,” Fundis wrote. “I miss it and am excited to remain a loyal customer when they reopen.”

Georgetown University administrators addressed student concerns related to public health conditions on campus at an Oct. 13 forum. 
The virtual event featured Provost Robert Groves, Vice President and Chief Public Health Officer Ranit Mishori (MED ’02) and Vice Provost for Education Rohan Williamson. Panelists addressed student criticisms and questions concerning main campus public health conditions and protocols. 
Georgetown has been successful in controlling the spread of COVID-19 on campus so far, according to Mishori.
“The positivity rate has been low,” Mishori said at the event. “Thank you to everybody, every single one of you, for doing what we recommend and adhering to the policies so that we can get such a low number of positive cases.”
The combination of high vaccination rates, masking protocols, and newly renovated heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems is the reason for the low number of COVID-19 cases on campus, according to Mishori. 
All individuals, regardless of vaccination status, are required to wear a mask while inside campus buildings, except while eating, drinking or when inside private residences or offices. Georgetown is committed to COVID-19 safety procedures that match or exceed standards set by the Washington, D.C. Department of Health, according to Mishori. 
Students raised concerns about public health conditions on campus last month after more than 145 campus community members presented symptoms consistent with norovirus and 65 campus community members tested positive for influenza A. Norovirus is a highly transmissible virus that causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. While it can be transmitted from person to person, it can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces, food or water. 
While norovirus cases are typical on college campuses, last month’s spike in symptoms was cause for concern, according to Mishori. 
“We had a group of people and a spike, that’s what we call an outbreak, and we realized that there was something going on beyond the usual set of symptoms that present themselves on any college campus and any primary care clinic,” Mishori said. 
After reports of gastrointestinal illnesses on campus, students expressed concerns over the possible contamination of food at university dining services. The norovirus outbreak was not related to any contamination or salmonella and has not been linked to any food source on campus, including Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall, according to Mishori. 
“Our cases had nothing to do with salmonella. The D.C. Department of Public Health worked very closely with us. They did two inspections of Leo’s and other eating venues at the Leavey Center,” Mishori said. “I want you to know that there is zero evidence that Leo’s was the source of the infections.” 
Panelists also addressed student concerns about illness absence protocols and accessibility issues after a Sept. 30 email sent by Williamson to campus community members stated that professors are not required to provide virtual attendance options for classes and that students should not expect to make up class work asynchronously. 
While faculty must accommodate all COVID-19-related absences, they are allowed to do so in whatever manner they choose, according to Williamson. 
“Faculty have been asked to accommodate all COVID-related absences, which is consistent with the university public health guidelines. How they do so, though, is up to the discretion of the faculty member,” Williamson said at the event. “Faculty are not required to allow students to attend remotely via Zoom, given that we’re in in-person instructional mode.”
Williamson said students should report faculty who do not follow these protocols, and that they should contact their advising dean if they are absent for more than one class meeting.
“If you think a faculty member is using a punitive model for students who miss class, just let us know with a description of the model being used so we can clear and address that behavior,” Williamson said. 
Groves asked for patience during a difficult transition back to in-person operations. 
“What I ask for all of us is that we have patience with one another as we go through an uncertain world and that we act with kindness, as befits our institution,” Groves said at the event.

The Smithsonian’s National Zoo will not hold its usual Halloween and Christmas themed events this year.
The National Zoo will not hold its traditional Boo at the Zoo event for Halloween or holiday season ZooLights event because of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic safety concerns. Boo at The Zoo is a Halloween event during which kids dress up and visit candy stations around the National Zoo, while ZooLights is a holiday event in which the National Zoo is covered in lights while visitors shop and eat treats. 
The popular events are catered toward children, most of whom are not yet eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, which creates a public health risk, according Pamela Baker-Masson, associate director of communications for the National Zoo.
“You can appreciate that the primary audience for Halloween events are children not able to be vaccinated at this time,” Baker-Masson wrote in a statement to the DCist. “Our priority is still to do everything we can to keep visitors, staff, and animals safe.” 
Young children and their parents are not the only people who might be saddened by the cancellations, however. Georgetown students like Sam Litwin (COL ’22), who enjoys frequent trips to the National Zoo, are disappointed that the event will no longer take place.
Events like Boo at the Zoo and ZooLights provide students with an opportunity to take a break from homework and exams, according to Litwin.
“I think it would have been a good release from midterms and everything like that, so that’s a little bit unfortunate,” Litwin said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I was crushed when they said ZooLights were canceled, because every year I’ve been trying to organize my friends to go.” 
The cancellation of this year’s events marks the second year in a row in which they weren’t held in their traditional form. The National Zoo held a drive-through event for Boo at The Zoo in 2020, in which trick-or-treaters stayed in their cars as they travelled through decorated pathways and were met with a bag of candy at the end of the route. Last year’s ZooLights event consisted of a singular truck decorated with lights driving through local neighborhoods. 
Currently, the National Zoo requires entry passes and face coverings for all visitors. The zoo also enforces social distancing requirements and one-way lanes in certain locations of the zoo to prevent crowding. Despite the safety requirements, the National Zoo still made the decision to cancel both Boo at the Zoo and ZooLights.
According to Litwin, the COVID-19 precautions made visiting the zoo seem safe.  
“I went to the zoo last June, and it felt very safe,” Litwin said. “They were really good about keeping everyone in their time limit and you could only go if you had a ticket, so I think a similar thing could have been adopted for Boo at the Zoo or ZooLights, just because it’s outdoors.”
The decision to cancel the events also comes after the National Zoo struggled with a COVID-19 outbreak among some of its animals. Nine lions and tigers tested positive in September after displaying symptoms of the virus. Eight of the nine animals have made a full recovery, but one lion has continued to test positive. There is no evidence that animals play a significant role in the spread of COVID-19 to humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It is understandable that National Zoo made the decision to cancel the two holiday events given the recent COVID-19 outbreaks among the animals, but a backup plan could have been put in place instead, according to Litwin. 
“I understand the public health implications,” Litwin said. “I do wish there were modifications as opposed to it being cancelled.” 
While the cancellation of this year’s festivities may be disappointing to visitors, the National Zoo remains hopeful its popular events will return to normal in the future, according to Baker-Masson.
“We all feel hopeful that 2022 will bring new opportunities,” Baker-Masson wrote.

The John and Pat Figge Fellowship Program, which includes seven undergraduates conducting intersectional research, launched this year’s program Oct. 1.
The fellowship allows a select group of students to research topics at the intersection of religious, social, cultural and historical issues. The new cohort of fellows selected in August will work for the next seven months to develop in-depth individual research projects culminating in 30-page final papers, according to Fr. David Collins, S.J., co-leader of the program. The fellowship began under the former Woodstock Theological Center in 2009 and currently operates under the Georgetown University Catholic Studies Program.
This year’s cohort was selected from a record number of applicants because of the passion reflected in their proposed project ideas, as well as their sophistication and interest in engaging in theological reflection, according to Collins. 
“They seemed to already have a stronger than usual sense of why theological reflection would be important,” Collins said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The fellowship presents a unique opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research that is not typically available for first- and second-year students, according to fellowship participant Juan Pablo Espinosa (COL ’24).
“It’s really about pursuing original independent research. That’s one of the things I’ve been wanting to do since I got to Georgetown,” Espinosa said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Having a separate fellowship that doesn’t have to do with your major helps provide you with leeway to actually connect and bring your majors to that research, rather than something that’s deeply connected to your GPA or major requirements.”
The program operated via Zoom last year, resulting in fewer applicants and challenges for fellows in connecting with faculty mentors, according to Collins. Among other things, the return to an in-person format will allow the group to attend a retreat later this academic year, Collins said. 
“We go on a workshop retreat off campus before spring break,” Collins said. “Part of reflection is time, the absence of distraction and concentrated conversation. The workshop in the countryside helps that in the middle of the spring semester. Shortly thereafter, everything starts wrapping up.”
Many of the fellows chose topics that relate to personal experience and their course of study, according to fellow Jessica Quinones (COL ’23), who is exploring the impact of religion on cultural medicine.
“The next step is trying to implement the ideas that I learn and incorporate that into my career. My topic is very personal to me and is something I want to focus on in my own life,” Quinones said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “I want to open a Spanish clinic, primarily for immigrants and non-English speakers.”
Fellow Andrii Sendziuk (MSB ’24) said he will be exploring the impact of Christianity on drug use in Ukraine, where he is from. Although he does not necessarily see himself pursuing academic research as a career, Sendziuk said he is happy to have the opportunity to pursue academic research, an experience he has not found so far as a business student. 
“In high school, I did some research on drug use in teenagers and its causes and consequences,” Sendziuk said in an interview with The Hoya. “So when I applied, I knew that was what I wanted to research.”
Kenzie Knight (COL ’23) said she is grateful for the opportunity to work with faculty she has not had the chance to interact with, and she appreciates the chance to look at social issues through the lens of theology.
“I’m very excited to get into it and start it,” Knight said in an interview with The Hoya. “Right now I’m looking into previous research papers, which can be daunting to have so much information. It’s long. But I think that will be a challenge but I’m looking forward to coming through on the other side stronger and having a final product that I’m really proud of.”
Fellows will present their research in a final presentation in the spring to faculty mentors, members of the dean’s office, other students and members of the Figge family, according to Collins.
“Having talked to former ‘Figges,’ I get a sense that for them it’s a very powerful experience,” Collins said. “Again, it’s the classic thing that they look back at this project and realize that they are very grateful for having done it. They are eager to return the favor somehow.”

Georgetown University announced Oct. 11 that the Georgetown Scholars Program (GSP) could return to its office space in Healy Hall following nearly three months of student protest around the program’s relocation.
GSP students were first informed that the program, which provides support for first-generation and low-income (FGLI) students at Georgetown, would be allowed to return to Healy in an Oct. 11 email to GSP students obtained by The Hoya.
Many GSP students and other organizations on campus are celebrating the relocation. 
According to Hannah Ajibola (NHS ’24), who formerly served on the GSP student board, while GSP’s homecoming to Healy is welcome news, the move should never have happened in the first place.
“It was really awesome to hear, relieving, but in a way at the end of the day we shouldn’t have had to leave in the first place,” Ajibola said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
GSP students were first notified in January 2021 that the university planned to move the program’s space from its original location in Healy Hall to an office in New South Hall. The move was meant to be part of an effort to relocate campus resources and programs under the Office of Student Equity & Inclusion (OSEI) into a single office space. 
Georgetown administrators delayed the move, however, after an engineer discovered structural concerns in the New South office spaces, leading to GSP’s temporary location to a space in the Leavey Center. GSP will no longer be required to move as part of the OSEI consolidation and will instead remain a part of the Division of Student Affairs, according to the Oct. 11 email.
The Georgetown community first learned about GSP’s relocation in late August, sparking outrage among students and graduates and leading to advocacy calling on the university to reverse its decision. Most recently, GSP student leaders and members of the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) planned to hold a teach-in Oct. 13, followed by a sit-in to raise awareness of GSP’s relocation. Both events were canceled following the announcement that GSP would return to Healy.
Student and graduate activism demonstrates how important GSP is to campus life, according to GSP graduate Rashawn Davis (COL ’14). 
“It speaks, one, to just how much GSP means to some people — the fact that not just current students, but alum, have challenged this and really been a voice for GSP,” Davis said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I think it speaks to just what that program means to so many people past and present.”
While GSP’s move back into Healy is a step in the right direction, the university has damaged its relationship with FGLI students, according to Leo Rassieur (COL ’22), speaker of the GUSA Senate.
“Needless to say, the consideration of GSP’s relocation shows how weak the University’s commitment is to GSP and to FGLI students, and it is our hope that Georgetown can work to rebuild that trust moving forward. This announcement is an optimistic step in that direction,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The university recognizes the role and symbolism that GSP has within the Georgetown community, according to the Oct. 11 email.
“Since 2004, the Georgetown Scholars Program (GSP) has been a pillar of support within the Georgetown community — providing financial support, advising, mentorship and a sense of community for students who identify as first-generation and low-income,” the email reads. “We hear your concerns about being moved out of Healy Hall. While engagement and planning for the space is still underway, we can confirm that when renovations to the Healy ground floor are complete, GSP will be returned to new and improved space there.”
When contacted for comment, a university spokesperson referred The Hoya to the Oct. 11 email.
While the university has supported GSP in the past, the relocation saga has reinforced the importance of GSP to the Georgetown community, according to Davis.
“I think Georgetown has been committed to first-generation students for a long time, they’ve done really good work. I think the creation of GSP is an example of that, but I think with any large entity, whether it’s a university like Georgetown, or whether it’s a city like Washington, D.C., sometimes folks need to be reminded of how important some things are,” Davis said. 
Akibola said that although the situation was distressing, she saw the impact of continued advocacy throughout the process.
“At the end of the day, advocating for ourselves is really important in the situation because if we hadn’t advocated, we wouldn’t have been given a chance to go back to Healy,” Ajibola said.
