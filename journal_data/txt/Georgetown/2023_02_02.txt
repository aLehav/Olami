Jennifer Sims, one of the former chairs of Georgetown University’s intelligence concentration in the Security Studies Program, joined the Center for Security Studies (CSS) for a conversation on her new book on intelligence in international politics Jan. 31. 
Daniel Byman, a Georgetown professor in the School of Foreign Service (SFS) and the former director of CSS, moderated the event for the CSS speaker series. The event centered on intelligence as an element of power, its use in domestic and international military engagements and the role of intelligence agencies in times of crisis.
Sims said her latest publication, “Decision Advantage: Intelligence in International Politics from the Spanish Armada to Cyberwar,” is an effort to lay down a theory of intelligence. According to Sims, this requires knowledge of the history of the intelligence profession and an understanding that intelligence exists as an activity outside of institutions like the Central Intelligence Agency.
“The way you can actually find out what intelligence is, how it’s worked and not worked, is to look at the centuries prior to the 20th and 21st century to go way back in history,” Sims said at the event. “Any intelligence expert or academic will tell you it is the world’s second oldest profession.”
Sims said intelligence is all about gathering information for competition rather than for the goal of revealing the truth. 
“Its objective is not truth telling, although truth telling is an important ingredient,” Sims said. “Its objective is to gain advantage over the other side, over the enemy. It can be less than perfect information, less than thoroughly true, so long as it is better than what the other side has at any given moment.”
Sims said that even with a lot of public information available about intelligence, there are still many gaps in knowledge about its role.
“Despite all these books out there, you still have muddy thinking about what intelligence is, how you build it as a form of power, how you use it, and who is doing it,” Sims said. 
Sims said it is important to have the upper hand in information collection. This is how the English were able to outwit Spain during their defeat of the Spanish Armada, a 130-ship naval fleet that Spain sent to invade England in 1588. 
“When you go into a competition, you want to understand the terrain of uncertainty and develop a strategy that puts what you know foundationally into the priority box,” Sims said. “If you are going to fight, fight on ground you know.”
The use of information in intelligence applies to current military and political struggles including the ongoing war in Ukraine, according to Sims. 
“First of all, when you go into a competition, you want to understand the terrain of uncertainty and develop a strategy that puts what you know foundationally into the priority box,” Sims said.
Sims explained that Ukraine’s determination to maintain its knowledge of its own land is why Russia has not completely overtaken Ukraine. 
“Everybody was discounting Ukraine,” Sims said. “Part of the reason Russia has not overtaken Ukraine is that Ukraine is fighting for its own turf. That affects willpower, but it is also the knowledge of the terrain that counts.”
Sims said intelligence depends on anticipating what the enemy will do next, the proximity of decision makers to intelligence professionals and selective secrecy — effectively choosing what to keep private. Sims also said it is important to collect information beyond that which exists in the intelligence institutions. 
“You cannot be biased and think that the only platforms that count are the ones owned by the intelligence community,” Sims said. 
Outside-the-box-preparation will be critical in successful intelligence strategy in the future, according to Sims. 
“Find out what the unexpected is, what policymakers for some reason are not interested in,” Sims said. “That is where you win in strategic warning.”

The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) selected on Jan. 25 Jermar “Coach” Rountree as one of five finalists for the 2023 National Teacher of the Year award. 
The CCSSO is a nonprofit organization of public officials who lead the departments of elementary and secondary education within the United States. Since 2000, the organization has run the annual National Teacher of the Year (NTOY) Program in order to promote leadership skills in educators while also celebrating their talents.
Rountree teaches health and physical education to students ranging from pre-K to eighth grade at Center City Public Charter School’s Brightwood Campus, and he also works as the District Teacher Lead for the Physical Education and Health Department. 
Rountree has been an educator for 16 years. Rountree also spent time leading the D.C. Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) Physical Education Cadre, which evaluates D.C. elementary through secondary school health curricula and shares the information with local physical educators. 
Rountree said he is honored to represent D.C. given his passion for his students and education as a whole. 
“I love what I do and that will not change. I am dedicated to my kids, families, and colleagues. That is what pushes me along no matter what,” Rountree said in a Jan. 25 press release from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D). “I want to be that trusted person, that father figure, that coach that my students can rely on no matter what.”
Rountree began teaching in 2008 as an educator at the YMCA in Danbury, Conn., according to the press release. When he moved to Washington, D.C., in 2012, he started teaching elementary school students in both health and physical education.
Rountree has since hosted numerous health-focused events for families and launched various programs at Center City PCS-Brightwood, according to the press release. 
“Rountree also helped streamline Center City PCS-Brightwood’s before- and after-school clubs program; launched a swimming program for middle school students; and organized fun programs such as a fencing, wrestling and cooking clubs, and family boot camps,” the press release read.
Rountree is only one of three D.C. teachers who have been in the running for the National Teacher achievement since 2005, according to the press release. 
“Teaching is where I belong,” said Rountree in the press release. “I want to be that trusted person, that father figure, that coach that my students can rely on no matter what. I am so honored to represent the District of Columbia as a finalist for National Teacher of the Year.”
The CCSSO selects four finalists from a group of 57 teachers. The finalists are then interviewed by a selection committee that includes representatives from 16 different education and community organizations.
The CCSSO coordinates the selection process, and the selection committee itself makes the final decisions on the basis of key indicators of teaching expertise, said CCSSO Press Secretary Carolyn Phenicie. 
“The Selection Committee reads teachers’ written applications to determine finalists,” Phenicie wrote to The Hoya. “They’re looking for teachers who are experts in the field; build collaborative relationships with colleagues, students and families; deliberately connect the classroom to community; are lifelong learners; and express themselves in engaging and clear ways.”
The announced finalists will interview with the selection committee in-person, according to Phenicie. Following the committee’s review process, one teacher will be named the 2023 National Teacher of the Year in the spring, and the winner will spend the full year as an ambassador for education, traveling across the U.S. and advocating for teachers and students. 
The finalist is also recognized as National Teacher of the Year by President Joe Biden in a ceremony that takes place at the White House.  
State Superintendent Dr. Christina Grant said Coach Rountree represents all of the essential qualities of an educator.
“At a time when our young students need positive role models who care deeply about their lives, in school, at home, and in the community, Coach Rountree is the educator we need – here in the District of Columbia and nationally,” Grant said in the press release. “As 2023 DC Teacher of the Year, Coach Rountree has shown us how to meaningfully connect with our families, support our students, and build healthy school communities where everyone thrives.”
Bowser said she is grateful for the work of Rountree’s health education initiatives in the District.
“Jermar Rountree is an outstanding educator, a leader in his school and community, a role model for teachers across the District, and a vital source of support and inspiration for the students and families he serves,” Bowser said in the Jan. 25 release.

CW: This article discusses antisemitism and violence against Jewish communities. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The Jewish Student Association (JSA) invited the Georgetown community to Havdalah to stand in solidarity against recent incidents of antisemitism on campus. 
Havdalah represents a new beginning to each week for those of the Jewish faith, and the Jan. 28 gathering of dozens of community members in front of Healy Hall served as an opportunity for Georgetown’s Jewish community to find comfort and safety after a string of antisemitic incidents on campus, including the discovery of a swastika drawn on a wall in first-year residence Darnall Hall. 
The event featured remarks by JSA Co-President Chloe Schneider (CAS ’24) and speeches from Rabbi Menachem Shemtov and Rabbi Daniel Schaefer, the interim director for Jewish Life, about confronting difficulties with spirituality. JSA Co-President Joseph Abergel (CAS ’23) sang Havdalah blessings and passed around a ritual cup of grape juice, a substitute for the traditional wine, to end the ceremony. 
The event emphasized the importance of finding solace in community amid times of struggle, Shemtov said.
“Shabbat is a time and uplifting time with a community of spirituality of sitting together, enjoying the moment of being in touch with ourselves as a community,” Shemtov said at the event. “We’re taking a special idea of survival, taking the inspiration of the warmth and trying to infuse that in the week ahead and the community around us.”
Abergel said he received a lot of positive feedback about the ceremony and felt encouraged after seeing so many people show up to celebrate their Jewish identity. 
“The Havdalah was a reminder that there is a thriving and functional Jewish community that will always stand up for each other, in good times and in bad times,” Abergel wrote to The Hoya.
Schaefer said he appreciated the large show of support from the Georgetown community at the gathering, especially from those who are not Jewish.
“It’s amazing to see so many people here tonight for a distinctively Jewish ritual to be proudly Jewish, again in support and solidarity with Jewish people who want to live freely, proudly and without fear,” Schaefer said at the event.
Mrudula Chodavarapu (MSB ’26), who does not identify as Jewish, said she attended to show solidarity with the Jewish community on campus.
“I attended Havdalah because the recent antisemitic acts on campus are atrocious,” Chodavarapu said. “Havdalah was a beautiful experience. It was multisensory and immensely immersive.”
The location of the ceremony added to the feeling of solidarity as a community, according to Sasha Sebag-Montefiore (CAS ’25).
“Havdalah took place in front of Healy Hall, the nucleus of Georgetown University, where hundreds of students everyday pass by,” Sebag-Montefiore wrote to The Hoya. “By doing this, not only the Jewish Community, but all those who condemn racism and hate, we’re obviously and tangibly showing our love for each other and the strength we have together.” 
Naomi Gould (CAS ’26), a JSA first-year representative, said she felt the support of the Georgetown community tangibly at Havdalah.
“Knowing that people were willing to take time out of their weekends to show solidarity for the Jewish community on campus means a lot because — as was mentioned by Joseph and Rabbi Daniel — standing together in strength is the only way we’re going to be able to combat all forms of bigotry,” Gould wrote to The Hoya. “I had non-Jewish friends physically standing with me at the ceremony after being there for me all week, and it was really uplifting to have their support.” 
Antisemitism incidents on college campuses peaked in the 2020-2021 academic year when 244 incidents took place, according to the Anti-Defamation League, a nongovernmental organization fighting against antisemitism and bias. As of 2022, 85% of Americans believed in at least one anti-Jewish trope, which is 24% higher than rates measured in 2019. 
Gould said she was grateful for everyone who attended Havdalah and that similar small acts of solidarity, including educating oneself about Jewish history, are vital for creating a safer and more inclusive community.“Jewish students on campus, if they’re not actively feeling uncomfortable or unsafe being openly Jewish, are often put in situations where they’re forced to explain their identity to others to combat inaccurate stereotypes or be treated like any other student,” Gould wrote. “If every Georgetown student read one book, one article, took one trip to the Holocaust Museum, or even just read through one infographic on Instagram shared by a Jewish peer it would help alleviate that burden at least a little.”

A panel of scientists and university professors spoke about the results of the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) and the future of the fight against climate change.
Georgetown’s Free Speech Project, a nonpartisan initiative tracking the status of free speech in the United States, and the Future of the Humanities Project, a collaboration between Georgetown and the University of Oxford, hosted the Jan. 25 event, titled “A Fractured Earth — Global Failures and Greenwashing in the Fight Against the Climate Crisis.” Michael Scott, a senior dean at Oxford, and Sanford Ungar, the director of the Free Speech Project, moderated the event, which centered on the intersection of humanities and public life in world issues like climate change.
The COP27 summit took place in Egypt in November 2022, bringing together nearly 200 nations to discuss issues including fossil fuel flow, climate justice funding and floods.
Senior climate scientist Astrid Caldas who works at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit organization committed to fighting for a safer and healthier world, said COP27 has created many positive changes including the Loss and Damage agreement, which gives vulnerable countries funding to tackle climate crises.
“Many perceived that was the issue for COP27 because the Global South and climate activists have been really fighting for it,” Caldas said at the event. “The establishment of a fund for loss and damage for vulnerable countries is a big development.”
Constance McDermott, a senior research fellow at Oxford, said there have also been disappointing outcomes to certain commitments, including the pledge COP members made last year to tackle issues of deforestation by 2030, but have not yet taken many tangible steps to honor.
“It almost feels like a pledge Olympics, because so far the progress in even slowing deforestation has been very underwhelming,” McDermott said at the event. “It makes us step back and think, ‘Maybe we need to look at these problems in somewhat of a different way.’”
Caldas said reversing environmental damage is possible through projects like the building of the Trans-Amazonian Highway, a road that cuts through Brazil and the Amazon Rainforest from East to West.
“There are certain areas that can recover, but in the southern part, where grazing and other activities take place, the biomes are changing because the forest takes so long to develop,” Caldas said.

Richard Staley, professor at the University of Cambridge, said countries in Middle Europe have been more successful at communicating climate change than Great Britain, for example.
It is important to monitor countries that have declared a climate emergency, according to Charlie Holt who serves as a legal counsel for Greenpeace International, an initiative that focuses on non-violent action to create a greener world. He said the European Union and 18 national governments have declared a climate emergency status.
However, Holt said Great Britain has yet to settle on its role in the international fight against climate change.
“We’ve seen our government go back and forth, not quite clear if they want to play the role of global leader, not quite sure whether this fits into the mold of global post-Brexit Britain,” Holt said at the event.
McDermott said national governments are not the only ones who can take meaningful action to mitigate climate change, though.
City-level efforts that address climate change can go hand in hand with initiatives on the national level, according to McDermott.
“I don’t think it should be an either/or because there’s no reason why governments shouldn’t try to talk among themselves and come to an agreement.” McDermott said.
Staley said some conservative Republican figures have opposed the fight against climate change, even as far back as the founding of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Rachel Carlson’s “Silent Spring,” a book covering the effect of pesticides on the environment.
“It’s been a great inspiration to look back on Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” and the founding of the EPA and the extraordinary changes and developments of a movement with environmentalism at its heart, but also to realize that at the same time as that was being developed and at lot was being achieved, there was a constant opposition in the U.S.,” Staley said.
McDermott said that international collaboration and shared goals will be critical in reinforcing the fight against climate change moving forward.
“Environmental problems are social problems,” McDermott said. “It’s a matter of how well states, people and governments can work together to address problems that are affecting everyone.”

Thomas Bollyky, an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, spoke at a webinar hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) on pandemic preparedness and public trust Jan. 25.
Bollyky, who runs the global health program at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank, discussed with other panelists the role that public trust plays in coordinating and carrying out pandemic responses. Panelists detailed their findings and opinions on the impact of low trust, both in government and in individual communities.
Bollyky said that trust between a country’s citizens and its government, as well as between members of a community, should be a key theme in discussions of improving pandemic preparedness.
“Many assessments of the U.S. and other nations’ performance in the COVID-19 crisis acknowledge the importance of public trust, but fail to include concrete proposals for addressing its potential absence in future pandemic preparedness and response planning,” Bollyky wrote to The Hoya. “That is what my colleagues and I are working to change.”
Bollyky and several colleagues published findings in The Lancet, a peer-reviewed medical journal, from research they conducted on the relationship between trust-building and success when facing pandemics in February 2022.
During his opening statement at the webinar, Bollyky said the study aimed to analyze the large differences in the number of COVID-19 deaths across countries, in order to inform future responses to global health crises.
“If policymakers want to limit the damage from that next threat, they will need a clearer understanding of why some nations have done better in responding to this one,” Bollyky said on the panel. “What we did find was a significant association between cumulative infections — the total number of infections — and trust in government and interpersonal trust. And the effect we observed was large.”
According to the February 2022 publication, factors that contributed to differences in COVID-19 infections across countries included altitude, GDP per capita and seasonality. Greater trust and less government corruption also resulted in statistically significant lower infection rates, as well as more vaccine coverage in certain countries. 
Bollyky said that understanding the roots of these differences is integral if policymakers want to improve the results of government pandemic response in the future. 
“While the COVID crisis is certainly not over, the time for planning for the next dangerous pandemic threat has already begun,” Bollyky said at the event. “And if policymakers want to limit the damage from that next threat, they will need a clearer understanding of why some nations have done better in responding to this one.”
Other panelists included Zubaida Haque, former interim CEO of The Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank; Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness department; Owewale Tomori, former president of the Nigerian Academy of Science, an independent scientific body in Nigeria; Lucille Blumberg, former deputy director of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a South African public health organization; and Andy Seale, adviser for the WHO Department of Global HIV.
Haque said individuals from communities that face or have historically faced structural inequalities often turned to friends and family members as sources of information during times of health crisis.
“Especially marginalized communities and overlooked communities historically — because they haven’t had a trustworthy relationship with governments, with the medical establishment, with clinicians, with national health services and so on — they tended to depend on people around them,” Haque said on the panel.
Haque said that public health experts could have predicted the disproportionate impact the pandemic had on groups who face disparities.
“I think I come at this from the perspective that we didn’t need the pandemic and the appalling outcomes, especially in terms of ethnic disparities, hospitalizations and deaths,” Haque said at the event. “We didn’t need those outcomes to know that this pandemic was going to be a pandemic of inequality, and that’s because we’ve always known that those inequalities existed in society.”
Blumberg said trust should be established prior to health emergencies in order to prevent the spread of illness.
“Trust is absolutely critical to ensuring that people respond to what you think is right, to manage them and to stop the outbreak,” Blumberg said. “But I think as previous speakers said, you have to build this trust before the outbreak.”
Bollyky said societies with low levels of trust experience worse health outcomes as trust levels decline globally. 
“Reported levels of trust in government and among citizens are declining in many democracies, especially in the United States,” Bollyky wrote. “As mentioned, that decline has had devastating consequences in the COVID-19 pandemic, where low-trust societies performed significantly worse than their counterparts, but it has broader implications for health and societies as well.”
Levels of public trust in the U.S. have steadily decreased in the past several decades, with just 21% of surveyed Americans reporting that they trust the federal government to do what is right “just about always” or “most of the time” in 2022, according to a Pew Research Center study.
Bollyky said that it remains essential that governments facilitate cooperation among their citizens during a pandemic.
“When confronted with a novel, contagious virus, the most effective way for a government to protect its citizens is convincing them to voluntarily take measures to protect themselves and others,” Bollyky wrote. “Especially in democracies, the success of those efforts depends on trust — between citizens and their governments and among citizens themselves.”

The Georgetown University Law Center partnered with the Carl Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, an organization dedicated to increasing government accountability, to host a panel on the implications of the House Jan. 6 Select Committee’s hearings on future congressional oversight.
At the Jan. 30 event, titled “How the January 6 Committee Broke the Mold: What it Means for Future Oversight,” speakers discussed how the committee’s format — in particular, its use of a television consultant, documentary style and choice of specific committee members to present and question witnesses — will impact future congressional hearings. James Townsend, the director of the Levin Center, moderated the conversation, and panelists included attorney Reginald Brown and PBS congressional correspondent Lisa Desjardins, as well as David Rapallo, an associate professor at the Law Center, and Kristin Amerling, the committee’s chief counsel and deputy staff director.
Amerling, an experienced congressional staffer, said the public mischaracterized many of the committee’s formatting choices as new or different from standard practice. The choice to have only one or two committee members question each witness is typical for congressional hearings, according to Amerling.
It was the members’ collective agreement to work together that distinguished the committee’s hearings from past oversight hearings, according to Amerling. 
“The foundational feature of the Select Committee’s work that enabled use of these procedures was the commitment across the entire committee’s membership to work collaboratively to advance their investigative goal, which was to uncover what happened on Jan. 6, why it happened and make recommendations to make sure something like that never happens again,” Amerling said at the event.
The committee’s hearings notably brought a limited number of witnesses into hearing rooms in person, with many witnesses testifying over video. The committee hired television consultants and a producer to shape the hearings into docudrama-style episodes, detailing the full story of the Jan. 6 insurrection on primetime TV. 
In its Dec. 22 final report, the committee concluded that former President Donald Trump incited the Jan. 6 riot and pressured state officials into providing false results for the 2020 election, recommending that Trump be banned from holding public office. 
Brown, an attorney who represented witnesses testifying before the committee, said that the committee’s use of video effectively conveyed the dire nature of events inside the executive branch that led up to the insurrection at the Capitol.
“They also did an amazing job of telling the story of how close we came to losing aspects of our democracy, having the government crumble,” Brown said at the event. “And the only way to do that was by limiting the number of speakers and focusing on particular parts of the narrative through the use of video and live in-person testimony.”
Desjardins said the committee’s careful planning of how to deliver information created a more persuasive argument for a TV audience. The broadcast of the first primetime hearing reached at least 20 million viewers. ​​
“This was an incredibly made-for-TV series of hearings,” Desjardins said at the event. “It was the use of compelling video and very carefully scripted wording which was tailored to each member, I think, and driven by each member.”
Rapallo served as a congressional and White House staffer for 23 years before joining the Law Center faculty, advising and serving on several special committees including those investigating Hurricane Katrina, the 2012 attack on an American diplomatic post in Benghazi, the COVID-19 pandemic and Trump’s impeachment. 
The hearings’ documentary style made the committee’s findings more accessible to the general public, according to Rapallo. 
“It’s like watching a series that has two-hour documentaries, where you have the same characters coming through as the members of Congress and then you get the new witnesses each time,” Rapallo said at the event. “At the beginning of the hearings, there was a recap of what happened last time and a preview of what you’re gonna hear here tonight. At the end of the hearing, there’s a recap of what you heard today and what you’re gonna hear at the next hearing.”
Desjardins said the committee intended to convince viewers of the executive branch’s involvement in the Capitol attack, not just explain a timeline of events.
“The focus was on not just the final report, but in telling it in a way that would change not just the pages of history — which I think the committee paid a lot of attention to — but hearts and minds of now,” Desjardins said. “They really were thinking about Republicans and independents in this country — that they think didn’t understand the danger, from the committee’s point of view, of what happened on Jan. 6.”
The committee’s success with these hearings required behind-the-scenes dedication to a common mission from both staffers and members, Amerling said.
“It involved a commitment to ongoing respectful conversations with each other, a spirit of accommodation and a willingness to put the overarching goals of the committee above individual egos,” Amerling said. “Democracy takes work and this committee was willing to do that work.”

Members of the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN) raised awareness for plastic pollution through outreach at a local Cub Scout meeting Jan. 18. 
A student advocacy club that promotes environmental preservation, GREEN is the largest environmental club on Georgetown’s campus. Through initiatives like removing invasive species, running beekeeping classes, offering students opportunities to compost waste and organizing advocacy both on and off campus, GREEN seeks to raise awareness of environmental issues and decrease students’ and Georgetown’s carbon footprints. 
Single-use plastics, such as plastic straws, grocery bags and candy wrappers, contribute up to 213 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the University of Colorado Boulder Environmental Center. If consumption trends continue, plastics will account for 20% of all oil consumption by 2050, according to a Center for International Environmental Law report. 
The Washington, D.C. government has worked to decrease plastic use in the district, becoming the first municipality in the nation to enact a five-cent tax for disposable plastic bags in 2009 and banning single-use plastic straws in 2020. 
Theology adjunct professor in the College of Arts and Sciences Bulbul Tiwari, who teaches classes on religion’s interplay with climate change, connected GREEN with Pack 100, a local Cub Scout troop in which her children are involved, after finding out about GREEN’s efforts through a student. 
Tiwari said that she put GREEN into contact with the troop because she believes there needs to be more environmental and climate change education taught in schools. 
“I am grateful to GREEN for taking the time to educate young children about caring for their planet and their future,” Tiwari wrote in an email. “I was impressed with their dedication, flexibility and enthusiasm.”
GREEN members showed a crowd of 50 scouts from the ages of 6 to 10 years old how to make crafts from upcycled plastic water bottles during their visit, presenting to scout members the dangers of microplastics and ocean pollution before showing them how to upcycle plastic water bottles into piggy banks. 
Katelyn Rickert (CAS ‘24), who runs GREEN’s education branch with Jialan Deal (SFS ’24), said GREEN aimed to show scout members that single-use plastics can be reused and turned into new, creative things.
“It is important to educate people about single-use plastics because plastics have harmful effects on land and water. Many plastics break down into microplastics and pollute waterways, harming sea life and human life as well,” Rickert wrote to The Hoya. “Environmental education is very important because people can’t change their actions for the better until they understand how their actions change the environment.”
Rickert added that environmental science is not typically taught to students at any level, making environmental education particularly crucial for elementary school-aged students.
“It’s so important we teach children when they are young so they can form good habits they can carry on into the future,” Rickert wrote. 
Deal and Rickert run GREEN’s education branch with the aim of increasing environmental conservation knowledge within the club and the greater Georgetown community. GREEN had hoped to work with local schools, but COVID concerns limited their ability to do so, according to Rickert.
“We contacted many schools in the area to do environmental education, but all of the schools had COVID concerns which prevented us from teaching the kids,” Rickert wrote. “We hope that this year schools will be more willing to invite us in to do some environmental lessons!”
Deal said that while GREEN wants to continue growing its educational programming with youth, their programs are not yet fully formalized.
“While we would like to work with more local schools, it’s not really a full-blown program as of yet,” Deal wrote to The Hoya.
Rickert said it felt rewarding to see kids learning about an important topic through creative methods that made learning fun. 
“Our goal was to educate children on some environmental issues in the world and things they can do to take action,” Rickert wrote. “The kids loved learning and making the craft, which was really fun to see.”

Leaders from around the world gathered at Georgetown University on Jan. 24 to discuss the moving of the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight, a physical reflection of the world’s increasing proximity to global catastrophe. 
The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, the organization that leads the Doomsday Clock and promotes awareness of man-made threats to human existence, moved the arrows of the clock on Jan. 24 to just 90 seconds away from midnight, the closest they have ever been to midnight — which represents global destruction — in history. The closest before this year was 100 seconds to midnight.
Mary Robinson, the first female president of Ireland; Elbadorj Tsakhia, the former president and prime minister of Mongolia; Juan Manuel Santos, the former president of Colombia; and Rachel Bronson, the president and CEO of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, gathered at the Jan. 24 Doomsday Clock Town Hall to discuss the global conflicts, including the ongoing war in Ukraine, which are pushing the clock closer to global destruction.
Tsakhia, the youngest member of The Elders, a group of world leaders that Nelson Mandela founded in 2007, said the outcome of the war in Ukraine will be important to the state of global freedom and safety.
“I am always in support of the Ukrainian people because they have a right to exist, they have a right to live freely and they have the right to choose their fate,” Tsakhia said during the event. “And because of that, I think we have to rally behind those who are fighting for global peace and security.”
The moving of the Doomsday Clock arrows started in 1947, when its hands rested seven minutes away from midnight. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists also held a town hall after they set the clock at 100 seconds to midnight in January 2020, in part due to the threat of nuclear war and the growing climate crisis.
John Pope, the chief audience officer of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, said all students, regardless of their background, need to make a long-term commitment to preventing the global issues that make the world unsafe. 
“The man-made risks covered by the Doomsday Clock affect everyone and cannot be solved by one generation or group,” Pope wrote to The Hoya. “Georgetown students come from all sorts of different backgrounds and are pursuing all sorts of different professional interests. But all of you have the potential to contribute to making the world a safer place.”
Tsakhia said he values opportunities to speak to students about the threats and potential solutions that they will inherit.
“When I talk in front of you, I try to choose my words very carefully because you guys are going to live after me,” Tsakhia said.
In their decision to change the Doomsday Clock, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists cited the threat of nuclear war, Russia’s attacks on nuclear reactor sites that could release radioactive materials and disinformation about bioweapons.
While creating peace is important to preventing further violence and victimhood, it sometimes conflicts with justice and accountability, according to Santos.
“It has a price, and the price has to do with justice,” Santos said at the event. “Every single peace process that is resolved on the negotiating table boils down to where you draw the line between peace and justice. How much justice are you as a person — and you as a society, as a country — willing to sacrifice to have peace?”
Even though much of the world has mobilized together to support Ukraine, other countries remain hesitant to oppose Russia and risk their own wellbeing, according to Bronson. 
“I think the very fact that the NATO countries have come together in a unified fashion, that the EU has come together on this, is very significant,” Bronson said at the event. “At the same time, we are seeing in a number of countries the desire not to take sides.”
Pope said engaging with young people through events like the town hall is important to stopping current global threats.
“We like to do these student events because of the important role students can play in advocating for the solutions we need now, and because they are going to be the leaders in the future that maintain those solutions and address new problems,” Pope said. “Our hope is that the audience takes away two key lessons. First, the immediacy of these problems. Second, that they can be addressed.”

Paraguay presidential candidate Santiago Peña spoke at the Georgetown Americas Institute, a center for research and dialogue on key issues facing Latin America, on Jan. 25 regarding his hopes and expectations for Paraguay’s development. 
Peña addressed the importance of the upcoming elections on Paraguay’s future and his plans for the country in an event titled “Paraguay’s Future in a Turbulent Continent.” Peña is the presidential candidate for the Colorado Party, a right-wing political party currently holding the presidency.
Peña, a politician and economist, worked previously in the International Monetary Fund and served as Paraguay’s finance minister.
Peña said he hopes to bring his broad experience in both the public and private sectors to bring Paraguay out of recent economic stagnation due to lower harvest rates of soybeans. 
“Like a table, I needed four legs to stand. So I have one academia, the second public policy, the third one politics. And I needed the fourth, which was the private sector,” Peña said at the event. “I spent the last five years, again, advocating the importance of sound public policy in general in a way to develop a country.” 
The Paraguayan public protested Peña’s Colorado Party in March 2021 due to concern over the government’s COVID-19 policies, as low vaccination rates, low funding and scarce medical supplies led to high infection rates and overwhelmed hospitals. Protestors demanded the resignation of President Mario Abdo Benítez and better handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protestors.
Peña said the protests reflected Paraguayans’ optimistic hopes for a better government, rather than pessimism about the country’s future.
“We were concerned about what was happening in the region and the protest. And the reality is the protests were only stopped because of the pandemic,” Peña said. “It was very clear that Paraguayans, they have aspirations, they have dreams, but they are not angry.”
Although the COVID-19 policy protests ended in 2021, the Paraguayan health care system remains underfunded. Paraguayan health workers protested again in December 2022, demanding increased government support for medical facilities. 
Despite increasing quality of life in Paraguay, the country remains behind other Latin American states, according to Peña.
“Over the last 30 years, Paraguay has developed in some period of time. It was the country with the highest rate of growth, and a rapid improvement in social indicators,” Peña said. “But despite all that, when you take up the picture of Paraguay, it is still behind the rest of the countries in Latin America.”
Peña said that despite this lack of growth, Paraguay has untapped potential in its people’s desire for progress and young population.
“We have a window of opportunity with all the potential and basically with this democratic, the democratic bond, the young population that today is an asset,” Peña said. “In order to get further social progress, we need to include more stability, education and help.”
Peña said that if he’s elected, his government would capitalize on Paraguay’s resources and population to further develop the country. 
“75% of the population is under 40 years. So there is huge potential to develop, but all the things that we cannot control, the land, the water, the water regime in terms of rain and the population we are given now, the country needs to do the part that we can control, and this starts with the election,” Peña said. 
Peña also said one of his key administrative plans is to further the use of renewable energy in Paraguay in order to bolster innovation and the economy. Paraguay is one of the largest producers of renewable energy in South America, with 99.5% of its power coming from hydropower. 
“Paraguay is probably the only country in the world that has an excess amount of clean, renewable energy,” Peña said. “So if we replace the selling of electricity for the use of electricity, the potential for new technology, the installation of large data centers that will collect information that will generate an ecosystem for innovation, is huge.”
Paraguay’s renewable energy surplus could provide the vast amount of energy which data centers require to operate. The market research firm Arizton estimated in June 2022 that Paraguay will receive up to $400 million in data center investments by 2027.
Peña said he hopes to advance progress and uphold democracy in the country by listening to the demands of everyday Paraguayans.
“If you think that you know what the country needs, go out, talk to the people. If they give you the confidence, then you’re gonna be able to make change for the country,” Peña said. “If you want to maintain freedom, a democratic system, you need the people to choose that vision.”
