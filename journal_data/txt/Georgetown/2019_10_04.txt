On Oct. 5, it will have been exactly one year since the Georgetown University Women’s Center last had a program director. Laura Kovach, who led the Women’s Center from 2008 to 2019, was the first of two full-time staffers to vacate their position in the last year. 
Without a director, program coordinator Karla Rondon continued running regular programming until her own departure from the Women’s Center in June. Neither of these positions have been filled by the university, leaving undergraduate program assistant Caroline Sarda (COL ’20) as the Women’s Center’s most experienced staff member, having worked there since her sophomore year. 
The Women’s Center now has no full-time staff, relegating operations to three undergraduate students, two of which were hired this semester. 
Despite these vacancies lasting for months, the university has just formed a committee comprised of students, faculty and staff that is set to meet this month in order to interview candidates in November. 
As the Women’s Center continues to run without a permanent full-time director or coordinator, the brunt of the work falls on the student interns and other resource centers such as the LGBTQ Resource Center. Often underqualified and overloaded, the students are unable to provide the services that are expected of the Women’s Center with a full-time staff. 
Picking up the Pieces
Since Kovach left last year, the prolonged search for her replacement — along with the lack of other professional full-time staff members — has detrimentally affected the Women’s Center’s ability to function at full capacity. 
In an attempt to supplement the Women’s Center during the search for a full-time director, the LGBTQ Resource Center has filled in the gaps by supplementing student interns and co-hosting programming, according to Sarda. 
In the beginning of the semester, Sarda was the only staffed worker left, since previous student workers had graduated or gone abroad. 
As a result, student interns like Sarda have had to take on increased leadership responsibilities that have usually fallen to the director, such as training new interns. This semester, however, Sarda has also had to train student workers from the LGBTQ Resource Center to work at the Women’s Center to help bridge the gap in staffing. 
“I definitely felt a sense of increased responsibility,” Sarda wrote. “I have had to come in at times when I’m not scheduled to in order to train them (and some new student workers at the LGBTQ Center), and have had to serve in a pseudo-coordinator position since I am the only returning student worker at either center this semester.”
In previous years, the Women’s Center hosted its own leadership events, including the Biondi Copeland Lecture Series on Women in Higher Education and Women Advancing Gender Equality fellowship workshops. The Biondi Copeland Lecture Series aimed to foster dialogue and increased visibility around issues facing women in leadership and higher education. The series was created by Kovach but has not been active since her departure.
While the Women’s Center is still providing basic resources such as pregnancy tests, pads and tampons, it has not planned independent programming this year, instead partnering with the LGBTQ Resource Center, and it discontinued hosting regular feminist roundtables and collaborations with student groups, according to Sarda.  
While the Women’s Center was able to continue WAGE workshops and the VOICES retreat last year because of Rondon, her departure this June left the Women’s Center without any full-time staff. 
Without the full-time support of a programming coordinator, student interns have been left without guidance on planning future independent programming, according to Sarda. 
“We are not really able to do our own independent programming, and it’s unclear how we are supposed to go about co-sponsoring events with student groups,” Sarda said. “Us student workers have no idea what the center’s budget is for the year, and we have no real guiding, coordinating force behind any independent programming the women’s center would do. We really just never know what’s going on.”
The Women’s Center has not only ceased most independent programming, but has also significantly decreased its operating hours. While other centers like the LBGTQ Resource Center have maintained their regular hours, the Women’s Center has had to close many hours a day because of its lack of full-time staffing, according to the shift schedule.  
An Ongoing Search
A year after Kovach’s departure, Georgetown University has still not found an adequate replacement for the Women’s Center’s leadership. 
The university first formally announced the beginning of its search for a new leader of the Women’s Center back in January. University leaders emphasized engagement with student leaders as an integral part of their search, according to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson.
Almost one year after launching this process, however, the administration has only just created a committee of community members, according to Associate Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Jeanne Lord.
“Last year we reviewed our structures and explored best practices in how to serve students optimally through our various centers,” Lord wrote in an email to the Hoya. “We also looked for opportunities to align resources to support more programming and minimize administrative tasks. Informed by that work, we’re convening a committee of students, faculty and staff, chaired by Dean Sue Lorenson and Charlene Brown-McKenzie, to search for a new leader for the Center.” 
The committee plans to convene later this month to review applications and bring prospective candidates to campus in November, according to Lord.
In the interim, Lord has served as a form of an interim director, according to Sarda. Because the Women’s Center is overseen by the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, administrators like Erika Cohen-Derr, assistant vice president in student affairs, have also been helping the student interns throughout the process. 
Throughout the search, the LGBTQ Resource Center is committed to supplement the center in a time of transition, according to director Shiva Subbaraman.
“The leadership within Student Affairs has been engaged in thoughtful conversations about the Women’s Center, and a search for a new person to lead it will begin shortly,” Subbaraman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Meantime, the Women’s Center is open, and there are student staff in place, and they offer Coffee Hours along with the LGBTQ Center on Fridays to bring communities of students together. We always will continue to serve all students, and it has been important for us to be here for students during this time of transition.”
However, the delayed process has taken an unnecessary amount of time and placed extra stress on surrounding students and administrators, according to Sarda.  
“I am definitely frustrated that it has taken this long to fill Laura’s position, and that my coworkers and I, Shiva, Erika Cohen-Derr, and Jeanne Lord have to deal with the consequences this semester,” Sarda said. “The university had all of last year — when there was at least [Rondon] leading the center — and the summer to fill the role, and it is only beginning to happen now.”
The director of the Women’s Center is not the only position the university has left vacant for a prolonged period of time, as the Title IX office has remained understaffed for two years. 
Former Title IX Coordinator Laura Cutway left Georgetown in June 2018, leading Title IX Investigator Samantha Berner to serve as interim coordinator while maintaining her role as investigator during the yearlong search for a new coordinator. 
Georgetown eventually promoted Berner to the role of permanent coordinator, leaving the role of investigator vacant. The university is still in the process of searching for a new Title IX investigator, marking the second consecutive year Georgetown did not have a fully staffed Title IX office at the start of the school year. 
Since the Women’s Center is a resource for survivors of sexual assault, the university must hire properly trained staff members to serve in those positions, according to Kovach.
“As a listed resource for survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence, it is imperative that qualified, full-time staff are hired to work in the Women’s Center to support students, faculty and staff,” Kovach wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I hope the current leadership will address the critical lack of full-time staff with great urgency so the Center can continue to lead and care for the whole student as it has done for almost 30 years.”
The Women’s Center used to be a critical resource for student organizations like WAGE and Sexual Assault Peer Educators to provide resources to sexual assault survivors, according to Nora West (SFS ’15), a former WAGE fellow and SAPE member.
“The Women’s Center was a key supporter of SAPE and led a lot of the trainings that made that possible, which was huge for me as a survivor trying to fit back in after having a traumatic experience,” West said. 
Creating a Solution
To sustain the Women’s Center as an effective resource without senior leadership, the LGBTQ Resource Center and student groups on campus have stepped up in solidarity.  
Staff members from the LGBTQ Resource Center have had to alternate shifts in the Women’s Center to provide coverage beyond their explicit tasks, according to Sarda. 
“One person from the LGBTQ center has to come and work here for a couple hours each week because people just aren’t here,” Sarda said. “Three people can’t fill a schedule. I feel like the university is really just stretching everyone over here too thin, and they need to consider that stress and potential burnout every day they’re not actively looking to fill the position.”
In the past, students have seen collaborative events as a chance to build solidarity between the centers, according to Adriana Zinn (NHS ’15), who worked at the Women’s Center between 2013 and 2015. 
“The guest speakers we were able to bring in through the women’s center were huge for me in developing as a feminist,” Zinn said. “Having cross-sponsored events with the LGBT Center created a place where we were giving a voice to marginalized groups who may not have felt like Georgetown was their most natural fit.”
The two centers are co-hosting a coffee chat Oct. 4 titled, “Gender and the Women’s Center” with the hopes of discussing ways to create more inclusive programming, as well as hosting focus group sessions for interactive feedback.
This time of transition provides an opportunity to reimagine the Women’s Center’s purpose, according to Sarda. 
“This moment of transition presents a great opportunity to rethink the relevance of a women’s center, especially regarding our changing understanding of gender,” Sarda said. “How do we move beyond the gender binary in the work that we do? How do we make ourselves more inclusive to transgender, gender-nonconforming and gender-fluid students? How can we create a new sense of community and purpose around the center?”
This article was corrected on October 4 to include a comment from Shiva Subbaraman. A previous version this article also previously incorrectly stated the Biondi Copeland Lecture Series had been discontinued.

Why does there need to be a center for the majority of the student population (female)? Seems like an easy budget item to cut.

Student frustration is continuing to build as Georgetown University’s board of directors, which met multiple times this week, has still not publicly provided a concrete timeline to students for action on the GU272 referendum’s results, over six months after the student vote.
The board of directors did discuss the GU272 referendum during its meetings this week, according to university spokesperson Meghan Dubyak. When student representatives to the board raised the topic of the referendum at a meeting between representatives and the board Oct. 3, the board indicated plans to contact the GU272 advocacy team but did not have a clear timeline for referendum implementation, according to Casey Doherty (COL ’20), who is a student representative to the board. 
The board of directors held at least three meetings Oct. 3: One meeting included student representatives Doherty and Eliza Lafferty (COL ’21) along with the board of directors; another full-body meeting included Georgetown University Student Association President Norman Francis (COL ’20) and President of Georgetown Graduate Student Government Lewis May, a second-year master’s student in the School of Foreign Service; a third private meeting was closed to students, according to GUSA Press Secretary Harper Thomas (SFS ’22). 
The board of directors’ full-body meeting, which is separate from the meeting between representatives and the board, occurred amid student demonstrations calling for the board to implement the results of the April 11 referendum. Students held “Where are your Jesuit values?” and “Don’t ignore history” posters and chanted “Respect our vote” outside of the Georgetown Hotel and Conference Center, where the meeting was held. 
As a student referendum, the results do not bind Georgetown to implement or formally vote on the fee. The board discussed the GU272 referendum at its June 10 meeting but did not announce any specific responses or action to the referendum after the meeting.
Doherty and Lafferty, also student representatives to the board of directors, raised the topic during the meeting they attended, according to Doherty. 
Though the board said it plans to reach out to the GU272 advocacy group after the meeting, it did not provide a definitive timeline, according to Doherty.
“We were hoping for a response different from June, and we were hoping for a concrete timeline, or something at least,” Doherty said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Today’s meeting was basically more of the same that ‘we’re excited to converse with the students,’ and that was disappointing, obviously.”
The board did not discuss the topic at a full-body meeting attended by Francis, he said.
Francis voiced frustration at the lack of full transparency from the board on its discussions of the referendum. 
“Students want to be involved and we want to be heard and be told actual dates and timelines,” Francis wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “Right now it seems like we are stuck hearing about an endless loop of dialogue and engagement but are not included in the actual discussions that matter.” 
66.1% of students voted “yes” in an April student referendum to establish an added semesterly fee to contribute to a fund benefiting descendants of the GU272, the 272 enslaved people sold by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus in 1838 to financially sustain the university. The referendum had the highest voter turnout in recorded student government electoral history.
The board of directors typically holds multiple meetings over a few days during its sessions, and student representatives to the board are only permitted to attend the meeting for the Working Group on Student Affairs, according to Doherty. 
The university is working to address logistical questions raised by the referendum, according to Dubyak. The university also began searching for a librarian to oversee collections on slavery. 
Thursday’s board meeting comes days after members of the advocacy team and GUSA representatives met with Cheryllyn Branche, president of the GU272 Descendants Association, and Fr. Timothy P. Kesicki, S.J., the president of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States, on Monday, according to Dubyak.
“This meeting emphasized the importance of this Dialogue as part of the University’s approach to engaging with members of the Descendant Community and working with Descendants to understand how we might together chart a path forward,” Dubyak wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The board has lacked transparency and clear GU272 initiatives when meeting with the GU272 Advocacy team, according to team member Aly Pachter (COL ’19). (Full disclosure: Pachter formerly served on The Hoya’s board of directors.) Though the advocacy team has offered to participate in further meetings with board members, none have reached out since June, she wrote.
“During our meetings, the members of the administration often dodge direct questions from the advocacy team and emphasize dialogue over tangible steps forward,” Pachter wrote in a statement to The Hoya before the Oct. 3 meeting. “The advocacy team has left almost all meetings doubting the university’s full commitment to implementing the referendum. We’ve had several formal meetings with administration.”

I don’t think that the board of directors are in a hurry to vote on and implement a plan to include reparations funding in tuition costs. Can you blame them?

Which students will be exempt from this obligation?    Black students (wealthy or otherwise)?   Latino students?  White students receiving university grants and financial aid?  Students whose parents immigrated to US illegally?

Reports of stalking and burglary incidents in on-campus, nonresidential buildings have nearly doubled in the last year, according to the Georgetown University Police Department’s 2019 Annual Security Report.
The report documents that total reported on-campus stalking incidents increased over the past year to 17 reported incidents in 2018, up from 11 reported incidents in 2017. Stalking is defined as any conduct, including unwelcomed communication or surveillance, directed at an individual that puts a person in fear for their safety, makes them feel alarmed or causes them emotional distress, according to the report. 
Among reported stalking incidents, stalking in nonresidential buildings saw the highest increase, with 13 reported incidents in 2018 compared to seven reported incidents in 2017. GUPD sent the report to the Georgetown University community in a Sept. 30 email.
The increase in reported incidents of stalking on campus may not necessarily reflect heightened safety risks, according to Jen Luettel Schweer, associate director for Health Education Services and director of Sexual Assault Response and Prevention Services. Rather, the uptick could stem from students having a better understanding of the reporting process, according to Schweer.
“An increase in numbers around issues like stalking and sexual violence often reflects an increase in knowledge about these issues and in reporting,” Schweer wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUPD releases the safety report annually to the Georgetown community to address both campus and personal safety. The report also includes the last three years’ number of reported incidents of statutory rape, domestic violence and disciplinary referrals for drugs and alcohol, among other types of incidents.
The report contains data on reported crimes that occurred on the main campus as well as at the Georgetown Law Center, School of Continuing Studies and university campuses in Florence, Qatar and London, in addition to general information on university policy and reporting procedures. 
Forty-six total reported on-campus burglary incidents were reported in 2018, compared to 31 on-campus burglary incidents in 2017, according to the report. The breakdown of on-campus burglary incidents shows the number of on-campus, nonresidential related burglaries almost doubled, with 27 reported incidents in 2018 compared to 12 reported incidents in 2017.
Though the total number of on-campus burglaries increased over the last year, the number of on-campus residential related burglaries remained at 19 for the second year in a row. 
GUPD did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Though the number of reported burglary incidents at on-campus residential buildings has not changed in the last year, students should continue to be aware of their surroundings and take precautionary measures, according to Executive Director of Residential Education Ed Gilhool.
“Students are encouraged to always lock their doors and to never leave personal belongings, including laptops and cell phones, unattended,” Gilhool said in an email to The Hoya.
In addition to the annual security report, the university also released the Annual Fire Safety Report and Fire Statistics that provides information about fire safety at Georgetown. The report includes statistics on fires at the university and outlines university policies and procedures.
Eleven reported on-campus rapes have been reported for each of the last three years, according to the security report. Though organizations like Sexual Assault Peer Educators work to break the stigma about reporting sexual assaults, the statistics in the report suggest there are students who choose not to report rape for their own personal reasons, SAPE member Courtney Smith (COL ’21) wrote.
“Although I think we are making strides in changing the stigma around reporting rape, there is still much to be done,” Smith wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The fact that the total number of on-campus rapes has stayed the same for the past three years makes me think that there are survivors who have, for their own valid reasons, not reported.”
Georgetown requires all incoming students to complete online educational programs that educate students about on-campus resources and bring awareness to sexual misconduct, according to the report. 
In addition to completing online training courses, all new undergraduates attend Hoya RealTalk, a theater production put on by HES during New Student Orientation. The play touches on themes relating to bystander intervention, mental health and alcohol consumption. 
For students affected by interpersonal violence, HES provides students support and advice to help ensure their safety, according to Schweer. 
“In Health Education Services, we work with students who have experienced stalking, sexual assault and any other form of interpersonal violence by offering them support, advocacy, safety planning and connecting them with any other resources they may need,” Schweer wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Zack Johnson, a formerly incarcerated student in the Georgetown Prison Scholars Program, was freed Sept. 30 after serving two and a half years in the Washington, D.C. Correctional Treatment Facility.
At a hearing to retry his case on Monday, Johnson faced a possible four- to eight-year sentence. Professor Marc Howard, the founder of the Prison Scholars Program, and Aliyah Graves-Brown, coordinator for Georgetown University’s Prisons and Justice Initiative Program, which develops programming on mass incarceration and criminal justice reform, testified at the hearing. 
The judge sentenced Johnson to time served, commuting his sentence to equal the time he had already spent in jail, leading to his immediate release, according to a Facebook post from Howard announcing the decision.  
Howard launched the Prison Scholars Program, which provides both credit and noncredit courses for incarcerated individuals, at the D.C. Jail in January 2018 as a part of the Prisons and Justice Initiative.
The Prisons Scholars Program has given Johnson the opportunity to pursue his dream of receiving a bachelor’s degree from Georgetown, according to Johnson.
“Georgetown’s prison and justice initiative allowed me to finally unite my real self with my ideal self,” Johnson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “With this clarity of mind I realized my dreams were not impossible and quickly devoted myself at being the best student I could be. Because of PJI I’m now truly living my dream.” 
Johnson was a strong student all throughout high school, he said. However, right after Johnson graduated high school, his father suffered a heart attack, which necessitated a quadruple bypass surgery and left him unable to continue working. The medical bills and loss of his father’s income inflicted a heavy financial burden on Johnson’s family, which made Johnson unable to attend college, according to Johnson.
Johnson’s struggle with prematurely ending his education sent him on a troubled path that led to his incarceration, according to Johnson.
“For so long I have been told how much potential I have,” Johnson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Instead I drifted down the wrong path creating a real self that was in constant contention with my ideal self. This disconnect only caused more depression and despair leading me deeper and further down the wrong path.”
The “Prisons and Punishment” course is offered to both prisoners and Georgetown students. Johnson’s former classmate Haley Wierzbicki (COL ’21) said that she gained a personal perspective from learning alongside Johnson and hearing about his life experience.
“We need to humanize these people that are being subjected to the terrible position that is our criminal justice system,” Wierzbicki said. “We need to use our privilege of being Georgetown students to humanize them, and to prove to the world that taking a class in prison is the same experience you’d have on campus, but you’re learning more from a diverse set of life experiences.”
Johnson, who was taking Howard’s “Prisons and Punishment” class while he was incarcerated, will now join the class held on Georgetown’s campus and will also enroll in a personal finance course through the university. 
While taking the Georgetown course during his incarceration, Johnson pursued a Communications degree through the Prisons Studies Project with Ashland University, which offers postsecondary education in correctional facilities, according to the program website. 
Johnson’s avid participation in two academic programs speaks to his strong desire to learn, according to Graves-Brown, who met Johnson while visiting the prison several times every week to ensure the smooth operation of the program as coordinator.
“He was in both of our programs simultaneously, which speaks to his intellect and his ability to handle a lot of work,” Graves-Brown said in an interview with The Hoya. “I’m grateful that I was able to cross paths with him and continue to be a part of his journey.”
Johnson’s journey exemplifies how incarcerated individuals can follow a new path, according to Howard.
“The biggest takeaway of all of this is that people who are incarcerated are human beings who have made mistakes,” Howard said, “Very few of them are incapable of change. Many of them will do great things and make us proud if we support them well.  Zack is the embodiment of that belief.”
Johnson hopes to become an addiction and trauma counselor to help others overcome addiction and find joy through recovery.
Johnson is grateful for the opportunity to prove his potential to himself and sees his release as a turning point, he said.
“When I heard the final verdict on Monday, I felt an amazing sense of relief,” Johnson wrote. “At that moment I knew my life was now on the right path and that I had the right people in my corner to see me through it.”
Correction: This article was corrected to update the terminology for incarcerated persons.

This side door to a Georgetown degree is much more economical than bribing a tennis coach.

This year’s OUTober events will celebrate LGBTQ History Month through keynote speaker Mesma Belsaré, an Indian LGBTQ activist, and expanded programming which will involve a new Campus Ministry event.
Belsaré, an Indian transgender woman who is a classical Bharatanatyam dancer, painter and actor, will speak at an event called “The Creative Process” Oct. 10. The event will be sponsored by the South Asian Society, Rangila, the LGBTQ Resource Center, The Indian Initiative and Lecture Fund.
The event featuring Belsaré will focus on how her various social identities have shaped her journey in both art and dance. Belsaré will also discuss the principles of Bharatanatyam, the oldest classical form of Indian dance, and what her process to becoming established in the dance looked like as a member of the LGBTQ community, according to Rangila co-coordinator Avni Kulkarni (NHS ’21).
The event will also include a question and answer section where students will be able to engage in conversation with one another and hopefully discuss ways that the South Asian community can be more inclusive of LGBTQ members, according to Kulkarni.
“I hope this sheds light on what it means to hold LGBTQ identities in a South Asian place and what we can do as a community to make LGBTQ representation more inclusive within our community,” Kulkarni said.
Bringing Belsaré to talk about her experiences as a South Asian member of the LGBTQ community is important in bringing awareness to stigmas around sexuality within the South Asian community, according to Co-Director of Special Projects and Strategic Initiatives for Rangila Satya Adabala (SFS ’22).  
“I believe that it is truly important to reflect on the reality of some of the stigma in the South Asian community regarding LGBTQ identity, and as it is OUTober, we wanted to collaborate with the LGBTQ Resource Center to explore some of these important topics,” Adabala wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Campus Ministry will also host a LGBTQ-affirming mass for the first time on Oct. 20, according to LGBTQ Resource Center Director and Special Assistant to the Vice President of Student Affairs Sivagami Subbaraman.
“That is a big milestone for our communities and we are really grateful,” Subbaraman wrote in an email to The Hoya
OUTober will include the annual celebration for Coming Out Day in Red Square on Oct 11. The celebration will feature music and a “closet door,” which students can symbolically “come out” from, according to GUPride Co-President Siena Hohne (COL ’22).
GUPride will also be hosting a smaller, more casual event later that day for students to share their coming out stories and queer experiences in a more intimate setting, according to Hohne.
“Our goal for this event is to provide a space where closeted or more low-key members of the community can still feel celebrated and welcomed,” Hohne wrote in an email to The Hoya.
OUTober is a tradition that began in 2012 to honor LGBTQ History Month. The LGBTQ Resource Center celebrated its 10th anniversary during OUTober last year.
GUPride will potentially host an event for International Pronouns Day Oct. 16 and are in the process of finalizing their keynote speaker, according to Hohne. The official schedule for OUTober will be released next week, according to Subbaraman. 
OUTober provides students in the LGBTQ community an avenue to express their identity in a safe environment despite being unable to proudly express their sexuality in other circumstances, GUPride Co-President Al Castillo (SFS ’22) said.
“Many members of the queer Georgetown community are unable to be open about their sexuality or gender identity back in their hometown, for risk of social and familial rejection, violence, and discrimination,” Castillo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In comparison, OUTober provides the opportunity for the community to be out and proud of their identity as a queer person on campus.”
This article was updated Oct. 4 to correct that campus ministry is hosting a new event for OUTober this year, not that this is the first time Campus Ministry has partnered with OUTober. The article was also updated to correctly reflect that Coming Out Day is Oct. 11 and that International Pronouns Day is Oct. 16.

Professors Mary Wakefield and Carol Taylor (GRD ’97) from the School of Nursing and Health Studies will be honored by the American Academy of Nursing this month for their accomplishments and contributions to the field of nursing.
Wakefield, who previously served in leadership at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, will be recognized as a Living Legend of the American Academy of Nursing, the highest distinction conferred by the AAN. Wakefield joined the NHS faculty in 2017 as a visiting professor.
The Living Legend honor is a remarkable accomplishment, President of the American Academy of Nursing Karen Cox wrote in a July 30 news release.
“The leaders selected in this year’s class of Living Legends are highly acclaimed, longtime Fellows whose accomplishments to health and wellness are profound and sustained,” Cox said.
Wakefield, who is a visiting distinguished professor in the practice of health care at Georgetown University and the University of Texas at Austin, was honored alongside four other distinguished nurses from institutions including Lehman College of the City University of New York and the University of Washington. Wakefield feels privileged to be recognized by such a qualified group of nursing professionals, she said in an interview with The Hoya. 
“They are some of the most stellar nurse-researchers in the country. They are nurses who are chief executive officers of hospitals and other health care facilities. They are deans of some of our schools of nursing across the country and outstanding educators and outstanding clinicians,” Wakefield said.
At Georgetown, Wakefield advises students on research and career paths in health policy, conducts executive programs on nursing and guest lectures in undergraduate and graduate classes.
Sharing her experiences in lectures and discussion at Georgetown as a visiting professor since 2017 has been a rewarding experience for Wakefield.
“Most of the role has been lecturing across a wide variety of health-related courses, bringing to those classes the experience and expertise that I have as a nurse who has worked extensively in health policy at the federal level,” Wakefield said.
Taylor, an ethicist and professor of advanced nursing practice, will be inducted as an AAN fellow in October.
Induction as a fellow in the AAN recognizes Taylor’s research in the field of nursing as well as her commitment to teaching, according to Interim Dean of the NHS Carole Roan Gresenz.
“Dr. Taylor is highly regarded on and off Georgetown’s campus as a reflective and knowledgeable ethicist and educator,” Gresenz said in a news release. “Her fellowship in the academy honors her many contributions, and we celebrate her achievement and are grateful to call her a colleague.”
Taylor’s research focuses on nursing ethics and she is well known for a textbook she co-edited, “Fundamentals of Nursing: The Art and Science of Person-Centered Care.” She joins 10 other Georgetown faculty who are fellows in the academy.
The AAN, composed of more than 2,700 fellows, is a professional organization that drives health practice standards and supports policy-related initiatives. The academy publishes a bimonthly journal on new developments in nursing practice and hosts a yearly policy conference.
Cox praised the work of the fellow inductees and their major contributions to the organization, according to a news release.
“I am proud to welcome this incredible class of leaders to the American Academy of Nursing,“ Cox said. “Their amazing accomplishments have changed health and health care across the country and around the globe.”
Both Wakefield and Taylor have conducted research in the health care field, specifically focusing on policy and decision-making. The future of research and policy in the health care field looks optimistic, but there are significant problems that face policymakers, Wakefield said.
“The issues are clearly about affordability of health care for people who are still standing on the outside of health care access and unable to afford it or unable to find affordable insurance coverage,” Wakefield said. “We’ve had a lot of improvement in terms of getting people access to insurance, but there are still segments of the population where affordability is a challenge.”

Provost Robert Groves has released a podcast series featuring interviews with Georgetown University faculty members to offer listeners a glimpse into their research, careers and stories before and during their time at the university.
The series of short interviews includes a diverse group of faculty from various academic departments and focuses on sharing the unique journeys that led the faculty to the university. Eight episodes have been published since June 3, 2019, and the most recent of the semimonthly episodes was released Oct. 1. 
 Groves aims to appeal to multiple audiences with the podcast and interviewee selections, specifically students and younger faculty, he said.
“I greatly enjoy the discussions, and they supplement my admiration for the great work of our faculty at Georgetown,” Groves wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Every podcast is different, and the topics end up being heavily shaped by the guest faculty member.”
Groves hopes that listening to the podcast will deepen Georgetown students’ perception of faculty by providing these selected stories. Otherwise, students are unable to learn the valuable lessons that faculty might not discuss in a classroom setting, according to Groves. The podcast is also designed to offer students confidence in their own future work in the fields of scholarship and research.
Groves intends the podcast to inspire younger members of Georgetown faculty by offering a glimpse into the demands and opportunities of their profession. The diversity of the experiences of those selected for the podcast speaks to the intellectual diversity present at Georgetown, Groves wrote.
“We seek to represent faculty from across the different fields in the university,” Groves wrote. “We want to give the audience a sense of how variable are the careers of faculty.”
 In the second episode of the podcast, ethics professor Nancy Sherman spoke about her college experience, her discovery of philosophy and her time working with the United States Naval Academy following a cheating scandal. The podcast format offers a great opportunity to share stories in a nonclassroom setting, according to Sherman.
“The conversation was wonderful. Bob [Groves] understood the broad nature of my work and my academic and research trajectory,” Sherman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think podcasts are a great way to learn about what our fellow colleagues and students are doing. They are good, informal ways of learning.”
 In his interview, the most recent in the series, sociology professor Brian McCabe recounted his time at Georgetown, as well as his research on socioeconomic justice in the housing sector. The opportunity to be featured on the podcast was liberating and removed the constrictions that being a professor can sometimes create, according to McCabe.
 “Often, students only see us as educators when, in fact, most of our time is spent researching and writing,” McCabe wrote in an email to The Hoya. “To me, the purpose is really to unmask the work that we’re doing, and to share the research that excites us—in my case, work on housing and urban inequality—and to give listeners a window into that world.”
 The Office of the Provost has other programs designed with similar goals of shedding light on Georgetown’s faculty, such as their blog, but Groves greatly enjoyed the podcast format and has plans of continuing the podcast.
 Groves hosts featured distinguished faculty members like McCourt School of Public Policy professor George Akerlof, who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2001. 
Groves also authors a blog published on the provost’s website, discussing the world of academia and key issues facing faculty, students and higher education.
“For most students, seeing faculty teach in classrooms robs them of a window into the deep devotion that faculty have to their own scholarship,” Groves wrote. “We want students to get an idea of why a faculty member would devote their entire life to a set of research issues.”

Evolving cultural attitudes towards women in leadership is crucial for promoting peace, former President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said Wednesday as part of a three-day workshop on conflict recovery. 
Sirleaf was the first woman elected as president in Africa and she served two terms from 2006 to 2018. Sirleaf was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 for her work defending women’s rights. 
Speaking to two undergraduate international relations classes taught by Georgetown University professor Lise Howard, who moderated the Oct. 2 event, Sirleaf answered a number of student questions on the importance of women’s empowerment and post-conflict policy both in politics and Liberian society. 
By the end of her time in office, Sirleaf felt as though she had changed the mindset of people in Liberia about what a woman in power could do. 
“It’s accepted now, even the little girls in our rural Liberia are known now to challenge,” Sirleaf said. “Challenge their teachers and say, ‘I can be what I want to be as a woman president.’”
Sirleaf strongly believes that, when given the opportunity, women are better at running a society than men. 
“I can’t tell you I have empirical evidence. I wish I could,” Sirleaf said. 
Director of the Global Human Development Program Steven Radelet approached Sirleaf about establishing a program for her at Georgetown after he served as an economic advisor to Sirleaf during her time in office.
Along with Dean of the School of the Foreign Service Joel Hellman, Radelet designed a three-day program that has been hosted three times since spring 2018. The program includes a series of faculty meetings, small group meetings about post-conflict reconstruction and classroom discussions and public speeches. 
Sirleaf’s most recent visit marked her fourth time coming to Georgetown. She is set to visit again in either March or April 2020, according to Radelet.
“I think there’s been pretty enthusiastic response on both parts,” Radelet said. “Each time she comes, I’m already getting requests from student groups who missed out this time to want to be on the schedule next time.”
Sirleaf was excited about the opportunity to participate in a number of in-depth interviews and discussions about Liberia as well as the chance to meet and engage with students, according to Radelet.
“She really likes meeting with students and she always says, she said it to me today, that she gets energized by meeting with students and hearing their questions and sensing their energy and their curiosity,” Radelet said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Gabriella Turrinelli (SFS ’23), a student in Howard’s introductory course, was struck by how much Sirleaf stressed the importance of women’s empowerment in politics.
“I thought it was really interesting, especially how she emphasized the role of not just getting women into politics but advancing women’s rights outside of politics within the rural parts of Liberia,” Turrinelli said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Prior to this event, Sirleaf’s audiences were limited and an attempt was made to change that this year, according to Howard,
“We had a little feedback that maybe we weren’t having quite enough broad student engagement. So that was when we decided to bring her to the introduction to IR class. Just so she could engage with a lot of students,” Howard said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Even after meeting with Sirleaf a number of times, Howard is still amazed by the work Sirleaf accomplished in the face of numerous obstacles, including the end of a civil war and the 2014 Ebola outbreak. 
“I tell my students that I’ve met a lot of important people over the course of my career, a lot of heads of state and famous people and in a variety of ways, and I still have that feeling of a little bit of starstruck trying to talk to her,” Howard said.
People should not underestimate the role that the United States has had in creating important international standards that other countries look to, Sirleaf said.
“The role that the United States has played, the influence that the United States has had, in the promotion of democracy and the protection of rights, is what has influenced and made so many countries that adopt similar policies, similar positions for their improvement,” Sirleaf said. “Don’t let it change.”

The Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, gardens and a research library for Byzantine and pre-Columbian studies, has plans to renovate its current greenhouse into an education space and construct another.
Planning for the project at Dumbarton Oaks, located in north Georgetown, began early this summer in coordination with the project’s lead New York-based architecture firm, Selldorf Architects. The official timeline for construction will be announced once designs are completed, according to Annabelle Selldorf, principal of Selldorf Architects.
Dumbarton’s new greenhouse will be more energy-efficient with solar panels, improved irrigation and climate control features included in the plans. 
The project is a part of the estate’s three-year Access Initiative to improve its campus, Dumbarton Oaks Communications Manager Erica Bogese said.
“We envision that this project will enhance sustainability, K-12 educational activities, and support of the arts and humanities at Dumbarton Oaks,” Bogese wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Dumbarton’s existing greenhouse was designed by Lawrence Grant White in 1925 and is one of the oldest structures standing on its campus. The current project, which integrates the old and new, is a unique opportunity, according to Selldorf.
“While on the one hand it is two distinct and separate buildings, and one is new construction while the other is the renovation of an existing structure, they are intertwined,” Selldorf wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Both are premised on finding a design solution that is appropriate for their beautiful campus that will allow them to increase their educational programs and continue the critical stewardship of the historic garden.”
The project will occur in two phases, delineated by work on the greenhouse and the education space separately, according to Lisa Green, a partner at Selldorf Architects. 
“The new greenhouse needs to be constructed first so that the activities taking place in the current greenhouse can move there,” Green wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Once that is done work on the historic greenhouse renovation will begin to transform that to the education space.” 
Dumbarton Oaks currently hosts an Early-Career Musician Residency, which provides young composers and musicians with resources to study classical music and exposes a younger generation to the genre, according to Bogese. The museum’s current musician-in-residence, American violinist Robyn Bollinger, is holding free pop-up concerts in the galleries throughout the fall months for local residents.
The renovated greenhouses will allow for programming that the entire Georgetown community will have the opportunity to enjoy, according to Bogese. 
“This space will also provide us with more room to support emerging artists,” Bogese wrote. “The Greenhouse renovation will allow us to expand the program by providing a studio for a future artist in residence, which will be one more way we can contribute to the vibrant arts and culture community of Georgetown.”
Dumbarton Oaks has been a hub for cultural, artistic and political discovery since its owners, Mildred and Robert Woods Bliss, donated the museum to Harvard University in 1940. The Dumbarton Oaks Museum houses collections of Byzantine and pre-Columbian art, as well as sprawling, picturesque gardens. The gardens, where the greenhouse project will take place, were designed by Beatrix Farrand, a noted landscape architect. 
The greenhouse project is a step in the right direction in terms of sustainability, according to Amelia Walsh (SFS ’20), president of the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network. 
“In general I’m really excited about any work that Dumbarton is able to do, as they work with leading conservationists and landscape architects and are thoughtful about how they approach sustainable development,” Walsh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m hopeful that Dumbarton continues to be transparent about where they source their energy from, and that they take both greenhouse gas emissions and conservation efforts into account, as is important with all energy projects!”

D.C. Circulator buses will now charge a $1 fare for travellers as of Oct. 1 following 10 months of allowing riders to travel for free.
Mayor Muriel Bowser had previously enacted the free ride policy as a part of her #FairShotFebruary initiative in 2019, and continued the program indefinitely until this month. Although the mayor’s budget proposal allocated $3.1 million to free circulator busing, the City Council rejected this proposal. 
The Circulator is a system of six bus routes throughout Washington, D.C., and into Rosslyn, Va., with buses scheduled to arrive at each stop every 10 minutes. After boarding, riders can pay the $1 fare in cash or with a SmarTrip Card, the same card used to ride the D.C. Metro service.
Linda Stuetz, a D.C. resident who is currently experiencing homelessness, said that the bus fares will have a negative impact on D.C.’s poorest residents. 
“This really hurts the poor people,” she said in an interview with The Hoya. “For example, last week I got so sick. If it wouldn’t have been free, I wouldn’t have been able to take the bus to see my doctor. When you live on the street or in a shelter, sometimes you don’t have a dollar.”
Many individuals in the D.C. homeless community benefited from Mayor Bowser’s free circulator ride initiative, according to Stuetz.
“It really helped,” she said. “If I had one dollar to my name, and this happens a lot, do I take the bus one way or do I go to McDonald’s and get something to eat from the dollar menu?” 
The Circulator was created by the District government in 2005, originally with the intention of allowing transportation for tourists around downtown D.C. When the fares were made free in January, Circulator ridership increased by 29%, or 850,000 trips, according to the District Department of Transportation. 
While the Circulator had always cost $1 for all trips before it was temporarily made free, bus transportation alternatives D.C. Metrobuses are $2.00 and $4.25 on express lines. The Circulator has six lines that cover Wards 1, 2, 3 and 6, while Metrobus is more extensive in its routes, covering all 8 Wards.  
Festus Kembubala, a five-year Circulator bus operator whose route runs through southeast D.C., felt a changing atmosphere both when the fare was lifted and when it returned.  
“When the fare was free, I realized a lot of people were happy,” he said. “People were able to save 40 dollars, 60 dollars, even 80 dollars a month because of the free fare.”
D.C. is not the only city to have implemented a free bus system. Baltimore has a free, privately owned circulator bus called the Charm City Circulator, which has similar qualities to D.C.’s current Circulator bus. The program benefits the low-income families who live near bus routes, but covers a total of three zip codes in Baltimore City out of a total of 20.
Despite the fact that the bus rides are no longer free, some riders still see the Circulator as an affordable option, according to recent Georgetown graduate Dina El-Saharty (GRD ’19).
“It’s still cheaper than everything else,” she said. “I used to go to Georgetown, so this was easier than taking the shuttle bus from Rosslyn, so I took it everyday until I graduated. Now I take it every other day to get to Georgetown and Foggy Bottom.”
Many of his riders have directed frustration with the change in fare price directly at bus operators, according to Kembubala.
“The people in Southeast, they don’t find it easy. They were so happy for the free rides, but when it comes to the point they have to pay, they don’t like to pay,” he said. “Sometimes it makes them become so aggressive to the operators and we just have to deal with it.”

The D.C. Department of Health ordered the shutdown of Glover Park pizza shop and hookah lounge Cafe Romeo’s Sept. 24 due to a vermin infestation and other health code violations.
The restaurant’s unsanitary conditions and rodent problems were the most significant violations of the D.C. Food Code. The D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs also ordered that the owners of Cafe Romeo’s vacate the building because of structural dangers, including extensive electrical issues.
Cafe Romeo’s closure will likely be temporary, however, according to D.C. Department of Health Public Affairs Specialist Alison Reeves. 
“Cafe Romeo’s will be reopened once they pass their restoration inspection, after they have corrected all the violations marked on their inspection report,” Reeves wrote in an email with The Hoya.
Cafe Romeo’s has been at its 2132 Wisconsin Ave. NW location for over 15 years, according to its website. 
This is not the restaurant’s first health code violation, according to the D.C. Department of Health. The D.C. Health Regulation and Licensing Administration has filed eight complaints against Cafe Romeo’s since November 2008. Several complaints reported unclean food contact surfaces, improper handling of food and the lack of necessary sanitary equipment and procedures.
The owner of Cafe Romeo’s, Davar Ashgrizzadeh, declined to comment.
Cafe Romeo’s pest problems, however, are not an isolated incident in the Georgetown area. Georgetown restaurant Moby Dick House of Kabob experienced a rodent infestation this past summer. The restaurant’s rat problems were revealed by a video posted online by FOX 5 DC on July 23 that caught several rats on camera within the establishment. 
Moby Dick was closed for over three weeks for the restaurant’s management to tackle the issue. After several structural changes were made to the building in order to combat the rat problem, Moby Dick reopened and has not experienced any more rodent visitors since.
These occurrences highlight the issues faced by the larger Georgetown community when it comes to pests. Almost every restaurant and vendor in the Georgetown area deals with rats on a daily basis, according to Moby Dick’s Chief Development Officer Alex Momeni.
“It’s a day-to-day struggle out in Georgetown,” Momeni said in an interview with The Hoya.
Rodents are a daunting problem for restaurants and homes across Washington, D.C. The neighborhoods of Columbia Heights, Park View and Bloomingdale reported the highest numbers of rat complaints made to the District’s 311 service request number in recent months. In 2018, D.C. received more than 6,000 rat complaints from the 311 line, an increase from the 5,000 calls it received in 2017.
Momeni argued that Georgetown’s location next to the Potomac River provides a comfortable area for rodents.
“Georgetown in particular happens to be near the water,” Momeni said. “And from what we’re gathering, it’s a very comfortable, resort-type situation for these things.”
A Whole Foods in Glover Park shuttered in March 2017 after experiencing a massive rodent and bug infestation. Although the grocery store intended to manage the pest problem, renovate and eventually reopen, a dispute with the landlord prevented Whole Foods’ return, according to Washington Business Journal. The store broke its lease by closing for over 60 days because of the health code violations, ultimately leading to its demise. 
As chronicled on the popular Instagram page @georgetown.hotmess, rats, dead and alive, are frequently seen around Georgetown University’s campus, including in Leo O’Donovan Dining Hall. A rat was spotted crawling on bags of potato chips in Wisemiller’s Deli in October 2017, and students circulated the resulting video around Facebook. 
The city’s government has made several efforts during the past few years to effectively end the rodent problem, including a recent push for the administration of rat birth control. Other efforts include the use of dry ice and solar trash cans. 
In order to combat pest issues in the Georgetown community, Momeni suggested that local restaurants with rat problems should consider temporarily closing down.
“If they can financially afford it, they should really consider potentially closing up for a few days or a week or two,” Momeni said. “And to do exactly what we did because it just seems to work really nicely for us.”
Momeni stressed the importance of government and community action when it comes to Georgetown’s rodent problem. 
“The good news is I know the D.C. mayor and the entire political scene out there is aware of this problem,” Momeni said. “They’re constantly coming up with new programs to help businesses combat this. I’m just hoping and praying they continue escalating their level of involvement and teaming up with businesses in the area and hopefully together we can start pushing these friendly neighbors out of the way.”

Tauheed Rahim II, also known as rapper Marco Pavé, was named as Georgetown’s first hip-hop artist-in-residence this fall, working directly with students through the department of performing arts and department of African American studies.
Before coming to Georgetown, Rahim, a hip-hop and performing artist and an educator and arts entrepreneurship advocate, served as a Memphis Music Initiative Teaching Fellow, bringing hip-hop music, culture and activism to middle and high school students.
Rahim will host a series of panels and events sponsored by the department of performing arts and the department of African American studies entitled, “Critical Frequencies: Live from the Southern hip-hop Stage,” over the 2019-20 school year. These events will discuss entrepreneurship, culture, fashion, politics, social justice and music business in the context of hip-hop. 
Rahim hopes the series will help students who are less familiar with hip-hop engage with the discipline. 
“You don’t have to be a rapper, you don’t have to be trying to make beats, you don’t have to do anything, you don’t have to be a practitioner of hip-hop to learn from hip-hop,” Rahim said in an interview with The Hoya. “I learn from hip-hop artists on the day to day by building confidence, by building self-efficacy, by building things that just help me navigate the world.” 
The series will also include events directed at students with a specific interest in music, like open studio sessions, beat-making workshops, as well as bring other artists to campus through the department of performing arts, according to Rahim. 
“If students are interested in coming in to check out how life in the studio is with the artist making a song, we’ll be doing stuff like that,” Rahim said.
Professor Anthony DelDonna, director of the Georgetown music program, hopes Rahim’s work will elevate the music department program by putting greater emphasis on hip-hop as an academic discipline, an area which had been missing from the American musical culture major until now, he said in an interview with The Hoya. 
“Our major is a major in American musical culture. So, what does that mean? The types of music that are created, practiced, performed in the Americas,” DelDonna said in an interview with The Hoya. “But it’s not just the classical tradition. It’s jazz, it’s blues, but what’s really been missing from our curriculum is hip-hop, which is a dominant cultural force.” 
Rahim will also be the first yearlong academic resident at Georgetown, which makes the project more ambitious than previous similar efforts that were semesterly positions, according to DelDonna.
“What we’ve always done is residencies, so a very limited impact where an artist or a group of artists will come in for a handful of days or maybe even a week at a time and work with students on a very limited engagement — a very focused, concentrated, intense engagement,” DelDonna said.
Rahim’s residency is sponsored by two departments, which offers a more integrative curriculum, according to professor Soyica Colbert, chair of the department of performing arts and professor of African American studies.
“This residency is also a collaboration with African American Studies, which both signals the interdisciplinarity of hip-hop Studies and the importance of the arts in various modes of knowledge production,” Colbert wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Much of Rahim’s musical and personal inspiration comes from his hometown of Memphis, Tenn., he said. His first philanthropic venture was a fundraiser called “Books on Beale,” which collected books and established centers to encourage higher literacy rates in the city. Rahim has traveled the United States to speak at universities about the use of the arts to affect social justice.
This series will emphasize the importance of southern hip-hop because of Rahim’s Tennessee upbringing, he said. 
“Memphis is a music town so everything about Memphis is around music: soul, jazz, the blues, all of those different types of songs were constantly in rotation in my house,” Rahim said. “I came of age listening to Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane, Lil Wayne, so in this 2005 to 2011 era was just like, very, very significant for southern rap but also for my own growth as an artist and a person.”
 The first Critical Frequencies event, “Sneakers and Speakers” will be held this Friday, Oct. 4, in McNeir Hall.
