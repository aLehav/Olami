After facing months of community opposition and bureaucratic delays, popular bagel deli Call Your Mother was granted a zoning variance Jan. 15, clearing the way for an expected opening by the end of the month.
The Washington, D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment voted unanimously Wednesday to grant Call Your Mother a zoning exception, allowing the bagel deli to serve hot food. Pushback from neighbors and community officials triggered a process that included four separate BZA hearings on the topic. 
The outcome is a long-awaited victory for the deli, according to founder and owner Andrew Dana.
“We are over the bagel moon,” Dana said in an interview with DCist. “We are thrilled that we can now toast bagels and top them for our customers.” 
Call Your Mother announced its plans to open on the corner of 35th and O streets in June. The space was formerly zoned as a retail space, but the bagel deli needed to be zoned as a corner store to be able to prepare hot foods. The proximity of another corner store, Wisemiller’s Deli, however, prohibited that option because of corner store rules. The BZA granted Call Your Mother an exception to the proximity rule, allowing it to go forward with the opening. 
The new bagel deli’s proximity to Georgetown University’s main campus sparked interest among students, some of whom started a petition in favor of Call Your Mother’s opening which garnered 476 signatures. The BZA’s decision proves that student voices can yield change, according to Georgetown University Student Association Senator Samuel Dubke (SFS ’21), who cosponsored a Nov. 24 resolution urging the granting of the zoning variance. 
“This is a huge victory for all of the Georgetown community, and will bring more business and dining options to the Hilltop,” Dubke wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Moreover, it demonstrates that student activists can work effectively with the wider business community to break through the District’s bureaucracy.”
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, a local government body of elected officials that represents Georgetown, endorsed the granting of the variance Jan. 7, with a 6-2 margin, according to The Georgetowner. The deli’s opening will improve food options in the Georgetown area, according to ANC 2E Commissioner Matias Burdman (COL ’21). 
“Call Your Mother’s opening is a major victory that will bring affordable and high quality food options to the university’s doorstep,” Burdman wrote in a statement to The Hoya.  
Tenants living in the buildings that neighbor the space led the opposition against granting the zoning variance. The opposition group appeared at all four of the BZA hearings to make its case. The vote was disappointing but not surprising, according to Melinda Roth (LAW ’03), a neighbor who was active in the opposition effort.
“It was completely an expected outcome,” Roth said in an interview with The Hoya. “It was clear that the BZA would try and find a way that they could allow Call Your Mother to operate the way that Call Your Mother wants to operate.” 
The granting of the variance is concerning because the building will be permanently zoned with the exception, according to Roth. Roth said she fears future tenants may not be as cognizant of neighbors’ concerns.
“Now that variance is with the building forever,” Roth said. “It could come in and be like some sort of other take-away food shop, which hasn’t promised to be a good neighbor, and isn’t a good neighbor.”
While disappointed in the BZA’s decision, Roth plans to support the Call Your Mother opening, she said.
“No matter what happens, you know I’ll be in line with everyone else,” Roth said. “You know I want them to succeed, and I wish them the best.”

Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) released a statement and contributed to legislation this week supporting the release of Cynthia Liu and Victor Liu (COL ’21) from China. 
Chinese authorities have prevented Liu and his older sister, Cynthia, who are U.S. citizens, from leaving China since June 2018 under an exit ban, which bars travelers from leaving the country. Warren and Markey, who represent the Liu siblings’ home state, released a Jan. 14 statement urging the Chinese government to release the Lius. The previous week, Cynthia penned a letter to Markey urging the U.S. government to push for their release, according to CNN.
Chinese police hope to compel the Lius’ estranged father, Liu Changming, to return to China to face criminal charges. Changming, who is accused of participating in a $1.4 billion fraud scheme, left China in 2007 and cut ties with the family. When the Liu siblings visited China with their mother, Sandra Han, to visit their dying grandfather in June 2018, authorities then imposed the exit ban blocking their return to the United States. The siblings have since lost contact with Han, who is being detained in a secret holding facility. 
The Liu siblings’ detainment is unwarranted, and their release is overdue, according to Warren.
“China’s use of exit bans on my constituents and other American citizens is unacceptable and must end,” Warren said in the shared press release. “The Liu siblings are confined to Chinese territory for no legitimate reason and it is long past time for them to come home. I’m glad to partner with Senator Markey on a bill that would hold the Chinese government accountable for this unjust policy.”
One day after issuing their statement, the Massachusetts senators collaborated with Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) (LAW ’90) on a related initiative. The senators introduced a bill that would revoke or deny visas to Chinese officials involved in implementing and enforcing exit bans on U.S. citizens. China has long used exit bans to keep Chinese dissidents and human rights activists from leaving the country, according to USA Today. In recent years, however, the Chinese government has started limiting the international travel of some foreign nationals. 
After the Massachusetts senators issued their news release, Georgetown University President John DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) advocated for the release of Liu in a Jan. 14 public statement. 
“Georgetown joins Senators Markey and Warren in urgently asking for the release of Victor and his sister Cynthia, both U.S. citizens,” DeGioia wrote. “Advocacy for Victor has ensured that his case has been brought forward at the highest levels of government and, as we continue to support Victor as a member of our Georgetown community, we sincerely hope a diplomatic solution can be reached for his return home as soon as possible.”
Georgetown administrators have pushed for Victor Liu’s release for over a year, according to a university spokesperson. DeGioia met with Liu in China in Fall 2018, and Georgetown officials have held meetings with Chinese authorities about facilitating Liu’s return home. However, in recent months, the university has faced mounting pressure from students concerned with Liu’s captivity to voice more public support for his expedited return. In November, the Asian American Student Association hosted an event at which students and faculty called on the university to consider new strategies to accelerate Victor Liu’s release. 
Evan Medeiros, a School of Foriegn Service professor specializing in U.S.-China relations who has been involved in Georgetown’s efforts to push for the Liu siblings’ release, attended the event. Georgetown officials have met with members of the Trump administration and the National Security Agency to facilitate an end to Victor Liu’s detainment, according to Medeiros. 
“Georgetown is fully committed to ensuring Victor returns to the United States as soon as possible,” Medeiros wrote in an email to The Hoya. “To that end, the University has been working closely with U.S. Government officials since June of 2018 to secure Victor’s release, and we will continue to advocate for the Administration to do the utmost to secure the earliest possible return of Victor to his home in the United States.”

We need to pressure Canada to lock up Meng Wanzhou, she never should have been released on bail.  If extradited to USA she needs to stay locked up here until conviction, then turned over to prison.   No bail.  No pre-lockup release.    
A covert operation needs 2 be implemented to sneak these 2 innocent people out of China.
Finally, the US needs to get serious with punishment of companies that use China parts in their product.  Citizens need to see if any part came from China then set it back on the shelf for hopefully no one to buy.

LEO MKT transitioned to reusable dishes and cutlery this semester as part of a broader campus pivot toward more sustainable dining practices. 
Previously, the food stalls on the main floor of Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall exclusively used disposable cutlery and dishware. The trash bins in upstairs Leo’s are now accompanied by racks, which are taken down to the dish room where used tableware is washed along with used dishes from the Fresh Food Company, according to a Jan. 6 Hoya Hospitality announcement. Compostable containers are still available by request for students taking their food to go. 
The transition to reusable utensils in upstairs Leo’s was led by a collaboration among Georgetown University’s Office of Sustainability, campus environmental advocacy groups and Hoya Hospitality, the university’s food provider, according to Director of the Office of Sustainability Audrey Stewart.
“We were thrilled to collaborate with student environmental clubs, Auxiliary Business Services and Hoya Hospitality last semester to help plan the reusable tableware initiative, and are glad to be able to take this additional step, in coordination with LEO MKT, to increase sustainability outcomes on campus,” Stewart wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network, one of the clubs involved in the effort, has been pushing to institute reusable tableware for years, according to GREEN President Noelle Gignoux (SFS ’22). The cost of transitioning away from single-use dishes and utensils posed a significant challenge to the push for the new system, according to Gignoux.
The new dining system will drastically cut back waste, according to Gignoux. 
“It’s easy to write off the amount of waste that used to be produced upstairs, because we never actually see the sheer magnitude of waste that we produce,” Gignoux wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This new setup makes infinitely more sense because we are instantly cutting down on garbage that goes directly into the landfill.” 
GREEN members Amelia Walsh (SFS ’20) and Caroline Flibbert (COL ’21) began advocating for more sustainable dining practices in Leo’s in Fall 2017, according to Flibbert. After about two years of meetings with Georgetown and Aramark, their student-led activism eventually yielded funding from the Business Auxiliary Officer to pay for reusable tableware. 
“What we pitched to Aramark and the business auxiliary office over and over again was just to go back to reusable cutlery, reusable tableware and we did receive a lot of pushback at first because of the potential cost issues,” Flibbert said in an interview with The Hoya. “We managed to break through those talks, which had spanned over two years now, and received the funding for reusable tableware to get back to honestly being a more sustainable dining hall experience.”  
Reusable plates and flatware were used throughout upstairs Leo’s before the 2017 renovations, according to Associate Director of Business and Operations David Schoen. Upstairs Leo’s switched to disposable materials because of the student body’s request for more on-the-go options. However, Leo’s soon realized that too much waste was being generated by the increased use of paper products, Schoen wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In addition to reducing waste, switching to reusable tableware will help improve Georgetown Dining’s post-consumer composting, according to Schoen.
“We are glad to be able to make the switch to reusable plateware and flatware, which overall is more environmentally-friendly and sustainable than disposable flatware,” Schoen wrote. “This will reduce the amount of paper waste generated and will allow for more accurate sorting of food waste, which is diverted from the waste stream to be composted.”
Preparations were made at the end of last semester and over break to have the new system ready by the start of the spring semester, Schoen added.
“The reusable materials arrived on site at the end of the Fall semester, and all materials were set up over the winter break,” Schoen wrote. “Signage has been added to help direct students, faculty, staff, and guests on where to place their plateware when they are done eating, and all food service staff have been trained on transport, washing, and stocking procedures.”
The change follows a campuswide shift toward more environmentally friendly practices. In January, the university established the Laudato Si’ Fund, which sets aside $300,000 in grants to help fund student-, faculty- and staff-proposed projects that seek to combat local and global sustainability challenges. In September, 50 students living on and off campus began composting their residential food in a pilot program organized by Compost Cab, a compost pickup service, and GREEN.
Even though the upstairs Leo’s transition represents a positive step toward eco-friendly habits, the university should expand its efforts to other areas on campus, according to Gignoux.
“The next issue to tackle would hopefully be the dining options in the Leavey center, such as getting recycling in Royal Jacket and reusable options there, as well as reusable dishware options at the other dining services,” Gignoux wrote. “Composting is also another area in which Georgetown has room to improve — GREEN has been taking steps to make it more accessible to the student body, but it would be fantastic to see the university step up on this issue and offer more post-consumer composting options, as well as education on the issue.”
The decision by Georgetown and Aramark, the university’s food service provider, to introduce reusable tableware sets a valuable precedent in sustainable practices, Gignoux wrote. 
“This is a huge step because it shows that the university and Aramark recognize their responsibility to be good environmental stewards, setting an example for the students that pass through the university that our small, everyday actions have large environmental consequences,” Gignoux wrote. 
Student-led advocacy’s success in the Leo’s Goes Green initiative should inspire other student activists to take action for their cause, Flibbert said. 
“We definitely thought that this was an excellent process that definitely shows that students can take initiative and run with it, generate enough support and actually have a positive outcome at this school which I think is the biggest takeaway from this project,” Flibbert said. “If you see an issue on campus that you think needs to be addressed, just go out and address it.” 
This article has been updated to include Walsh and Flibbert’s perspective.

Congressional pushback on presidential foreign policies is essential to quelling the escalating tensions between Iran and the United States, Program Director of the Institute for Policy Studies Phyllis Bennis said in a panel Monday.
The event, titled “Iran on the Brink of War: A Teach-In,” was sponsored by the Program on Justice and Peace and the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service. Panelists for the event included Bennis, Georgetown University graduate student in philosophy Keyvan Shafiei and Deputy Director of the Arab American Institute Omar Baddar. The event was moderated by professor of philosophy and Co-director of the Program on Justice and Peace Mark Lance.
Less than two weeks before the event, the Trump administration ordered an airstrike that killed Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani and several Iraqi militia officers Jan. 3. The airstrike followed an attack by the Iranian militia on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, on Dec. 31. While the Trump administration has claimed that killing Soleimani was a necessary defensive action to deter future Iranian attack plans, many Iraqi and Iranian officials have condemned the strike as an act of aggression and have warned the United States to expect retaliation, according to The Washington Post.
Given public concern about executive overreach when declaring war, Congress can best deescalate the current situation between the United States and Iran, according to Bennis.
“Right now Congress is the key,” Bennis said. “There are finally people in Congress willing to fight back just a little bit against these rogue administrations that believe that presidents have the right to just go ahead and go to war wherever they want upon whatever excuse they want for whatever reason without any concern for the consequences.”
From 1998 until his death, Soleimani was an Iranian Major General in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces that protects the country’s Islamic republic political system. In retaliation for killing Soleimani, Iran fired missiles at two Iraqi military bases in Irbil and Al Asad that housed U.S. forces Jan. 8, according to BBC. 
Such retaliation is not a cry for war, but a sound response to the loss of the Iranian leader, according to Shafiei.
“I think the response was carried out quite reasonably given the enormity of the loss for the Iranian government and the Iranian regime,” Shafiei said. “I’m not sure anyone is really beating on the drums for war in Iran; the people certainly are not.”
While Soleimani had been accused of implementing violent domestic and foreign policies, the United States did not have the right to kill him, according to Bennis.
“Even if this guy had been a terrorist, had attacked civilians, does that give us the right to just kill him because we found him in our sights?” Bennis said. “That is what we have come to. The notion that it was somehow okay to kill him is driven by this global war on terror assumption.”
Diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran worsened after the Trump administration pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in May 2018, according to Reuters. The JCPOA, signed in 2015 under President Barack Obama, limited the scope of Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for easing economic sanctions. 
While pulling out of the nuclear deal has reportedly been the primary reason behind the contentious relationship between the two nations, the principal conflict between the two countries is regional authority issues, Baddar said. 
“The fundamental adversarial position we have with Iran has to do with the fact that Iran has an independent foreign policy, so it does not mesh with ours,” Baddar said. “It’s about the fact that the U.S. has a regional project dominance and that Iran is challenging that dominance and trying to spread its own dominance on the region.”
Later in 2018, the United States reintroduced sanctions on Iranian oil assets and trading services, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Sanctions, like war, have a crippling effect on the nation and its people, according to Shafiei, whose father suffered from a rare disorder and was unable to receive necessary medicine as a result of U.S. sanctions on Iran.
“When politicians tell you that sanctions are an alternative to war, do not be fooled. They are violence.” Shafiei said. “Sanctions hurt people and they’ve hurt me, and I will do everything that I can in my power to try and make sure that the people I am voting for in this upcoming election know that I do not support sanctions.”
Even if the Trump administration does not intend to incite a war with Iran, its current actions have further destabilized the two nations’ relationship and have also caused Iranians to suffer for their government’s actions, according to Baddar.
“I think Donald Trump might believe himself when he says he doesn’t want a war with Iran,” Baddar said. “But he has charted out a course in U.S. policy that has guaranteed a confrontation with Iran by tearing up the nuclear deal, shutting down any avenue for diplomacy, by imposing crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy, sanctions that increase the Iranian people’s suffering as a means of pressuring the Iranian government to change its behavior.”

Over two-thirds of respondents in a Georgetown University Student Association senate survey identify as ethnically nonwhite, according to an internal demographic survey presented at a Jan. 12 weekly senate meeting. 
Senators have been required to fill out a demographic survey since a bylaw amendment introduced by the 2017-2018 GUSA senate, according to later legislation. The most recent dataset, obtained by The Hoya, shows 31% identify their ethnicity as white, 31% as Latino, 24% as Asian and 14% as black. The survey question about ethnicity received 29 responses, though 28 students currently serve on the senate. 
The GUSA senate represents a student body that identified as 50.1% white during the 2018-2019 school year, according to data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics, a research branch of the United States Department of Education. 
In recent years, GUSA has become more effective at promoting diversity and inclusivity, according to Senator Eric Bazail-Eimil (SFS ’23). 
“I think GUSA is definitely making steps in the right direction,” Bazail-Eimil wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As the electoral demographic information presented to us this past meeting showed, the Senate has clearly become far more diverse, representing far more communities than it did in years past.”
Past efforts to elevate inclusivity in GUSA included a campuswide referendum certifying that senators be elected by class instead of geographic location, intended to increase diversity in the senate in 2017. 
The statistics also revealed that 60% of the 30 responses to a question about gender identity indicated male identity and 40% indicated female identity. Seven women won seats during last year’s spring senate elections, marking an increase in female representation compared to recent years. In the fall 2018 GUSA senate elections, which filled 14 senate seats, the student body elected only one woman, Hayley Grande (COL ’21). Additionally, the 2018-19 senate included an all-male freshman class. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 55.9% of the Georgetown undergraduate community identifies as female.
Though GUSA has become more inclusive, it must continue its efforts to increase female representation in the senate, according to Bazail-Eimil. 
“We still have progress to make in ensuring that women are represented in all the branches equitably,” Bazail-Eimil said. “But I credit this administration’s hard work at recruiting candidates of color and bringing in lots of people into the executive and other agencies from all parts of campus.”
The survey revealed that 37% of the 27 respondents to a question about sexual orientation identify as LGBTQ while 63% identify as straight. Additionally, 55% of 28 respondents to a question about religious identity identify as Christian and 43% identify as nonreligious, while 3.5% identify as Muslim and 3.5% identify as Hindu.
In a nod to GUSA’s growing diversity, Senator Zach Volpe (SFS ’23) recommended introducing legislation Jan. 12 that would push back GUSA’s Sunday meetings to 6 p.m. to accommodate students who want to attend Sunday religious services. Volpe indicated that the current GUSA meeting time was particularly an issue for Hindu students, as it conflicted with Weekly Āratī, a Hindu service held by Georgetown’s Dharmic Life on Sundays at 5 p.m.
This time change would accommodate both GUSA senators and members of the Georgetown student body interested in attending GUSA meetings, according to Volpe. 
“I think part of this is making sure that all people of all faiths can attend public meetings and also feel comfortable to run for office knowing that they’re not going to have to compromise their religious practice for serving in public office,” Volpe said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Volpe’s own involvement in the Hindu community on campus brought the time conflict to his attention, he said. 
“The issue basically started with myself, in that I am both a practicing Lutheran and Hindu,” Volpe said. “I started talking to some other people in the Hindu community about this and they voiced that they felt that there was somewhat of an injustice.”
The new legislation will help the GUSA senate best serve the Georgetown community, GUSA Senator Eddie Galvan (MSB ’23) said. 
“I think it’s important to take into consideration all of the groups across campus,” Galvan said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’re supposed to represent our student body.”
This proposed legislation would demonstrate GUSA’s commitment to representing the interests of all communities at Georgetown, according to Bazail-Eimil.
“I think this change will be a win-win for all Senators, regardless of their faith affiliation,” Bazail-Eimil wrote. “It would definitely show that GUSA gives important consideration to the needs of other communities, religious, ethnic, racial, etc. when forming policies and representing the student body.”

Artists have a responsibility to be honest and vulnerable in their work, rapper and poet Noname said at an event Wednesday.
The event, titled “Existing in Multitudes: Noname,” was hosted by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund. At the event, Chicago-native Fatimah Warner, known professionally as Noname, discussed themes of race, sex and politics as they relate to her personal experience creating music and poetry. The event was moderated by associate professor of African American Studies Zandria Robinson.
Though artists should not feel obligated to share personal experiences with their audiences, they should strive to be genuine and vocal in their work, according to Noname.
“When it comes to our responsibility to talk about black flight and to keep going through — ’cause I mean it’s traumatic to revisit all of this in your work all the time — I don’t think it’s our responsibility to do that necessarily,” Noname said. “But I do think all artists, and particularly black artists, I think it’s crucial for us to be at the very least vulnerable in our music.”
Noname, who first came into prominence for her debut mixtape released in 2016, spoke about her own experience during the production of her debut album, “Room 25.” The album, which was released in Sept. 2018, received widespread critical acclaim, with Rolling Stone deeming Noname one of the best rappers alive.
“Room 25” deals with more serious and personal themes, according to Noname. The increased vulnerability of this album made Noname feel more concerned with public reception, she said.
“With bodies of art, the public, the audience, they decide who you are based on material. That was a struggle for me. I’ve never been in the public eye, so coming into ‘Room 25,’ I definitely came in with expectations based off of what other people were expecting of me,” Noname said. “I wanted to get my point across that I’ve matured, and this music is more serious sonically and lyrically.”
Aside from being in the public eye, another struggle musicians face is the mass consumption of music with little regard for the meaning behind the art, according to Noname.
“When I’m performing or when I’m in a space, and people are just consuming blindly without any sort of deeper — not that you need to sit and have deep analysis — but just even emotionally thinking about what is this person going through that they would write this type of music,” Noname said. “I guess that’s just hip-hop right now. We’re not really taught to engage with hip-hop in a way that’s beyond just consumption.”
Despite this public tendency to focus primarily on blind consumption, Noname continues to emphasize the underlying themes and political commentary behind her music, especially those regarding her own identity, she said.
Her identity as a black woman is something that is deeply important to her, Noname said.
“I’ve only experienced life as black, and then woman, so everything that I think about always comes from blackness first,” Noname said. “I never felt oppressed as a woman in a way that I experienced it being black.”
Given the largely male-dominated spaces within the black community, Noname said that she hopes her music will inspire black women to take on a more active role within their own communities.
“Leadership in the black community, especially in the organizing spaces, they’re romanticized, and a lot of the leadership that we’ve had has predominantly been male,” Noname said. “I hope that black women listening to my music feel empowered to link up with other people around them. I don’t want them to just consume the music and be like this is just for therapy, this is just for when I’m feeling sad. I want it to motivate people to get up and to do something.”
Having found her way into the hip-hop scene through slam poetry, Noname also emphasized the importance of finding a community in art and music.
“What’s very crucial is to just really search and find community or create it yourself,” Noname said. “Music is such a communal act, unless you’re like a genius and you’re one of those people who can just produce a whole thing on their own, but most of us need outside help.”

Annie Selak was named the new associate director of the Georgetown University Women’s Center Jan. 8, marking the first time two full-time staff members have worked in the center since Oct. 2018. 
In her new role, Selak will help current director Shiva Subbaraman advance the mission of the Women’s Center and assess which topics or projects the center will focus on in the upcoming year. Subbaraman, who has served as the director of the LGBTQ Resource Center since its founding in 2008, was appointed to simultaneously direct the Women’s Center in November.
High student traffic in both centers and few staff members available to work in either prompted the Women’s Center to hire another full-time staffer, according to Subbaraman.
“There was a lot more increased demand from both undergraduate and graduate students but it was still a one-person office. It was clear that getting a second person was not an option,” Subbaraman said in an interview with The Hoya. “At the end of the day, if students need to be served, they need more than one adult in each office and before there was just one.”
Former Director Laura Kovach resigned from her position as director of the Women’s Center in October 2018. Former programming director Karla Rondon continued normal programming with the center until her departure in June 2019, after which three undergraduate students ran the center for over a year. 
As a result, student interns had to take on increased leadership responsibilities that usually would have fallen to the director, such as training new interns.
Selak’s hiring will allow the Women’s Center to better cater to Georgetown students’ needs, Caroline Sarda (COL ’20), an undergraduate staffer who helped run operations while the center looked for a director, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“I definitely think Annie will help push the centers in the right direction,” Sarda wrote. “I think what we’ve learned from the past semester is that we really need to re-engage with students and what they need and want from the Women’s Center, and I think Annie’s extensive experience working with students will be really great in that process.”
Prior to working at Georgetown, Selak worked at the University of Notre Dame, where she helped students with topics ranging from student leadership and development to sexual assault prevention and response, according to a Jan. 8 email announcement of Selak’s appointment.
The hiring of Selak follows the fall appointment of Amena Johnson as associate director to the LGBTQ Resource Center, working under Subbaraman. Both Selak and Johnson come to their positions as the centers plan to restructure, according to Subbaraman. Previously, the two centers operated as separate entities, but now the centers share a director and will begin collaborating on more operations and initiatives. 
As part of the restructuring, the three full-time staff members plan to work to their professional strengths across both centers, facilitating programming and outreach. The changes will not diminish the individual identities of the two centers, according to Subbaraman.
“The two centers will remain separate in terms of their function and their audience. They will have distinct identities, but for all intents and purposes, the three professional staff here will work across both,” Subbaraman said.
The increased professional presence in both centers will allow student volunteers and staffers to better serve students on Georgetown’s campus, according to Sarda.
“I think all of the staff changes this year will enhance the work of both centers,” Sarda wrote. “Having more staff members to look to for guidance will certainly make student workers’ lives easier and more effective, and will also help grow the reach of the centers on campus.” 
The restructuring reflects current dialogues about the interconnectedness between the LGBTQ and women’s communities, according to Subbaraman.
“There was a big shift in how current generations of students think about gender. Even before Laura left, the two centers collaborated a lot to talk about what is gender,” Subbaraman said. “The reason the LGBT Center has been very successful is that we have had a very broad vision, and that is the vision we want to bring to the Women’s Center.”
As the centers move forward, Subbaraman plans to involve students in discussions this spring about the new structure to ensure the centers fully support the Georgetown community’s needs, according to Subbaraman.
“We will try to start conversations with students to ask where are the overlaps, where are the differences and what needs to remain separate between the two centers,” Subbaraman said. “By having me oversee both, my vision is that the three of us will work together to be available for all women students.”

Students of Georgetown Inc., commonly known as The Corp, plans to begin selling nicotine cessation products at Vital Vittles in coming weeks, ahead of a universitywide tobacco ban that will go into place Aug. 15. 
Beginning in August, smoking and other tobacco use will be prohibited within Georgetown University-owned buildings and grounds, the university announced last April. Prohibited items include all e-cigarettes, including juuls and vapes. The ban comes more than two years after students voted in a student government referendum in favor of creating a smoke-free campus.
Georgetown University Student Association Chair of Student Health Casey Kozak (NHS ’20) has pushed for the ban’s implementation since her appointment in 2018, she said. Kozak encouraged The Corp to begin selling cessation products such as nicotine gum or lozenges to help smokers quit smoking.
“The Corp was really open to the idea of bringing in cessation products,” Kozak said. “If we are going to put this ban in place we also need to have solutions available for people who are looking to quit.”
The decision to begin selling cessation products was driven by an entirely student-led initiative, according to Chairman of The Corp Joshua Sirois (SFS ’20).
“We as a company recognize the desire of students and Georgetown community members to transition away from nicotine and tobacco products,” Sirois wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We equally recognize that nicotine patches, mints, and gums are better alternatives.”
The university offers smoking and tobacco cessation support for students, faculty and staff. University resources include workshops and personalized cessation programs, which are available through all university-sponsored medical plans and the Student Health Center, according to Associate Vice President for Benefits, Payroll and Wellness and Chief Benefits Officer Charles DeSantis. 
The university plans to continue to support students as the university shifts to a smoke-free campus, according to DeSantis.
“We realize that the Smoke and Tobacco-Free Policy may significantly impact members of our community,” DeSantis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We aim to create a supportive transition ahead of the policy’s fall 2020 implementation.”
The university is preparing for the ban’s enactment by displaying signage around campus to notify campus visitors and increasing communication about the smoke- and tobacco-free policy with the campus community, according to DeSantis.
Students with multiple infractions of the smoke- and tobacco-free policy may be considered in violation of the Code of Student Conduct and will be subject to disciplinary action, according to the smoke- and tobacco-free policy. Repeat violations by any faculty or staff member will be handled through normal university processes.
While The Corp was originally supposed to receive a shipment of the new cessation products Wednesday, the products were mistakenly not included with the shipment, according to Sirois.
“We have been awaiting the arrival of the shipment, and unfortunately, the products were not included with our order,” Sirois wrote. “We’re contacting our vendor to understand what went awry, but we now are uncertain of when we will receive the products and be able to begin sales.”
Though The Corp currently sells JUUL products and traditional cigarettes in its Hoya Snaxa and Vital Vittles locations, the stores plan to halt sales of tobacco products in tandem with the shift to the tobacco-free campus, according to Sirois.
“The Corp has full intentions of ceasing the sale of tobacco products prior to the onset of the tobacco-free policy this fall,” Sirois wrote. “The Corp will begin phasing out nicotine products over the summer of 2020.”
The high cost of cessation products often presents a barrier to students trying to quit smoking, according to Kozak. The price of one package of cigarettes in Washington, D.C., is around $10. A two-week supply of nicotine patches costs upward of $50 at CVS, while a package of 100 pieces of nicotine gum costs $45. 
“The biggest issue was actually a cost barrier,” Kozak said. “A lot of people I talked to said they would go to CVS or wherever and get patches, and they said they are really expensive and they know in the long-term quitting might save them money on cigarettes, but in that moment it’s easier to go for the draw of cigarettes that are cheaper than the patches.”
Sirois said he hopes the availability and affordability of cessation products within The Corp will help students who are trying to quit.
“While I cannot speak to the exact costs of the products at this time, I can say that we sought out the most affordable products for students,” Sirois said. “We will be incredibly receptive to feedback to ensure students are satisfied with their choice of product.”
This article has been updated to correctly attribute the final quotation to Sirois.

Active demonstrations supplement individual lifestyle changes in making strides towards combating climate change, according to actress and activist Jane Fonda at a Jan. 7 event.
The event, titled “This is Not a Drill: A Discussion with Jane Fonda on Climate Change,” was hosted by the Georgetown Environment Initiative and the Kalmanovitz Initiative on Labor and the Working Poor, a research group that develops policy and strategies to improve American workers’ lives. The dialogue was led by Director of the Georgetown Environment Initiative Peter Marra.
While reducing meat and fish consumption or buying an electric car are important steps toward alleviating the effects of climate change, individuals need to think bigger when it comes to combating such a time sensitive issue, according to Fonda.
“It’s a good place to start, but it’s not the place to stop,” Fonda said. “Our individual lifestyle choices can’t be scaled up in time. Time is the issue. We only have 10 years to do something that is probably the biggest challenge that humans have ever faced.”
Fonda, a longtime climate activist, moved to Washington, D.C., and created Fire Drill Fridays, a weekly march on Capitol Hill in which she and other demonstrators engage in protests and acts of civil disobedience to fight for climate justice. 
Fonda found inspiration for Fire Drill Fridays after reading Naomi Klein’s “On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal.” The book specifically referenced teen climate activist Greta Thunberg and other youth climate activists, all of whom served as further inspiration for Fonda’s move to D.C. and creation of the weekly protests, she said.
“I said, ‘I’m gonna move. Greta says get out of your comfort zone, so I’m moving to D.C.,’” Fonda said. “‘I’m gonna camp out in front of the White House for a year.’”
Fonda said Fire Drill Fridays were her way of joining youth strikers in demonstrating against climate change.
“The young student activists here in D.C. agreed that they would share their Friday protests with me, and so that’s what got me here,” Fonda said. “I’m very very moved by what’s happened.” 
Since the first Fire Drill Friday in October 2019, turnout at the protests has increased. Around 500 protestors attended the most recent Fire Drill Friday on Jan. 10, which was Fonda’s final climate rally in D.C. before moving back to California. 
While the movement hopes to enact widespread change, specific areas of focus include advocating for the regulation of the fossil fuel industry and the Green New Deal, a congressional resolution to address climate change, Fonda said.
“At Fire Drill Fridays, we talk about the Green New Deal, but then we add on no fossil fuel expansion and phase out of existing fossil fuels with a just transition for the workers. Those are the main demands,” Fonda said. “We can have all the windmills and solar collectors in the world, and if they keep drilling and fracking and refining and turning stuff into plastic and everything, we’re never gonna solve the problem.”
Fonda’s activist experience is not limited to climate justice. She was a vocal opponent to the Vietnam War in the 1970s and has continued to be outspoken on other issues including women’s rights and Native American rights. In 2017, Fonda came to campus to speak about unfair labor practices within the services industry.
Activism not only helps stress the urgency of an issue, but also helps to mobilize more people to join in the push for change, Fonda said.
“Activism, and the kind of things we’ve been doing with Fire Drill Fridays, is creating community,” Fonda said. “We have to fight for community in the sense that we are interdependent, that we have to stick together, that it’s gonna take all of us, so I highly advocate activism.”

This article exactly captures Fonda’s message and relates it to the reader in a clear. concise tone. It is great to see Georgetown playing a role and getting out the need for us to combat climate change. I think the writed shouold start some sort of Fire Drill Fridays diary for The Hoya.
Quite well written!

Select students in the McDonough School of Business’ MBA program began classes for a new certificate program centered around business sustainability this semester. 
The certificate in sustainable business will focus on general business approaches to environmentalism, with specific emphasis on supply chain management, the general management of the goods and services supplied to a business and corporate environmental sustainability. MSB certificates provide students the opportunity to supplement general curriculum requirements with specific topics.
Inspiration for the certificate first developed about five years ago when elective courses about sustainable business were created by MSB professor Vishal Agrawal, who will serve as academic director of the certificate program, Agrawal said in an interview with The Hoya.
“For the last four or five years, I started developing electives on this topic so that was sort of my goal initially,” Agrawal said. “So that was sort of the impetus behind developing a certificate in this case, a way for students to signal their experience, their qualifications and their knowledge in this space.”
Adding the certificate to the MSB not only reflects a demand by businesses to further address the topic in MBA programs, but also promotes Georgetown’s Jesuit teaching values, Paul Almeida, MSB dean and William R. Berkley chair, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“As companies are increasingly focused on sustainable business practices, it is essential that we strengthen our curricular offerings in this area,” Almeida wrote. “We have a longstanding Jesuit tradition of teaching our graduates how to do right by their companies while also doing right by the world. This certificate is another way in which we can leverage the unique character of Georgetown to ensure we are educating students to become principled leaders in an increasingly complex world.”
Under the new certificate, students will complete a 10.5-credit combination of core and elective courses relevant to the program, according to the press release. Two courses, “Environmentally Sustainable Operations and Business Models” and “Corporate Social Responsibility,” are required to complete the certificate in addition to 4.5 credits from a list of approximately six approved electives. 
Though the required courses in the program provide a comprehensive view of the topic, Agrawal additionally plans to implement supplemental activities to further distinguish the program from other certificates.
“Those two required courses together sort of really provide a good encompassing of for-profit versus non-profit, and social versus environmental, and sort of laying down the groundwork for sustainable business,” Agrawal said. “Now the other thing which will be going along with this is that we’ll be planning a bunch of different activities: case competitions, industry events, career and networking events, to sort of really provide way more than just ticking the boxes.”
The first class of students in the program began the certificate at the start of the spring 2020 semester, and applications for the next cohort are currently open.
Though the program is currently in its first semester, there are already plans and policies in place to enhance the program in the future, Prashant Malaviya, associate professor of marketing and senior associate dean of MBA programs, wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The way this certificate and all of our other certificates evolve over time is essentially by an addition of new electives that are relevant for the certificate or through the revision of current courses that are part of the certificate,” Malaviya wrote. “We do an ongoing curricular review and innovation process and these certificates would be subject to the same continuous innovation process for the curriculum and whatever new innovations are happening in the business world should get reflected in what we include in the curriculum of the certificates.”
The environmental sustainability certificate joins two existing certificates within the MBA program, nonmarket strategies and consumer analytics and insights.
Though there is not currently much overlap between the certificates, Agrawal hopes to emphasize interconnectedness between the three options in the future to build a more comprehensive program.
“I think this year’s class can share certificates if they like without double conflicting courses, so there’s some coordination already happening,” Agrawal said. “I see a lot of scope for people to sort of play at the intersection of these certificates and in the future hopefully we’ll find ways to collaborate on it.”

Georgetown University Law Center named international justice and war crimes expert Anna Cave as its new executive director of the Center on National Security and the Law, after a monthslong search to fill the role.
Cave replaces Nadia Asancheyev (LAW ’06), who served six years as executive director of the center, a department of the Law Center that emphasizes scholarship and experiential learning initiatives for graduate students enrolled in the program. Cave’s appointment was announced Dec. 9.
In her new role, Cave will focus on promoting diversity in all facets of the center, she said.
“How do we ensure that there is diversity of expertise, diversity of backgrounds?” Cave said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think that’s an area where the field really needs to grow. It’s not a particularly diverse field, so the Center can help educate and mentor a diverse next generation of national security experts.” 
Cave hopes to direct the center to look more closely at the real-world effects of national security policies, she said.
“It’s easy to focus on the nitty-gritty of the law or these abstract principles — so separation of powers, checks and balances, or what it means to fight terrorism,” Cave said. “But, what does that actually mean for the people who are affected by our national security bureaucracy, policy, legal framework? What is the human element?” 
The Master of Laws Guide ranked the Law Center as the No. 1 program for “National Security / International Security Law” in the United States. As executive director of the center, Cave will help bolster the school’s reputation in the field, according to Executive Vice President and Georgetown Law Dean William Treanor.
“In light of the school’s position as a national leader in the field, she will have the opportunity to help to advance the conversation in ways that strengthen U.S. national security and rule of law,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya.
National security and rule of law go hand in hand, according to Cave. By studying the intersection of the two fields, the center can help enact positive policy change, according to Cave.
“I hope that the center that we build can have an impact in the world and that we can take and translate the research, and identify some of the key problems and then really experiment and innovate possible solutions,” Cave said. “You really need to have a national security system and approaches and policies and laws that are undergirded by rule of law principles.”
Prior to joining the center, Cave worked in national security and foreign policy positions in the Department of State and U.S. government. Cave served as the director for Central Africa on the National Security Council and helped to advise, support and coordinate the U.S. executive branch’s response to security crises in Central Africa, she said.
Her time at the NSC taught her critical decision-making skills and gave her real-life experience, Cave said.
“You get to see all of the permutations of U.S. interests, U.S. power, U.S. values, when to restrain and hold back, how to balance competing interests,” Cave said. “That kind of glimpse behind the curtain of how the national security apparatus actually works was incredibly valuable.”
Cave most recently served as the founding director of the Ferencz International Justice Initiative, a division of the Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, which works to prevent genocide and other crimes against humanity. Leading the initiative in its early stages also prepared Cave for her role as executive director of the center, she said.
“That was really creating something new, and launching something new — in a big institution,” Cave said. “So creating a new strategy, and then figuring out how to implement it, and understanding the comparative advantage that your institution has, the needs in the field that you’re working in, and the way in which those two things can come together to create something new.” 
Cave’s diverse past experiences will serve her well as she joins the center, Treanor wrote.
“Anna brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise: she has experience in private practice, government, and the nonprofit sector, so she understands critical questions from a number of perspectives,” Treanor wrote.

The Office of Planning and Facilities Management is investigating the cause of a fire that broke out in a private office in Healy Hall on the evening of Jan. 5, according to a Georgetown University spokesperson.
The Georgetown University Police Department and the Washington, D.C. Fire and EMS Department responded to a fire alarm that sounded at 7:25 p.m. when no one was in the building. The fire tripped the building’s sprinkler system, which extinguished the fire, according to a university spokesperson. 
The office is housed in the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, located on the fourth floor of Healy. An electrical issue most likely ignited the fire, according to acting Kennedy Institute Director Daniel Sulmasy. 
“There were no flammable liquids, candles, or holiday decorations in the office, and it was unoccupied at the time, so none of these can have been causative,” Sulmasy wrote in a Jan. 9 email to The Hoya. “An electrical cause is most likely, but formal investigations are ongoing.” 
Members of the community, many of whom were off campus for winter break, were notified of a fire investigation in Healy at 7:32 p.m via HOYAlert, a notification system that delivers news of emergencies to students, staff and faculty.
While Healy did not suffer any structural damage, the fire damaged the office and adjoining rooms, according to Sulmasy.   
“The office sustained significant damage and many books and papers were damaged or destroyed — either by fire or water from the sprinkler,” Sulmasy wrote. “Carpets in several adjacent offices were made wet by the sprinkler system, and there was water damage on the third floor, but the fire was wholly contained within the one office and did not spread.” 
Previously, smoke from a mechanical failure triggered a fire alarm in Healy in February 2019. The alarm led to a complete evacuation of the building. D.C. Fire and EMS determined that the smoke resulted from a defective fan belt on a heating, ventilation and air conditioning unit rather than from a fire. During that incident, 45 personnel were dispatched as part of a predetermined procedure in the event of a potential fire in Healy. 
The Georgetown community has faced several other false alarms in the past few years. In February 2018, a series of late-night fire alarms were triggered in the Southwest Quadrangle dormitories. Later that year, a circuit failure in the Nevils dormitory set off multiple false alarms. 
Although Healy is operational, the incident’s aftermath has disturbed office routines, according to Katherine Arcement, communications officer for the Kennedy Institute. 
“Cleanup is ongoing on the KIE hallway, so there have been disruptions to day-to-day operations, but they have been minimal,” Arcement wrote in a Jan. 9 email to The Hoya. 
Despite the inconveniences faculty at the Kennedy Institute are facing, those who work in Healy are adapting to the circumstances, according to Sulmasy. 
“Several other faculty and staff have been working from alternative locations due to the noise of the drying fans and the smell of smoke, but most of us are still coming to work as usual and we can [be] very grateful that there was no more damage or disruption,” Sulmasy wrote. 
Since the start of the spring semester, students and faculty have been using Healy while Facilities attends to the impacted areas, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Healy Hall is fully-functional, and any remaining damage caused by the fire or sprinkler activation is being assessed and addressed by Georgetown University Facilities Management,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.

This article quotes an alleged instance of hate speech. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
A federal grand jury indicted a California woman for allegedly threatening to bomb Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School, a Catholic all-girls school in Northwest Washington, D.C., over its decision to publish same-sex wedding announcements in its alumnae magazine.
Sonia Tabizada pleaded not guilty to federal charges of obstructing religious exercise by threat and transmitting bomb threats in interstate commerce at her hearing Jan. 3, according to court records. Tabizada will remain in jail until her Jan. 21 detention review hearing, at which the court will determine whether to detain her without bail.
Tabizada’s lawyer Carmen Hernandez wrote that at an initial appearance in court, a defendant ordinarily pleads not guilty, because at that stage the prosecution has not yet produced the evidence regarding the charged offense.
“Neither the defendant nor her criminal defense lawyer have had a sufficient opportunity to investigate the charges, research the law, nor discuss the events with the defendant,” Hernandez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “So it is prudent to plead not guilty.”
Tabizada allegedly left two threatening voicemails for the school two days after a May 13 letter to the school community from Visitation President Emerita Sister Mary Berchmans Hannan announcing a new policy to include all alumnae marriage announcements in the Visitation alumnae magazine, according to The Daily Beast. 
“Remove the f–cking gay motherf–ckers from your magazine, or I’m going to f–cking kill your kids,” she allegedly said in the first voicemail. “I’m gonna f–cking blow up the school and call it a mission from God. You guys are going to get terrorism within your f–cking school, motherf–ker. And you’re going to be guilty. And I warned you!”
Tabizada did not graduate from Visitation and has no known ties to it, a Visitation official told NBC News. 
Despite the threats, the fall 2019 issue of the school’s alumnae magazine featured announcements of same-sex marriages, according to Visitation Director of Communications Caroline Handorf.
“We did publish news of several same-sex unions in our most recent class notes, which were printed and distributed in December,” Handorf wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The school, located on 35th Street, was established in 1799 and is one of the oldest Catholic girls schools in the country. The decision to publish news of alumnae same-sex marriages came after reflection from school leadership on forging a more inclusive relationship with LGBTQ alumnae, according to Berchmans’ letter. 
“The Church is clear in its teaching on same-sex marriages,” Berchmans wrote in the letter. “But, it is equally clear in its teaching that we are all children of God, that we each have dignity and are worthy of respect and love.”
The announcement received some pushback from Visitation alumnae who viewed the school’s decision as a betrayal to Catholic community.
“In claiming a ‘contradiction’ between Church teaching and the gospel message of love, your letter betrays a deep misunderstanding of Catholic sexual teaching,” four Visitation alumni wrote in an open May 23 letter. “Catholic doctrine is intrinsically unified: The Church’s teaching on sex and marriage is of a piece with its teaching on the value of human life, the urgency of caring for the poor and marginalized, and the promotion of peace.”
In response, Berchmans, Head of School Dan Kerns and Principal Mary Kate Blaine sent a joint letter to the Visitation community May 31 reaffirming the school’s commitment to its Catholic identity.
“The editorial change to our magazine in no way lessens our fidelity to the Catholic values that have governed Visitation for over two centuries,” the letter obtained by The Hoya read. “It continues to be our firm belief that we can uphold Church teachings, while, at the same time, welcome all members of our community.”
The Catholic faith emphasizes that all members of the community should be accepted, according to the letter.
“As Catholics, we are blessed with both the richness of Church teaching and the abundance of the Gospel commandment of love. They are compatible and the fullness of our faith invites us to lives that embrace both,” the letter read. “It is God’s love that inspires us to ensure all members of our community feel equally valued and respected.”

Voter participation in federal elections among eligible students at Georgetown University increased 143% from 2014 to 2018 following student-led efforts to facilitate voter registration.
Voter participation for qualified Georgetown students increased from 20% to 49% during the 2014 and 2018 elections, according to the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement, a consortium that allows campuses across the country to collect data on their student registration and voting rates. In the 2018 elections, voter turnout among Georgetown students exceeded the national average campus voting rate by 10%, according to the study.
Founded with the goal of increasing political participation on campus, GU Votes, a student-led branch of the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, began initiatives in 2015 to make registering to vote more accessible for students. 
GU Votes’ work to break down barriers to voting for students brings politics to the forefront of students’ lives, according to GU Politics Chief of Staff Carly Henry (GRD ’19).
“A lot of what we do is expose students to career opportunities in politics and public service and tell them how they can make a difference,” Henry said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think GU Votes is a really good way of showing students how they can make a difference immediately by registering to vote and making their voice heard.”
Students are now able to register to vote in federal, state and local elections, as well as request an absentee ballot and find other election-related materials through a portal on MyAccess, GU Votes announced Nov. 4. Students can also register through GU Votes’ online voter portal: bit.ly/guvotes.
While data regarding student activity on the new MyAccess voter registration portal is not yet available to GU Votes, since August, 427 students have used the voter registration links on the GU Votes website, Henry wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
GU Votes programming aims to combat unclear and complicated absentee ballot policies, which present barriers to registering for students who opt to vote in their home state, according to Sarah Bryant (SFS ’22), a student ambassador for GU Votes. 
“I think students are very enthusiastic and really want to vote and want to be involved in the political process,” Bryant said. “Often times, I think what we see at GU Votes is that when students don’t vote it’s not because they don’t want to or they don’t care. It’s that it’s often just really hard for students to do that.” 
GU Votes holds an annual “Storm the Dorms” voter registration drive on National Voter Registration Day on Sept. 24. On the day in 2019, volunteers from GU Votes tabled in the four first-year dorms and registered hundreds of students.
With the 2020 presidential primaries and election approaching, GU Votes plans to establish relationships with clubs and organizations across campus to ensure they reach as many students as possible, according to Bryant.
“Really our club partnerships is something we’re trying to extend and work more on so that we’re able to reach parts of campus that aren’t just people who are already working with GU Politics,” Bryant said. 
One way GU Votes hopes to connect with student organizations is through its voter drop box program, according to Bryant. The program, which is run in partnership with the Office of Residential Living, provides students with secure drop boxes to send off their voter registration materials. 
In the coming months, as the primaries begin taking place in states across the country, the Georgetown Office of Federal Relations will email students individualized letters explaining their state-specific deadlines and processes, according to Henry. 
Going forward, GU Votes aims to continue encouraging students, especially those who have never voted before, to utilize the resources offered to them, according to Bryant. 
“There’s lots of people on campus, especially within GU Politics, who are doing good work and are there to help students who maybe haven’t voted before, don’t know exactly how it works, but really want to,” Bryant said.

Georgetown neighborhood residents have expressed concern about the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s December draft budget report for the 2021 fiscal year suggesting potential bus route changes and a fare hike ahead of a Jan. 16 WMATA meeting. 
The December proposal suggested the complete elimination of bus routes servicing the Georgetown, Burleith and Glover Park neighborhoods, including Route D1 (Glover Park-Franklin Square Line) and Route 54 (14th Street Line), among others. Route G2 (P Street-LeDroit Park Line), which stops outside the main gates of Georgetown’s main campus, would be merged with Route D2 (Glover Park-Dupont Circle Line), according to WTOP. 
Metrobus base rush-hour fares would see a 25 cent increase for anyone paying with a Metro card or cash, according to the draft budget released in November. The draft also proposed a 10 cent base rush-hour price increase for those using the Metrorail. A December WMATA Finance and Capital Committee meeting proposed raising the 10 cent increase to 15 cents. The budget would also include a $2 discount for those transferring from bus to rail and vice versa. 
Both proposed moves have been met with concern from community members, according to Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner 2E01 and Burleith resident Kishan Putta.  
“In December, a few constituents and I traveled to downtown D.C. to testify before the Metro Board because we had seen proposed changes in conjunction with their budget proposal,” Putta said in an interview with The Hoya. “A lot of the constituents, they took the bus to get there — actually, they didn’t have any other way of getting down there from our neighborhood. That’s the only way to get there via public transportation because there’s no Metro station.” 
WMATA representatives said they would primarily cancel repetitive routes and customers currently relying on those services would continue to have access to the transportation by transferring to another bus or rail, according to WTOP. At least two possibly canceled routes would be terminated due to few riders. 
The WMATA Board is set to discuss the proposals at its meeting Thursday. The board will also set dates for public hearings over the next few weeks when residents can voice concerns and give feedback on the draft proposal. 
The proposed route changes would directly affect students who live off campus, according to Georgetown University student Jordan Brown (COL ’21), who lives in Petworth and commutes to campus for classes. 
“The routes that comprise my daily commute, the 54 and G2, are both on the chopping block,” Brown wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These proposed Metrobus changes would severely affect my commute likely cause it to be even longer than it already is – forty-five minutes to an hour each way.”
If WMATA implements these changes, lower-income community members will be disproportionately affected, according to Brown.
“This will most directly impact low-income students, who are already at a disadvantage in this expensive neighbourhood,” Brown wrote. “Low-income students like myself quite literally cannot afford to take rideshares every time we need to travel between Georgetown and another area.”
Logan Arkema (COL ’20), who commutes to Georgetown from East Burleith, reached out to Putta directly to express his grievances.
“As a Georgetown University student without access to a personal vehicle, a budget to sustain rideshares, or easy access to a metro station, these five lines have been essential for me to access my internship, job, and city as a whole,” Arkema wrote in the email. “One of the main reasons I decided to rent in East Burleith is its close proximity to the aforementioned bus lines, and I’m hoping they won’t go away with the next WMATA budget.”
Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), who represents the Georgetown neighborhood on the council as well as other sections of the District, announced in a Jan. 7 letter that he will officially resign from the D.C. Council following accusations of ethical misconduct. A special election to fill Ward 2’s open seat will be held June 16.
Evans’ resignation announcement leaves Ward 2 without representation to voice community members’ concerns about WMATA’s proposed changes, according to Arkema. 
“Ultimately, the decision rests with the city council at a time when Georgetown and all of Ward 2 has no city councilmember,” Arkema wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I hope the city council takes the concerns of his former (and now unrepresented) constituents into account, especially since the budget will be finalized before the election to fill his vacant seat.” 
WMATA’s response to complaints has been slow, leaving residents dissatisfied and confused, according to Putta. 
“They said they would be putting more details out after the holidays. So we waited,” Putta said. “There was a community meeting last week and Metro was supposed to come, and they pulled out at the last minute because they said we would have more details and would be able to react to that.”

City officials permanently cleared a homeless encampment under the bridge crossing over K Street NE on Jan. 16, displacing dozens of people experiencing homelessness and disposing of their belongings.
The city announced the scheduled encampment clearance by posting orange signage Jan. 3 that said the sidewalk under the bridge was a “pedestrian passageway” that could not be blocked by any private property, including tents, according to The DCist. At 10 a.m. on Thursday, city officials, police and sanitation workers arrived at the encampment to clear anything that was left. After everyone vacated the underpass, sanitation workers swept and power washed the sidewalks, according to The Washington Post.
Officials made the decision to remove the K Street encampment after reports that the encampment was interfering with pedestrian traffic, which was a safety concern, D.C. Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Wayne Turnage said in an interview with WAMU.
“We were noticing over time that pedestrians were stepping into the street to not interfere with the encampments,” Turnage said to WAMU. “We needed to address it before someone got hurt.” 
Homeless encampments on K, L and M streets in NoMa, a neighborhood north of Capitol Hill, have been cleared biweekly, though people usually return afterward, according to The DCist.
Georgetown University’s Homelessness Outreach-Meals-Education program oversees multiple homelessness outreach and education efforts through the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service. Members of HOME attended the clearance to aid people experiencing homelessness. 
Students in the HOME program will assist members of the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, a local nonprofit that provides free legal assistance to people experiencing homelessness. 
WLCH and HOME plan on working together to advocate on behalf of people experiencing homelessness in the city, according to Associate Director of the CSJ Raymond Shiu.
“In partnership with WLCH, Hoyas will assist individuals experiencing homelessness during the clearances and advocate for their rights,” Shiu wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In this new development in the NOMA neighborhood, HOME will continue to be present and support the homeless community.”
HOME’s work in collaboration with WLCH reflects the program’s commitment to Georgetown’s Jesuit values, according to HOME Program Coordinator Brianna Ledshome.
“HOME’s partnership with the Washington Legal Clinic exemplifies our Jesuit Mission of being men and women for and with others,” Ledshome wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our programs’ values rely on recognizing human dignity and agency of people experiencing homelessness, and we believe that these values should be guiding forces when the city responds to the encampments.”
There are more than 6,500 people experiencing homelessness in D.C., making the District home to one of the largest homeless populations in the country, according to a 2019 D.C. census. About 9% of people experiencing homelessness live directly on the streets or in an automobile, according to the census.
Residents of NoMa have voiced concerns with the large population of people experiencing homelessness. NoMa Business Improvement District President Robin-Eve Jasper penned an open letter last August recommending “pedestrian safe-passage zones” to address the underpass encampments in NoMa. 
“Many report that they have been harassed as they walk by the tent encampments, where people frequently engage in aggressive panhandling and occasionally menace passersby,” the letter read. “Used and bloody hypodermic needles and other drug paraphernalia, rotting food, trash, broken glass, public nudity, prostitution, sales of illegal drugs, and human urine and feces are encountered by those whose routes take them by the encampments and pervade the space in which encamped individuals are living.”
In response to the letter, more than 30 NoMa residents wrote emails to Turnage to call for the removal of the K Street bridge encampment, according to the Washington City Paper.
Establishing pedestrian safe-passage zones in NoMa can quickly become a way to exclude vulnerable NoMa residents, according to a response to Jasper’s letter by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty.
“It is an act of dividing human beings into groups of people who are considered ‘illegally encamped’ and those who are not, those deemed worthy of safety and those who are not,” the response read. “We are falling into an ‘us versus them’ narrative, which sees the ‘other’ as a threat that must be strategically removed.”
The city’s decision to declare the sidewalks on K Street “pedestrian passageways” was not inspired by Jasper’s letter but rather by observations taken during regular encampment cleanups. Regardless, the city does endorse the creation of these safe-passage zones, Turnage said in an interview with WAMU. 
Currently, the Department of Human Services provides people experiencing homelessness with various resources, including homeless shelter services, transportation services and hypothermia alerts, according to the DHS website.
The Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services creates policies on homeless encampments with the well-being of all of its constituents in mind, according to the DMHHS website.
“The District of Columbia is focused on making homelessness rare, brief and non-recurring,” Turnage wrote. “Our protocol for cleaning public spaces is triggered when a site presents a security, health, or safety risk, and/or interferes with community use of such places. With this in mind, we provide resources to shelter, pathways to housing and access to behavioral health services to individuals at these locations.”
