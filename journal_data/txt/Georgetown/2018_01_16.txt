An online reporting form for sexual assault and misconduct concerns and an online resource center were launched by the university last Wednesday in response to findings from the 2016 Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey.
The two new resources are intended to help guide students during the reporting process, as well as compile available information regarding instances of sexual assault and harassment on campus. The goal of both tools is to enable students to communicate incidents of sexual assault in a more comfortable and easily accessible manner.
The results from Georgetown’s 2016 Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey reported that many students were unaware of available sexual misconduct resources and that there was a desire for a more centralized platform to access them. According to the survey, 18.9 percent of students claim to be “very” or “extremely” knowledgeable about where to report an incident of sexual assault or misconduct.
Rosemary Kilkenny, the Vice President for Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action said that the goal of these initiatives is to create a healthy campus climate for all members of the Georgetown community.
“It is also critical for students to be armed with knowledge of how to address this issue not only on campus, but also as they navigate life in society,” Kilkenny wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Sylvia Levy (SFS ’18), the vice speaker of the Georgetown University Student Association senate, emphasized the importance of student contributions to the creation of these resources and Georgetown’s other efforts to combat sexual misconduct.
“For a few years, students in GUSA have been pushing for the University to make an online reporting form available, so this addition is more than welcome,” Levy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “GUSA as a whole is completely committed to this work and will continue to try to work with administrators to get more resources for survivors and make campus a safer place.”
Before the launch of this online forum, students wishing to report an instance of sexual misconduct were able to do so by going directly to the Office of Student Conduct, the Title IX coordinator or the Georgetown University Police Department. Ultimately, reports are also sent to the office of the Title IX coordinator, who works with students on a case-by-case basis to provide adequate resources and support, as well as explore potential avenues for recourse. When reports are made to the Title IX coordinator or the Deputy Title IX coordinator, the university has an obligation to review all reports and respond appropriately, according to the Georgetown website for sexual misconduct.
According to Laura Cutway, the university’s Title IX coordinator, the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force’s recommendations were also a contributing factor to the creation of these platforms.
University President John J. DeGioia established the task force in 2016 to help the university obtain a broader understanding of sexual assault on campus.
The Sexual Assault and Misconduct Advisory Committee was created in fall 2017 to implement the recommendations made by the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force.
Cutway also highlighted other university initiatives to combat sexual misconduct, including adding two full-time professional roles in the Office of Title IX Compliance and one full-time professional role in Health Education Services.
Although the new online resources represent a promising step, there is still progress to be made, according to Kory Stuer (COL ’19), administrative chair of Sexual Assault Peer Educators, a student group that facilitates interactive discussions that promote healthy relationships, define consent, dispel myths about interpersonal violence, provide bystander intervention strategies and highlight available resources.
Stuer praised the university’s commitment to addressing the issue, but also pointed out areas for improvement, particularly with regard to particularly vulnerable groups such as students of color, LGBTQ students and students with disabilities.
Stuer said members of these groups experience sexual misconduct at disproportionately high levels.
“Responding to sexual violence in our community takes a dedication that goes beyond just words, and we hope that Georgetown continues to commit the necessary resources to Health Education Services and the other offices supporting our community,” Stuer wrote in an email to The Hoya.

When Kyle Rinaudo (SFS ’17) threw his cap in the air last May to signify the end of his undergraduate education, he had no idea he would soon be running to represent Georgia’s 35th District in the state House of Representatives. If elected, the 21-year-old Acworth, Ga. native would become the state’s youngest representative and first Democrat in nearly two decades to represent his community.
Lackluster job opportunities led Rinaudo to consider alternate career paths as he looked for professional ways to serve his community after graduation.
“The idea of making money for myself seemed very selfish of me, and none of what I had applied for really worked out,” Rinaudo said. “What I really wanted to do was get involved in campaigns here near my home.”
Rinaudo said that after asking around, he realized no one was running against incumbent Republican leader Rep. Ed Setzler, who has served the people of Acworth and Kennesaw for over 13 years. Setzler has run unopposed in the past several elections.
“Nobody was contesting [the seat], so I said I constitutionally am able, so I am going to do it,” Rinaudo said.
He credits both religion and his mother for initially pushing him to take leadership in his community.
“My principles and my policies were formed from two places,” Rinaudo said. “My church and my mother.”
Georgetown’s focus on Jesuit traditional beliefs also helped shape who he is today and his decision to run, Rinaudo explained.
“Whenever people ask me ‘What was your favorite part about Georgetown?’ it is the Jesuit community there,” Rinaudo said. “Getting to know them as chaplains or just people walking around on campus [and] their preaching of the God’s service every day is what really made a big impact on me.”
Despite his focus on international affairs during his time in college, Rinaudo said he has always been interested in government in general, which drove him to become more involved in domestic politics. He credits one of his favorite authors, Krista Tippett, for inspiring his campaign.
“American journalist, author and philosopher Krista Tippett, who I absolutely adore, mentioned that big change does not happen in huge, cataclysmic moments,” Rinaudo said. “If you want the world to change, you want them to change in little tiny bits, and we cannot expect somebody else to be the person doing this change.”
“It’s no secret that a government of incumbent politicians for almost two decades has not been able to accomplish a whole lot,” Rinaudo said.
Rinaudo and his team released a video at the beginning of the month outlining his platform. He said he would focus on health care, public school funding and transportation if elected to the position — issues he believes are important to residents of his district on both sides of the aisle.
“You go anywhere in my hometown, which is Acworth, or our neighboring town, which is Kennesaw, and ask the people what they think the government should be doing better, and those are the three things they are going to tell you,” Rinaudo said. “To me, these are the things that matter because if you ask anyone around [Acworth], these are the things that matter to them —Republican or Democrat.”
Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J., who knew Rinaudo from his time as an residential assistant in New South Hall, praised him for his compassion and positivity.
“Kyle loves engaging people — in conversation, in debates, in negotiations to resolve issues,” Steck said. “He is extremely bright and knowledgeable about local and world affairs. He always has a smile on his face and exudes enthusiasm.  Being an RA is a tough job. He was wise and compassionate in dealing with the various issues and concerns that arose on the floor and never let them dampen his positive spirit. I think he’ll do great.”
While it is unusual for someone as young as Rinaudo to run for office, he sees his candidacy as an opportunity to make a difference in his community.
“The only thing that matters is doing the most good you can given the situation that you have,” Rinaudo said. “It does not have to be a humongous act, but it is the little tiny change that matters. If nothing else, Georgetown reinforced that for me. If we want to see good happen, we have to be the ones doing it.”

Kyle you seem like a great guy. But you have fundamentally no experience in the real world and are utterly unprepared for this. The last thing DC needs is more people without relevant experience in the world.

I love it when people sit behind a keyboard and criticize others without even knowing them.  I’m not sure that experience really matters as long as you have the knowledge and the will to help others.

What you lack in experience, you appear to have in passion and intelligence.  We don’t need more leaders looking rob rich themselves, we need people like you who aspire to serve the greater good.  Best wishes in your run for office!

A member of the advisory board for Georgetown University’s Master of Science in Foreign Service program resigned Monday after posting a tweet on Saturday evening that appeared to condone sexual harassment of a female conservative commentator.
Jeff Bernstein (GRD ’85), formerly a managing director at Pennsylvania-based advisory firm Solebury Capital, left his role at Georgetown after telling Allie Stuckey, a conservative commentator, that he hopes she has a “#metoo moment” after she tweeted her views on sexual harassment and assault.
The hashtag #MeToo is used to identify as a survivor of sexual harassment and assault. It has been popularized in recent months as a statement of solidarity with sexual assault survivors, following a deluge of sexual misconduct allegations leveled against prominent men in politics, media and business, including movie producer Harvey Weinstein and NBC News anchor Matt Lauer.
Referencing the #MeToo phenomenon Saturday, Stuckey tweeted that the problem was not a symptom of a broken legal system, but “a symptom of a broken world.”
False. The #metoo moment is a symptom of a broken world. https://t.co/xEtJVasdsN
— Allie Beth Stuckey (@conservmillen) January 13, 2018

Bernstein replied Saturday evening in a tweet reading: “Wishing you a #metoo moment. Maybe then you won’t be so insensitive.”
Bernstein later wrote that he had misinterpreted Stuckey’s tweet, believing she was criticizing the popular groundswell against sexual assault rather than sexual assault itself.
Stuckey, 25, said she was initially confused by Bernstein’s response — she did not consider her original tweet insensitive, or even controversial. When she realized what Bernstein appeared to mean, she became upset.
“I thought, ‘Did this grown man actually just hope that I get sexually harassed or assaulted?’” Stuckey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I considered all of the horrific stories I’ve read of sexual abuse and rape over the past few months and thought, ‘He wants me to go through that because he disagrees with me?’”
Stuckey responded later that evening by questioning Bernstein’s role at Georgetown:
Hi @Georgetown — someone on your MSFS board just told me he hopes I get sexually harassed or assaulted. Is this the kind of standard your university holds for your advisors? pic.twitter.com/O2CLUkYvcR
— Allie Beth Stuckey (@conservmillen) January 14, 2018

Stuckey acknowledged she had criticized “certain tactics” of the #MeToo movement in the past, but said she takes sexual assault and its victims “very seriously.”
“And though I’m no stranger to disagreeable, sexist Internet trolls, to me, this was too far,” Stuckey wrote.
Georgetown agreed. School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman announced that the university accepted Bernstein’s resignation in a news release Monday.
“Encouraging, threatening or condoning violence and harassment against another person, in any form and on any format, is deeply inconsistent with the values of the program, our school and our university,” the statement reads. “The Masters of Science in Foreign Service (MSFS) program at Georgetown University is deeply committed to fostering the role of women in international affairs and promoting respectful dialogue and debate on the critical issues facing our world.”
Hellman added that the university appreciated Bernstein’s “efforts to apologize.”
Bernstein was a member of the MSFS advisory board, which is designed to advise the MSFS program on matters relating to curriculum, career development, alumni relations and fundraising, according to the MSFS website. First convened in 2011, the board is now composed of 36 alumni and professors and meets annually at Georgetown.
Bernstein was also fired from his job at Solebury Capital as a result of his conduct. Solebury learned of Bernstein’s conduct Sunday evening and “immediately investigated the matter,” according to Lisa Wolford, a spokeswoman for Solebury.
“Based on that review, we promptly terminated his employment with Solebury,” Wolford wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Bernstein deleted his tweet a few hours after it was published. In a subsequent series of tweets, Bernstein repeatedly apologized to Stuckey and denied that his comments were intended to condone harassment. He said that he “would never wish harm on anyone” and only meant to say Stuckey — whom he accused of making disparaging statements about women, immigrants, people of color and others — “needed a moment of truth.”
Bernstein later wrote in a Twitter direct message to The Hoya that he had “apologized profusely” to Stuckey and feels “terribly” about the incident. He also said he has “incredible love for MSFS and Georgetown.”
Stuckey noted that Bernstein later sent her what she considers a sincere apology, “albeit after many insincere apologies and after having his name dragged through the mud.”
“I do forgive him. I really do,” Stuckey wrote.
Bernstein had deleted his Twitter account by Monday morning and could not be reached for additional comments about his resignation from the MSFS advisory board or termination from Solebury.
Stuckey said she appreciated the university’s “adherence to their proclaimed values.”
“Sexual harassment and assault — and online bullying — are not to be taken lightly,” Stuckey wrote.

When I read about this story yesterday I was wondering how GU would handle the matter in the media.  I was pleasantly greeted with the Hoya lead article this morning documenting the entire exchange.  
Thank you.  I am proud to have my daughter attend a university that’s not afraid to do the right thing and stand up for women.

Grounded, the newest Students of Georgetown, Inc. storefront in The Hilltoss, is gearing up for a revamp this month, replacing its smoothie and acai bowl station with a new espresso bar and expanded breakfast menu by Jan. 25.
The Corp first launched Grounded to meet the demand for coffee in the Healey Family Student Center. Grounded currently sells coffee, tea, nonespresso-based specialty drinks, smoothies and acai bowls.
The new menu is slated to incorporate elements of staple Corp items and exclusive specialty drinks and breakfast options, according to Emily Leeser (COL ’18), director of The Hilltoss.  The improved Grounded plans to offer espresso, tea, toasts and bagel sandwiches, as well as snacks, bottled beverages, oatmeal and yogurt parfaits.
With the launch of the espresso bar, Grounded is set to remain open until 1 a.m. on weekdays, Corp CEO Melina Hsiao (COL ’18) said. Grounded currently closes at 9 p.m., according to The Corp’s website.
The Corp plans to price all new breakfast items under six dollars, with the hope of integrating the newly expanded Grounded menu with pre-existing Corp offerings, Leeser said.
“The coffee prices will be the same as at other Corp locations,” Leeser said. “We will have a different drink selection — our signature drink section will look a little bit different — but our prices will be comparable to other services.”
Hsiao said The Hilltoss will not expand its staff with the relaunch of Grounded. Instead, the current acai and smoothie shifts are now to be allocated to coffee service.
The renovation is expected to last three days — most likely over a weekend — and will preserve the same Hilltoss layout, according to Hsiao.
“It is a pretty low-cost renovation; they’re calling it a service agreement,” Hsiao said. “It’s basically changes to electric and water output. It’s really a facility project.”
The Corp has contracted an external company to deal with the renovations, though the group still awaits university approval for its renovation plans and dates, Hsiao said.
The Corp decided to change the menu and offerings in response to a survey conducted about the HFSC. Patrick Ledesma, director of the student center, said the survey found that 88 percent of students supported increased coffee options within the study space.
“The majority of the students that use the HFSC actually come after 7 p.m.,” Ledesma said. “The highest numbers where we record usage in this case is from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. [or] 12 a.m. So, you can tell that people are probably looking for coffee at night. We thought it was a good idea for somebody to serve coffee, so we gave the information to the operators of the [Bulldog] Tavern and Hilltoss, and Hilltoss this year decided to move forward with those options.”
The Corp’s upper management had been talking about this shift in service since the summer, as the group felt it was not meeting the needs of the entire student body, Hsiao said.
With the expansion of Grounded, The Corp hopes to provide late-night drink and snack options for students studying in the HFSC area when its competitors are closed.
“We hope that Grounded will become a coffee option in the morning before class, but [we] are more focused on offering coffee and espresso options in the HFSC area of campus in the evenings when Whisk and other vendors are closed,” Hsiao said.

Members of the D.C. Fair Skies Coalition, including Georgetown community members, argued at the D.C. Circuit Court on Thursday against flight routes out of Reagan National Airport that have led to increased noise over the Georgetown neighborhood.
The oral argument marks the most recent development in a lawsuit filed by local neighborhood groups and Georgetown University challenging northbound flight routes out of DCA. The routes, launched by the Federal Aviation Administration in 2013 to save flight time and reduce fuel emissions, direct planes in a scattered pattern over Washington, D.C.-area neighborhoods. The suit seeks to suspend a northern route and reinstate the prior flight path, which tracked up the west side of the Potomac River.
Community members in the D.C. area have opposed the route, called LAZIR, maligning the increased air traffic and noise. Activists formed the D.C. Fair Skies Coalition, which aims to revert the new flight route back to its original path along the west side of the Potomac and “restore the peace and quiet of established and historic neighborhoods in D.C. and the safety of their residents,” according to the coalition’s website.
Roughly 23.6 million passengers travelled through Reagan airport in 2016, according to data recorded by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
The coalition urged the D.C. Circuit in January 2017 to discard the new routes on the grounds that the agency had not properly assessed the noise and air pollution from planes flying planes over neighborhoods, including Hillandale, Burleith, Georgetown, Colony Hill, Foxhall, Foggy Bottom and the Palisades.
The coalition has also argued that the FAA did not properly involve the D.C. community before implementing the route. Since the court case was originally filed in August 2015, the FAA has failed to have it dismissed on grounds the groups had filed it too late.
The FAA declined to reverse the new flight route six days prior to the oral argument last week.
Christopher Murphy, vice president of government relations and community engagement at Georgetown University, has been actively involved with the coalition, and is pleased with the citywide support the coalition has garnered.
“Support for the D.C. Fair Skies Coalition has been overwhelming. I can’t think of another issue facing our community that has united so many different neighborhoods, citizens associations, elected leaders, and other important institutions that call the District home,” Murphy wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), the only Georgetown student in attendance at the Thursday hearing, became involved with the D.C. Fair Skies Coalition in 2015. As a Blue and Gray tour guide, Goldstein said the planes’ new route causes disruptions at least once during each of his tours.
“All the time when I’m giving tours I have to stop and wait for a plane to pass, and it’s really awkward,” Goldstein said. “On almost every single tour I get a question from a prospective parent like, ‘Is it always like this? Do you just get used to this?’ and it’s an awkward question to answer.”
Murphy said he is optimistic about the court’s decision.
“We are hopeful the Court will direct the FAA to go back to the beginning and run an open and inclusive process to consider changes to routes — but this time ensure District residents and other impacted organizations like the University have a say,” Murphy wrote.
