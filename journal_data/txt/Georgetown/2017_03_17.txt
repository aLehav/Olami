After receiving a record number of total applicants for this year’s application cycle, Georgetown’s admissions department anticipates accepting about 15 percent of 21,459 regular decision applicants to the Class of 2021, down from last year’s acceptance rate of 16.4 percent.
Georgetown accepted a record-low number of early action applicants this year, down to 11.9 percent of the 7,822 applicants from last year’s 13 percent.
The total applicant number is up 7.3 percent from 19,997 applicants in 2016. The previous record was 20,115 applicants in 2012.
This increase is expected to reduce the number of transfer students accepted this year from 170 to 150 admits.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69), the incoming freshman class is expected to increase slightly from 1,580 to 1,600 students.
Deacon said based on the 1600 SAT score scale, the average critical reading score and math score for the applicant pool rose by about 16 points, translating to a more competitive applicant pool.
The number of first-generation college students who submitted regular decision applications increased this year, making up 11 to 12 percent of total applications.
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions plans to send out decisions for the regular decision cycle beginning the week of March 27 for applicants to receive their letters by April 1.
Deacon said the College received a bump in applicants, while the number of prospective students in the School of Foreign Service, the McDonough School of Business and the School of Nursing and Health Studies remained similar to last year. Deacon was unable to provide specific numbers as of press time.
According to Deacon, these trends suggest a greater interest in the liberal arts and an improving job market.
“The trend that had people going toward business or the [School of Nursing and Health Studies], which gives you a concrete outcome with a job — maybe people are getting less worried about getting a job on that end and more worried about following their academic interests,” Deacon said. “It’s a good sign for the liberal arts that people are going back to it.”
Deacon noted the role of the Georgetown Scholarship Program as a contributing factor of the rising number of first generation students submitting applications.
“We have the GSP program, which is a great program. We don’t recruit for that — people get invited to join from the admissions committee selecting people they think would be good for it,” Deacon said. “But the word of mouth is out about it, which holds up our first-gen, lower-income pool.”
Deacon said this change in admissions rates reflects a trade-off between the number of incoming freshmen and transfer students admitted.
“We’re taking slightly more freshmen and slightly fewer transfers, which is what the deans want because the freshmen [class] is the strongest pool already,” Deacon said. “We still have a good transfer pool, which comes in April.”
Deacon also said the increased number of first-generation students is a positive sign for socio-economic diversity, though it foreshadows competition between elite schools to retain these students.
“For us, with first-gen kids, the problem is, with all the socio-economic circumstances of their lives, not that high of a percentage have the academic record that puts them in a range for a school like a Georgetown or an Ivy League school,” Deacon said. “Essentially, a number of the most competitive schools are sort of competing for the same pretty small pool of people with a sufficiently strong background.”
Deacon also indicated the various factors behind the high number of applications, such as the new SAT exam, Georgetown’s independent application system, an increase in the number of high school graduates applying to colleges, the national political climate and Georgetown’s location, which all bolster the university’s brand.
“Washington, D.C., is an interesting place to be, particularly in a political year. President Trump wanted to drain the swamp, but he filled it back up with everybody,” Deacon said. “Washington is a political power center, as opposed to a financial one, or an entrepreneurial one. It’s a political power site.”
The 2016-17 admissions cycle was the first to use the new SAT format, which transitioned back to the 1600-point scale from the previous 2400-point scale and was administered for the first time in March 2016.
The change did not affect the way Georgetown analyzes standardized test scores, since the admissions committee only calculates the combined critical reading and math scores. However, Deacon said the College Board, the organization that administers the SAT, has suggested there might be more students scoring higher than they would have on the old test.
Deacon said this year also saw an increased number of students taking and submitting scores for the ACT. In the early admissions pool, the number of students submitting ACT scores compared to SAT scores was split about evenly.
Deacon said this trend could have hurt students who preferred to submit ACT scores instead of the new SAT scores they received because they considered it to look more impressive.
“A lot of people are advised by their high school counselors maybe to take the ACT, which we don’t think is great advice, because the ACT was unchanged but the SAT came out higher, so that could have had an impact,” Deacon said.
Deacon said this ended up making the applicant pool significantly more competitive.
“Almost all of the increase was from people who are in the top 10 percent of their high school class. What you see going on there is that as you become more competitive, people begin to weed themselves out. People with lower scores say, ‘Why bother?’ If they are high, they say, ‘Maybe this is a school I should be applying for,’” Deacon said.
Deacon also said that despite the men’s basketball team’s performance this year, the university’s reputation is growing and attracting more students.
“Put basketball aside,” Deacon said. “The Georgetown brand has been stronger and stronger.”
Correction: an earlier version of this story listed last year’s total application number as 19,097 instead of 19,997. Additionally, it listed the percent increase from last year’s total application number as 12.3 percent, when it is actually 7.3 percent.

Can you provide statistics on the socio economic breakdown of the family for these applicants? or provide the statistics for the current freshman class? Or just point me to that information. I am curious to know what segments of the population can afford $70,000 tuition, room, and board. Thank you.

Reverend Mark Bosco, S.J., a professor of theology and English at Loyola University Chicago, will serve as the new vice president for mission and ministry starting Aug. 1.
Currently, Bosco serves as director of The Joan and Bill Hank Center for the Catholic Intellectual Heritage at LUC, where he is responsible for developing symposia, lectures and research on Catholicism.
Bosco, who will also serve as a professorial lecturer in the English department in his new role, brings a history of scholarship to the position. Bosco has authored three books and about 20 articles on the relationship between theology and art.
In an interview with The Hoya, Bosco said he is looking to engage the community in a conversation on Georgetown’s Jesuit identity in his new position.
As vice president for mission and ministry, Bosco will oversee the Office of Campus Ministry, which is responsible for Roman Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, Orthodox Christian, Hindu and Buddhist worship services and includes the Hindu, Muslim and Jewish chaplaincies.
“I’m excited to celebrate the liturgy for students as often as I can, something I’ve always gotten great joy out of,” Bosco said. “I’d like to deepen the conversation about what Jesuit Catholic education means, whether to faculty and staff or to students.”
In a campuswide email yesterday, University President John J. DeGioia said Bosco embodies the university’s Jesuit identity.
“Fr. Bosco will bring to our University an extraordinary understanding of our Catholic and Jesuit tradition and the way it influences and strengthens all that we do,” DeGioia wrote. “Fr. Bosco also shares our University’s commitment to advancing interfaith and ecumenical dialogue and understanding, and will work with colleagues in our Office of Mission and Ministry to further animate our efforts to help our students live lives of deep meaning and purpose.”
Bosco taught at the University of San Francisco and the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley, after earning his Masters in Divinity from the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley.
Bosco will replace interim Vice President Fr. Howard Gray, S.J., who has served in the role since former
Vice President of Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., (CAS ’88) left the university to serve as the dean of the Jesuit School of Theology last August.
Gray said Bosco will bring a depth of experience to the new position.
“Georgetown is fortunate to have Mark Bosco as the new Vice President, a Jesuit of many talents, wide experience, and proved commitment to Jesuit higher education,” Gray wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Government professor Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., who served on the search committee that selected Bosco, said Bosco will bring innovation to the Georgetown community.
“I’m delighted by Fr. Bosco’s appointment. He conveys a marvelous sense of welcome and hospitality, and loves to cook, so I think there will be many opportunities for members of the community -— students, faculty, and staff -— to get to know him in close, personal ways,” Carnes wrote in an email to The Hoya. “His academic background in poetry, aesthetics, and theology, and his deep grounding in spirituality, will be a real gift to Georgetown, and they promise to help us move in new directions in the ways we live out Mission and Ministry.”
In his role as director of the Center for the Catholic Intellectual Heritage at Loyola, Bosco said he focused on cultivating interfaith dialogue, which he hopes to continue at Georgetown.
“For the last four years we’ve done a successful afternoon symposium on trying to bring faith traditions together. We always invited students to be part of it, and I really liked that part the best,” Bosco said. “It usually brought other students in because students like to hear what their friends are doing, but it also was a witness to what’s going on on campus.”
Bosco said he looks forward to becoming a part of the Georgetown community and strengthening the university’s Jesuit traditions.
“Mostly I’m looking forward to getting to know people there and to see what’s out there and to see how I can contribute,” Bosco said. “I’d like to talk more about and celebrate Ignatian pedagogy — which I know is going on at Georgetown — and see if we can just articulate that.”

The pursuit of gender equality should transcend religious ideology, according to author and feminist activist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who spoke as part of the Faith and Culture Lecture Series in Gaston Hall yesterday.
“Not just Catholicism, but the religions I am mostly familiar with, in the mainstream way they are practiced are not the most women-friendly institutions,” Adichie said. “Feminism is just that simple idea that women are fully equal and there’s a sense in which religion has been used to justify oppressions based upon the idea that women are not fully equal human beings.”
The event, moderated by Paul Eli, senior fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, was Adichie’s first public appearance since her Sunday interview with Channel 4 News, in which she distinguished between the experiences of transgender women and women. The comment was met with opposition from transgender activists.
The Faith and Culture Lecture Series invites authors to discuss their work and its connections to faith.
Driven by her belief that “we should all be feminists,” discussed in Adiche’s 2013 TED talk of the same name, Adichie said she wants those who are religious to feel like they can also be feminists.
“Lately, I’ve been finding myself thinking about how one can craft a feminist platform from Christianity. It feels tenuous, but maybe it’s not impossible,” Adichie said. “Practicing religion is really about making choices about what you want to emphasize. So the question becomes what does one want to focus on.”
Adichie, who grew up in the Catholic tradition in Nigeria, said she has struggled to define her relationship with religion.
“I like to say that I was raised Catholic. I am very uncomfortable saying that I am Catholic,” Adichie said. “It’s almost a political identity to be Catholic, in America. It’s an identity that says you’re pro-life, conservative. In some ways I feel as though they often go together.”
Despite having left the Catholic church as an adult, Adichie said she values her religious upbringing and the ways it shaped her worldview.
“Growing up Catholic, for me, was a joyful experience. As a child, I loved mass. I loved the drama of mass. It was very important for me to grow up the way I did with a sense of the Catholic world,” Adichie said. “It’s a very complicated thing for me because on the one hand, I do have these deep-seated concerns with the laws of the Catholic doctrine. Part of my quarrel with the Catholic Church is how often there is an elevation of the institution over the person.”
In her hometown and childhood communities, Adichie said she has encountered several women who find themselves torn between being good Christians and following their instincts concerning gender equality.
“I remember talking to a woman who I thought was very progressive and I was just horrified at what I thought were very backwards views on homosexuality, and then she said, ‘If it wasn’t in the Bible I would be more willing to listen to you,’” Adichie said.
According to Adichie, many women, especially in countries other than the United States, are hesitant to identify themselves as feminists or act according to feminist values of equality because of a negative cultural stigma associated with the term.
“Feminism is not an abstract concept or academic discourse, it’s a way of life. It’s about changing the world,” Adichie said. “There’s a lot of hostility that’s directed at any woman who publicly takes on that label and I think it happens everywhere in the world. To know that that comes with the territory and to continue to do it has to be because I think it’s worth doing, worth talking about.”
In the question-and-answer portion of the event, Desiree Lucky (LAW ’19) read a statement from transgender artist Venus D’Khaijah Selenite calling out Adichie’s Sunday comments as hypocritical and transphobic, questioning Adichie’s commitment to gender equality.
Adichie clarified her comments by indicating that the sex someone is born with shapes their life experiences and alters the privileges they are granted by society.
“For me, feminism is not rhetoric, it’s about lived experiences. I come from a place where a child is born, they look at what’s between a child’s legs and immediately decide what value to give that child. Based on what’s between that child’s legs, whether vagina or penis, that child runs the risk of being killed,” Adichie said. “Gender matters because gender is about how the world treats you. It’s about how the world treats you based on your biology.”
Adichie said while she believes transgender women have different life experiences than those born female, both parties should be considered equal and treated as such.
“There is a difference in the gender experiences of trans women and women who are born female. I don’t see why acknowledging the differences somehow translates to my being transphobic,” Adichie said. “Trans women should have the right to be because they are fully human beings. At the end, we are on the same side. I am a person who will continue to stand up for the rights of trans women.”
Adichie said she is hopeful that the feminist movement will continue to gain traction outside of the United States.
“We have to start somewhere. If my friend’s friend is raising her son differently, then at some point we are going to have a critical mass,” Adichie said. “I am hopeful because I really believe in the ability of humans to change.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit late last month against four D.C. Metropolitan Police Department officers and the D.C. government on behalf of Lourdes Ashley Hunter, a local transgender rights activist who was arrested on a misdemeanor charge without a warrant last November.
Hunter, co-founder and executive director of the TransWomen of Color Collective, was hosting a dinner for her friends and fellow trans activists last November. Hunter’s neighbor allegedly called the police to complain about noise and claimed Hunter had assaulted her.
ACLU attorney Shana Knizhnik said the ACLU is suing the MPD both for the warrantless arrest, which violates a D.C. statute, and for a violation of Fourth Amendment rights. The Fourth Amendment protects individuals and their homes from unreasonable searches and seizures.
“There are two claims that we’re making. First, that the warrantless arrest of Ms. Hunter was a violation of D.C. law,” Knizhnik said. “Second, we’re claiming that the entry by MPD officers into Ms. Hunter’s home to arrest her — again, entry without a warrant, arrest without a warrant — was in violation of the Fourth Amendment.”
According to Hunter, police then proceeded to enter Hunter’s apartment without a warrant and arrest her on a misdemeanor charge.
“I refused to go with them, and they dragged me out of my apartment,” Hunter said. “The police violated my Fourth Amendment rights. The MPD has a history of entering homes without a warrant and it is against the law for them to enter my home for a misdemeanor charge without a warrant.”
Hunter said she contacted the ACLU for assistance in suing the MPD. Knizhnik said she felt that pursuing the case was not only in Hunter’s best interest, but also in the interest of the D.C. community as a whole.
“Ms. Hunter reached out to us and we saw some video from that night and spoke with her and did research about the issue and found that this was a violation by the police,” Knizhnik said.
According to Michael Tobin, the executive director of the D.C. Office of Police Complaints, the District has laws different from other metropolitan areas regarding when an officer can and cannot arrest an individual for a misdemeanor.
“Under D.C. law, which is a little bit peculiar from other jurisdictions, the police officers in Washington, D.C., are required to actually observe that type of event in order to make an arrest, unless there is an exigent reason at the time, such as to quell violence or to prevent violence from continuing to occur,” Tobin said.
The D.C. Office of Police Complaints has received numerous complaints of warrantless entry into private homes over the past several years. Prior to 2013, dozens of reports of warrantless home entry were filed with the office. Of these, 12 were ruled legitimate.
Tobin said a report was filed in 2013 by the Office of Police Complaints that described the incidents and made recommendations to the MPD on how to improve on this issue.
“In that policy recommendation we had found that there were a series of instances that we recognized to be developing into a pattern in which MPD officers were conducting arrests without the proper warrant,” Tobin said.
Tobin said the pattern the office noticed led to a desire to rectify the situation.
“When we see a pattern developing then, if we’re able to identify that, we try to help the police department improve its policies, procedures and training by making these policy recommendations,” Tobin said. “That’s what we did in this case. We made the recommendation that they improve their procedures.”
Since the 2013 report was filed, there have been 57 more incidents of warrantless entry into private homes and warrantless arrest.
Tobin said a second policy report was filed last year to address this same issue.
“We found some cases in which proper police work was not being done to identify the actual house and the proper living place of the subject of the warrant, so we issued a second policy recommendation with respect to doing more diligent work and identifying where somebody lives before the arrest warrant or search warrant is issued,” Tobin said.
According to Tobin, there are currently four open cases against the MPD for warrantless entry into private homes.
Hunter, who attended the White House gala for transgender activists the night after her arrest, said her arrest has caused her significant trauma, and she hopes that her case will influence future MPD policy.
“My hope is that MPD will implement monitoring of its officers, in particular when it comes to entering the homes of citizens without a warrant because that is illegal,” Hunter said. “I also hope to be compensated for the trauma I experienced from being arrested the night before attending a huge gala at the White House.”
The MPD Public Information Officer Hugh Carew said the MPD cannot comment on pending litigation but said the department is looking to strengthen its ties to underserved groups.
“MPD remains committed to assisting and building relationships with historically underserved groups including the LGBT community,” Carew wrote in an email to The Hoya.

What a shocker! The ACLU is suing the police. I am sure Ms Hunter was quietly reading a book when the storm troopers kicked in her door and she was arrested for no reason? The neighbor who called in the noise complaint should have been more understanding and just sat up all night? It sounds like an obvious hate crime committed by the trans phobic MPD. Hopefully the ACLU can find a legal technicality to get a multi million dollar windfall for this poor victim so she can get past this incident that has ruined her life!

Georgetown University alumnus Jon Ossoff (SFS ’09) is running as a Democrat in Georgia’s special election to fill the 6th Congressional District’s seat in the House of Representatives. Ossoff has come under fire for videos from his time at Georgetown that have resurfaced.
Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who represented Georgia’s 6th District for 12 years, was confirmed as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to President Donald Trump on Feb. 10, leaving his seat in the House of Representatives vacant.
Ossoff is one of the 18 candidates — five Democrats and 13 Republicans — vying for the spot.
The race to replace Price is unique for a few reasons. First, the election is a jungle primary, in which unless a candidate wins by a majority, garnering 50 percent of the votes plus one, the two top candidates enter a runoff.
The first vote is on April 18 and if there is no majority winner, a runoff vote is scheduled for June 20.
Second, Georgia is historically a Republican state and its 6th Congressional District is no exception. The 6th District has not elected a Democrat congressman since 1979, when former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) replaced incumbent John Flynt (D-Ga.).
However, in the 2016 presidential election, Trump won the 6th District by only 1 percent of the vote.
With an online pitch to voters titled “Make Trump Furious,” Ossoff, like the other Democrats in the race, is counting on November’s numbers signaling a shift in the district’s voting preferences.
Ossoff’s campaign has received a large amount of media attention from liberals who see his candidacy as part of the anti-Trump resistance. The progressive online community Daily Kos, which helped fund Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) bid for Senate, set up a website to receive donations for Ossoff. Through the website, Ossoff’s campaign received more than $800,000 in a week, around double the total amount Daily Kos raised for Warren.
At only 30 years old, Ossoff’s youth is being used to paint Ossoff as young and immature by some. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC backed by House of Representative GOP leaders, ran an attack advertisement featuring clips from a performance Ossoff gave as a member of the Georgetown Chimes.
In the video, Ossoff sings a parody of Billy Joel’s “Uptown Girl” in Gaston Hall with the Chimes.
“Georgetown girl / You know she’s living in her M Street world / She never tires of her high-class toys,” the Chimes sang.
In other parts of the video, Ossoff is dressed up as Han Solo from “Star Wars.”
The advertisement ends by describing Ossoff as “not honest, not serious, not ready.”
Ossoff spoke to volunteers and supporters at the campaign’s Marietta, Ga. office March 11. He said the campaign’s grassroots growth with over 7,000 volunteer workers is reflective of the current political climate.
“The grassroots momentum that this campaign is building is really extraordinary,” Ossoff said. “It has nothing to do with me. It has everything to do with the times we’re living in and the renewed sense of civic engagement that people across the sixth district are feeling.”
Ossoff said his campaign aims to unite the district and give the people hope during a contentious political time.
“I am doing my best and my team is doing its best to run a different kind of campaign, to run a campaign that approaches all voters with respect and humility, with no prejudice no matter where they are on the political spectrum, no matter who they support,” Ossoff said. “Despite all of the negativity out there, we are doing our best to run a positive campaign that gives people something to believe in.”
Ossoff’s campaign is not the first time this year that Georgia politics have come under the national spotlight.
Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) from Georgia’s 5th District was attacked by Trump on Twitter as being “all talk, talk talk — no action or results” for criticizing Trump’s legitimacy as president.
In a Jan. 5 statement endorsing Ossoff, Lewis said Ossoff’s campaign provides an avenue for Democrats looking to rebuild after the 2016 presidential election.
“Jon is committed to progress and justice and he knows how to fight the good fight,” Lewis said. “We should unite behind Jon and send a clear message that Donald Trump doesn’t represent our values.”
The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service is sending a small group of students to Georgia from March 29 to 30 to experience campaigning in a local election. While in Georgia, the students will meet with Ossoff as well as the republican Georgia State Senator Judson Hill. GU Politics Chief of Staff Hanna Hope said the trip builds upon the program’s mission and work on campus.
“This is the kind of experience we are always looking to give Georgetown students, the chance to leave the beltway and see what is politics really like on the ground, how does public service take shape in the real world,” Hope said. “This is an extension of our mission on campus.”
Correction: an earlier version of this article misspelled GU Politics Chief of Staff Hanna Hope’s name.

The Georgetown University Police Department has launched an investigation after posters were placed in several locations on and off campus by Identity Evropa, a white national group, Sunday night.
The posters, placed in locations including Red Square and Village A, included several white nationalist slogans, such as “Our destiny is ours,” “Serve your people,” and “Let’s become great again.” The group took credit for the posters on its Twitter account.
By Monday night, many of the posters had been taken down by students. GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said campus police were investigating the matter.
“We have recently been made aware of the posters,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are currently investigating this.”
The group, founded at California State University Stanislaus, has plastered posters at universities across the country, including the University of California, Los Angeles, Pennyslvania State University and the University of Washington. A past campaign at Indiana University specifically targeted the offices of professors of color.
The Southern Poverty Law Center identified the group as white nationalist on their website in February.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said in a statement to The Hoya the campaign is an act of hate.
“The posters appear to be part of a campaign by an outside group that has posted similar materials on campuses across the country. Acts of hate will not be tolerated on Georgetown’s campus,” the statement reads. “We are a community that welcomes all people and that values understanding, dignity, inclusion and respect.”
Georgetown University Student Association President-elect Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Vice President-elect Jessica Andino (COL ’18) said the posters stray beyond the territory of free speech into harassment.
“We are appalled to see that these flyers that promote hate were spread across campus. Because of the hateful message that the organization embodies, this crosses the line of free speech into dangerous territory of harassment,” Mack and Andino wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are committed to promoting a tolerant speech environment where there is fruitful dialogue.”
Mack and Andino also encouraged students to use the university’s Bias Reporting System, which allows students to report bias incidents to the university.
“At this time we want to remind students that Georgetown has a Bias Reporting System if they feel any of their identities have been targeted in a threatening manner,” Mack and Andino wrote. “We would also like to emphasize the current guidelines of the Speech and Expression Policy as laid out by the university and to express that during our administration we plan to continue programming that informs the student body of these guidelines.”
The Georgetown Bipartisan Pro-Israel Dialogue denounced the posters and Identity Evropa in a post to the group’s Facebook page Monday.
“These individuals may be blinded by hatred and ignorance; the Georgetown population, however, is not,” the post reads. “For we are Georgetown, and we are one family. And no Hitler dress-up club can touch that.”

How are these acts of hate? The posters are of statues with text saying “Our Destiny is Ours,” “Serve Your People,” and “Let’s Become Great Again.” 
Seems pretty harmless.  Far from the harassment Kamar hysterically claims it to be.
And please explain how this is different from other race-based identity groups at Georgetown seeking to promote their own racial identity groups . . .
We have “The Black House” and “Casa Latina,” both race-based segregationist housing programs which put on programming with the specific goal promoting Black and Latino identity and which often put on anti-White events.
We have a ton of clubs devoted exclusively to the promotion of racial solidarity and advancement by race. They just happen to all be non-White races.  
Why is it only non-White groups are allowed to advocate for themselves or show pride in their history?
How come when a group of White people seek to care about their own race it’s all of a sudden bad thing?
If we believe the races are equal and should be treated equally, shouldn’t Whites be allowed the same rights and privileges non-Whites are allowed when it comes to supporting and identifying with their own racial groups?
If it’s wrong for Whites to be proud of their identity and the accomplishments of Whites and the many wonderful things Whites have done, and if Whites feeling solidarity for each other is wrong, then shouldn’t, if we believe in equality and equal treatment, condemn Black and Latino and Asian and Arab identity groups WHO DO THE EXACT SAME THING?
There is a huge double standard here, in addition to a lot of anti-White hate.
If you think it’s wrong for Whites to be proud of who they are but okay for other races to be proud of who they are, or if you think Whites shouldn’t help and promote each other based on race but think it’s okay for other races to help and promote each other based on race, then you’re a huge hypocrite.

The university is planning to renovate Alumni Square, Village A and Village C East this summer to include new windows, furniture and LED lighting for the three communities.
The Office of Planning and Facilities Management and the Office of Residential Living are working together to ensure that the upgrades are completed for the 2017-18 school year. The renovations funds, which are expected to total about $6 million, will come from the University Capital Fund, a fund established for such projects.
The most extensive renovations, costing $4.5 million, will take place in Alumni Square. All apartments will receive new refrigerators, windows and dehumidifiers. Apartments numbered 1-15 will receive renovated kitchens and bathrooms with new flooring.
Village A will receive new dining and living room furniture at a cost of about $300,000, while Village C East will have new windows installed at an estimated cost of $1.2 million.
Robin Morey, vice president of planning and facilities management, said this summer’s projects are a continuation of the renovations to apartments and residence halls that began last year. The university installed new air conditioning, hot water heaters and roofing in Alumni Square last summer.
The university, Georgetown University Student Association and neighbors agreed to a 20-year campus plan in September, calling for the university to maintain a three-year housing requirement. Morey cited the plan, which also calls for existing residence halls to be renovated to bolster efforts to improve student residences.
“The renovations to our residential communities are part of our investments in deferred maintenance and our commitment in the campus plan to renovate existing campus housing to be competitive and marketable,” Morey wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said she worked with the university through the Master Planning Consortium, which brings together administrators and student advocates to address planning concerns and review residence halls and apartments run by the university to determine those in need of renovation. According to Khan, the previous campus plan had diverted funds away from renovations in order to construct new residences.
“The suboptimal state of many dorms on campus is a result of the previous campus plan, which led to the building of two new residential faculties,” Khan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The construction of these facilities diverted funds away from long-overdue renovations.”
According to Patrick Killilee, executive director for residential services, many of the residential communities have not seen improvements since the 1990s. Last year, the Office of Residential Living and Facilities worked with an outside architectural firm to determine that Alumni Square, Village A and Henle Village were the buildings most in need of renovations.
“Our facilities around campus — especially our apartment areas — needed renovations. Most probably haven’t been renovated from the early to mid-90s,” Killilee said. “Certainly many are due — if not past due — for these renovations.”
Khan said the renovations being conducted were a promising first step, but more money was needed in order to make housing options on campus more appealing for students.
“Until we can raise the capital to take on the full renovations needed for some facilities, we hope these annual renovation projects will make a difference and fix the bare minimum,” Khan wrote.
According to Killilee, work will begin in Henle Village and continue in Alumni Square and Village A in the coming years. Killilee said that by starting with 15 apartments in Alumni Square, best practices for future renovations can be determined.
“We have enough money to do these 15 apartments, and that would be a test case,” Killilee said. “So,we can set our standard so when we do the rest in Alumni Square and Village A, we can say these are the materials we want to use.”
According to Killilee, the renovations will have a minor impact on summer housing. He said that the apartments are usually not completely occupied for those staying on campus over the summer. Most students will instead stay in residence hall dorm rooms.
“We’re down one apartment complex that we can’t use,” Killilee said. “However, apartments tend to be the least occupied of all of our residence spaces in the summer. We don’t often fill our apartment complexes. Alumni Square was down last year; it’ll be down again this year.”

The McDonough School of Business’s program for master’s in business administration was ranked among the top-25 MBA programs in the country, according to a March 13 ranking by U.S. News & World Report.
Of the 131 programs ranked, the MSB’s full-time MBA program was ranked No. 21 in the nation, up one spot from last year’s ranking of No. 22. Additionally, the MSB’s international business studies program ranked eighth, up seven spots from last year. The MSB’s evening, part-time program was ranked No. 18, down six spots from last year.
U.S. News & World Report’s rankings for MBA programs are based on a number of distinct metrics, such as rates of recent alumni employment, base salaries after graduation and surveys completed by peer institutions on fellow MBA programs.
Senior Associate Dean for MBA Programs Prashant Malaviya said the ranking honors the MSB’s accomplishments and inspires them to improve programs in the future. Malaviya said the ranking indicates improvement in the latter metric, demonstrating Georgetown’s standing among fellow universities.
“What’s really important is to see that, slowly but surely, our reputation amongst our peer institutions is also improving,” Malaviya said. “To see that those measures are also improving is a reflection that not only are we doing hard work and doing well, but people are recognizing that we are doing the hard work and doing well.”
Malaviya also attributed the rankings to the innovative use of technology fostered within the MSB. One such example is the “blended classroom” the MSB introduced last January, which allows students to attend classes and engage with course materials both physically and digitally.
“We cannot be satisfied with what we have done in the past. We’ve got to be continuously innovating, and a big part of innovation in today’s education world is technology-based initiatives,” Malaviya said. “We are exploring and experimenting with several initiatives that are reliant on technology and looking at how technology enhances both the educational experience for our students and the quality of learning, but also increasing access of Georgetown to the world.”
MSB Assistant Dean for Communications Teresa Mannix said the MSB’s improved ranking for full-time students is also due to the program’s increased percentage of students who are employed three months after graduation — up to 90.3 percent from last year’s 85.9 percent.
Mannix said the drop in ranking of the MBA evening program can be attributed to the program’s primary recruitment of full-time students. U.S. News & World Report includes what percentage of students are part-time in their calculation of program rankings, which Mannix explained is a much smaller population within the MSB than within most MBA programs.
Malaviya said the program’s increased rankings among international business programs reflect a number of new initiatives within the MSB, such as its joint master’s program with the School of Foreign Service launched last fall, which allows students to study the intersection between international business and foreign affairs.
“That’s really a core of what the MSB brand is and what it has been since the very beginning, and that is getting reinforced every day through the curricula initiatives that we take and through the work that our students do all over the world,” Malaviya said. “So it is really making sure that we deliver on our promise of being the premier destination for global business education.”

The Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation announced 23 recipients of its annual GU Impacts fellowship alongside a series of changes to the program Monday.
The program, which sends students to work in social impact organizations for 10 weeks in the summer, is seeing a significant expansion this year, with the program almost doubling from last year’s 16 participants.
87 students completed the application this year., with a 26.4 percent acceptance rate. The program received 73 applications last year.
The 23 fellows will work at nine partner organizations in India, Nicaragua, Peru, the Philippines, Rwanda, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta. The fellows will also partake in fall past-programming that includes capstone presentations, reflections and career development.
Some of the new initiatives being piloted in the 2017 fellowship program include the addition of a graduate student from the Global Human Development program. The program is also debuting a partnership with the Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines, entrepreneurship collaboration space kLab, the Gashora Girls Academy for Science and Technology and Akazi Kanoze Access, a United States Agency for International Development-funded school, in Rwanda.
GU Impacts project manager Matthew Fortier said these changes are part of the program’s efforts to expand and reach more communities internationally.
“I’m really excited about the program this year because it’s the largest program to date,” Fortier said. “We also expanded the number of partnerships, and with that we are entering new geography — we are working in East Africa, specifically in Rwanda, for the first time, and we’re placing students in three different partnerships in the same country, which is really exciting.”
According to Fortier, one of the most important aspects of the program is how it teaches Georgetown students to apply what they learn in the classroom to real -life situations.
“Whether it’s working for a nonprofit, a for-profit, or a government initiative, students can apply the skills they learn in the classroom, and that will not only help them to refine their skills, but also to determine how to make the most their remaining time at Georgetown,” Fortier said.
According to Fortier, the program hopes to provide students with an experience that will stay with them through their time at Georgetown and beyond.
“The hope is that these experiences will be transformative and that students will take their experiences with them for the rest of their lives, and as they go on to make important decisions in the various positions that they hold, that this GU Impacts experience will stay with them and influence them in a positive way moving forward,” Fortier said.
Beatrice Hociota (MSB ’19), a GU Impacts alum who participated in a partnership with Mochila Digital in Managua, Nicaragua, and now serves as the program’s alumni mentor, said the program allowed her to combine her skills with her career interests to grow both personally and professionally.
“Through GU Impacts I was able to work in a business setting while also improving my Spanish speaking skills and learning about a different culture,” Hociota wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It gave me the opportunity to learn to be okay with being uncomfortable – both personally and professionally. The growth that I have been able to see in myself and in my peers as a result of this fellowship has been incredible.”
Louisa Christen (SFS ’19), who is part of the 2017 class of GU Impacts Fellows, will be working with Agora Partnerships in Managua, Nicaragua. Christen said GU Impacts is important because it empowers different groups around the world to exercise their innate potential.
“It is a fellowship that, as a whole, is dedicated to actualizing social change, leveling the playing field around the world and improving local communities,” Christen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Though the program’s mission is carried out in the local community, its vision reaches much farther. In our globalized world, unlocked human potential undeniably comes around to impact all of us.”

An increase in the number of hate-related incidents reported within Washington, D.C., jumped to about 62 percent between 2015 and 2016, numbers that have left local authorities perplexed and members of the targeted communities concerned about their future safety.
Sixty-six incidents were reported in 2015 compared to 107 in 2016. Though racially motivated crimes were down 26 percent in 2016 from 2015, crimes committed based on ethnicity, religion, gender and sexual orientation all increased in 2016.
Crimes based on ethnicity or national origin increased from three to 12 between 2015 and 2016. Reported crimes based on religion increased from five to 18. Crimes based on sexual orientation, which have the highest reported number in the past five years, increased from 27 to 40 between 2015 and 2016. Crimes based on gender identity or expression increased from 10 to 19.
In a March 10 press conference addressing the city’s efforts to combat hate and bias-related crimes, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said her administration has made combatting these issues a top priority across the District.
“We value diversity and inclusivity and want all of our residents and visitors to feel safe. No matter your race, your faith, your sexual orientation, your gender identity, your background — you should be able to live, work and play in Washington, D.C., without fear of violence or discrimination,” Bowser said at the press conference.
Bowser added that an important aspect of combatting hate-related incidents is the public coming forward to accurately report them.
“My administration will continue fostering a culture that encourages people to come forward when they are the victim of discrimination or a bias-related crime because in order to properly address these issues, we need everyone to feel safe reporting them,” Bowser said.
Metropolitan Police Department Chief of Police Peter Newsham said the MPD was disheartened to see the rise in hate crimes in light of launching a number of initiatives to combat these crimes, including starting a focused outreach effort to the District’s Jewish and Islamic institutions, distributing flyers in six different languages to the District’s immigrant communities and increasing specialized resources to support victims of hate crimes.
“Although the number of reported hate crimes is only a small fraction of the overall crime in our city, we think it is important for everyone to know about this increase so we can collectively work on addressing it,” Newsham said in a press conference. “We will not accept this as the new norm.”
Newsham also addressed the role of the 2016 election in the increase of bias-related crimes across the nation.
“When I saw the concern that swept through our communities in the aftermath of the November election, I knew we had to send a message that MPD’s values have not and will not change,” Newsham said.
Mónica Palacio, the director of the D.C. Office of Human Rights, said monitoring these incidents and establishing a protocol is crucial to reducing the incidents of hate crimes.
Palacio said the OHR is expanding access to programs for transgender individuals who have been the victim of hate crimes, as well as programs for crisis intervention, counseling, medical forensic care and legal advocacy.
“We are reminded every day of the negative impacts of bias through the discrimination complaints we investigate,” Palacio said at the press conference. “However, we believe that when employers are equipped with the right information, discrimination can be avoided.”
Palacio also announced that the OHR is partnering with MPD to provide services to victims of hate crimes as soon as they contact MPD. All District patrol officers will have a card with information directing victims to OHR services as they respond to 911 calls.
Georgetown University Rabbi Rachel Gartner said she has seen increased instances of anti-Semitism, both through her own experiences and those of her colleagues and members of her community.
Two Jewish schools in the D.C.-Metro area received bomb threats last month, and according to Newsham, of the 18 religiously motivated hate crimes in 2016, 12 were perpetrated against Jewish individuals.
“I think it’s hard to say whether or not anti-Semitism is on the rise. We clearly know that anti-Semitic incidents are on the rise and it is very unsettling,” Gartner said. “It’s shifted our perspective a little bit, because seeing it is kind of an eye-opener. It makes you feel a little bit insecure, wondering what’s going to come next.”
Despite being saddened by the increase in reported incidents in the past year, Gartner urged members of the Georgetown community to see beyond the incidents against just the Jewish community.
“For me, this bias is just a piece of everything that we’re seeing. Apathy, in the very least and misguided fear and baseless hatred of refugees are all a part of it,” Gartner said. “As we fight one of these things we need to fight all of them.”
Gartner said that despite the differences in the communities at the receiving end of hate-related crimes, all communities should act together to combat bias.
“I do not feel that the Jewish community is going through the level of threat as some other communities,” Gartner said. “At the same time, I wouldn’t want us to forget that we need to stand up for each other and with each other.”

A collective response is needed against the recent worldwide swell of anti-Semitism, according to former United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Ira N. Forman in an event hosted by the Georgetown University Center for Jewish Civilization on Wednesday.
“Words are terribly important. It’s absolutely essential for not just the president, but Congress, and local elected officials, to speak out,” Forman said in the Intercultural Center Auditorium. “If civil society does not come to our side, it’s over. This is about the very values of the French republic. By extension, you could say it’s about the values of liberal democracy. That’s what’s at stake.”
According to Forman, while 49 percent of Americans surveyed agreed with the statement that anti-Semitism in the United States is a very serious or somewhat serious problem in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted last February, 70 percent of responders agreed with the same statement in the same poll conducted last week.
“There has been a real change in the United States of, at least, perceptions of incidents of anti-Semitism,” Forman said.
Anti-Semitism has come under the spotlight in recent months. There have been 67 bomb threats against Jewish community centers since January, according to The New Republic, while in February, tombstones in a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis, were turned over.
Forman said the complexity of modern-day anti-Semitism renders easy solutions impossible.
“There are no simple silver bullets here that we have, partly because of the difficulty and the complexity of the problem,” Forman said.
Forman said, however, that Jews are not in as dire straits as they were in the 1930s, when Jews faced persecution around the world, including in Nazi Germany. However, he warned that the world must learn from that perilous decade.
“Is this the 1930s? The answer is no, it is not. But if it’s not the 1930s, there are some really important lessons and issues we have to deal with. First of all, I believe history does run in cycles,” Forman said.
Forman specifically highlighted economic transformations as a trigger for xenophobia that corresponds with a rise in anti-Semitism.
“What pops for me out of the 1930s is economic dislocation and the rise of xenophobia. The other thing that is very clear is that we are 70 years past the Holocaust,” Forman said. “The generation that was alive during the Holocaust is quickly dying off. We forgot the implications, and that maybe is natural.”
As U.S. special envoy, Forman said he noticed how anti-Semitism takes different shapes in different countries.
“Xenophobic right-wing nationalism is driving anti-Semitism in Hungary. In France, you have xenophobic right-wing nationalism, but Jews also face anti-Semitism from the extreme left, often associated with green or anti-colonial movements, or anti-Israel sentiment,” Forman said.
Forman said prejudice against Jews could be seen as a feature, rather than an exception, of Western society.
“Whether it’s Hellenistic anti-Semitism during the Commonwealth Period, Christian anti-Semitism that dominated the first millennium and a half of the common era, racist anti-Semitism in the post-Enlightenment era or even anti-Semitism that is often masked behind anti-Israel rhetoric; all those have commonalities that are central to Western civilization,” Forman said.
Collective action by civil society is more ingrained in American culture than in European culture, according to Forman.
“In the U.S., civil society generally does stand up. We can do it better — we can certainly do it better against Islamophobia — but we have that mechanism that is really important. That mechanism does not largely exist in Europe.”
Georgetown Israel Alliance’s Political Chair Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20), who attended the event, said he appreciated that Forman distinguished anti-Semitism from criticism of Israel.
“It was very important that he highlighted that anti-Semitism and anti-Israel criticism are not the same thing, and people should not fall into the trap of automatically accusing anti-Israel sentiment of being anti-Semitic,” Larkin said. “However, they often are associated with one another.”
Larkin said that despite increased incidents against Jews in America, he has felt increased support from the community, especially from non-Jews.
“I felt a real upsurge in support for the Jewish community from many non-Jews, including many Muslims,” Larkin said. “It’s been a real wake-up call that anti-Semitism is present in our society, and we need to stand up against it.”
