ALEXANDER BROWN/THE HOYASEIU Director of Research and Strategic Planning Anne McLeer rallied the crowd at a panel on adjuncts Wednesday.Adjunct professors, university officials and students discussed the problems that non-tenured faculty members face nationwide — including an inability to find full-time jobs and difficulties involving unionization — during a conference held in the ICC Auditorium on Wednesday evening.
During this event, which was sponsored by the Georgetown University Student Association, adjunct-professor panelists discussed the strides that have been made since May 2013, when adjunct professors at the university voted to unionize and join the Services Employees International Union 500.
“It’s just unfair to have people doing the same work, held to the same expectations, with the same qualifications and expertise and the same dedication … to have these people underpaid and excluded and offered no benefits,” SEIU Director of Research and Strategic Planning Anne McLeer said to the audience.
The conference, which was attended by about a dozen students, also examined student involvement in the unionization of adjunct professors at Georgetown; it proved minimal when compared to similar movements at other colleges like American University.
“Somehow, at Georgetown, there was not very much student activity, and I think that’s a shame. I think in the future, in organized efforts, every effort must be made to get the students involved,” adjunct faculty member Pablo Eisenberg said.
In addition to issues involving pay, benefits and job protection, the adjuncts described the difficulties they face when finding jobs as full-time professors.
“Unfortunately, what happens is that there is a bias against adjuncts themselves, which is counter-intuitive because we do all have the same qualifications [as full-time professors],” adjunct professor Kerry Danner-McDonald (COL ’93) said. “More or less, the longer you stay adjunct, the less likely it is that you will ever be hired for a full-time position. It’s almost like you have a shelf life.”
Adjunct professors were buoyed in their efforts with the January release of a report by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, which concluded that the quality of education at universities is compromised by a lack of institutional support for adjunct professors. CHEA proposed fundamental changes in the accreditation process for colleges and universities with large numbers of non-tenure-track faculty members.
“Given that NTTFs make up the majority of faculty on most campuses, they should be provided a significant voice and attention in the accreditation process during the self-study process and campus visits,” the report said.
Eisenberg felt that the report called on administrators to directly respond to the needs of adjunct faculty members.
“I think that [the report is] some momentum in pushing administrators to be fairer in their treatment of adjuncts, particularly since the working conditions of teachers affect the quality of education that students receive. I think it’s a welcome report,” Eisenberg said.
According to the report, poor working conditions for non-tenure-track faculty members negatively impact students and lead to decreased graduation and retention rates. Daniel Maxey, who co-authored the report, believes that accrediting schools have been receptive to its findings thus far.
“Ultimately, accreditors are very concerned with the quality of academic programs at colleges and universities,” Maxey said. “You’ve got a situation where a majority of the faculty at many institutions are facing working conditions that impede their ability to serve their students and to provide the highest quality instruction possible. … The accreditors that we work with believe that this is an issue that needs to be addressed.”
Georgetown’s adjunct professors are currently working with the university to forge solutions to these problems. SEIU has reached tentative agreements with the university that will be included in a contract voted on by adjunct professors. These agreements include the assurance of a safe working environment, the creation of a Labor Collaboration Committee that will meet between negotiations to discuss issues of mutual interest and equal academic-freedom rights for part-time and full-time faculty members.
“We have presented proposals on various issues, and then both sides roll their sleeves up and make suggestions as to how to resolve these issues. It’s a much more collaborative process than I think people imagine,” McLeer said.
So far, negotiations between the bargaining committee and the university have proceeded amiably.
“Negotiations are going very well,” McLeer said. “They’re very productive, very collegiate and very collaborative. Both sides are working together to resolve some of the issues that adjuncts face at Georgetown.”
However, some adjunct professors feel that little progress has been made since the union was formed last year.
“I haven’t seen much activity on the university’s side so far. The university was very open about the vote [to unionize] and didn’t try to influence our votes, but I haven’t seen much change yet,” said Natalie Goldring, an adjunct professor in the Center for Security Studies. “I would like to see the university address the question of working conditions. I’d also like to see them address benefits.”
Goldring, who has worked at Georgetown as both a full-time and adjunct faculty member, said that her workload was unchanged by her status. She therefore feels that the discrepancy in the working conditions of full-time and adjunct professors is unwarranted.
“I don’t think that adjunct professors in the Security Studies Program provide a lower quality of teaching, and I don’t think we provide a lower-quality learning experience for our students,” Goldring said.

JULIA HENNRIKUS/THE HOYALinguistics professor Mark Sicoli leads two projects dedicated to analyzing and revitalizing the Zapotec-Chatino language family, native to Mexico, with an innovative method that goes beyond spoken words.Each Tuesday afternoon in Poulton Hall, professor Mark Sicoli gathers with a student research team to analyze videos of people speaking Lachixío, of the West Zapotec language family that is spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico.
With the rising prominence of Spanish, only approximately 3,000 people in the world currently speak Lachixío; in 2000, children in only four towns learned the language. Lachixío is considered an endangered language, and if current trends continue, the Linguistic Society of America expects it to become extinct within the next century. 
Sicoli’s group, named Multimodal Interaction in Meso America, analyzes the videos in order to understand everyday interactions, such as eating dinner or entertaining visitors. The videos, which total over 40 hours, were gathered during the summers of 2008 and 2009. Known as multimodal analysis, this method relies on the theory that language is more than simply spoken words; it is also gestures and other behaviors. 
“These are not setups. This is just what people would be doing if they were just going about their normal stuff,” Sicoli said. “Through all this work, we get the flavor of the language — not just the words and rules but also the flavor of how it gets used in social life — which are, in a sense, another level of rules for the use of language.”
According to Sicoli, interactional structures based on specific actions, such as requests or offers, can be similar between languages, even if the spoken language is different.
“The language material itself varies quite a bit, but the interactional structure that underlies language use is actually quite universal,” Sicoli said. “It’s actually turned the traditional view on its head — that language is much more variable than we thought, but interactional structure is much less variable than people think it is.”
—————————————
Sicoli, who also speaks Lachixío, initially learned about the language while completing his master’s degree at the University of Pittsburgh when a professor invited him to help with another language documentation project in the area. 
“I found the people fascinating and the languages very fascinating to me,” Sicoli said. “I wanted to work on a tonal language, like Cantonese and Mandarin and most of the other languages of the world.” 
Although several factors contribute to a language’s endangerment and possible extinction, Sicoli noted the strong influence of cultural ideologies have a major influence, particularly for Zapotec languages.
“Spanish became everybody’s second language starting in the ’50s and ’60s there, and with nationalism, for instance, comes a strong ideology for creating signs of homogeneity among the population,” Sicoli said. “Language is an easy symbol for people to grab on to and say, if we all speak the same language, we’re all the same people.”
—————————————
To revitalize the indigenous Zapotec-Chatino language family, which includes Lachixío and approximately 25 other languages, Sicoli has launched two projects that are funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  
Part of the Documenting Endangered Languages Program is an online archive of 2,500 phrases — such as verbs or numbers — from each of the 103 Mexican towns that speaks a Zapotec-Chatino language, readily available for linguists and students to utilize for revitalization purposes. According to Sicoli, the archive will be completed later this year.
But while Sicoli recognized the importance of documenting languages, he said that it did not embody the true nature of languages.
“It doesn’t capture language in its natural ecology,” Sicoli said.
Therefore, based on the research collected with his student research group, Sicoli aims to release a book called “Saying and Doing in Lachixío Zapotec” this year. To finalize his research, he will return to Oaxaca in July.
Sicoli, who teaches the undergraduate course “Language Evolution” and graduate course “Multimodal Interaction,” is one of the first to emphasize discourse and multimodal interaction in this way.
“People have tended to focus on documenting vocabularies,” Sicoli said. “Actually looking at language in use and how people are using that to coordinate their activities in everyday life has been mostly absent, but it’s a growing area. It’s a cutting-edge area of linguistics.”
Sicoli added that this shift toward multimodal analysis is a field-wide trend, encouraged by the NSF and the NEH.
“[They] are trying to encourage this type of documentation of language rather than the dictionary documentation as a bag of words and a bag of rules,” Sicoli said. “This is really the future of documentation — how language is used to do all of the things that we do as people — because it’s such a part of everything we do.” 
Professor Deborah Tannen, a sociolinguist, stressed the importance of Sicoli’s methods and technology for the field of linguistics.
“He’s at the [forefront] of the use of new technology in understanding language, analyzing language, storing language [and] using technological capabilities to analyze the features of the language,” Tannen said. “[The technology] allows us to analyze language in a more scientific way than we could before.”
The students in Sicoli’s research group agreed and said they were excited to work with Sicoli on the innovative analysis methods.
“I really like Dr. Sicoli’s approach — his analytical approach, his theoretical approach,” Amelia Tseng (GRD ’14), who is a Ph.D. candidate, said. “He’s a very well-rounded scholar who works on a number of things in impressive breadth and depth, so to be able to work with someone like that is very good for me in terms of learning how to do various things.”
By learning and using Sicoli’s methods, students are also able to learn and adapt to the specialized software the research group uses. 
“I enjoy getting experience with the software, which has been really helpful for me in a lot of the projects that I’ve done,” said April-Michelle Thomas (COL ’15), who is also using Sicoli’s software for her senior anthropology thesis.
—————————————
In addition to his documentation work, Sicoli also raises awareness in indigenous communities of the endangered nature of their language. 
“There’s many a documented case where languages go extinct without people really recognizing they’re coming into jeopardy until it’s too late,” Sicoli said. “It’s this issue of the human right to have a means of communication that is culturally appropriate for your desires, and that’s a nice place to kind of be able to contribute with the work of a linguist to be able to contribute to that empowerment.”
Nevertheless, Sicoli emphasized that he does not like to think of himself as “saving” the languages.
“I’ve done a lot of work to train native speakers of different Zapotec languages to do linguistics and to develop materials for their own town, and this where I really see there’s a service side to the work which helps facilitate people to do language maintenance within their own community, and that piece has to be there in order for anything you do to really work,” Sicoli said. “I like to put the agency in the hands of the people.”

KRISTEN SKILLMAN/THE HOYASam Greco (SFS ’15), Second Society of StewardsFour of the eight candidates running for Georgetown University Student Association executive office have confirmed membership in secret societies, compared to two out of the 10 candidates involved in the groups last year.
Presidential candidate Ben Weiss (COL ’15) and his running mate Sam Greco (SFS ’15) are both members of the Second Society of Stewards, while vice presidential hopefuls Dan Silk- man (COL ’15) and Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15) are members of the unre- lated Third Society of Stewards.
A fifth candidate, presidential hopeful Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), was rumored to have been in the process of induction into the Second Society; however, correspondence with Steward leadership provided by Tezel indicates he declined an offer of membership Jan. 29.
Tezel and Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) are the only ticket without at least one member of either secret society. Last year, three of the five teams claimed to be unaffiliated.
Tezel’s campaign sent a press release to student media early Wednes- day, outlining the trajectory of his conversations with the secret society. Tezel was interviewed by a panel of Stewards during the last GUSA executive election in February 2013, but the society declined to pursue him further at the time. He was approached again in October, at which time he submitted a letter to an unidentified Second Society leader delineating his ultimate decision to decline the organization’s offer of membership.
“My personal decision to decline consideration for the society stems not from its mission nor its potential effect on my candidacy for any office I may consider seeking next semester,” Tezel wrote in the letter, a redacted copy of which he sent to The Hoya. Tezel cited two concerns: the Stewards’ demands for secrecy, as well as the overall effect of their presence at Georgetown.
He has since been approached twice, according to the statement.
“According to Tezel, the existence of secret societies on campus can and has dissuaded non-members from involvement in campus life due to the dominance of leadership positions by members of secret societies, predominantly heterosexual, white, Christian men,” the statement, issued by Tezel and Omika Jikaria’s communication director, Emily Perkins (COL ’14), reads. “This imbalance in resources constitutes socio-structural prejudice and is an institutional barrier to equal opportunity and equal representation on a campus that purports to support social justice.”
The Second Society has held a place at Georgetown since its founding in 1982, when it split from the original Stewards society. While it initially operated almost exclusively in secret, in 1988 professor Fr. Joseph T. Durkin, S.J., exposed the organization in two letters to The hoya, after which leadership announced that the society would soon be dissolved.
However, the organization continued operating in secrecy until 2001, when Adam A. Carter (COL ’87, LAW ’91) published an article in the now defunct Georgetown Academy magazine, explaining the organization’s characteristics and objectives.
“The Second Stewards Society is a college fraternity of mostly alumni and students of Georgetown University,” he wrote. “Our right to serve Georgetown as we think best is no different than any other congregation of students, alumni, faculty, administrators or Jesuits.”
During last year’s GUSA executive election, the Stewards’ presence at Georgetown came to the forefront of public discussion when an anonymous Facebook account, “Steward Throat Hoya,” posted a correspondence that identified presidential candidate Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) as a member of the Second Society. This year, a Twitter account with the handle @StewardsandGUSA and the display name “Edward Stewarden” attempted to bring the Stewards issue to the fore by tweeting a link to his blog at various Georgetown organizations and students, beginning Jan. 30, more than two weeks in advance of the election kickoff. The blog only featured one post,
which described the author’s distaste for the amount of power a secret organization could wield. The Twitter account, which had been inactive since Feb. 4, has since been suspended.
The Third Society of Stewards is the direct successor to the original Stewards, who renamed themselves thusly after the Second Society left, and remains more secretive than their erstwhile
“When you’re the president of GU Pride, you aren’t approached by too many secret societies.”
THOMAS LLOYD (SFS ’15) GUSA Presidential Candidate peers. During last year’s election, Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) admitted to being a member of a private organization that was not the Second Society, but did not confirm his status in the Thirds.
Presidential candidate Zach Singer (SFS ’15), Silkman’s running mate, said that he has never been approached by a society, as did presidential candidate Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15), Ramirez’s partner.
“When you’re the president of GU Pride, you aren’t approached by too many secret societies, certainly none on the more conservative end,” Lloyd said.
This year’s candidates who are confirmed members of either society maintain that their membership in no way affects their platforms.
“It has definitely been a fulfilling experience on campus for me, and I have learned a lot and grown a lot through this group,” Silkman said of his mem- bership in the Thirds. “But in no way, shape, or form does it have anything to do with my running for GUSA.”
Silkman emphasized that he will continue to be open about his involvement. “I plan to be very honest, so if I am ever asked, I will be honest in saying my affiliation,” he said. “But I don’t think it will have any impact.”
Weiss similarly noted that he did not expect his association with the Second Society to have any impact on his campaign.
“The society has absolutely nothing to do with GUSA elections,” Weiss said. “I think everybody involved last year saw how it turned the focus away from the issues and what campaigns should be about towards a second and entirely unrelated question of private organizations.”
Weiss reiterated the society does not factor into GUSA elections.
“I am absolutely not ashamed in any way to be a member of my society, but it has nothing to do with GUSA at all,” Weiss said.
Similarly, in an emailed statement to The hoya, Ramirez noted that his mem- bership in the Thirds has had no impact on his motivations as a student leader.
“My membership in this group has not interfered in my on-campus involvements in the past,” Ramirez wrote. “And I can assure that it will not interfere with my future on-campus involvements as well, including my role as GUSA vice president if I was to win.”

COURTESY LGBTQ RESOURCE CENTERLeft to right: Cal Watson, Bridget Sherry, Shiva Subbaraman and Michael Ritterbeck, staff on the LGBTQ retreat.The LGBTQ Resource Center held its inaugural retreat for 23 students at the Calcagnini Contemplative Center in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains over President’s Day Weekend.
Due to high interest in the retreat, the center increased the number of participants from the original cutoff number of 18.
“As the community has grown, part of our hope in doing this retreat was to figure out where we are as a community because we don’t get to see ourselves as a community very often,” LGBTQ Resource Center Director Shiva Subbaraman said.
Although the Calcagnini Contemplative Center hosts other retreats including ESCAPE and ministry events, the retreat is the first LGBTQ event to use the space.
“I think we built on and extended that retreat culture by bringing something like this to the LGBTQ community to provide a space that really was safe to open up and talk about all of those different aspects of being a student and also [the] LGBTQ identity,” LGBTQ Resource Center Special Projects Coordinator Bridget Sherry said.
The retreat, endowed with a “journeys” theme, consisted of a series of student reflections on their origins, current states and future hopes. The retreat also included small group and large group contemplation with the goal of engaging those attending in reflection. The retreat highlighted how being a member of the LGBTQ community affects a person’s identity. 
“You’re recognizing that the LGBTQ identity is just one aspect of a person, how they experience that is part of a holistic approach to self,” Sherry said.
The students said that the dialogue that took place throughout the retreat served as a bonding mechanism.
“My favorite part of the retreat was staying up, a good three hours after we were supposed to go to bed, just talking,” ESCAPE leader and LGBTQ retreat organizer Eric Nevalsky  (SFS ’16) said. “We started talking to each other about our lives and our stories and it was a great way for us to bond and bring our friendship to a deeper level.”
Throughout the course of the retreat, students celebrated diversity and discussed similar experiences. 
“The LBGTQ communities have many different facades on campus and that’s not something I expected,” Patrick Bylis (COL ’17) said. “I expected everyone to be involved in Pride and really vocal about it, but that’s not the case.”
Participants also discussed how they could improve the LGBTQ community at Georgetown and continue to expand the community. 
“The phrase that came up often at the retreat was ‘widening the welcome mat,’” Nevalsky said. “Everyone said that we need to make sure that we are welcoming and that we respect people’s differences because everybody was at that point in the process at some point.”
In order to organize the event, students attended retreat-oriented focus groups in November. 
“It takes a while to know the students, to know the community and for myself to see what the needs of the students are,” Subbaraman said.
Participants in the overnight retreat included students involved in the LGBTQ community, unaffiliated students and both closeted and openly gay students. 
“I think it was surprising how open people were because it was a very short amount of time,” Bylis said.  “Hearing about their triumphs and struggles in all of their lives inspired me to be open and inspired me to get a lot out of the retreat.”
Martin Hussey (SFS ’14) reflected on the changes he has seen during his time at Georgetown. Although the LGBTQ community has grown in recent years in support and size, Hussey questioned whether the development was from the larger Georgetown community or simply his social circle.
“I think it’s difficult for me to separate Georgetown maturing as a community and myself and my friends maturing,” Hussey said. “I think freshman year it was much less stigmatized to say something homophobic.”
Despite its Jesuit identity, Georgetown has since aligned with the sentiments of society and its subsequent perception of the LGBTQ community.
“I think that the changes that have happened at Georgetown [are] parallel to what has changed in the country too,” Subbaraman said.
In the future, Subbaraman hopes to provide an LGBTQ-specific retreat at least once a year. For the immediate future, Subbaraman and Sherry both hope to find a way to sustain the conversations and connections students made on the retreat.
“Retreats are unique in that everyone gets something unique out of it for themselves,” Sherry said. “I think one of the biggest fruits of it was hearing from each other in that small group sharing and the large group sharing to view that power of personal narrative and to recognize that you’re not the only one going through something.”

NATASHA THOMSON/THE HOYASenior University Architect Jodi Ernst introduced revised designs to the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall in an open forum Wednesday.University administrators and representatives from architectural firm Sasaki Associates presented revised designs for the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall at an open forum Wednesday afternoon.
“We’ve evolved the building significantly since it appeared on the website [last] June,” Sasaki Senior University Architect Jodi Ernst said. “We’ve been working in concert with a lot of student input, a lot of forums, a lot of … [Old Georgetown Board] input most recently, to really refine the building and make it as nice as it is today.”
Approximately 15 students attended the forum.
In response to the OGB’s suggestions, Sasaki architects added an additional entrance on the south side of the building that leads into an open engagement space on the ground floor.
This space, accessible to all students, includes a large workroom with movable panels that can be used as temporary study niches and a large multipurpose room that can be divided into two smaller rooms and a kitchen.
“One of the things that informed a lot of our thinking about the design was the ability to engage students in different ways and the ability to combine social learning and hanging out with more academic purposes,” Sasaki Campus Studio Head and Executive Board Member Vincius Gorgati said.
The building’s original plans included a mezzanine with various study spaces overlooking the first floor’s engagement space, but architects eliminated it due to the building’s height restrictions and financial constraints.
“You always start a project with a wish list of all the things that you would like to have, and at some point, the budgets come and you need to make some adjustments,” Gorgati said.
Residents will access their rooms with their GOCards, making the Northeast Triangle Georgetown’s first keyless residence hall. Administrators have not yet finalized plans for electronic room access, but they have determined that each floor will contain an emergency phone in case of lockouts.
“[The Department of Public Safety] has signed off on it. GOCard has signed off on it,” Director for Residence Life Stephanie Lynch said. “It’s just a matter of implementation at this point.”
Each residential floor consists of a variety of semi-suites with two, four or six beds and a bathroom. The bathrooms will be compartmentalized to allow up to three people to simultaneously utilize them while maintaining privacy.
The double bedrooms in each unit are compact and will have space for closets, beds and desks. Beds will be raised to create room for dressers underneath.
“Every square inch that we could get, we put back into the [common] areas so that we could find some balance between privacy and collaboration,” Gorgati said.
Additionally, each floor will include a common room, a kitchen and a quiet study room.
In addition to changes to Northeast Triangle’s interior, Sasaki also implemented changes to the outside according to OGB’s feedback.
The building’s exterior includes elements of stone, brick and glass in order to connect the primarily stone buildings of Healy Quad with the brick buildings on the north side of campus.
“There was a very strong engagement from OGB in the sense that we should work with those elements and develop a design that was authentic — a building of today that was inspired by the buildings of the past, as opposed to a building of today that tries to mimic the buildings of the past,” Gorgati said.
Sasaki’s plans for the Northeast Triangle extended beyond the building itself, with landscape architect Gautam Sundaram presenting designs for the walkway situated between Reiss Science Building and the site of the Northeast Triangle.
The plans created extra outdoor seating by calling for additional benches and movable tables and chairs along the walkway, as well as a green terrace with precast concrete seat edges outside the dorm.
“That area can be a more successful and user-friendly space, rather than just a wide walkway,” Sundaram said.
In addition, Sasaki redesigned the steps between Red Square and this walkway. The new stairs will be wider for greater accessibility. The adjacent ramp will also be moved to the opposite side and will be curved, meeting the steps at both the top and the bottom.
The Northeast Triangle, which will house 225 students, is scheduled to open in fall 2016, instead of the originally planned fall 2015. The Old Jesuit Residence Project and temporary conversion of Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center floors will contribute to filling the requirement in the interim.
Preliminary Northeast Triangle site work is expected to begin in June, with construction beginning in early October. The architects approximated that construction will take about 16 months.
Although the OGB already approved the proposed building’s scale and massing, the university will seek full concept approval on March 6.

COURTESY NAIMUNThe NAIMUN conference welcomed 150 schools to D.C.Despite heavy snow and travel difficulties, the Georgetown International Relations Association’s 51st North American Invitational Model United Nations Conference took place from Feb. 13 to 16.
In response to snow, NAIMUN staffers, led by NAIMUN Secretary-General Pavan Rajgopal (SFS ’15) and Executive Director Sarah Pemberton (SFS ’15), focused on the ability of committees to adapt and creatively continue discourse despite delayed delegates.
“There was just a lot of adaptation we had to do, mostly on the executive side, so that’s Pavan and Sarah who were running the conference, and they did a great job with it,” Danny Aherne (COL ’16), director of the U.S. Supreme Court committee, said.
The heavy snow affected travel plans, causing many of the 150 attending high school delegations difficulties in reaching the Hilton in Dupont Circle. Only about two-thirds of high school students arrived in time for the first committee session at 9 p.m. on Thursday.
Late delegates, however, creatively stepped into their roles.
“Some of the people that got awards were people that came late,” Andrew Wang, president of the Roxbury Latin School’s Model UN, said. “So I think they definitely did a good job of making sure that people got caught up, and in knowing how to help them out.”
For those committees deemed unable to run because of the lack of delegates, Georgetown staffers found several creative solutions.
“A few of us on security were asked to sort of fill in on a few of the committees because there were so many delegates missing that you couldn’t really run an effective committee,” staffer Alex Barnes (SFS ’16) said. “So a few of us stepped in and took the places of the high school kids that were missing. … I tried to start a secret war between the [United States] and the USSR, so that was fun.”
Crisis committees, although carefully structured, allowed delegates to control the direction of the committee.
“You usually sit down with the secretary-general, the director-general, the [Undersecretary-General] and the [Deputy Undersecretary-General] and you discuss different potential committee styles or committee types,” DUSG Councils, Boards and Courts Isobel Blakeway-Phillips (SFS ’16) said. “A lot of times you’ll have one or two ideas when you’re going into it, lots of which can be really, really controversial, and you take stages to come up with. [The trial of] Kaiser Wilhelm, we sat there for about an hour discussing whether or not it would even function properly.”
In addition to replacing absent delegates with present staffers, NAIMUN executives presented Georgetown chairs and directors with other solutions.
“Our committee was only supposed to have only 13 kids, so if you’re missing, you know, five kids, it’s not going to run very smoothly,” Aherne said. “So we wound up moving kids from different committees in, which actually worked really well.”
Though this on-the-spot shuffling of delegates left some committees well short of a necessary number, Aherne said that individual chairs and directors adapted remarkably well, along with the general oversight of executives.
“Mike [Sliwinski (SFS ’16)] also turned his committee into a crisis. So, his was supposed to be the [Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice], and so ostensibly they’re supposed to be dealing with macro issues, but given how small the committee was, because of how many kids weren’t able to make it and how many got moved onto different committee … they made a crisis arc out of it, where they had pirates and whatnot.”
According to attendee Wang, the ad hoc gambit paid off.
“I think NAIMUN is really creative with how they run their crisis committees, with the crises that they give us and making it creative, making it fun,” Wang said. “The chairs let us steer the direction of it our own way, as opposed to kind of saying, ‘We have to talk about this.’”

Georgetown students will face a Friday night dilemma this spring, as miscommunications led to the scheduling of both the 89th Annual Diplomatic Ball and the Georgetown Program Board Spring Kickoff Concert on the night of April 4.
This is not the first time a scheduling conflict of this sort has occurred. Last year, the ball conflicted with Relay for Life, and while the leaders of those two events worked together this year so as to avoid a similar issue, the respective ball and spring concert planners did not take each other into account.
Both the ball and concert are highly anticipated events planned well in advance, which includes the scheduling of venues. For the kickoff concert, McDonough Arena was scheduled immediately after last year’s Calvin Harris concert wrapped last spring. For the ball, after the committee chairs were elected in the spring, the venue was booked when students returned to campus in the fall.
The conflicting date was brought to the respective organizations’ attention in November, by which point it was too late to make changes.
“We spoke to each other but at that point we realized it was too late. Everyone had already booked their [respective] venue[s],” GPB Spring Kickoff Committee Chair Tiara Kawser (MSB ’15) said.
The organizations initially attempted to work together to seek alternatives, including arranging transportation for the students to shuttle back and forth between events if they were interested, but in the end, the funding from both ends proved inadequate to cover such expenditures.
“We talked to Tiara and we thought about taking GUTS buses and asking them to drive people from Dip Ball to the Spring Kickoff, but neither of us have the budget to do that,” Diplomatic Ball Committee Chair Victoire Carrasco (SFS ’15) said.
Kawser admitted that more could have been done to ensure that the events would be held on separate evenings.
“I wish it didn’t have to be this way. It was kind of a miscommunication on both our ends, which is a lesson to learn for the upcoming years,” Kawser said.
Carrasco added that perhaps in the future, a master scheduling plan or more effective communication route would be best to ensure that each event could be accorded its own time frame.
“We’ve learned that it would be good for someone higher up to be coordinating these events,” Carrasco said.
While neither organization anticipates majorly depressed attendance levels, Kawser did express some concern.
“I think the event will still be successful because the concert is something that a lot of students look forward to, but it is unfortunate because Dip Ball is a huge event as well. It will definitely affect our numbers. I know people will definitely be torn,” Kawser said.
Dip Ball recognizes that ticket sales may be affected as well, but considering that the event has consistently sold out in recent years, Carrasco is not overwhelmingly concerned.
“We sell out every year. It may affect ticket sales, but it will affect both sides,”  Carrasco said.
Both organizations have remained upbeat in spite of the scheduling concerns. The upcoming artist reveal for the Spring Kickoff looks to capture students’ curiosity and interest in the event.
“I think that the artist will be highly anticipated. We will release it as soon as possible so students can get excited,” Kawser said.
Similarly, the ball leadership understands that although the events coincide, the array of students at Georgetown suggests that varying interests will lead students to both events.
“The good thing about Georgetown students is that everyone has very diverse interests, so I think both events are appealing to a large group of students. We are lucky in a way that these events come back every year, so if you don’t make it this year, you can always make it to the one next year,” Carrasco said.
Students seem to feel confident that both events will be successful as well.
“I plan on going to the Spring Kickoff Concert. It has nothing to do with ticket price, really. I just am more interested in the concert,” Courtney Lenny (NHS ’17) said. “[However], most of my friends are going to Dip Ball.”
If students feel torn between the events, and ticket prices are of no concern, it is possible to attend both events. The ball begins at 8 p.m., while the concert is expected to start over an hour later.
“There is a way around the conflict for students who want to go to both. If students want to do that, it can be done,” Carrasco said.

ALEXANDER BROWN/THE HOYASkillHack, the second annual problem-solving Hackathon, a problem solving initiative, took place Feb. 15 at the Fisher Colloquium, as part of the Designing the Future(s) of the University Initiative.
According to the event website, SkillHack, co-sponsored by the Office of the Provost and h.innovation, challenges student teams to “reimagine the boundaries between curriculum and the workplace and design a more connected platform for meaningful learning experiences.”
The event began at 8 a.m. with talks by Z. Michael Wang (MSB ’07), program manager for innovation and new media, and Provost Robert Groves about the purpose of the hackathon.
Teams had just over an hour to choose a focus area to hack and craft a pitch on the problems they wanted to address. The students, who were selected via application, worked to formulate ideas towards a common goal.
Helen Brosnan (SFS ‘16), director of strategic partnerships and outreach for h.innovation helped plan the event and believes the transformative goal of the event to be attainable.
“I think that was one of the positives of doing a pigeon-holed prompt was that you could create something that you know would be easily integrated in the next few months,” Brosnan said.
Although some may feel pressed to complete an open-ended project of this nature, many students felt minimal pressure throughout the process.
“I learned that I could be very productive under a time constraint. Creativity likes constraint, and I think that’s the best way to innovate and learn and produce something,” participant Josh Rivera (COL ’15) said.
Each team developed and created a video outlining its proposal to improve the university. Cash prizes will be awarded Feb. 24, and the winning team will receive $2000 and the runner-up will receive $1,000. The winners will be chosen by a judging panel, who will score the videos on usefulness, feasibility, originality, value and unique advantage and an “h.” factor, in addition to the number of YouTube likes.
“Hoya SkillTag,” currently ranked third, suggests attributing certain skills to student courses. In doing so, after taking a course professors and students would be able to add tags to their classes, which would then be searchable on MyAccess and Classy.
“The problem we had been hearing was that employers say there’s a lack of skills that Georgetown graduates have,” Hoya SkillTag member Rio Djiwandana (SFS ‘16) said. “But our group determined that the hard skills employers are looking for are being developed at Georgetown, they just aren’t being displayed correctly so we focused on redesigning the transcript not the curriculum.”
Those in attendance felt the event proved productive.
James Li (MSB ’14) and his team of students developed an idea they called the “Georgetown Experiential Learning Lab,” which called for classrooms designs to reflect real-life situations.
“If you’re a foreign affairs student you are suddenly in a situation room or if you’re studying business you’re in a boardroom,” Lee said. “Thirty minute real-world scenarios would be conducted in the specialized rooms so that students can learn in an ‘apprentice-style.’”
Ideas of other teams include a one-credit pass/fail class built to design the lack of money-managing and budgeting skills of underclassmen. This class would teach teach students the basics of programs like Quicken and Excel.
Overall, the Hackathon allowed students and faculty to collaborate to improve education from both viewpoints.
“I think it creates a dialogue that should be there to begin with. It’s just not just about educators, it’s about educators learning from students and us learning from educators, so I think it’s a symbiotic relationship. It’s mutual, and that’s the best way to go forward, learning from each other,” Rivera said.
Correction: The article erroneously described Z. Michael Wang as chief innovation officer. He is the program manager for innovation and new media. James Li’s name was originally published as James Lee.

Georgetown officially added the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan Policy to the Code of Student Conduct on Feb. 4, which protects anyone in need of medical attention because of the consumption of alcohol or drugs, and their caller.
The policy, added as Appendix E because of nuances and specific guidelines, stipulates that students seeking medical attention for an alcohol- or drug-related emergency for themselves or other individuals will not be subject to consequences of violating the alcohol or drug policies already included in the Code of Student Conduct.
“This keeps students from having to choose between getting themselves or their friends emergency medical care that they need versus worrying about getting themselves or their friends in trouble,” Judy Johnson, director of the Office of Student Conduct, said.
Students will still be liable for other violations of the code of conduct that do not pertain to alcohol- or drug-related polices. The policy also does not protect underage students who may be at the scene and are consuming alcohol or drugs, but who are not seeking medical help for themselves or others.
“It is not amnesty for the entire scene. It is amnesty for the situation at hand,” Student Advocacy Office co-Director Michelle Mohr (COL ’15) said. “If the [Department of Public Safety] arrives on scene and six students are holding beer cans, they can still be written up.”
Under the revised policy, the responding medical or law enforcement officials will first make sure that the individuals in danger receive appropriate medical attention before any infraction documentation takes place. A report of the incident and the surrounding social event will be given to the Office of Student Conduct, where officials will determine if the situation applies to the Medical Amnesty Policy. The policy changes also determine that the student that experienced the medical emergency will have a meeting with a community director to discuss the situation.
“Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Services is very excited and proud of the official addition of the Medical Amnesty Policy,” GERMS Director of Public Relations Kate McClellan (COL ’14) said. “We believe that such a policy will eliminate significant hesitations patients and their friends might have felt when deciding whether or not to seek emergency care from GERMS or D.C. Fire and EMS. This is a great step forward in improving access to emergency treatment, care and transport.”
Overall, the policy does not represent significant change, as Georgetown has honored medical amnesty in some form for many years.
“This policy is not much different from what the university has been doing in practice. This was all about putting things into writing. With GERMS, we have a good relationship with the student body and we are well respected,” GERMS Acting Crew Chief Brian Monahan (COL ’15), who advocated for the policy, said. “I think that students know that they can call us even if they are not sure [if they might get in trouble]. I hope it will convince people to call, but I don’t see there being a major change in call volume.”
According to Mohr, prior to its enactment, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and legal counsel reviewed the proposal to ensure compliance with the law, as with the new alcohol amnesty policy in cases of sexual assault.
“This type of policy is a national standard and a lot of schools have policies like this. As a leading institution, it is really important that Georgetown follows that. If that is our policy, it is important then that that is written,” Mohr said. “There is no reason for us to have a policy that was not written in our code. Especially if Georgetown is going to hold its students to a code of conduct, all policies need to be included.”
Mohr and Monahan both highlighted the importance of student body awareness of the official policy so that they are aware of their rights in a medical emergency.
“The hope is that once the students see the policy in writing, they will believe it and act on it,” Mohr said.
Monahan agreed that the policy change will result in positive student behavioral change in dangerous drug- and alcohol-related situations.
“As an EMT, I would rather have someone that I walk onto a scene to that is fine and that they refuse to go to the hospital than have someone who is not fine and that we have to take more drastic measures,” Monahan said.

Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies Director Angela Stent discussed the future of U.S.-Russian relations Wednesday, as covered in her new book, “The Limits of Partnership: U.S.-Russian Relations in the Twenty-First Century.” The talk, held in Copley Formal Lounge, was moderated by professor Charles King and attended by approximately 60 people, most of whom were graduate students or professionals.
Stent covered the numerous “resets” which have been a hallmark of U.S.-Russian relations in recent years. Stent said that there were resets in the relationship under presidents Bill Clinton (SFS ’68), George W. Bush and most recently Barack Obama. The most recent reset was decidedly more tempered and practically focused. However, she emphasized that even the Obama reset had its troubles. Stent read a selection from her book regarding a humorous story from 2009 in which a mock reset button was given to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with the word “reset” written in English on one side and in Russian on the other. However, due to a translation mistake, the Russian word did not read “reset,” but instead read “overload.”  Such humor was laced throughout the talk, drawing a number of chuckles from the crowd.
Obama’s U.S.-Russian relationship reset over the past few years has been largely successful, according to Stent. The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, agreements on Iran sanctions, cooperation on transportation to Afghanistan and Russia joining the World Trade Organization are evidence to the productivity of the two nations’ solid partnership.
Still, Stent cautions that the strategy inherent with a reset is also rife with weaknesses.
“That reset was largely driven by the personal ties between President Obama and then-President [Dmitry] Medvedev,” Stent said. “That relationship was built by two younger, post-Cold War men. Once Prime Minister Putin returned to the Kremlin, the relationship began to deteriorate.”
Additionally, Stent talked about the legacy of the post-Cold War experience in Russia. Americans and Russians experienced the 1990s in starkly different ways, as the American economy surged while the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving the nation with a lack of leadership and direction. A “legacy of mistrust” bred in the aftermath of World War II remains between the two countries even today, despite recent democratic advances in Russia.
A question and answer session followed the lecture, with questions ranging from the Russian perception of U.S. power to the current crises in Syria and the Ukraine, the rise of the Orthodox Church in Russia, the proposed Eurasian Union project and prospects for greater inclusion of Russia in the international system.
Attendees, both Russian and American, enjoyed the presentation.
“Over the past 20 years, hundreds and hundreds of books have been written on U.S.-Russia relations, but pretty much nothing in the past five years,” Sidar Global Advisors employee IgorDanchenko said. “One of the reasons is [that] everybody focuses on U.S.-Russia relations rather than Russia-U.S. relations.”
A Georgetown student in attendance voiced her takeaway from the discussion.
“I thought it was really interesting to not only hear Dr. Stent’s research about the U.S.-Russia relationship, but also to see the common threads that have carried throughout, and where they might be going,” Anjelika Deogirikar (GRD ’14) said.

DANIEL SMITH/THE HOYAOmika Jikaria (SFS ’14) is the only woman on a GUSA ticket.While over 54 percent of Georgetown students are female and less than half of the student body identifies itself as white, only one out of eight candidates running for Georgetown University Student Association executive office this year is female, and only two identify as members of minority ethnic groups.
The absence of diversity among the tickets drew criticism from some candidates and student groups, who allege that the electoral field does not accurately represent the student body.
Six of the candidates, Ben Weiss (COL ’15), Sam Greco (SFS ’15), Zach Singer (SFS ’15), Dan Silkman (COL ’15), Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) identify as white males, while Lloyd’s running mate, Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15), is a Latino male. Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15), the only female in the race, is of Indian descent. Both Ramirez and Jikaria are running for vice president.
Although Jikaria is often reminded of her status as the only female in the candidate field, she maintains that this fact is relatively unimportant compared to other campaign issues.
“It’s definitely something I’m aware of going into the race, and people always bring it up,” Jikaria said. “But I think that the conversation about the issues is much more important than how many girls are running.”
She noted, however, that the lack of female candidates in this year’s GUSA executive contest appears indicative of a larger trend in American political culture.
“I think it’s sad that there’s only one girl running. I think that there definitely is a dearth of women leaders in student government positions in general in America,” Jikaria said. “I don’t necessarily have a solution for that. I think that it’s just important for young girls to see other women running, and that will inspire them.”
Tezel, Jikaria’s running mate, expressed disappointment that GUSA leadership failed to adequately represent the diversity characteristic of the student body.
“I think it’s always important that we see GUSA races that actually represent the student body, and part of that is, both from a racial and ethnic as well as gender side, it is important that we continue to have a diverse group run for GUSA,” Tezel said. “If we’re not continually looking at how we’re engaging with all the faces of Georgetown, then that’s something we’ll start to lose in a body that’s supposed to be representative of the whole student body.”
Lloyd, the race’s only openly gay candidate and the president of GU Pride, expressed similar frustration and described the difficult choice many students face regarding the decision to participate in activism for particular groups or causes, rather than becoming involved in student government.
“GUSA has had problems with gender for a very long time, and race and sexual orientation,” Lloyd said. “I think at Georgetown, it’s very difficult to be involved in an affinity group or an advocacy group and be involved in GUSA. I’ve never been involved because I’ve dedicated a lot of my time to Pride, and that’s meant burning some bridges with some administrators, that’s meant engaging in those tough conversations that maybe I don’t want to do if I have to get elected.”
Though neither Weiss and Greco’s ticket nor Singer and Silkman’s ticket include any women or members of minority groups, both teams stressed a dedication to fostering diversity on campus.
“Unfortunately, two individuals can never possibly represent the entire campus community,” Weiss and Greco wrote in a statement. “It has been crucial for us to hear every perspective, speaking with students of all different backgrounds in order to develop a platform and strategy that will best serve the entirety of Georgetown.”
Weiss and Greco’s statement additionally stressed input they received from campus groups such as the Women’s Center, the Georgetown chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Sexual Assault Peer Educators program in the development of their platform. However, they maintained the lack of diversity on their ticket was not a disadvantage.
“We will not, however, reduce our staff and supporters to minority tokenism,” the statement said.
Singer and Silkman similarly noted that, while women and minority groups are not represented on their ticket, these groups nevertheless maintain a significant presence in their staff and supporters.
“One of the top reasons Dan and I are running is because we know how to break down barriers and bring people together,” Singer and Silkman wrote in a statement. “That spirit is reflected in our campaign team, a group of men and women of diverse backgrounds who bring a wealth of unique experiences to our campaign.”
Last year’s election featured two female candidates for GUSA executive office, Shavonnia Corbin Johnson (SFS ’14), who ran for president, and Maggie Cleary (COL ’14), who ran for vice president. While both of their teams ultimately lost to current executives Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), Cleary and running mate Jack Appelbuam (COL ’14) came in a close second.
“I’m disappointed to see that just one of the eight GUSA executive tickets this year has a female candidate,” Cleary said. “That being said, this is not particularly unusual within Georgetown or within our country as a whole.”
According to Cleary, women may be hesitant to run due to concerns about qualifications.
“The reason we don’t have more women on tickets is not because more women aren’t qualified, but instead because they don’t believe themselves to be qualified,” Cleary added.
In 2012, however, the winning ticket featured two women, Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13). During that election, five of the seven tickets included at least one female candidate, and two featured openly gay students.
Kohnert-Yount expressed a desire for an increasingly diverse field but stressed the necessity that all candidates seek to represent minority groups.
“I would of course love to see more female candidates, just as I would love to see more candidates with disabilities or transgender candidates or candidates who identify as working class or first-generation college students,” Kohnert-Yount said. “But I think less important than a candidate’s identity is their commitment to serve all the students of Georgetown across the spectrum of gender identity, sexual orientation, racial and ethnic identity, socioeconomic status, ability and so forth.”
Of this year’s batch of candidates, four have experience in the GUSA senate. Eleven of the 27 current GUSA senators are female.
Chandini Jha (COL ’16), a deputy chief of staff and a former senator, coordinated Elect Her, a conference to encourage women to run for student government office, in September, after Cleary ran an iteration last April.
Jha said she does not believe the GUSA executive is institutionally male dominated.
“I don’t think the issue is the institution, but rather the way the institution has been in the past, in the sense that a lot of people see GUSA as something that is kind of male-dominated, and especially looking at the hard numbers in the Senate, we’ve always struggled to increase women’s representation because they’re a very underrepresented community in the senate,” she said.
Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14), also a deputy chief of staff, said the absence of women on this year’s executive tickets reflects the candidates’ priorities.
“You have a case where you have all-male heads of the ticket, but you’re making policy choices when you select your VP,” Peterson said. “When you pick a man, obviously there are a variety of factors why VPs are chosen, but when you do reach out to a man, you show that reaching out to females and representing us as a group isn’t necessarily one of your top priorities.”
The problem may also lie in how GUSA is perceived.
“My freshman year, GUSA was described to me as an old boys’ club, and just those words made it seem like an institution that was almost difficult to get into to and that mentality really needs to change. In order to have a student association that’s really representative of your student body, you need to have more females involved,” GUSA Director of Student Advocacy Office Michelle Mohr (COL ’15) said.
The idea of GUSA as a “boys’ club” can also lead to speculation about the women who do participate.
“I think that mindset also leads to the thinking that women who are involved are more cutthroat or of a very aggressive nature, which is often a characteristic given to women who are in leadership roles, that somehow they’re more aggressive than the standard female, if there is such a thing,” GUSA Freshman Outreach Coordinator Makaiah Mohler (COL ’16) said.
Nonetheless, Mohr said she does not feel like a victim of prejudice on the basis of her gender.
“The current cabinet does have more males than females, but there is a great sense of respect within the cabinet. I haven’t felt slighted at all by the fact that I am a female, and I think it speaks very highly to the individuals who are in the cabinet,” Mohr said.
Ultimately, some candidates expressed frustration at being categorized based solely on their gender or other characteristics. Ramirez, running with Lloyd, noted that although his is an all-male ticket, it nevertheless represents many other forms of diversity.
“I’m frustrated that, because we’re both males, we’re typecast,” Ramirez said. “I’m proud to be part of a ticket that includes Thomas Lloyd, and I’m proud to have the vantage point that I have, but I’m not proud that there is one woman running in the race.”

Medical experts with firsthand experience treating civilians in Syrian refugee camps discussed the Syrian government’s denial of basic relief aid to those trapped in a country that has been engulfed in a bloody civil war for almost three years.
The event, hosted by the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, Center for Social Justice, The GU Medical Center and the Institute for the Study of International Migration on Tuesday in the ICC Auditorium, included a screening of the BBC Panorama film, “Saving Syria’s Children” and concluded with a question and answer panel with medical experts Dr. Annie Sparrow and Dr. Hisham Naji. .
After the fighting in Syria began in March of 2011 as an extension of the Arab Spring uprisings, over nine million people have been displaced. The violence between rebels and the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has caused a shift in national resources to the battlefield, and consequently, education and healthcare have suffered throughout the country over the past few years.
The bleeding bodies, infectious diseases and infant deaths of the Syrian rebellion, while far removed from Georgetown’s campus, were placed in the spotlight in the film: “Saving Syria’s Children,” which followed two British doctors around Syria as they checked in on hospitals and aided refugees.
The film contextualized “the greatest humanitarian disaster” the country has ever seen. While international aid organizations have attempted to send relief to those affected by the war, the government’s military regime has made it almost impossible to succeed in delivering aid and supplies.
“We [Doctors and aid workers] are all terrorists in Syria. We are all criminals for doing our jobs … As doctors, as aid workers, as paramedics, we depend upon the laws of war and humanitarian efforts in order to give aid … But Assad has actually turned all the laws of war upside down in order to control society,” Sparrow, the Deputy Director of the Human Rights Program at the Icahn School of Medicine and an assistant professor of global health, said.
Since the fighting began, the focus of the already scarce Syrian medical centers has been on treating wounded soldiers, not everyday medical issues. Civilian cases simply are not the priority near fighting areas. Consequently, a lack of vaccines distributed to children has resulted in a surge in polio.
“With taxes against doctor [visits], the structure of the healthcare system, combined with millions and millions of civilians forced to live in refugee camps that are overcrowded, unhygienic … the most appalling, unsanitary conditions, it’s no surprise that polio is back,” Sparrow said.
Naji, a Syrian anesthesiologist at the Syrian American Medical Society described the Syrian government’s practice of implementing taxes and forcing relief organizations to bribe officers of the student youth army in besieged areas based on his experience working in a Syrian war zone hospital.
“Any donation that goes to humanitarian aid to Syria has to go through the student government … All of this money is going to the efforts of the student regime … The people who need the help — well the student government is not going to give it to them,” Naji said.
Amnesty International and the Jesuit Refugee Service tabled outside of the event, and Vice President of Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. led prayers for a solution to the medical issues and larger social conflict these civilians are facing.
“People are dying from simple things because they are being denied the help they require,” Naji said. “The United Nations must come up with a strong resolution to force the student government to allow humanitarians to intervene.”

MADDY MOORE/THE HOYATuesday’s mayoral debate at the District Architecture Center explored aspects of planning, including design and housing. From left to right: Carlos Allen, Vincent Orange, Tommy Wells, Reta Jo Lewis and Michael Green.With Mayor Vincent Gray out of town, an unconventional cast of mayoral candidates took to the stage Tuesday evening to explore the future of planning in Washington, D.C., in a debate held at the District Architecture Center in downtown D.C.
Sponsored by the Washington Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, the Potomac Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects and the National Capital Area Chapter of the American Planning Association, affordable housing and architectural design were on the table at the event, moderated by Douglas Fruehling, editor-in-chief of the Washington Business Journal.
The featured candidates included Councilman Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), Councilman Vincent Orange (D-At Large), former State Department official Reta Jo Lewis, write-in candidate Michael Green and the late addition of D.C. party promoter Carlos Allen.
Candidates addressed recent proposals to rewrite the District’s decade-old zoning laws including provisions allowing for accessory apartments and the construction of corner stores in areas zoned for residential use. Orange emphasized the importance of striking a proper balance if revisions were to be made.
“We need a reasonable, balanced approach without leaving anyone behind,” Orange said.
Lewis encouraged continued partnerships between District residents and the design community, saying that changes in zoning laws should parallel structures right outside of the District.
“Why aren’t we looking at communities right next door?” Lewis said.
Fruehling shifted the debate’s focus to family life and affordable housing in the District, and Wells spoke adamantly about his plans for adaptability in the city, proposing the creation of multi-use housing units that would be both affordable and adaptable for a diverse group of people.
“We need to move to infrastructure,” Wells said. “It can change depending on its use. So people don’t have to move because of their family size or income.”
Fellow candidates noted the importance of attracting and retaining families in D.C.
Orange brought up the Georgetown 2028 plan, a comprehensive strategy to make the Georgetown area more family friendly and accessible through new and improved modes of transportation. Green emphasized the importance of encouraging families to stay in the area, but he offered no concrete plans for doing so, while Lewis stressed the importance of having well-established education systems in each neighborhood.
Allen, who arrived late, agreed with Lewis on the value of education.
“We need to teach people to focus on how to depend on themselves instead of giving them handouts,” Allen said. “We need to make sure children are learning, graduating. If you aren’t making a living wage, you are in survival mode.”
Although the debate focused on the future of D.C. planning, candidates used the event as an opportunity to further criticize Gray’s current administration in his absence. Orange, a candidate with experience in economic development, spoke extensively about Gray’s failure to increase the minimum wage steadily every year.
“The minimum wage was raised to $11.50. … Gray didn’t increase the minimum wage annually as planned,” Orange said. “Are we really talking about giving people an opportunity to be here?”
On the subject of the proposed changes to the D.C. Height Act, however, all candidates united in opposition. The changes would lessen building restrictions instituted in the 1910 act, which limits building heights in the District to 130 feet. Wells criticized D.C. Planning Director Harriet Tregoning and her proposal that the building height restrictions should be loosened.
“[Tregoning] viewed it in a very linear, two-dimensional way,” Wells said. “We are redefining in a very complex way.”
Green offered no specific solutions for maximizing space in D.C. but repeatedly emphasized the importance of investing in residents. Allen opposed the height change proposal, referencing the changes in the housing economy in the city.
“I don’t want the height to change. The supply and demand of housing is always changing. We need to focus on that,” Allen said.
Mayoral candidates will square off again this Wednesday, Feb. 26th at a debate hosted by American University.

Virginia made waves last Thursday when U.S. District Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen overturned the state’s 2006 ban on same-sex marriage, making Virginia the first southern state to take such a strong pro-gay marriage stance.
Associate Dean for Graduate Programs and law professor Nan Hunter credited the same-sex marriage movement’s rising momentum to endorsements by high-profile figures like President Obama, younger generations’ support of marriage equality and a general shift in public opinion.
“In the more conservative states like Virginia, the public opinion had to reach a certain point before it was viable to bring a court challenge there…Judges may see a constitutional violation but hesitate to declare a law unconstitutional if they fear that the backlash to that ruling would ultimately do more harm than good,” Hunter said.
The Associated Press reported that Wright Allen stayed the ruling in light of the anticipated appeal to the Fourth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals; same-sex marriages cannot take place in Virginia until the Fourth Circuit upholds her decision. If Wright Allen’s ruling is upheld at the appeal level, it will apply to all states in the circuit — including North Carolina, South Carolina and West Virginia.
According to Georgetown Law Professor and Constitutional Law Specialist David Cole, one potential problem with the appeal is that Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, who has opposed the ban since his election, has refused to defend the ban in the case of an appeal.
“I think there’s a question about whether the Virginia decision can be appealed to the Fourth Circuit. In the California case, the Proposition 8 case from last year, the Supreme Court ruled that where the attorney general representing the state refused to defend a state law banning same-sex marriage, there was no party that had standing to pursue the appeal,” Cole said.
Philip Tam (MSB ’14), treasurer of GU Pride and a native northern Virginian, hoped that Virginia’s ruling would encourage other southern states to recognize same-sex marriage.
“I remember even back when I was in high school I never would have imagined that something like this would even happen, in a state like Virginia. This might be sort of like the first domino in the effect that the rest of the south potentially can now recognize marital equality,” Tam said.
Mack Krebs (COL ’16), who hails from the southern city of Lynchburg, Va., said that demographics in Virginia are changing.
“It’s very exciting that it’s overturned, especially because it’s such a conservative state. It was very unexpected… I’m very happy with it, and I look forward to seeing what happens with it,” Krebs said.
With same-sex marriage legalized in nearby Maryland and D.C., Krebs did not foresee a change in movement of same-sex couples into Virginia.
“We already have Maryland and D.C. for gays who want to get married so I feel like they’d be there. And the political climate of northern Virginia is much more accepting than southern Virginia, so I don’t think it’ll change very much,” Krebs said.
Despite northern Virginia’s liberal tendencies, Hunter held that the dissolution of legal barriers that currently keep same-sex couples in D.C. and Maryland will promote the movement of same-sex couples into Virginia.
“Right now there’s a sense among gay people in the metropolitan area that you want to either live in D.C. or Maryland because Virginia’s just viewed as a pretty hostile jurisdiction, so I think that will change.”
Tam agreed, noting that the ruling could stymie support for a more tolerant atmosphere toward the LGBTQ community in the area — and at Georgetown.
“It sends a message to the Georgetown community and especially the LGBTQ community at Georgetown that the area that we’re living in, no matter if you’re going into D.C., if you’re going back to Maryland, Virginia, it’s a very friendly, very progressive place to be,” Tam said.
Tam hoped that the ruling’s publicity would encourage support for groups in the LGBTQ community that do not receive as much media attention.
“There’s a lot of other groups that don’t necessarily get the coverage, so, gender fluidity, just being queer … with so much momentum behind it right now, if this is something that can be done and hopefully recognized on a national level, this momentum can carry on to focus on other issues that equally deserve the attention but aren’t necessarily getting that,” Tam said.
Since the Virginia ruling was the first of its kind among southern states, Hunter surmised that the ruling could hold a strong precedent for other southern states to reconsider their own marriage laws.
“It is the first time that a marriage statute has been struck down in a southern state, but the momentum for challenging these marriage laws has gotten so fast that I think some marriage cases will be before the Supreme Court in the next term,” Hunter said.

The Georgetown Business Improvement District has begun experimenting with temporarily widening sidewalks along Wisconsin Avenue during some of Georgetown’s busiest shopping periods to alleviate congestion and promote a safer environment for pedestrians.
The Georgetown BID first piloted widened sidewalks during a French Market event held last April. During the market, parallel parking spaces along the 1600 block of Wisconsin Avenue were blocked off and barriers were erected to create a safer space for pedestrians to pass.
“We will be doing sidewalk widening for the second day of the Georgetown French Market on April 26 and possibly for a longer period that weekend, but are exploring options and physical barriers that would allow the BID to do more regular sidewalk widening, such as every weekend during the late spring-early autumn seasons when we have significant foot traffic every weekend,” Sherie Winston, the communications manager for Georgetown BID, said.
The BID hopes that widening the sidewalks will promote more pedestrian traffic and thus more business for stores near Wisconsin Avenue and M Street.
“The BID expects that more people on the sidewalks will translate into an increase in business for merchants. For example, in Times Square in NYC, they widened the sidewalks, sales went up, and commercial rents went up,” Winston said.
Despite the success at last year’s French Market, concerns regarding reduced parking spaces during times when the sidewalks are widened still persist. The BID has concentrated their efforts on providing large parking lots for some of the planned events, like the Georgetown French Market, as well as easily available and accessible information about parking options.
“It would be significantly more efficient if drivers just anticipated going into a parking lot or garage to begin with. It would save a lot of driver frustration and time. Much of the weekend gridlock is exacerbated by people slowly cruising for parking spaces. We still have to do more to make the experience of using a parking garage better, but we’d like a situation where the parking economics don’t encourage drivers to cause congestion, waste time and burn extra gasoline,” Winston said, noting that the widened sidewalks only remove 10 to 12 parking spaces in total.
The BID has also considered working with the university to rent out Georgetown’s parking lot over the weekend, a time when the shopping areas see heavier traffic than the university, according to Winston.
“The times when the University needs parking most are the times when the shopping district needs it least, and vice-versa. You can take a look on any weekend … and the parking lot at 37th and Prospect will be almost empty, while drivers are circling the very same blocks looking for a parking spot in the neighborhood. We continue to work with the university on this and many other transportation issues,” Winston said.
Retail stores on M Street and Wisconsin Avenue expressed their support for the implementation of sidewalk widening to reduce the overcrowding over the weekend.
“I think it’s a great idea,” Chantia Johnson, who works at Baked and Wired, said. “It’s so crowded, and it’s very busy on the weekends. We have this small patio set outside, and although it does narrow down the sidewalk, customers enjoy the space, and it’s a perfect scene to relax with coffee and cupcake on a nice day outdoors. If the sidewalks widen, we’d be able to continue setting up the outdoor patio, and pedestrians wouldn’t have any problem walking past it.”
Steve Madden employee Nikyia Johnson also voiced her support for the new campaign.
“Widening the sidewalks would lead to a smaller street with less parking, but I don’t think it would change the value of the customers here because people come to shop regardless. Georgetown is a tourist town; it’ll be a plus,” she said.
Gayoung Jeong (SFS ’16), however, said that she did not think the wider sidewalks would make a difference.
“I’ve never really felt that the sidewalks are narrow … it definitely gets crowded on the weekends. But then again, I don’t think widening the sidewalks would un-crowd the streets. It’s more likely that even more tourists would come enjoy the wider sidewalk,” Jeong said.

ALEXANDER BROWN/THE HOYADOH inspectors found live and dead mice in Dean and DeLuca.Live rodents and poor disposal of waste and sewage were among the critical health violations that caused the Georgetown location of Dean and DeLuca to close Wednesday.
The eatery was cited for six critical and eight non-critical health violations. According to Najma Roberts, communications director for the D.C. Department of Health, the gourmet grocery store was found to have “gross and unsanitary occurrences or conditions that may endanger public health, including but not limited to a heavy infestation of vermin.”
This is not the first time that the store, located at 3276 M St. NW, has been shuttered for critical health violations. In February 2013, the eatery was cited for the presence of rats and cockroaches, which was attributed to the presence of construction next door.
In light of the repeat violations, Dean and DeLuca was designated a Class 4 Risk on a scale of five on both the 2013 and 2014 reports.
“[This] means that it would become a higher-risk food establishment than perhaps a gas station or a restaurant that maybe has not been closed. So what that means for us is that they will get inspected more frequently than the standard once a year,” Roberts said.
Included among the six critical violations were a lack of separation of foods to prevent cross-contamination, a failure to maintain proper food storage temperatures and a lack of proper date marking on produce. While two of these violations, improper date marking and the maintenance of food at improper temperatures, were able to be corrected on site, the eatery remained closed until it was able to correct all critical violations Thursday afternoon.
Live and dead mice were also found upstairs in the food preparation area, as well as downstairs by the cheese display case.
The store received especially low marks for prevention of food contamination, after being found not in compliance for the categories “insects, rodents and animals not present,” “contamination prevented during food preparation storage and display,” “wiping clothes: properly used and stored” and “washing fruits and vegetables.”
The inspection also pointed to the lack of signage inside the storefront instructing employees to wash their hands and poor disposal of sewage and waste water.
Roberts said that the store would not open unless all health code violations had been corrected.
“Our goal is to assist in the corrective action and make sure that that establishment is safe and healthy,” she said.
Georgetown students expressed alarm at the health inspection results.
Annamarie White (MSB ’17) said that she was unlikely to continue to buy food there.
“That’s quite alarming, and I’m glad that I don’t buy cheese there. It’s such a well-regarded store that has such high values, that makes me think maybe I’ll just stick to Vittles,” White said.
After a recent encounter with uncleanliness at the eatery, Paola Peraza (SFS ’17) was not surprised by the violations.
“I went into Dean and DeLuca a couple of weeks ago to buy glass cups, and all of the ones on the shelves were dusty, chipped or covered in fingerprints. I bought a couple anyway but had to wash them multiple times before using them,” Peraza said.
Abigail Watson (COL ’17), however, was confident that the grocer would be able to address the violations accordingly.
“That’s disgusting, but I still love Dean and DeLuca. I figure if they close it down and clean it out, they’ll be good to go,” Watson said.
Dean and DeLuca did not respond to requests for comment.
