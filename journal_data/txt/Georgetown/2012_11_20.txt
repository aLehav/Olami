The Class of 2013 Fund recently hit 500 participants, marking the first time a class fund has hit the milestone so early in the year.
“We are extremely excited,” Jessica Douglass (MSB ’13), co-chair of the class fund board, said. “It speaks to the dedication and enthusiasm toward philanthropy that the entire class fund board and our class in general have.”
The board, led by co-chairs Douglass and Christina Dupre (SFS ’13), is composed of four chairs — events, marketing, stewardship and outreach.
Douglass attributed the board’s success to the various events held through the fall semester.
“In previous years, most boards have upped their efforts in the second part of the year, but we wanted to hit the ground running this fall,” Douglass said. “We’ve had a few events in September and October to get out the message about the class fund.”
Two events in particular were a cowboys-and-aliens-themed event at Old Glory Bar-B-Que during Senior Disorientation and a famous-couples-themed party at local bar George during Halloween.
“These events really got people getting excited about the fund,” Douglass said. “It really highlights the message that these seniors are giving back to Georgetown just as Georgetown has given back to them all four years.”
Dupre agreed, but she also pointed to the board’s teamwork.
“We’re a very cohesive group, and we have a very good marketing team,” Dupre said. “In addition, we’re a very diverse group, so we can reach out to our own networks and friends to get the word out.”
The 500 participants, which represents about 30 percent of the graduating class,, are encouraging for the board’s year-end goal, Douglass said.
“Our goal is 85 percent participation, and seeing how we’re at 30 percent already, we’re well on our way,” Douglass said.
Looking forward, the board has future events planned for the senior class, including a Nov. 20 event called “500 Reasons to Say Thanks.”
“As people leave for Thanksgiving, we’ll be giving out hot chocolate and some snacks,” Dupre said. “We’ll have a huge wall and post-its, and people will be able to write down reasons they are thankful to Georgetown. It’ll be a huge collage.”
The statements will also be released through social media.
Douglass encouraged seniors to donate to the class fund, which will support the Campaign for Georgetown and its 1789 Scholarship Imperative, which funds undergraduate scholarships.
Dupre agreed, saying that raising awareness about the importance of donations is the board’s main goal.
“We want to make people understand that while Georgetown has money and tuition is very high, scholarships really come from donations,” Dupre said. “People don’t always know that, but we want to stress that the money that people donate goes towards scholarships and rebuilding the school. The money is going to legitimate causes, and Georgetown doesn’t have infinite money.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate unanimously passed a resolution to extend hours of GOCard access to campus buildings Sunday night.
The resolution stated that limiting access to academic buildings and dormitories after certain hours impedes the goal outlined in the 2010 Campus Plan of bringing undergraduate social life back to campus.
Currently, students can swipe into any dorm with their GOCards during the day. After 10 p.m., students who are not residents of that dorm must be signed in. This limitation also applies to academic buildings; only students of the McDonough School of Business have access to the Rafik B.Hariri Building after 10 p.m. and only science majors may swipe into Regents Hall after that time.
The resolution calls for campus-wide GOCard swipe-in access from 10 p.m. to midnight and urges 24-hour GOCard access throughout the Southwest Quad complex for residents of its three buildings. It also urges the university to eliminate restrictions to academic buildings for unspecialized students.
GUSA Senator Nolan DiConti (COL ’15), co-sponsor of the resolution, said that mandatory sign-in for Southwest Quad residents is inconvenient and redundant.
“The Southwest Quad is a unique structure because basically, it is connected with three dormitories, so what happens is if we’re studying [in one of the other SWQ dorms] and I decide I want to grab some food or check out a book at Lau — I have to be signed back in,” DiConti said.
Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), GUSA speaker and co-sponsor of the resolution, expressed concern that mandatory sign-in after 10 p.m. makes it difficult for students to socialize in accordance with university rules.
“Especially in a situation when you’re hosting a large event, [say] in an apartment, it’s very difficult for the host to leave to sign someone in and run back up to the party because the host is supposed to be in the residence for the duration of the party,” Tisa said.
Tisa added that the sign-in time has made socializing on campus inconvenient for students.
“Ten o’clock is not late by college standards. … We are trying to convince Residence Life that the difference between 10 p.m. and 12 a.m. does not affect safety. This is why students go off campus. They do not want the bother of having to sign in,” Tisa said.
GUSA Vice Speaker Zach Singer (SFS ’15) proposed an amendment to the resolution that would have advocated for extending GOCard access to 2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights.
However, several senators expressed concern that an extension to 2 a.m. would be too much to ask for, and the amendment did not pass.
“I think in terms of pragmatic reality, what can we accomplish? How best can we accomplish that? I think the more conservative number is going to be more effective to make the administration think we’re serious, we’re being thoughtful [and] we’re taking the administration’s perspective into account,”Tisa said.
GUSA Senator Vetone Ivezaj (COL ’13), who is a residential assistant, said it would be hard for RAs to enforce rules.
“From an RA’s perspective, it’s harder for us to enforce policy with students who don’t live in the dormitory,” Ivezaj said.
GUSA Senator Ben Weiss (COL ’15) said that students should have the right to visit dormitories of their fellow students, regardless of the hour of night.
“Our job is to voice for what is in the best interest for students at Georgetown. I think it is their best interest to give them the leniency to get into their friends’ dorms at 2 o’clock in the morning or, in my opinion, whenever they please. I think that 2 o’clock is reasonable to at least start the discussion,” Weiss said.
The resolution also authorized the GUSA Student Life Committee to poll campus residential communities for student input on these potential policy changes.

Approximately 1,300 students have voted for the spring concert’s headline artist since the Georgetown Program Board launched an online poll Thursday night.
Voters could rank five electronic dance music artists — Afrojack, Alesso, Axwell, Bassnectar and Steve Aoki — and the winner of the poll will likely be the headliner at the spring concert tentatively scheduled for April 5 in McDonough Arena. Wiz Khalifa headlined the concert last year.
“I think it’s going to be great for us to have electronic artists this year. I think that’s really where music is going. These are the people that are headlining the big festivals and selling out the biggest arenas right now,” GPB Concerts Chair William Henderson (MSB ’14) said. “We’ve done hip-hop or pop acts for the past four to five years at least, so we thought it would be nice to bring an electronic artist.”
The GPB does not poll students every year. In past years, polls have been ineffective when the artist chosen by students was unable to perform, according to Henderson.
“This year, we had the opportunity where whoever won that poll was definitely going to be brought in, so I thought it was worth it to get the students involved,” he said.
Henderson said he hopes to announce the artist in the next few weeks.
Tickets are subsidized and will cost less than $20 for students. The concert usually costs more than $100,000, less than half of which is covered by ticket sales. The rest of the concert is paid for by GPBand other cosponsors, according to Henderson. Last year, the Senior Class Committee and What’s After Dark cosponsored.
The spring concert’s ticket price will not be announced until all contracts are finalized.
“[Ticket price] will, of course, depend on the cost of the concert, which includes artists, staging and lighting,” GPB Chair Tyler Simpson (COL ’13) said. “The tickets do not cover all the costs, so the tickets are actually subsidized. It’s just kind of looking at expected revenue and then costs. Money can be made from contributors’ looking at what we can charge students, but we do try to keep that costlow.”
