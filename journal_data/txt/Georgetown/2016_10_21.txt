The Georgetown University Student Association senate may be replaced next year with a new GUSA assembly — a body consisting of elected students and appointed club advisory board members to appropriate club funding — pending a senate vote and studentwide referendum this fall.
The proposed assembly will consist of both representatives, students who are elected by peers in their class, and delegates, voting members appointed by each of the six advisory boards to represent them in budgetary discussions. This structure will include advisory boards in the negotiations process.
Student representatives will work with a delegate from a club advisory board to advocate for its allocation of the student activities budget. Currently, the senate’s Finance and Appropriations Committee — known as Fin/App — hears presentations from advisory boards, the Georgetown Program Board and the Lecture Fund before submitting a budget to the senate for approval.
Representatives will be entitled to vote on legislation — including resolutions and potential referendums — and budgets, while delegates will only vote on budgetary issues.
The move marks the most significant change to the elected body since GUSA established the senate in 2006.
GUSA is currently meeting with advisory boards to finalize the new structure for the senate before the proposal is formally released in an Oct. 30 senate meeting. The senate is slated to vote on the proposal Nov. 6. If approved, a referendum to replace the senate with the assembly at the beginning of the 2016-17 academic year will take place Dec. 1.
The new assembly is intended to create a more democratic funding process for clubs, according to GUSA Senate Speaker Richie Mullaney (COL ’18).
“The Council of Advisory Boards has consistently said that they want more of a say in the funding process because they’re experts. Fin/App has said that they want more of a say in the funding process because they’re democratically elected and accountable to the students,” Mullaney said. “I believe both are right, and that’s why in the plan we combine CAB and Fin/App into a new body called the assembly to make club funding more transparent and accountable.”
Last year’s budget appropriated $998,202 for advisory boards, including $235,000 for the Student Activities Commission, $185,000 for the Advisory Board on Club Sports and $95,000 for the Media Board.
The Georgetown Program Board, which received $94,000 last year and the Lecture Fund, which received $74,702 last year, are not part of an advisory board and advocate individually for funding.
GUSA President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said the structure of the new assembly involves clubs in the funding process.
“It’s been an ongoing topic from even before I was in the senate, of clubs feeling frustrated like they didn’t know what the process was, or how to be engaged in it, who to reach out to, who’s making these decisions,” Khan said.
The new structure reflects the senate’s original purpose of allocating the student activities fee, according to Khan. The establishment of the senate in 2006 shifted from elections for at-large seats to districts based on residence halls.
“Now that we have this new form and structure, the main emphasis — or the real authority — that the senate has right now is Fin/App,” Khan said. “I think we all recognize that the really big distinguisher for the senate is that it allocates around a million dollars per year.”
Khan said having a new assembly structured around advisory boards is the best way to represent all clubs.
“This essentially gives everyone a seat at the table. So the budget summit isn’t the only place that Fin/App and the Advisory Boards connect, but rather it’s a continuous process and there’s engagement throughout,” Khan said.
Council of Advisory Boards Chair Janhvi Bhojwani (SFS ’18) said the new structure will be more inclusive of clubs.
“I believe this new structure is a good way for all of us to work together to improve student life on campus,” Bhojwani wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It allows for advisory boards to have a voice in the process, and overall I think it’s a very inclusive structure that gives everyone representation, which is an important component I feel is lacking currently.”
GUSA Senator Ben Baldwin (SFS ’19), who currently sits on Fin/App, said the new assembly will help make funding more transparent.
“I think it’s going to be a great way to reform the way funding is done at Georgetown,” Baldwin said. “I fundamentally think that it is going to be a better plan in terms of both transparency and engaging all the correct parties in developing an amenable funding plan for the university.”
The new budget-focused assembly will shift more responsibility over policy to the executive branch. GUSA restructured the executive branch last spring, creating 19 policy teams around issue areas with a co-chair in the executive branch and a co-chair in the senate.
Mullaney said the new structure will help GUSA operate more effectively.
“Right now, our student government is modeled after the United States. I think that model is great for America, but not necessarily a student government,” Mullaney said. “I don’t think it makes much sense for a student government to check its own power.”
The current policy teams will be able to grow in size to accommodate senate members who choose to transition to the executive to work on policy, according to Mullaney.
GUSA Vice President Chris Fisk (COL ’17) said the changes are part of a broader effort to make GUSA more inclusive.
“These restructuring efforts are a continuation of the changes we made last year to make GUSA a more open, transparent, and inclusive organization,” Fisk wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While they’re still a work in progress, these changes will undoubtedly make the funding process more transparent and bring into the fold the real experts on where student activities money should go: advisory boards and student groups.”

Those durn pesky voters keep electing the wrong people, so it’s time to do away with them completely in order to make more positions for friends of the  current administration.

Making the funding process for student clubs more democratic is a wonderful change. Best of luck to the GUSA Senate.

Leaders of Georgetown’s largest student groups will undergo required bystander intervention training as part of the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Task Force’s goal of improving bystander education to prevent sexual assault on campus.
The first training session, coordinated by Health Education Services, will take place this Sunday, with four additional sessions to come in the following weeks. Student leaders are required to sign up for one session to train at least three members of their organization’s leadership.
The task force’s Bystander Intervention and Education Committee, convened by the Office of the President in June after the release of Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey, is working to improve bystander training on campus after the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey’s report released June 16 showed that 77 percent of students have witnessed high-risk situations said they did not intervene when they witnessed a potential incident of sexual misconduct, of which 24 percent said they did know what to do.
The committee plans to work with both recognized and unrecognized student organizations, including Students of Georgetown, Inc., the Georgetown University Alumni Student Federal Credit Union, the Blue and Gray Tour Guide Society and other student organizations with widespread leadership, but has not solidified a specific list of organizations to date, according to Zac Schroepfer (MSB ’19), the student co-chair for the bystander intervention and education committee.
Health Education Services will adapt the session from a curriculum from the University of New Hampshire. The program will educate students on sexual assault issues on college campuses as well as how to identify and respond to high-risk situations.
The training will use case studies, role play and discussions to train student leaders for effective bystander intervention.
Assistant Dean for Student Engagement Erika Cohen Derr, who reached out to student groups to sign up for the mandatory training, said improving bystander education through student organizations is important because of their unique role in providing an outlet for social life at Georgetown.
“I think that student organizations provide a foundation for social life for many students, and so I’m really encouraged at the responsible and forward-thinking approach to addressing sexual assault on campus,” Cohen Derr said. “All student organizations, every individual who goes through it, will benefit and share that back to their group. That’s the goal and the objective. If they’re providing a context for social life, then I think this will be valuable to them.”
Schroepfer said training student organizations in bystander intervention can facilitate safer social environments on campus.
“Georgetown’s culture is different from a lot of other colleges in the fact that our social culture focuses a lot on clubs. Many parties occur because of the clubs and people who typically hang out together are typically parts of the same clubs,” Schroepfer said. “So we decided that if this is true and we can train student leaders, we can have more active bystanders in each social environment and help to protect the community in that way.”
According to Schroepfer, student leaders should prove instrumental in setting an appropriate example for other members of their organization.
“People do look up to club leaders as role models, so the idea is if your student leaders are being active bystanders and are stepping into certain situations which they see as potentially dangerous, that more students are going to be motivated to learn how to be an active bystander and to make that culture change,” Schroepfer said.
Director of Health Education Services Carol Day said Health Education Services is dedicated to spreading awareness and promoting a shift in student behavior in high-risk situations.
“We hope to increase awareness about sexual assault and resources, of course. Specifically, we hope to increase bystander intervention for the next time we do the campus climate survey,” Day said. “We hope we will be able to influence students to think more about sexual assault, and we expect we will be able to work on some culture change and shift in how students behave in high-risk situations.”
Schroepfer, the student head for the project, said the committee’s goal is to instill long-lasting change in the student body’s mindset toward sexual assault.
“We’re really trying to show that there’s a culture shift and show here on campus that people actually do care about this issue. If you ask anybody on campus, people know that sexual assault is an issue on campus and they want to know how they can become a part of the movement to solve the issue,” Schroepfer said.
Schroepfer also said the task force was discussing potential future projects, including mandated bystander intervention training for all incoming freshmen.
“The hope is moving forward to eventually be able to implement this for all students, whether that’s trying a step process where we implement it for all the freshmen or we implement it for all students in general,” Schroepfer said. “We’re first doing the student leaders to see how it works, what kind of feedback we get from the program and then from there we’ll move to adopt it for all students.”

The Bystander intervention training is 5 hours long midday on a Sunday, which is poorly timed for club leaders who have other commitments or busy schedules. Also, 5 hours of training is more time than the university spends with leaders during the blueprint training.

SFS 2016 says 
October 22, 2016 at 8:57 pm
My guess is leaders don’t need the training.  This will have the same effect of TSA scanning little babies for bombs in their diapers.  Everyone knows rape is wrong.  Everyone knows if someone is being attacked you should step in.  The people who need training are the girls who are going to get drunk and go home and consent to sex with a guy and then in the next day or two decide she was raped because she had a few beers and now regrets it so is calling it sexual assault.

Fr. Arturo Sosa, S.J., a former visiting researcher at Georgetown’s Center for Latin American Studies, was elected the 31st superior general of the Society of Jesus and the first non-European superior general in an Oct. 14 vote with the Jesuits’ main governing body in Rome.
Sosa worked at Georgetown between March and July of 2004, during which time he organized seminars and conferences, focusing on Latin American politics. As superior general, he will be responsible for leading the Jesuits, one of the largest and oldest orders of the Catholic Church, which counts Pope Francis among its 16,000 members.
In addition to his previous work at Georgetown, Sosa, who was inducted into the Society of Jesus in 1966 and holds a doctorate in political science from the Central University of Venezuela, serves as a founding board member at the Andrés Bello Catholic University in Caracas and a rector of the Catholic University of Táchira. He also acted as provincial superior of the Society of Jesus in Venezuela from 1996 to 2004.
A vote by 212 Jesuit representatives at the Roman General Congregation elected Venezuelan native Sosa following the resignation of Adolfo Nicolás last week.
Georgetown Center for Latin American Studies Director Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., said he was pleased with the results of the election and that Sosa would bring a level of social awareness and forward thinking to his role, similar to what Pope Francis has done.
“It’s a tremendously exciting time for us as Jesuits because having a new general is always exciting,” Carnes said. “You have someone new who’s going to bring new energy, but in this particular case, he brings a vision that is very similar to that of Pope Francis.”
According to the General Congregation’s website, 27 percent, the majority of representatives, still come from Europe; however, 21 percent, the second largest group, come from South Asia. The smallest percentage of the delegation is from Africa at 10 percent.
Carnes noted the Jesuits, originally a European order, have greatly expanded their ranks in non-European countries.
“The idea that leadership can be in the hands of any Jesuit really speaks to the way that we’re a global organization and the kind of trust we have in one another,” Carnes said. “We’re looking for the best candidate.”
Fr. Sean Michaelson, S.J., the executive secretary and treasurer of the Jesuit Conference, an organization representing Jesuits in Canada and the United States, said the General Congregation would advise on how best to proceed with his platform based on reconciliation and bringing people together.
“The General Congregation is the highest governing body in the society,” Michaelson said. “So, when the General Congregation is in place, it can make a lot of decisions about the future of the society and what should be emphasized and what should be focused on.”
Center for Latin American Studies Academic Director Angelo Rivero-Santos worked with Sosa while he taught at Georgetown in 2004 and spoke highly of Sosa’s ability to promote and moderate reasonable discussion.
“We have firsthand experience with him,” Santos said. “He has been doing this for years and I think a voice of reason that is respected and able to bring some rationality to the political discourse is essential.”
Santos recalled that when Georgetown wanted to host a conference in 2004 on the state of Venezuelan politics two years after a failed coup attempt against Hugo Chavez, Sosa convinced many participants to speak despite having their political opponents in the same room.
“We organized a conference to speak about what was going on in Venezuela at the time, and he played a crucial role,” Santos said. “We faced some difficult times in getting some of our guests to accept being with each other.”
Santos said although Sosa was qualified for his new position due to all of his experience as part of the Catholic Church and Society of Jesus, Sosa would be successful mostly because of his character.
“I think it’s important to note that besides being a great academic, being a Jesuit, having all the moral authority, people should know he’s a great man, he’s a good man,” Santos said. “He’s jovial and he connects with people beyond his faith.”
Carnes said he has extended Sosa an open invitation to return to Georgetown.
“I still have a couple emails from him,” Carnes said. “I actually sent an email to him telling him that if he ever wants to come back, we’d be happy to have him come and give a talk or be part of the center again.”

The Washington, D.C. Council unanimously approved a first vote of the Comprehensive Youth Adjustment Act of 2016 on Oct. 11, which would institute reforms to D.C.’s criminal justice system for juveniles in detention centers, most of which focus on separating how the criminal justice system treats juvenile and adult criminal offenders.
Councilmembers Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5), David Grosso (I-At large), Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Anita Bonds (D-At Large), LaRuby May (D-Ward 8), Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) originally introduced the bill in April. The purpose of the legislation is to prohibit jailing juveniles before a hearing, limit solitary confinement, exempt juveniles who commit minor offenses from imprisonment and avoid placing offenders under the age of 18 into adult prisons.
The District’s bill, which has garnered the support of 28 local and national advocacy organizations, reflects President Barack Obama’s executive order to ban solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons.
Having passed the D.C. Council’s first vote, the bill will be up for second vote before it is officially passed.
McDuffie stressed the detrimental effect of the criminal justice system on juveniles as a reason for introducing this legislation. According to McDuffie, after being convicted of a crime as a juvenile, past offenders struggle to successfully reintegrate into society and often commit crimes again.
“We know that, when a young man or woman comes into contact with the justice system, it is often a pivotal moment in their lives,” McDuffie wrote in a press release. “What happens next often sets the trajectory for the rest of their lives — and ultimately determines whether they will eventually be contributing members of our community.”
According to the Department of Youth Services, 10 percent of newly incarcerated youth in the fiscal year 2015 were still in jail. Of those who were released, nearly 30 percent were placed under home arrest and about another 30 percent went to residential treatment facilities.
The bill, which will cost around $6.7 million to implement over the span of the next four years, aims to improve the conditions of confinement, invest in data collection and protect at-risk minors in the District community. McDuffie’s spokesman, Nolan Treadway, said the councilmember hopes the bill will combat recidivism, which is a relapse into criminal behavior following incarceration.
“Hopefully, we’re seeing more reasonable treatment of juveniles that are in the system and also not so much focus on punishment and retribution but on rehabilitation, not recidivism,” Treadway said in an interview with The Hoya.
A large focus of the bill is separating how juvenile and adult offenders are treated by the criminal justice system. Paul Rothstein, a professor of law on civil procedure and trial practice at the Georgetown University Law Center, said more money should be spent on special facilities, counseling and court procedures for juveniles.
“There is too much of a punitive attitude toward children as though they are on par with adult offenders. I think that the more humanely you treat juveniles, the better chances you have at rehabilitating them and preventing them from seeking further into a life of crime,” Rothstein said. “These provisions will move the District of Columbia even further forward on the front of improving a lot of juvenile facilities.”
Government and law department professor Marc Howard is also the director of the Georgetown Prison and Justice Initiative, which was founded last year to examine mass incarceration in the United States from a variety of viewpoints. Howard said the American penal system remains plagued by issues of mandatory minimums, parole procedures, re-entry into society after prison and public assistance.
“I got involved about a decade ago when my friend had been wrongfully convicted of double murder. The further involved I got, the more I realized that his case, as crazy as it was, wasn’t that exceptional,” Howard said. “It’s been a long journey to the underbelly of the American criminal justice system and realizing that much of it is deeply flawed and in desperate need of reform.”
Julia Kerbs (COL ’17), president of the Georgetown initiative Prison Outreach, which teaches classes and is involved with one-on-one tutoring with inmates at the Alexandria and Arlington detention facilities, said the organization may be involved with assisting recovering juveniles in the future.
“I’m really excited to see that there’s more of a humanizing effort,” Kerbs said. “These people are kids, the people you babysit, the people you tutor. These are the people that you live across the street from.”
Kerbs noted that the bill’s focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment was a good first step.
“When rehabilitation is emphasized, the recidivism rate’s lower. We see more productive relations within communities for returning citizens and we see a lower likelihood of violent crime and drug crime,” Kerbs said. “I think it’s absolutely crucial for people behind bars, for their families and for every American.”

Public policy experts and veterans of the 2016 presidential primary campaigns characterized the newest generation of voters as the most coveted and elusive demographic in the presidential election cycle during a panel discussion held Monday in the Rafik B. Hariri Building.
The event, titled “The Millennial Mindset: Millennials, the Economy, and What it Means for 2016,” was co-hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, the Economic Innovation Group and professional service firm Ernst & Young.
The conversation centered on the findings of “The Millennial Economy,” a survey conducted by EIG and EY, which paints a complex picture of millenials’ desires and their vision of the future, finding the majority of millennials have a pessimistic view of the economy.
Tim Miller, who was communications director of former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s campaign, which has an increasingly aging voting base, must seek a transformational candidate who can appeal to millennial and minority voters in future elections.
“The biggest problem is that you go to a Republican Party event, and it’s all old white dudes,” Miller said. “What the party needs is a ‘millennial Trump,’ a candidate that can run in 2020 or 2024 that can appeal to minorities.”
Moderated by Michelle Jaconi (SFS ’96, GRD ’97), senior advisor to the Independent Journal Review and former producer of “Meet the Press,” the panel discussion covered a wide range of issues including partisanship, patriotism, college tuition and tax rates.
EIG Executive Director and School of Foreign Service adjunct assistant professor Steve Glickman (COL ’02) noted 80 percent of millennials in the 21st century fear they will not be able to obtain jobs that pay as well as their parents’ jobs. Glickman said while the viewpoint is pessimistic, he acknowledges the rationale behind it.
“Millennials are the most educated, yet most indebted, generation in U.S. history,” Glickman said. “Millennials don’t feel like they’re in a position to take risks.”
As the conversation turned to the role played by millennials in the 2016 presidential election, Miller offered insights into how the political parties should aim to reach out to millenials. Miller praised former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ efforts to reach out to young voters as a platform for future presidential candidates to use.
“What they need is a government that is more responsive to them,” Miller said. “A lot of these young voters liked what Bernie Sanders was doing because he demonstrated that he cared about them. He listened to them.”
Symone Sanders, previously the national press secretary for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, attributed millennials’ reluctance with identifying along party lines to the lack of an existing party addressing issues important to them.
“Forty-six percent of millennials across the board identify as independents. That is an opportunity across the board for both parties,” Symone Sanders said. “Fundamentally, they do not believe that this system is dedicated to the betterment of their lives.”
EY Tax Policy Leader and GU Politics Advisory Board Member Cathy Koch (GRD ’94) encouraged millennials to pursue a career in public service.
“It’s one of the fastest ways to accelerate your career,” Koch said. “There is room above you that you won’t find in corporate America.”
Glickman said millennials might find work with local comunities rather than the federal government to be more rewarding.
“There is something very entrepreneurial about what’s happening at the local level. I would say go home, find partners in the private sector and start turning those communities around,” Glockman said.
Sanders praised the findings of the EY and EIG report and stressed the continued importance of reaching out to this generation and involving them in policymaking as well as government decisions beyond the 2016 race.
“I think the research is very rich. It tells the true story about millennials in this election and what millennials across the board are thinking,” Sanders said. “Regardless of the outcome, the political establishment are going to have to grapple with the role that young people are going to play.”
GU Politics Director of Programming Sophie Goldmacher said the discussion skillfully addressed the need to discuss the views of the millennial voting group.
“I think something that has been lost in the political conversation up until now is some of the actual issues that matter to voters,” she said.
Max Magid (COL ’19) said the discussion focused largely on the theme of entrepreneurship while neglecting trustworthiness, a component important to millennials that would explain the tepid support for Hillary Clinton.
“That’s why millennials didn’t seem to back Hillary Clinton, and I feel like that’s something that they sort of passed over,” Magid said. “I think people are finally starting to pay the right amount of attention to millennials.”

Eight members of the workers’ advocacy group Georgetown Solidarity Committee were removed from the Georgetown University Law Center by Georgetown Law Department of Public Safety officers Oct. 14 during a demonstration in support of Georgetown facilities workers, who are continuing labor contract negotiations with university administrators.
Facilities workers, their union representatives from Service Employees International Union Local 1199 and university human resources representatives have been negotiating terms for a new labor contract since early September.
The union must either accept the university’s current offer, call a strike or further extend the duration of the current contract by Oct. 30 to continue negotiations.
Facilities workers aim to gain a 6 percent annual wage increase and parity with Georgetown University MedStar Hospital workers with regard to parking and health care costs.
GSC is also demanding better translation services for workers, an end to understaffing and protections against alleged workplace intimidation practices, in addition to the 6 percent annual wage increase.
The university proposes that facilities workers accept a 2 percent annual wage increase along with a 6 percent health care cost increase. Currently, facilities workers have to pay $140 a month for parking and as $15 for regular healthcare visits.
The meeting between the university and the workers’ union was originally set to take place Oct. 4 at McShain Lounge, but the date was changed to Oct. 14 and the location shifted to the Eric E. Hotung International Law Building at the Law Center.
GSC members were met by Georgetown Law DPS officers, who prevented them from entering the building while trying to deliver a petition signed by around 950 students, faculty and community members demanding better working conditions to negotiators.
GSC Member Mizraim Belman (SFS ’20) said the officers were waiting for the students when they arrived.
“As we were trying to enter the building where negotiations were taking place, police officers were at the door and they stopped us, asking us what we were planning on doing, and prevented us from entering the building,” Belman said. “They definitely knew that we were coming.”
Belman said two members of the university’s human resources department, Director Roberta Paul and Vice President for Human Resources Brenda Malone — both on the university’s negotiating team — met them outside the building to accept the petition. However, members of GSC insisted on delivering the petition to the entire negotiating group.
According to Belman, the GSC members snuck into the building and chanted outside the negotiation meeting room. They were subsequently removed by DPS officers.
Belman said GSC will be delivering a petition to the office of University President John J. DeGioia on Oct. 24.
Belman said the university changed the location of the meeting to thwart students’ attempts to show support for facilities workers.
“Usually all negotiations have been taking place here on the main campus,” Belman said. “We do see this as possibly a reaction to our rally that we wanted to have in support of the workers.”
The new contract, when ratified, will apply until 2019. Along with university representatives, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, an independent agency that promotes labor-management cooperation, has been helping with negotiations.
The current contract under which facilities and maintenance workers are working was finalized in July 2013 and was set to expire June 30. Due to the ongoing negotiations between the university and the union, however, the contract has been extended to expire Oct. 30.
GSC member Esmeralda Huerta (SFS ’17) said that if the new contract were to be finalized in its current state, workers would essentially end up worse off than they were before contract negotiations.
“The university is absolutely not willing to give more than 2 percent. Because health care costs are increasing by 6 percent and because parking has increased as well, that means workers are going to be worse off than before if the university gives them 2 percent,” Huerta said. “This is their wage over the next three years. It really matters.”
A facilities worker who has been employed at the university for over a decade said under the current facilities manager, incidents of workplace discrimination have been prevalent.
The worker, who requested anonymity out of fear of retribution, said employees of the same nationality as the current manager, who is from Jamaica, are provided with additional break time and preferential treatment for overtime.
“I want there to be equality,” the worker said. “I want us to be treated fairly regardless of race, regardless of nationality.”
The worker expressed concern over the firing of Maria Ochoa, an administrative organizer with SEIU Local 1199 who had been representing the workers in negotiations. Ochoa was perceived to have worked cooperatively with workers, providing interpretation for Spanish-speaking workers.
“There’s a lot of concern over what happened with Maria,” the worker said. “We’re worried that the union might accept whatever contract the university gives them, which so far hasn’t been a good one.”
Associate Vice President for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the university has shown a commitment to negotiating fair agreements with the SEIU Local 1199.
“We have a long history of collective bargaining with 1199 SEIU and we have reached mutually acceptable collective bargaining agreements with the union in every negotiation,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our bargaining process involves representatives from the university and the union, and, at the request of the union, we have mutually agreed to have a neutral mediator involved in our negotiations.”

Washington, D.C.’s only public psychiatric institution may have repeatedly violated D.C. laws regarding alleged employees’ treatment of mentally ill patients, including improper restraint and forced seclusion of patients, according to a report by nonprofit group Disability Rights D.C. at University Legal Services.
The report was published Sept. 26, two years after the federal government ceded control of St. Elizabeths Hospital to the local government. Disability Rights D.C. previously filed a lawsuit in 2005 in federal court suing for reforms on behalf of patients. The report cited repeated incidents in which hospital staff failed to employ proper de-escalation techniques with patients, exacerbating unsafe conditions in the hospital.
The 292-bed facility, located in Southwest D.C., was previously subject to seven years of federal oversight following complaints of overcrowding and assaults, which ended in 2014 after the hospital agreed to meet 224 benchmarks for care imposed by the Department of Justice. D.C. Department of Behavioral Health now oversees the hospital.
The authors of the report analyzed hospital records over a one-year period from May 2015 to April 2016. The records show 524 incidents of staff physically or mechanically restraining patients and 252 incidents of seclusion, though D.C. code 21-563 requires these measures be used only as a last resort.
Over the same period, hospital records counted 632 incidents of physical assault. The report pointed to poor staff conduct as a possible exacerbating factor in the high number of assaults.
“A significant reason for large numbers of acts of aggression may be the result of staff conduct — either because of staff conduct that escalates behaviors or staff’s failure to use techniques that deescalate behaviors,” the report reads.
In 2011, ULS previously settled a lawsuit filed in 2005 against the District of Columbia after alleging patients were not receiving appropriate psychiatric and medical treatment and staff shortages resulted in safety issues. As part of the settlement, St. Elizabeths agreed to improve open access to information about patient safety and allowed ULS to participate in routine monitoring visits.
ULS attorney Mary Nell Clark, who compiled the report, said she suspected hospital staff involved in cases of physical assault had not been following protocol.
“We did not find the evidence we felt like we should that they are using appropriate de-escalation techniques,” Clark said. “Maybe they are, but we doubt it.”
The report also details specific incidents of hospital staff apparently escalating or failing to appropriately de-escalate tense situations. In one case, a staff member identified as Staff One reacted explosively to a patient identified as Bill Mann, who reached out to touch his mother’s face during a visit.
“During the May 7th incident, Staff One threw his arm around Mr. Mann’s neck and tried to force him down, then grabbed Mr. Mann’s waist and pushed him backwards,” the report said. “After they fell, Staff One continued to hold Mr. Mann down on the floor. Staff One applied his body weight and appears to sit on or straddle Mr. Mann’s stomach, who was struggling on the floor.”
The report characterized the staff member’s conduct as “not simply abusive” and “extremely dangerous.”
DBH Legislative and Public Affairs Director Phyllis Jones declined to comment on what disciplinary action was taken regarding the staff member due to confidentiality concerns. However, she said the hospital takes disciplinary action against staff members when necessary.
“St. Elizabeth’s evaluates staff performance in incidents of alleged patient abuse to determine whether proper protocols and procedures were followed and will take action including additional training if needed, and disciplinary action up to dismissal when appropriate,” Jones wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The hospital’s internal report on the incident substantiated the allegations of physical abuse by the staff member. However, ULS said the hospital failed to recommend sufficient or significant corrective action in response to these findings. The St. Elizabeths report made only one recommendation — enforcing quicker response to the emergency call button.
“We are concerned that these measures do not address what may be a direct cause of the unsafe environment — the issue of staff’s response to agitated consumers and the adequacy of both the hospital’s training and the hospital’s support of staff required to meet the needs of individuals in care who present extremely persistent and challenging behaviors,” the ULS report reads.
Jones also disputed that these incidents represent a larger systemic problem for the hospital.
“Consistent with its commitment to continuous improvement, the Hospital regularly reviews training program to ensure best practices,” Jones wrote. “All staff is required to take mandatory safety training. There is no evidence of repeated failures by staff to adhere to training protocols.”
The ULS report makes a number of recommendations to the DBH in response to its findings, including investigating staff practices and re-assessing staff training programs. It also called for a DBH investigation into the hospital.
“DBH should now perform its own investigation of St. Elizabeths Hospital to determine if there are systemic failures, including the failure to identify staff members whose behaviors are escalating aggression and who are failing to implement de-escalation techniques, resulting in the unsafe environment,” the ULS report reads.
Though Jones did not acknowledge systemic failures at St. Elizabeths, she said they will meet with ULS to discuss the recommendations of the report.
“A secure environment for patients and staff that is also therapeutic and fosters recovery is a top priority for the new Chief Executive Officer Mark Chastang,” Jones wrote. “We look for ways to make the hospital even safer for patients and staff and will meet with ULS to discuss its recommendations.”
Max Lee (NHS ’17), who has volunteered at St. Elizabeths since last spring, said he was surprised by findings of the report.
“In my experience, the staff at St. Elizabeths always treat volunteers and residents with respect and professionalism. I have not witnessed any behavior that might indicate abuse,” Lee said. “Allegations of abuse, especially in this context, should never be brushed aside or ignored.”

Despite recent organizational changes, including new staff and reduced fees for mental health services, Counseling and Psychiatric Services is still not fully equipped to address the demand for mental health support, according to a panel of six university administrators from the Mental Health Advisory Board at the university’s second annual Mental Health Open Forum on Monday evening.
CAPS Director Philip Meilman said further reforms remain necessary to help CAPS catch up with student demand.
“We have hit a ceiling in terms of the amount of service we can deliver,” Meilman said. “We’re running about 10,000 visits per year. With the current staffing, the staffing that we had as of June 30, I don’t know that we can go any higher. We did get some more staff this year, so ideally it will go a little bit higher, but it’s not going to go as high as the demand for services.”
The forum featured Meilman, Student Outreach and Support Director Katie Boin, Assistant Vice President of Student Health Vincent WinklerPrins, Academic Resource Center Director Dr. Jane Holahan and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson.
Organized by the Georgetown University Student Association Mental Health Policy Team, the panel, which took place in the Healey Family Student Center, built on last year’s forum.
After the forum, where students raised concerns about the cost of mental health services, CAPS introduced a new payment policy reducing fees by 89 percent for follow-up psychological visits and 80 percent for follow-up psychiatric visits at the beginning of the semester.
Meilman said he is proud of the fee reduction and highlighted the process of reaching a decision on the policy change.
“I feel good about the fee reduction,” Meilman said. “This is something we had been cogitating for a long time now, and then finally we made that decision the Monday before classes started.”
Boin said that beyond the fee reduction, changes regarding medical leaves of absence include looping her office into the process, with the aim of smoothing students’ transition back into university life.
“After we changed the procedure this summer, students who are approved to return get an email from me to welcome them back to the university and to ask them what they might need to transition, whether that’s housing, help with ongoing treatment in the area or if they just needed a friendly face,” Boin said.
WinklerPrins said the focus going forward is on expanding services to more students.
“One of the things I would love to find a way to do is try to figure out how to reach everyone,” WinklerPrins said. “Many people are hurting badly for all sorts of reasons. How do we reach every one of those people?”
Holahan said it is important to improve the overall campus climate, highlighting the need for students to prioritize self-care rather than relative academic achievements.
“Be kind to yourself and don’t compare yourself to other people,” Holahan said. “There’s nothing wrong with a B. Quite frankly, I think all of us on this panel would say we don’t remember our GPAs from high school or college. It doesn’t really matter in the big scheme of things. What really matters is being kind to yourself and finding something that makes you happy every day.”
Olson said this shift in culture away from Georgetown’s stereotypical competitiveness needs to start with student leaders
“There’s a choice that every visible student leader has: to narrate franticness or to narrate balance and thoughtfulness,” Olson said. “I think the other piece of this can be just asking people how they’re doing in a little different way, so it’s clear what you’re looking for is actually an answer about how they’re doing and not just, ‘Fine, how are you?’”
Boin emphasized that cultural change within the student body comes from focusing on inclusivity and treating others with civility.
“I see a lot of situations where the consequence to a student’s mental health is related to a feeling of social isolation, and there is a component of someone really truly not being nice to them in a very basic way,” Boin said. “When we encounter others who are socially different from us, I want to challenge our student body to take on an attitude of basic civility. If there was some way in which we could incorporate that into a culture change, I would love it.”
Mental Health Policy Team Chair Sylvia Levy (SFS ’18) said the forum was intended to promote awareness of mental health policies and to clarify recent changes.
“The purpose of the event is to try to engage the student population in a continued discussion about mental health resources and policies on campus,” Levy said. “Given all the changes that have happened over mental health policies, it’s important to make sure the student body is aware of those changes.”

Top European diplomats expressed uncertainty at the extent of the economic fallout accompanying Britain’s historic vote to leave the European Union in a panel discussion hosted Oct. 17 by Georgetown University Law Center’s Institute of International Economic Law.
French Ambassador to the United States Gérard Araud categorized populism as an important role in Brexit, as well as the current U.S. presidential election, pointing to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s take on populism as particularly powerful.
“I think, quite frankly, ‘Trumpism’ is a transatlantic phenomenon,” Araud said. “We all face the same wave of populism. It’s really a wide challenge that we are all facing — all Western democracies, and not only the Europeans.”
The event, Europe After Brexit, included remarks from ambassadors representing the European Union, Germany, France and Slovakia reflecting on the ramifications of the referendum on both the EU and its partnering countries, as well as their priorities going forward in post-Brexit Europe. GULC is the first law school in the world to offer a seminar, Brexit and the Law, focused exclusively on Brexit.
EU Ambassador to the United States David O’Sullivan said Britain’s decision to leave the EU did not come as a shock given its history of reservation toward the organization.
“There’s always been a healthy, strong body of opinion in the U.K. which was frankly reluctant and reserved about membership if not downright hostile,” O’Sullivan said. “I think once you open the possibility of a vote on this subject it was always going to be a close call as to what came out of it.”
O’Sullivan also recognized the role of the 2008 financial crisis in Brexit, which he cited as a starting point of the growing discontent throughout Europe and the United States.
“There are generic elements of the moment which you will find elsewhere in Europe, and which, to a certain extent, I think you will find elsewhere in the United States: a sense of frustration with the way economic and social policy had developed, particularly since the financial crisis and economic crisis in 2008,” O’Sullivan said.
German Ambassador to the United States Peter Wittig said while it is difficult to change the narrative surrounding immigration at this time in Europe, it is important to remember the benefits that come with the single market. Wittig cited the recent acceptance of 10 Eastern European states into the EU as an example of the positive economic growth that can accompany the single market and immigration.
Araud said the complexity of negotiations and uncertainty regarding the long-term future of the EU requires cooperation among countries.
“All of us want a mutually beneficial relationship with the U.K.; we are not going on the revenge path,” Araud said. “But it is so complicated that we are unable to tell you where we are going.”
Araud also emphasized the importance of maintaining unity within the EU, stating that compromise with the U.K., while essential, is secondary to maintaining unity among the remaining 27 members of the union.
“Our main concern would be, of course, to maintain the unity of the 27,” Araud said. “So it means that we are not going to accept some U.K. demands which may actually endanger the unity of the 27.”
O’Sullivan stressed the difficulty of implementing further measures until the EU receives a clear response from the U.K.
“We are at a very, very early stage; every morning brings some new revelation of disagreement or a different reproach,” O’Sullivan said. “We owe it to the British government and people to give them the space to try and sort this out and come forward, in due time, with a sort of position which reflects how they see this and where they want to go. And, until this happens, it’s difficult to respond.”
Panelists agreed that the repercussions of Brexit are largely negative for all involved parties. However, Wittig expressed that the referendum can be used as a lesson for growth.
“If there’s an upside after the Brexit decision, it’s two things: First, it’s a shock that helps us to refocus, and second, it might help to mobilize the youth, because they are the hope for our future,” Wittig said.
Max Sanders (LAW ’17), who attended the discussion and will be working for a British law firm after graduation, said Brexit holds personal consequences for him.
“A lot of what they do are the backdrop for these international transactions. So if, all of a sudden, you have a lot of protectionism imposed, then you can face some serious issues which might be good for legal work but which also might hamper corporate legal work,” Sanders said.
Elizabeth Rogers (LAW ’18), a student in GULC’s Brexit seminar, emphasized the relevance of Brexit for students in the community.
“Maybe in the U.S. we don’t take it as seriously as we should. I think that given how hostile the current election has been, how wild the accusations have been, we sort of miss the underlying concern of populism,” Rogers said. “That’s a real problem, and something we should be actively addressing. As students, it affects all of our futures, no matter what field we’re in.”

The number of students studying abroad has increased from 561 in the 2012-13 year to 684 students in the 2015-16 year, marking a 21.9 percent increase and the highest overall enrollment in the past three years.
Georgetown currently offers study abroad options in 40 countries ranging from Botswana and Cameroon to Tajikistan and Taiwan. Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Denmark and France have remained the most popular study abroad options over the past three years. Hong Kong, China, Argentina and Australia are the most popular choices in regions outside Europe.
According to the Office of Global Education website, 467 students — about two in three — are currently studying abroad in Europe, consistent with the trend in the past three years. Latin America has seen a significant decline in enrollment over the past three years, with the number of students studying in the region falling from 80 in 2012 to 54 in the latest cycle.
Africa and the Middle East/North Africa usually receives the fewest students, though Morocco has seen a steady increase in enrollment from four students each cycle in 2013-14 and 2014-15 to 11 in 2015-16.
Director of Global Education Craig Rinker said the number of students abroad demonstrates the importance of a global perspective in equipping Georgetown students to enter a more connected world.
“We all live in a world of increasing interdependent nations and cultures.  The need to engage with the world has never been greater,” Rinker wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown students must be prepared to live and work in an international environment where they may need to look beyond borders to solve complex world issues. While our students can prepare in part through academic study and open debate, nothing can match direct experience.”
Students in the College make up more than half of students currently studying abroad. The School of Nursing and Health Studies continues to be the least represented school, with 12 students abroad in 2012-13 and 17 in 2015-16.
Meredith Johnson (SFS ’17), who studied abroad last fall in Madrid and now works as a peer adviser for the Office of Global Education, said she preferred to study in Europe because of the ease of travel to other nations.
“I’ve always known I’ve wanted to study abroad,” Johnson said. “I had never been out of the country before I went abroad so I knew I wanted to be in Europe because I wanted to see a bunch of countries in the short amount of time I was abroad.”
Johnson also said the availability of courses that matched her major affected her decision.
“[Spanish universities] had the most classes that would count towards my major whilst directly matriculating into classes with Spanish students,” Johnson said.
Tatiana Hadchiti (MSB ’18), who is currently studying abroad in the business and culture program in Barcelona, said her program balanced her interests in business and the humanities.
“As an International Business and Marketing double major, I thought that studying business abroad would give me a unique opportunity to learn about issues related to these topics through a unique lens,” Hadchiti wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Living in Spain also allows me to enhance my knowledge of the Spanish language and culture and explore a city in a different part of the world.”
Tori Costa (COL ’18), a Spanish and Portuguese major studying at the Complutense University of Madrid, said her study abroad experience is not what she anticipated.
“Studying abroad is a great experience, but I will say it has not met my expectations. Before arriving in Madrid, I thought things would be a lot easier than they turned out to be,” Costa wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown culture often depicts study abroad as a fun, well-deserved break from the daily grind we usually face as students. While in some ways this is true, there is still a lot of learning that goes on outside of the classroom.”
Hadchiti said that Georgetown students tend to spend most of their time with other students studying abroad, reducing opportunities to meet locals
“The majority of my time is spent with Georgetown students and other students I’ve met from different universities. My program consists almost entirely of American students, so it has been a little more difficult to meet local students,” Hadchiti wrote.
Katherine Leopold (COL ’18), who is studying abroad in Copenhagen, said her host family alleviated this issue by enabling her to find a balance between her peers and locals.
“My program has lots of Georgetown students in it. I spend some time with them and some time with other students in the program. Since I am living with a host family, I get to spend a good amount with local Danes everyday,” Leopold wrote.
Hadchiti said she received support at Georgetown prior to studying abroad that prepared her for a living experience in a foreign country.
“The MSB deans were very helpful during the application process and want to ensure that you are well prepared before leaving, in terms of course credits, cultural adjustment and any other issues that could arise,” Hadchiti wrote.
However, Costa said the College preparation did not ensure an easy transition overseas.
“I believe Georgetown did everything possible to equip us before moving overseas, however, I do not believe this is an experience you can truly prepare for,” Costa wrote.

“I thought things would be a lot easier than they turned out to be” – haha, what student was ever surprised with college being easier than they thought? 🙂 going to europe is a big step, but certain countries have a big advantage. if you look through the programs at e.g. https://www.study.eu you find that most universities in some countries don’t charge americans any tuition fee, such as france or norway, if you are doing the full degree there. imagine saving five digits or more on your postgrad!

The majority of students agreed that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was the winner of the final presidential debate Wednesday at a watch party in the Healey Family Student Center.
Hosted by Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service and co-sponsored by Georgetown’s College Democrats, College Republicans and the Independent Journal Review, the watch party featured expert commentary from former Democratic National Committee Communications Adviser Jamal Simmons and former Director of Vice Presidential Operations for the Bush-Cheney 2004 presidential re-election campaign Mary Cheney, who is also the daughter of former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney.
According to text polls conducted by GU Politics after the debate, students generally believed the stakes were highest for Republican nominee Donald Trump, but Clinton had won the debate. Fifty-three percent of students voted for Clinton winning the debate while 20 percent cast their votes for Trump. Twenty-eight percent of voters said Chris Wallace, the moderator, won the debate.
Students at the watch party also spoke with IJR Congressional Reporter Joe Perticone and GU Politics Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) who were at the debate at the University of Nevada Las Vegas on Facetime.
Cheney said this election is unique because candidates from both parties embodied the electorate’s desire for a change in the political norms. Cheney pointed to Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who ran for the Democratic nomination.
“I sit through a lot of focus groups, and I was amazed this year how many people … just wanted change against the system,” Cheney said.
Other text polls by GU Politics included students’ views on which candidate is more trustworthy in regard to national security and which candidate would create more jobs for America. In both those polls, students voted in favor of Clinton.
Having both worked on various campaigns, Simmons and Cheney offered insider perspectives on the happenings in a candidate’s room right before the debate. Cheney said debate preparation varies greatly depending upon the candidate, highlighting her own experience in her father’s room before debates.
“In my dad’s prep room, basically our family each gave him a hug, told him we were proud of him and to go win this thing,” Cheney said. “I learned later that in [2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee] Joe Lieberman’s prep room, he and his family and a couple of their key staffers held hands and sang ‘This Little Light of Mine.’”
In this final debate, Wallace, of Fox News, received praise for his efforts to keep the candidates on topic, more so than in the two previous debates. The night was punctuated by Clinton’s defense of the Clinton Foundation and Trump’s comments describing Clinton as a “nasty woman.”
Though the debate covered several key issues including immigration and the national debt, some students, like Meghan Bodette (SFS ’20), said they wished the candidates had discussed a wider range of topics.
“I would have liked to see climate change brought up. I would have liked to see more questions that involve foreign policy issues other than just terrorism and trade,” Bodette said. “No questions on Africa or Latin America. Really no questions on anything other than foreign policy issues that provide good soundbites.”
Chris Stein (SFS ’20), who attended the watch party, expressed shock at Trump’s statements insinuating he may not accept the results of the election come November.
“I just think it’s crazy that during the debate Trump said that there is a possibility he would contest the validity of a presidential election,” Stein said. “If you go down into the nuts and bolts of it, and look at how American elections are held, there’s literally no large-scale way to create voter fraud in the American system because each state operates its own system of polling.”
Bodette said Clinton came across as the most presidential by the end of the debate.
“She stayed composed, she stayed on her message, and I think she looked presidential,” Bodette said. “She was in control of what she wanted to say, and she definitely looked like a president on stage tonight.”

Adnan Syed was granted a new trial in 2016 after 16 years in prison for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. This exemplifies the importance of the media in providing hope for those who have been wrongfully convicted of crimes, according to Rabia Chaudry, who initially raised awareness for Syed’s case.
Chaudry, the author of the best-selling book “Adnan’s Story: The Search for Truth and Justice After Serial,” spoke this Thursday in the Intercultural Center Auditorium alongside Martin “Marty” Tankleff, a lawyer who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent 17 years in prison. Tankleff was released in 2007.
The event was sponsored by Georgetown’s Prisons and Justice Initiative and moderated by PJI Director Marc Howard, a longtime friend of Tankleff who worked to secure his freedom.
Syed, who had been imprisoned since 2000, was the subject of Sarah Koenig’s exculpatory podcast “Serial” and Chaudry’s own podcast “Undisclosed,” which profiles wrongful convictions.
“Serial,” now in its second season investigating the case of Bowe Bergdahl, has over 500 million downloads, and “Undisclosed” has over 100 million downloads.
Chaudry, an immigration and civil rights lawyer, said she never expected such a popular response to her work advocating for Syed.
“I think shock is probably the right word, not just surprised but completely shocked, and not just me, I think Sarah and the entire team, nobody expected this response,” Chaudry said.
According to Tankleff, the media plays a pivotal role in not only providing support in favor of freeing an individual who could have been wrongfully convicted, but also in spurring other people to come forward who may provide information useful to winning the case.
“I know in my case that when the media started to write more about it, more witnesses came forward,” Tankleff said. “Wrongful conviction cases are like puzzles in that one little piece can contribute in making it clearer. Your individual piece may not mean anything to you, but when you start connecting five of these little pieces connecting it really helps tell the story.”
Tankleff said focusing on each case individually can draw attention to systematic issues in the criminal justice system.
“By focusing on one case, each has become exponentially larger as people get referred to it,” Tankleff said.
Chaudry said although the role of media was significant in bringing Syed’s case to light, it was also essential in humanizing him. According to Chaudry, Koenig’s podcast made this possible.
“What I learned as an advocate, which I now use in my other work, is that you’ve got to tell the story first,” Chaudry said. “You’ve got to get people interested first and then you can follow up with ‘now this is the ask, this is what I need you to do.’”
Race also played an important role in Syed’s case, according Chaudry. Chaudry said the prosecution used an anti-Muslim bias to justify its theory for Adnan’s motives for committing the crime.
“It was very openly argued in front of the judge that you know, they framed it as an honor killing, although technically honor killings are something else,” Chaudry said. “They said basically ‘this is a jilted young Muslim man.’”
Each year since 2014, more than 100 people have been exonerated, but according to Tankleff, these numbers do not reflect how many innocent people are still behind bars.
“We really don’t have enough resources to litigate all these cases,” Tankleff said. “Every law school in America should have an innocence project, every law firm, especially the big ones who have the time and resources, because how many are we missing?”
Events and Program Coordinator for the Center of Jewish Civilization Michelyne Chavez (SFS ’15) said the event was essential to spur forward action on this important issue.
“I found that the conversation was very insightful and eye-opening, something very necessary for students to hear so the Georgetown community can start transitioning from being aware to being active,” Chavez said.
Scott Dennis (COL ’17), who attended the event, said the focus on new media and its use in drawing focus to individual wrongful convictions was especially fascinating.
“I think the best part of the discussion was about how things like “Serial” can draw broader attention to these issues and how there is this balance, this fine line you have to walk between how do we call attention to specific stories but at the same time call attention to the broader issues?” Dennis said.

After a semesterlong hiatus to restructure its ability to meet high demand for its dinners from the Georgetown community, Dinner with Seven Strangers will resume later this semester.
Since DW7S’s inception in the spring of 2015, more than 1,000 people have participated in the initiative, which organizes dinners between strangers at the homes of volunteer hosts.
Founder Lexi Cotcamp (MSB ’15) said she created DW7S to provide a place on campus where students could interact with peers they might not have otherwise encountered at Georgetown.
“DW7S is the opportunity to share a meal, consider what cura personalis really means and reflect on the Georgetown experience,” Cotcamp wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s the chance to meet new friends & mentors; take five; and appreciate the magic of a communal experience.”
During the first six weeks of the program, three dinners were held per night, five nights a week. Due to waning host interest, the initiative later scaled back to one dinner each night from Monday through Thursday for the 2015-16 school year.
Once reinstated, DW7S will be concentrated in one week of each month. One dinner will be held per night, four nights a week.
The identity of DW7S’s leadership has been kept a secret since its founding. Cotcamp was revealed as the founder in a Washington Post article about DW7S published after her graduation.
The leaders of DW7S hope that these changes will generate more interest from hosts and prove more financially sustainable than its previous structure.
According to Cotcamp, the anonymity of the leadership eliminates any bias associated with the leaders’ involvement in other clubs around campus.
“There was the idea that people would take pause in being involved in it because of who was running it and what institution they were attached to, and we wanted this to be an institution that any felt equally compelled to take part in without any sort of hesitation because of where it was coming from,” a current coordinator of DW7S who has requested to remain anonymous said.
The coordinator said the goal is for DW7S to establish connections that transcend the bounds of students’ typical social circles.
“At Georgetown, our social lives are so compartmentalized around what clubs we’re involved in, and there are so many amazing people doing so many amazing things on this campus,” the coordinator said. “But Lexi felt — and I feel the same way — that there was a huge inopportunity to get to know people outside of your specific realm of interest at Georgetown when there are all these incredible humans, and so we wanted to provide a space where people could relax a little bit.”
Cotcamp emphasized the initiative’s aim to encourage students to move outside their comfort zones and try new experiences.
“We shy away from the awkward because we’re only human,” Cotcamp wrote. “But DW7S serves as a reminder that we didn’t come to Georgetown to stay within the confines of our comfort zone. To engage in the inherent tensions of Georgetown is to truly experience what it means to be a Hoya.”
Alessandra Ruggiero (COL ’19), who attended a dinner as a freshman, is looking forward to the renewal of DW7S.
“As a freshman, I thought it would be a great way to get to know people or at least have a conversation with people I wouldn’t typically meet,” Ruggiero said.
While DW7S has been on hiatus, Georgetown’s professional foreign service sorority Delta Phi Epsilon has started its own version of DW7S called Dinner with 7 Sisters. Ruggiero, who is a member of DPE, said she enjoys the ability to develop a relationship with students she is unfamiliar with.
“I love going to these dinners because, similarly to DW7S, I get to meet and talk to sisters I typically wouldn’t,” Ruggiero said.

Climate change is the greatest moral issue faced by humanity in modern history, according to Former President of Kiribati Anote Tong during a lecture hosted in Copley Formal Lounge on Oct. 17.
Titled The Global Challenge of Climate-Induced Migration, the lecture was sponsored by the Global Futures Initiative, Georgetown Environment Initiative, Environmental Futures Initiative and the School of Foreign Service’s Science, Technology and International Affairs program. The event was part of the semester-long “The Global Future of the Environment” dialogue.
Environmental Futures Initiative member Aaron Silberman (SFS ’18) moderated the discussion.
Tong’s speech focused on the critical state of the Pacific Ocean island nation of Kiribati, which is predicted to be fully submerged in water within the next century. Thousands of Kiribati people have been displaced due to rising sea levels, resulting in loss of land for living and crop production.
“In all my advocacy, I have always referred to climate change as the greatest moral challenge facing humanity at any time,” Tong said. “Now that we know what we are doing is detrimental to the future survival of people and that we have the capacity to save that future, the question is: Are we willing to do something about it?”
Tong suggested that using floating islands or elevating land above predicted water levels may be possible solutions to the rising sea level threat Kiribati and other Pacific Island nations currently face. As the situation in the Pacific becomes more dire, and as technology progresses, island nation governments are starting to consider these concepts that were once thought to be impossible.
“It is my very strong conviction that in times like this, extraordinary and unconventional solutions are needed. Indeed, these are crazy, but we have no other option,” Tong said.
Despite the potential realization of these solutions, there are not enough resources to support the entire Kiribati population. As a result, the island population will need to migrate. Fiji and New Zealand already have systems in place for accepting Kiribati refugees.
Silberman highlighted the significance of dignified migration and said it is important to allow migrants to be treated as more than refugees.
“It’s a concept that, if executed properly, would go some way to giving justice to people who are suffering a profound injustice,” Silberman said. “Rather than taking away the agency of people and simply classifying them as powerless refugees, instead work could be done that would allow people to choose where they move, choose when they move.”
Tong acknowledged the sacrifices the people of Kiribati make when they migrate to other nations. Tong pointed to one Kiribati community that had migrated to the Solomon Islands in the 1960s, highlighting its assimilation into its host nation’s culture.
“Our people were beginning to do things that Solomon Islanders do. I saw this lady chewing betel nuts. In Kiribati we don’t do that. There was this other lady carrying what looked like Kiribas baby, so obviously there has been intermarriage,” Tong said.
Tong also discussed the importance of establishing effective programs to smooth the process of migration and to prevent a situation similar to the Syrian refugee crisis. However, he stressed that keeping the islands above water is the utmost priority, as Kiribati culture greatly relies on the physical land.
“We want to be able to maintain our islands so that those have somewhere to come back to find out, ‘What was our culture?’ In order to maintain culture, we must have a home,” Tong said.
Brice Russo (COL ’18), an attendee, said he left the lecture with a deeper understanding of the critical state of Kiribati and of the world as a result of climate change.
“I think it is of global importance, it is an issue that affects everyone and it’s our responsibility as people — as humans — that tragedies like this don’t affect others,” Russo said.
Jake Glass (SFS ’20) said he was moved by how Tong spoke of the culture and livelihoods of communities impacted by climate change.
“I think there’s a lot of empty rhetoric surrounding climate change, and a lot of politicians believe it’s simply an issue we need to argue about whether or not it’s actually happening. In this case, sea levels are actually rising, and it’s just fascinating and really saddening to see that there is a personal humanitarian impact to the rise of sea levels,” Glass said.
