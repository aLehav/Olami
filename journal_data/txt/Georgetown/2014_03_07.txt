Construction on the Intercollegiate Athletics Center, which will be named for former men’s basketball coach John Thompson Jr., will begin this summer, University President John J. DeGioia announced in a campus-wide email Tuesday.
The athletics department again announced the center’s full name, the John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletics Center, at halftime of the men’s basketball game at Verizon Center on Tuesday evening.
“It was very appropriate to have Coach Thompson Jr.’s name used on this facility,” Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Lee Reed told The Hoya. “He has meant so much, not only to Georgetown athletics and basketball, but to this university.”
According to Vice President of Public Affairs Erik Smulson, the university did not consider any other namesakes for the IAC.
Thompson served as the head coach of the men’s basketball team from 1972 to 1999 and, in 1984, became the first black coach to win a major collegiate title.
In his 27-year tenure, Thompson collected 596 wins and 13 Big East championships, including seven regular-season titles and six tournament titles. After his retirement in 1999, Thompson was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
“He has impacted professions beyond being a basketball coach. He is bigger than a basketball coach,” Reed said. “To be able to now have him and his name on this great facility, people will now remember his legacy forever. It couldn’t have happened to a better, more deserving person.”
The IAC will replace the adjacent McDonough Arena as the primary athletic center for Georgetown. When McDonough was built in 1951, there were 250 student-athletes and nine varsity sports at Georgetown. Today, however, there are 750 student-athletes and 29 varsity sports. Although McDonough is no longer capable of fully serving Georgetown athletics, it will still be used, according to Reed.
“McDonough still has life,” Reed said. “We will still use McDonough and repurpose it because the community values McDonough because there has been so much history there.”
The $60 million IAC, which is funded by the Campaign for Georgetown, will serve all 29 varsity programs and will include practice courts, suites and offices for the men’s and women’s basketball programs, locker rooms for the men’s and women’s soccer and lacrosse teams, meeting rooms, weight training and sports medicine facilities, a study lounge for athletes and a new space for the Athletic Hall of Fame.
“We want [student-athletes] to come here and be efficient. Then we can get them back out to campus where they can study and do the things they need to do and really embrace all they can at Georgetown University,” Reed said.
Athletics department administrative offices will remain in McDonough, while a use for the arena’s court and training facilities is yet to be determined.
Although the 130,000 square-foot IAC will be exclusively used by varsity student-athletes, Reed believes that the center’s effect of freeing up Yates Field House will benefit the wider Georgetown community.
“We will be able to pull the varsity activities out of Yates,” Reed said. “The IAC [will] free up more space and time in Yates for the general student activities.”
After breaking ground this summer, construction of the IAC, which is expected to take 18 to 24 months, is being run by the same company that is building the Healey Family Student Center in New South, the Whiting-Turner Contracting Company. Construction for the HFSC will run concurrently and is scheduled to conclude in fall. Lauinger Library, too, is undergoing a yearlong renovation to its Special Collections Research Center on the fifth floor, beginning this week.
“Whiting and Turner have a plan for how they will construct the building which will have a minimal impact on the rest of campus and our facilities,” Reed said. “Whiting and Turner has done a lot of work on campus so they understand how to do construction in tight spaces and protect our students, faculty and staff.”
Because the facility will replace the tennis courts currently located in front of McDonough Arena, the university is exploring options for new courts.
“We are really close to working through some plans and mapping out some plans to have tennis courts somewhere on campus or close to campus,” Reed said.
Design adjustments, including removing a proposed glass wall that would face West Road as well as a proposed wing that would partially obstruct McDonough, addressed the Old Georgetown Board’s concerns over size and design. The board criticized initial IAC designs in October 2011, describing the building as too dormitory-like and awkward, in addition to a dislike of the glass wall. The OGB provided permission to proceed with the project in September 2013, after the D.C. Zoning Commission approved plans in April 2012. Reed said he believes these adjustments created a better facility.
“During the process, we came together as two different communities,” Reed said, referring to the OGB and the university. “It looks better. It is going to be operationally and functionally better.”
Smulson stressed the widespread enthusiasm for the project.
“It is one of these unique projects that galvanize the Georgetown community and the entire Washington, D.C., community because they understand how important athletics is to Georgetown and the entire community,” he said.

The College Board announced extensive changes to the SAT on Wednesday that will eschew the mandatory timed essay and esoteric vocabulary to return to a two-section format with a maximum score of 1,600 points — rather than 2,400 — and an optional essay.
The changes, which will take effect in 2016, are designed to enable accessibility for students of all backgrounds and provide results more indicative of academic knowledge and capability, as well as to reduce the role of test preparation courses in determining a student’s score.
The writing and critical reading sections will be condensed into a singular category, with vocabulary questions testing words more commonly used in university settings. The math section will also be altered to better reflect math skills students will need after high school, like percentages and ratios, as well as some algebra, equations and their applications. The one-fourth point penalty for incorrect answers will be eliminated. An elucidation of the full scope of the changes will be revealed April 16.
“We will honor the qualities which have made the SAT excellent. We will build on the remarkable care and expertise which statisticians have used to make the exam valid and predictive,” College Board President David Coleman said at the announcement event in Austin, Texas. “While we build on the best of the past, we commit today that the redesigned SAT will be more focused and useful, more clear and open than ever before.”
Georgetown Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) praised the College Board’s decision.
“We’re very happy they’ve done what they’ve done. In my perfect world, I would say keep it stupid, keep it simple, go back and call it ‘verbal,’” Deacon said.
Deacon was apprised of potential changes at a meeting in the fall between the College Board and the deans of admissions of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education schools, a group of 31 private institutions that collaborate on financial issues. The deans were not informed as to the specificities at the time.
“This group objected a little bit to some of the terminology they were talking about. They were saying we need to have this ‘college- and career-ready,’ and people were saying, ‘Well what does that mean?’” Deacon said. “I think the College Board was trying to position themselves out there publicly in a way that made them seem more relevant. I know they wanted to respond to the fact that the test wasn’t really testing what students learned.”
The College Board will also offer fee waivers for the examination and four college applications to those eligible by family income, in a bid to provide more equitable opportunities to low-income students. To this end, the organization has partnered with the nonprofit online education website Khan Academy for provision of free test preparation, to counter the expense and culture of the test prep industry.
The current standard SAT registration fee is $51, which includes four score reports at no additional cost. Additional reports cost $11.25 each. The most popular Kaplan Test Prep course option, the SAT Classroom, is $699, while some private tutors charge upward of $100 per session.
“I agree with their goal, it might be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If they say it, people will think it,” Deacon said, also noting that a shortened test would ideally be cheaper. “We want more low-income students to go through the system.”
Members of Strive for College, a group that assists low-income D.C. high school students with the college application process, spoke highly of these steps.
“The larger issues is that the SAT is no longer a great measure of aptitude, just how well a student can take a test,” Eric Vorchheimer (MSB ’14), a former president of Strive for College, said. “Adapting the material to what is actually being taught in high school helps take down some of the barrier that are raised by the preparation process.”
Georgetown has never considered the writing section, which first appeared in 2005, in the admissions process, instead requiring applicants to submit critical reading and mathematics scores from all sittings of the assessment.
“We felt it was an unnecessary addition of time, and cost to students, which is significant. And then, thirdly, we thought it was a less accurate indicator because a piece of this test was this writing sample that was graded by 10,000 readers. It wasn’t done statistically correctly,” Deacon said. He also alluded to studies that identified a correlation between score and essay length.
Deacon said that the SAT Subject Tests — known as SAT IIs — that test specific academic subjects, of which Georgetown “strongly recommends” three, provide valuable insight into a student’s performance that supplants and exceeds the capability of the current writing section.
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions does not anticipate modifying the lens with which it examines scores. Paramount priority rests with those scoring at the top of the range, as, according to Deacon, 11 percent of the total test-taking population scoring over 700 in a section apply to Georgetown.
“We’ll probably get virtually the same score we would get before. … They’re going to norm it anyway so it comes our pretty much the same,” Deacon said.
The Georgetown admissions decision process does not assign a quantitative value to testing, but considers scores in conjunction with academic achievement, which is more heavily weighted, to predict freshman year performance.
The College Board’s changes also come on the heels of it ceding primacy in total student customers to the shorter ACT, whose writing portion is optional. According to Deacon, 25 percent of Georgetown applicants submit ACT scores, while 90 percent submit SAT scores, resulting in a 15 percent overlap.
“There’s no doubt that there’s been market pressure. The SAT, as we’ve known it for the past 10 years, was like it was because of market pressure,” Deacon said. “And the ACT has been gaining ground.”
Current Strive for College Co-President Megan McGlinchey (COL ’16) said that the changes had the potential to alter the advice the group offers to high school students.
“We definitely encourage kids to take both the SAT and ACT, but recently there’s been a greater push for the ACT because of the essay. Now, we might be encouraging the SAT,” she said.
Most changes have found popularity among high school students — despite the fact that current ninth graders will be the first to take the new test.
“I think a lot about the new format is it’s more related to what we’re actually studying in high school. I feel like I wouldn’t have had to spend as much on prep courses to learn little tricks and ways to solve problems,” said Tyler Winther, a senior at Glen Ridge High School in Glen Ridge, N.J. “It makes the SAT more of an achievement-based test than an aptitude test, which is what I think it should be. Unfortunately, they decided to do it after I’ve already taken the SAT three times.”
Danny Licht, a senior at Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, Calif., echoed Winther’s sentiments.
“I think it’s great what they’re doing in terms of democratizing the process, in doing Khan Academy, by making the content more accessible to people and making the test prep centers less relevant,” he said.
Licht, however, expressed dissatisfaction at the modifications to vocabulary, while Winther disapproved of the elimination of the compulsory essay.
“I think it makes it more boring, dumbing down the vocabulary,” Licht said. “I think just by virtue of them having arcane words, people improved their vocabulary while studying. We probably wouldn’t have had all those vocabulary tests without the SAT.”
“I don’t like that they’re making the essay optional. I think it’s one of the only real indicators of validity of the test,” Winther said.
Deacon, who says the College Board has reached out to Georgetown to ensure understanding and support, is a strong proponent of a future computer-based test. For now, he anticipates a streamlined and more accessible examination.
“In today’s world, the SAT should be computer-based. It’s much more efficient,” he said. “The test should be shorter, should be less expensive, should be amenable to be taken on a computer.”

University President John J. DeGioia has spent virtually his entire adult life on the Hilltop, and under his leadership, Georgetown has launched two major fundraising campaigns, expanded campus facilities dramatically and adapted academics to the new millennium. But PresidentDeGioia doesn’t do many interviews, and we were pleased to finally speak with him March 4 and address an accumulation of questions from a year’s worth of headlines.
Below is an abridged transcript. The complete video can be found here.
There’s that very memorable photograph of the three-way handshake between you, Mayor Gray and the community leader Ron Lewis after the 2010 Campus Plan agreement was reached in the summer of 2012. But in seeing the aftermath across so many areas of campus life, is there any denying that students were on the losing end of that bargain?
I would never characterize it that way. We actually have had the most positive working relationship with the neighborhood during my years at the university, going all the way back to my student years. We are able now to move forward and continue our efforts to expand on-campus residential capacity with the new Northeast Triangle and renovation of the old Jesuit Residence. That agreement enables us to strengthen the student experience and have a clear framework for growth.
Maybe the biggest story on campus this year has been the possibility that an undergraduate dormitory would be acquired several miles off campus, and there was overwhelming disapproval from students and recent alumni upon hearing that news. That plan has been scrapped for now, but where did you stand on the satellite residence?
We’ve had them before. During my undergraduate years we had one right on Massachusetts Avenue — Alban Towers, it was called. We had between 800 and 900 students living there. It was never ideal, and when we had the opportunity to build more on-campus housing and sell Alban Towers we did so. We were looking at a range of options. Our preference was always to find on-campus possibilities, and we needed to do the work to be able to determine if we could fit a residence hall next to Reiss; could we convert the old Jesuit Residence. Pieces of that puzzle weren’t clear.
In November, you unveiled your Defining the Future of Higher Education Initiative. At that time, you noted that higher education is at a critical turning point, but you also said that it may have lost its way recently, including at Georgetown. What did you mean by that?
The key point that I was trying to address was this question that in the face of unprecedented challenges in our lifetimes to the traditional model for higher education, how do we understand those challenges as potential opportunities? What is it that we have to protect, and what is it that we need to engage? There are three elements of the university that must be understood and protected: the formation of students, the inquiry of our faculty and the commitment of the university to contribute to the common good. Those three elements are inextricably linked, and one of the mistakes that’s being made right now is the idea that you might be able to isolate pieces of this from the other elements.
There seems to be a growing emphasis among students on the pre-professional aspects of a Georgetown education. Is any reform needed to counter that career-oriented approach to academics?
On the one hand, we fully recognize the interests of our students entering an ever-more complex workforce, and there are some core skills that it would be great if we could ensure that they pick up while they’re here. The question we’re wrestling with right now is does that have to happen in our traditional curriculum? I joke that we offer the minor in the College in business just to bring peace to the Thanksgiving dinner table, so that anybody going home with an English, theology or philosophy major could be able to say to their folks, “Well, I got this covered.” The idea that we’ve got to find the right balance is very important for the lived reality of our students.
The cost of attending Georgetown has more than doubled since you took office. Do you fear that barriers are only getting higher to studying on the Hilltop?
It’s never been more challenging for us to ensure that anybody who wants to study here can study here. In 1978, it cost us $2 million to meet the cost of our full-need financial aid policy. This year, it will cost us $107 million. We’ve sustained the policy, and it still sends the signal to students anywhere in the country that this a place that’s realistic and affordable.
When you think about people like Edward Bunn, Francis Healy and Joseph Lauinger, who are immortalized around campus, does someone like Frank McCourt, who has faced serious criticism for the way he accumulated his fortune, belong in that company?
Frank McCourt is from a three-generation legacy family at Georgetown. His contribution came from a life of hard work and engagement. He felt it appropriate to give back to the university at this time in his life. I recognize that there was lots of public criticism of Mr. McCourt, but none of that in any way should result in a criticism of his generosity to support the mission of this university.
You had a prominent role in Big East realignment. Last fall, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon told me in an interview, “From an institutional basis, the only negative is that we are probably taking a step backward in the national spotlight.” As important as basketball has been for growing our national reputation, is there any concern the new arrangement could diminish that?
The only way it will be a step backward is if the Big East doesn’t play basketball at the highest possible level. This season is a good indication that this a group of schools that will be able to play at the highest level. We can just give it a little bit of time.
At your inaugural address in 2001, you identified the tension between Catholic values and the practices of the academy. As president, what has been the most challenging instance when you’ve had to navigate that tension?
I suppose the most public, and significant challenge, was dealing with the implications of the Affordable Care Act. We wanted to be sure that we had fidelity to the deepest values that have animated this university for 225 years.
If you were in a position to choose your successor, and after reviewing all the candidates, the most qualified person happened to be gay, would he or she get the job?
I can’t imagine that our board of directors would discriminate for any candidate regardless of the criteria.
So that’s a yes, potentially?
Absolutely.

Lauinger Library has entered the beginning stages of renovations to the Special Collections Research Center on the fifth floor to update and expand the space, this week.
Throughout the renovations, designed by Bowie Gridley Architects, administrators hope to keep the noise and disruptions to students in the library at a minimum. Construction, led by Manhattan Construction, will take place Monday through Friday, from 6:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.
“We found that especially our undergraduate users tend to be here late afternoon and all through the night and so our hope is that the disruption will be minimal,” University Librarian Artemis Kirk said.
The renovation will not only update the Special Collections Research Center, but also move some of the crucial materials and staff to the first floor in order to continue services.
“We are redoing that space. It will be temporary space for special collections folk and some materials from which they will continue their service,” Kirk said.
Updates will feature a state-of-the-art shelving area and vault, which will be environmentally controlled. A classroom for teaching with special collections will be added, along with an enhanced reading room for researchers, a separate reception area and improved exhibition spaces. Collaborative study space for faculty, staff and students will also be added.
The renovations are taking place after years of planning to update the standards of the Special Collections Research Center to meet current preservation standards.
“During this 40-year period of time, in addition to having received so many more materials and the need to store them and keep them and preserve them, the standards have changed in preservation, so we are updating and upgrading the systems,” Kirk said.
This renovation is an opportunity to strengthen scholarly research possibilities by taking care of the collection and expanding research space. According to the website, the project costs $5 million and will be mainly funded through philanthropy.
“Because our job as librarians is to see to it that the scholarly communications continuum exists and that people use the materials that we have here to create new knowledge for the future but to make sure that we preserve all these things,” Kirk said.
There will be no construction during the exam period and Kirk stated that most of the loud and disruptive construction will be happening over the summer.
Kirk anticipates little concern over the renovation’s effect on study space on the floor itself.
“The Special Collections really wasn’t a study space to begin with, in the way that a lot of students would come in and expect to do their own assignments,” Kirk said.
However, Vice President for Planning and Facilities Robin Morey acknowledged that the renovations would spill over to the third floor, causing the Pierce Reading Room to be closed temporarily.
“The schedule contains a three-week period when the third-floor reading room will be closed. The work will be scheduled ahead of time with sufficient notice to users,” Morey said.
However, according to Coordinator of Communications, Outreach and Programming Jennifer Smith, these plans have not been finalized.
Kirk explained that the closure may occur because the heating systems between the fifth floor and the reading room are connected.
For students, these renovations may disrupt their regular study patterns. However, the updates will enhance study life.
For students, the renovations may be welcomed, as better study space is made available.
“Right now it’s kind of barren and a little dated, so [the construction] is encouraging, I know it will facilitate learning,” Thomas McAuley (COL ’17) said of the planned renovations.
Although McAuley frequently studies on the fifth floor, he said he would not be bothered by the construction.
“It probably will annoy some people, but there’s four other floors and it’s probably worth it. … It sounds like they’re trying to do their best to make it convenient and not disruptive to everyone, so I’m not going to be bothered by it, I’ll still go to Lau 5,” McAuley said.
The hours of renovation also will allow students who study frequently at night to avoid disruption. According to McAuley, he normally studies after the 6 p.m., after the end of construction.
“If I’m studying earlier, I go to a different floor because earlier in the day the other floors aren’t as crowded, the only reason I go to Lau 5 is because it’s not very crowded,” McAuley said.

At an official unveiling in Sellinger Lounge, employees at Hilltoss, a new Students of Georgetown Inc. location that will sell salads, smoothies and frozen yogurt, gave out free samples and solicited student input.
“The main point of this installation … is to communicate to the Georgetown community first of all what our product offering is for both the Farmers’ Market this spring and in the fall, actually in the academic year of 2014 to 2015, in the actual store,” Director of Hilltoss Dana Mitchell (MSB ’15) said.
Although a Hilltoss stand will open from March 19 to April 30 at the Georgetown University Farmers’ Market, the actual location in the Healey Family Student Center will not open until fall 2014.
The installation also revealed the newly designed Hilltoss logo.
“We kind of sat down and brainstormed — what does the Hilltoss mean; how does it fit in the Hilltop; and then how can we translate that visually into the logo,’” Mitchell said.
The logo depicts a leaf sprouting out of the store’s name.
A major part of the installation focused on receiving student input.
“A huge point of this isn’t just the event and the sampling of the salads, it’s us being able to talk to them [the students] and see what they are looking for in the Hilltoss,” Mitchell said.
This solicitation continued the crowdsourcing aspect of the new storefront’s development.
“If you remember last year, we sourced the name in a competition, in a submission style Google form where every single name that we looked at came from the Georgetown community and came from students,” Mitchell said.
In order to continue including student input, Hilltoss will have a suggestion box at its market stand.
“One thing we’d like to include is a submission box, or something like that, maybe a Google form, some activity to really get people to participate in our recipes and in our operations and to communicate with us … so we can really take into account what the students want from the Hilltoss. That’s our number one priority,” Mitchell said.
Student input will help Hilltoss put its best products forward when the location opens.
“I think in terms of vibes for the Farmers’ Market, again we are definitely looking for input from the Georgetown community because we want to keep reevaluating our quality and really have an introspective approach to our product offering,” Mitchell said, “Our number one priority for this service is high-quality products, and I think we are willing to take suggestions from the community, from students and make adjustments as need be.”
Corp CEO Sam Rodman (MSB ’15) believes that the market will give Hilltoss the opportunity to show the importance of students’ needs.
“The jump from coffee to a full-fledged restaurant style salad shop is a pretty big one and the Farmers’ Market is an excellent opportunity for us to, number one, show students that we’ve been really committed to addressing their concerns and putting together a product that students are really going to fall in love with, and for us to really make sure we are meeting the best interests of students,”Rodman said.
The installation offered two different salads to sample. The Jay Gatsby summer salad featured strawberries, avocado, goat cheese, walnuts and strawberry-blush dressing‬, while the Amalfi Coast Italian salad included mozzarella, tomato, basil, oregano, salt, pepper and a balsamic dressing.
Alex De Luca (COL ’15) expressed satisfaction with his sample. However, the presence ofSweetgreen still leaves Hilltoss with competition.
“I think next year I’m going to be living closer to campus, but I’m also going to be living like a block and half from Sweetgreen, so maybe if I’m on campus I’d rather go here than somewhere else,” De Luca said.
Although other students also enjoyed the salads, they expressed a desire for more options.
“I think it shouldn’t be just a salad place, like they should have other things,” Yue Ma (COL ’17) said, “I think it would be really cool if they opened something else to eat other than just salads and smoothies.”

The School of Foreign Service announced the appointment of Ambassador Barbara Bodine as the new director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.
After a search committee’s lengthy process of soliciting applications and interviewing candidates, SFS Acting Dean James Reardon-Anderson picked Bodine, whose tenure begins July 1.
“She is not only a successful diplomat, but she also has considerable academic experience. To have someone at a university you want to make sure that they know about and are experienced in higher education, and these two attributes make her a very attractive candidate,” Reardon-Anderson said.
Bodine spent the last seven years as director of Princeton University’s Scholars in the Nation’s Service Initiative, and served as the U.S. Ambassador to Yemen from 1997 to 2001, a tenure that coincided with the al-Qaeda bombing of the USS Cole in October of 2000. The Cole bombing resulted in the deaths 17 Americans and the wounding of 39 others.
According to a 2008 Washington Post article on the subsequent investigation, some contention surrounds the probe in regard to enmity between the embassy led by Bodine and the FBI, which may have hampered the investigation.
Bodine’s experience did not serve as the only factor in Dean Reardon-Anderson’s decision to appoint her.
“After interviewing her, I really liked her and thought she would be a terrific person to have on campus and among other things to have in the classroom,” Reardon-Anderson said.
Bodine will also serve as a distinguished professor in the practice of diplomacy. Although she will focus on the ISD come fall, which conducts research on the practice and processes of diplomacy through associates and student fellows, Reardon-Anderson has high hopes for her as a professor when spring 2015 rolls around.
“She will teach next spring, and she will be a terrific teacher,” Reardon-Anderson said. She hopes to decipher her aims and goals for the ISD in the months before she begins teaching.
“The first semester I want to spend the time really trying to figure out where and how the institute can best fit into the school and Georgetown. I know what I want the institute to be, I am still working on how to get it there,” Bodine said.
Bodine expressed excitement to work with the students of Georgetown, beyond the scope of the ISD, which is located in a townhouse on 36th Street.
“What I would like to see for the institute is that it really serves a purpose for the university and for the students. I don’t want it to be this funny little place that sits just outside the campus, and isn’t really part of the campus. I want it to be integrated into the life and the work of what the campus is doing,” Bodine said. “I don’t want the geographic position of the institute to be figurative of its position at the university as well,” Bodine said.
As Bodine plans to bring the institute to new places, her main goal is to work with and for students to facilitate participation in a broadening diplomatic world.
“The nature of diplomacy has really changed. A lot of the players are no longer just government employees, but NGOs, corporations and the like, and Ambassador Bodine is really going to lead the institute both in research and education on the new diplomacy and the new nature of this phenomenon,” Reardon-Anderson said.
Bodine’s appointment additionally emphasizes a newly founded diplomatic focus.
“Ambassador Bodine is a highly respected former diplomat with deep experience in academia. Her appointment as director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy and distinguished professor in the practice of diplomacy clearly reflects the high priority that Georgetown and the School of Foreign Service place on the field of diplomacy,” Interim ISD Director James Seevers, who assumed the role after former director Paula Newberg left for the University of Texas at Austin, said.
Current ISD staff indicated their satisfaction with the appointment.
“While I have not yet had the privilege of working with the Ambassador, she has a great reputation as an outstanding diplomat,” Seevers said. “We are very much looking forward to her arrival at Georgetown and her leadership at the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.”
Bodine looks forward to the new campus as much as the new work that awaits her.
“I am not only glad that I am able to work at another top university. I am especially glad to be coming to Georgetown,” Bodine said.

The university announced a new video service called Georgetown Everywhere that provides media coverage of Georgetown events, but while the service looks to enrich the university’s image, it has drawn criticism from GUTV, a student-run service that provides similar multimedia services to the Hilltop.
The project, announced Feb. 28, is completely run by the administration and now available in both website and smartphone iterations. According to Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson, Georgetown Everywhere was created to enhance Georgetown’s public image.
“We began developing Georgetown Everywhere about a year ago in an effort to centralize the terrific video content that was being created across campus by different departments and schools and engage the Georgetown community and others in new and exciting ways,” Smulson wrote in an email. “We wanted to create a platform that would make this content available across a wide array of mobile devices, tablets, websites and on TV to highlight the exceptional faculty and students and in general, all the extraordinary things happening at Georgetown everyday.”
The creation of Georgetown Everywhere came as a surprise to students in GUTV, a student-run news show. General Manager of GUTV Joseph Laposata (COL ’16) said that he was worried that the new platform would compete with the student publication.
“We’re a little dismayed because it’s very much what we’re doing, and in some aspects it could be seen as shoving us out,” Laposata said. “We’re not entirely at that point yet, but we’re talking with the administration about it because we’re a little worried it could go there.”
GUTV News Co-Director Elizabeth Teitz (COL ’16) does not see Georgetown Everywhere as direct competition, since the voice of each publication is very different.
“There’s definitely a little bit of competition in that we do have similar missions, but it’s really more complementary just in that they’re very different. … It’s really great in providing the administration perspective, but we do still have a really strong student voice,” Teitz said.
Despite this, Laposata sees that the fact that Georgetown Everywhere pays its student employees, while GUTV cannot, is unjust.
“It is unfair,” Laposata said. “It would be great if I could pay my reporters. I’d have more of an incentive for people to do underreported stories, but it’s unfair in the sense that they’re doing a very similar job to what we’re doing, but because we’re doing it for fun and they’re doing it for the university, they get paid.”
Both Teitz and Laposata said that although they wish they had been informed about the new platform, they are eager to find ways to collaborate.
“We think that this is a prospect for collaboration,” Laposata said. “We have some things that we can offer. … First of all, we have manpower, and second of all, we have a student’s perspective. Georgetown Everywhere is great. It’s got a mobile app and students can access it very easily, but it only covers things that the university covers.”
Georgetown Everywhere will include event coverage, features on life at Georgetown and stories about university athletics. In addition, the platform includes a student-produced program entitled Georgetown Buzz. In this program, students report on news of their choice in small snippets to create a short news show. Currently, two students are working on creating Georgetown Buzz and both receive compensation from the university for their work.
Molly Mitchell (COL ’14), Georgetown Everywhere’s student reporter, said that the job has helped her learn about broadcast journalism.
“I’ve learned a lot about the process of making a video in general, video production and how to put things together and how to write a script better. … I think it’s the best way to interact with people. There’s something about watching a video about an event that’s just extremely impactful. It’s something I’ve always been extremely passionate about,” she said.
According to Smulson, the platform will expand in the future to include outside content.
“We’re especially excited to be featuring student content through the new Georgetown Buzz show,” Smulson wrote. “As we move forward, we’ll be developing ways for alumni and other members of the Georgetown community to submit content to be included in Georgetown Everywhere.”

Ahn Ho-Young (GRD ’83), the Republic of Korea’s ambassador to the United States, spoke in McGhee Library Wednesday about his 35 years in foreign service and about his experience as a Georgetown student in the Masters of Science in Foreign Service program.
“I have always believed that I was a very lucky person in my professional life, but my life here as an MSFS student from 1981 to 1983 was when I felt I was the luckiest,” Ahn said.
Appointed ambassador to the United States in May 2013 by South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Ahn has made great efforts to build and reinforce relations between the United States and South Korea.
“Looking back at my 35 years of experience in foreign affairs, I found that I have been mostly engaged in matters regarding the U.S., and this is because Korea and the U.S. are one of the strongest allies and partners today,” Ahn said.
Ahn mentioned that the Korea-U.S. relationship began only as a strategic military cooperation rooted in necessity.
“Since the truce of 1953 between South and North Korea, the U.S. has been intimately involved in Korea’s security issues,” Ahn said. “The partnership continued to grow substantially over time, but until the 1980s the relationship was mainly security focused.”
This partnership became more multifaceted as economic relations deepened and diplomatic ties were reinforced throughout the last two decades of the 20th century.
“In the 1980s, things changed since the Korea-U.S. relationship changed to the economic sector,” Ahn said. “And as Korea began normalizing relations with several other nations, we consulted the U.S. on many occasions, thereby strengthening our diplomatic ties as well.”
One manifestation of this economic collaboration is the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, which was officially implemented on March 15, 2012, and is currently seen as a big success for both South Korea and the United States.
“There is a saying in international trade that says there are no happy farmers,” Ahn said. “But my diplomatic trips to many different rural areas in the U.S. has confirmed that this was wrong. I met a lot of happy farmers who actually said their exports to Korea were exponentially growing.”
Asian Studies Program Director Victor Cha, who organized the event, noted that the success of the KORUS FTA has created debate about whether Korea’s negotiations on the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership will be as effective.
“The current economic discussion of the KORUS FTA leads us to a similar debate on the TPP,” Cha said. “The TPP has been increasingly discussed within Korea, but it is also an issue involving the U.S. to a significant degree.”
Ahn added that the discussion and concerns over Korea’s involvement in the TPP are because of a belief that such engagement is too hasty at a time when the effects of the KORUS FTA have not yet been fully assessed.
“We Koreans like to traditionally do one task at a time,” Ahn said. “That’s why this new talk on the TPP worries people who think that we will not be able to reap the benefits of neither the FTA nor the TPP if we get our hands too full.”
Ahn also took the time to focus on his personal experience as a Georgetown graduate student, something with which the attendees connected.
“I found it fascinating that he once used to be a Hoya, just like me,” Michelle Hur (SFS ’17) said. “I want to work for an NGO in the future to develop these Korea-U.S. ties further, and I find it very encouraging that Ambassador Ahn has paved the way for making my goals possible.”
Ahn continued to emphasize the unique perspective that Georgetown offers to its students, and especially how the SFS helps Georgetown students to shape a particular international political lens that helps assess events in professional life.
“Know that you are lucky to be sitting here, as I had felt before, and be responsible for the great education that you receive,” Ahn added. “My 35 years in foreign service, in building the relations between the U.S. and Korea, has been a very rewarding experience, and the School of Foreign Service helped me shape [my] abilit[ies] and unique perspective.”

The Social Innovation Public Service Fund is raising its on-campus profile through several initiatives, including a business idea pitching competition and a summer fellowship program.
On Feb. 27, SIPS, Startup Hoyas, Global Social Enterprise Initiative and the newly launched Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation co-sponsored a Social Innovation Competition, which an opportunity for 10 teams of student entrepreneurs to pitch business ideas related to social impact and innovation. The competition drew around 110 people.
“We wanted to design an event that was entirely focused on students who have the creative drive and the capability to produce lasting effects for disadvantaged communities, and we wanted to channel that through entrepreneurship,” Startup Hoyas Chair Derek Embry (MSB ’15) said.
This is the first time that the SIPS Fund co-sponsored the competition, which is in its second year.
“SIPS was there to promote different projects that didn’t receive grants or funding or prizes there. They could go to SIPS potentially for funding in the future,” SIPS Fund Director of Development Kyle Rice (SFS ’16) said.
A panel, made up of eight judges, evaluated teams based on their presentations, the feasibility of their ideas and the social impact that their proposals will have. The judges consisted of entrepreneurs of the McDonough School of Business, local entrepreneurs and local professionals.
The judges selected Team Fresh Start, helmed by Shilpa Chandran (MSB ’15), Jack McCabe (MSB ’15), Phil Wong (SFS ’15) and Ann Yang (SFS ’15), to receive the $1,000 grand prize sponsored by Sweetgreen.
The team pitched an idea for a food truck business that sold juices and smoothies and that would also help combat the issues of food waste and neighborhoods lacking in fresh food.
The team intends to donate one pound of produce to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for every pound of produce that it sells as juice or smoothies.
“The innovation part is looking at how we can do something creative for a problem that’s been around for a really long time. … We thought about how we could combine the problems of both food waste and food deserts into one business idea,” Chandran said.
The team plans to utilize the prize money to purchase an industrial juicer and to begin sourcing fruit to launch its business.
Team WaterLily received the SIPS Fund People’s Choice Award. The team was selected by popular vote of the audience to receive a $250 prize from the SIPS Fund.
Nicolas Walker (SFS ’16) and David Burton (MSB ’15) presented for WaterLily. Christian Sparacino (COL ’14) and Frans Beerkens (COL ’14) are also members of the team but did not attend the competition.
Walker and Burton pitched an idea for a water desalinization method known as capacitive deionization, which is an efficient and environmentally friendly method for removing salt from water. This process was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The team is working to obtain an evaluative license from MIT, which would allow them to experiment with the technology, develop a prototype and have exclusivity in the humanitarian market for as long as they hold the license.
This technology can be utilized to provide clean drinking water to people that currently cannot access it because of natural disasters or environmental constraints.
“The social innovation side of it is that we’re trying to make a backpack-sized device to be deployed in humanitarian work,” Walker said.
The team plans to utilize its prize money to offset the cost of its endeavor. Obtaining the evaluative license from MIT for six to 18 months will cost between $5,000 and $20,000, depending on the amount of time for which it will hold the license.
“$250 isn’t that much money, but we’re looking to apply it any way we can … and just really make that money stretch as far is it can,” Burton said.
At an Executive Board meeting on Tuesday, the SIPS Fund, in an effort to expand on-campus presence, decided to grant $7,500 to Hilltop Microfinance Initiative to enable the provision of small loans to businesses and the development of its marketing team. The fund also gave $2,300 to the Georgetown Global Microfinance Initiative to help them strengthen its presence on campus through marketing.
This year, the SIPS Fund also launched a new summer scholarship program that will offer grants to students who are working on causes that align with the SIPS mission of social innovation and public service.
“We’d like to see applications from students who are volunteering abroad … who are doing research in environmentally friendly technologies, who are interning in a nonprofit on [Capitol] Hill,” Rice said.
Students can utilize these grants to fund travel, housing and other expenses over the summer.
It has yet to be determined the size of the grants or the number of students that will receive funding.
“A lot of it depends on what the average demonstrated need per student might be,” Rice said. “We do have a set amount to give out.”
Within the first week of the application going live, the SIPS Fund received about a dozen applications, which Rice said was an indicator of student interest in the SIPS Fund.
“SIPS really exists as a resource for students and alumni at Georgetown, and we really want to make sure that every student has heard our name,” Rice said.

Several Georgetown students and professors took part in the 2014 American Israel Public Affairs Committee Policy Conference Sunday through Tuesday, held at the Washington Convention Center.
Despite Monday’s snowstorm, the AIPAC conference amassed over 14,000 delegates in attendance and featured speakers such as Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), Representative Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
AIPAC, a lobbying group that promotes a strong U.S. relationship with Israel, is widely considered to be a strong force in shaping how the U.S government relates to Israel.
About 10 Georgetown students attended the conference and six Georgetown professors led breakout sessions following the major speakers on specialized topics, such as Israeli innovation in missile defense.
“The coolest part about the conference is not just the learning you have in sessions you sit through, but it’s in the relationships you have,” Michail Woods (SFS ’14) said. “Because you have people, from Latinos to African-Americans to evangelical Christians to, obviously, Jews, from all over the United States, and a lot of people come from even overseas to come together for one thing. … We all come together to support a strong U.S.-Israel relationship.”
Additionally, Woods said the conference functioned as a quasi-training session for the next generation’s AIPAC leaders.
“Any organization, to maintain its leadership, it’s like a showcase to say this is what we’re doing, these are the issues we need to be passionate about; and this is essentially why this organization still matters to you and why you should still be a part of it,” Woods said.
Josh Goldberg  (COL ’17) additionally felt the conference allowed attendees a chance to showcase prominent leaders in the field.
“I attended the AIPAC Policy Conference because I am interested in getting a better understanding of U.S.-Israel relations and the ongoing political issues in the Middle East. … I really enjoyed the conference because it was a good opportunity to hear many national speakers and to take advantage of being in a university in the nation’s capital,” Goldberg wrote in an email.
For Goldberg, who attended a breakout session about Middle East Politics, the conference allowed him to get more involved with the issues at hand.
“I hope to get further involved in AIPAC and learn what I can do to help promote U.S.-Israel relations,” Goldberg said.
This winter, AIPAC lobbied Congress to pass sanctions on Iran, although this effort failed.
“One of the main points of the conference, to get a member of Congress and raise awareness for it, is the issue of Iran,” Woods said. “Marrying a radical regime with weapons of mass destruction is a recipe for disaster.”
As a nonprofit, Georgetown cannot contribute money to any PACs, but it can and does provide resources for students to attend conferences such as the AIPAC conference.
“As a rabbi and director of the Jewish Chaplaincy, perhaps my primary role is to nurture and support the development of Jewish students, Judaism and their Jewish identity,” Rabbi Rachel Gartner said. “And for many of our Jewish students, a relationship with Israel is a core part of that identity. And for some, it is not; the focus of their Judaism is on their American-Jewish experience.”
In the past, Georgetown and the Jewish chaplaincy supported student trips ranging from the Jewish Film Festival and seeing Klezmer at the Kennedy Center to more politically oriented events like theAIPAC conference and the J Street conference.
“My approach to the AIPAC conference, to the J Street conference, is to be supportive of any students who come forward and say, ‘Hey, I want to go, but I don’t have the finances’ or, ‘Hey, I want to go, but I don’t know anybody else who’s going, do you know who’s going?’ So I share information and also support them with resources and subsidies,” Gartner said.
The crowd of 14,000, the largest gathering of America’s pro-Israel community, according to AIPAC’swebsite, consisted of approximately 2,200 college students and included about two-thirds of Congress.
“I’m not a big fan of the term pro-Israel or the term anti-Israel,” Gartner said. “Because I think it oversimplifies the range of ways that people can be pro-Israel and, I’m sure, the range of ways that people can be anti-Israel as well.”

World-renowned photographer and photojournalist Steve McCurry, spoke to students as part of the Lecture Fund’s Arts and Politics Lecture Series in the ICC Auditorium on Wednesday. The event was jointly sponsored by the Lecture Fund, the Office of the Provost, the Center for Social Impact Communication, the Center for Social Justice, Georgetown University Art Aficionados, Asian Studies Department, Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship and the South Asian Society. Michelle Yaw (COL ’15), a Lecture Fund member, introduced McCurry, giving a brief overview of his life and work.
Before the presentation, McCurry held discussion and photography workshops for students who had applied ahead of time. McCurry also sold posters and postcards after his presentation, the proceeds of which went to Imagine Asia, his non-profit that helps provide health and education services to children in Afghanistan.
McCurry is perhaps most famous for his December 1984 National Geographic cover of a young Afghan girl with striking green eyes, in a torn shawl. “
“His work spans political conflict, social issues, cultural diversity, but at the same time the photos retain a very powerful human quality that touches so many people around the world,” Yaw said in her introduction of McCurry.
McCurry first showed a short video featuring some of his photos, as well as a list of his maxims. According to McCurry, passion is what drove him to be a photographer, and his favorite photos are those he is most passionate about.
“One of the most important points that I should remind myself of when doing a story is to look for situations that I passionately care about,” McCurry said. “At the end of the day, the pictures that I care about and that are interesting are pictures of stories that I thought very deeply about.”
He also stressed the importance of being part of the conversation, or using his photos to create change. McCurry spoke specifically about his experience during the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
“Through filmmaking and photography, I thought, this is something I can do with my life;,travel, photograph, document and tell stories around the world,” McCurry said. “Take Sept. 11 as an example. I was in New York and realized this situation is something that we want to remember and is going to be a landmark of world history, and this was something that absolutely I felt I had to be a part of.”
McCurry then showed the audience a selection of his photos in detail, telling short anecdotes about each. He spoke of his travels to countries including India, Burma, Cuba and Afghanistan. One particular anecdote dealt with his most famous picture, “The Afghan Girl.” The photo, which was on the cover of National Geographic, soon became an international phenomenon, and was renamed the “Afghan Mona Lisa.”
“I saw her and she was a little bit shy and reluctantly photographed. … She dropped her hands and I shifted my camera a little bit to the left and I got this picture, which is sort of a once-in-a-lifetime picture,” McCurry said. “The background was perfect and the light was right, and the expression and emotional component were there. There’s a rip in her shawl, and she’s really pretty, but you can see that she’s poor and her face is a bit dirty.”
Karen Zhang (COL ’17), an attendee of the event, enjoyed McCurry’s humor throughout his explanation of his collection.
“I thought it was a very entertaining presentation, and it was refreshing to see how optimistic and humorously he viewed all these major world events and cultural customs,” Zhang said. “I thought he was a very genuine person because he didn’t hesitate to admit that maybe there wasn’t an epic significance of certain photos, but just that something or someone caught his eye and he just wanted a picture of it.”

The Bring on the Books Foundation, founded by Sohayle Sizar (COL ’14), continues to expand beyond the Hilltop as its annual Bring on the Books Drive enters its third year at Georgetown.
Sizar started the nonprofit in 2008 when he noticed that old books at his high school were going to waste — laying unused in storage closets or getting thrown out.
“For me when I was a kid, books were a way to escape the homogeneity of my neighborhood where I didn’t really have that many friends,” Sizar said. “For me, a book … gave its entire existence to me, and I want to share that with other kids.”
Sizar says what started as an instinct to help his beloved books became a passion for sharing literature with children.
Bring on the Books has collected approximately 8,000 children’s books at Georgetown, plus another 75,000 books at other universities across the nation. Offshoot chapters are growing at New York University and at nearby University of Maryland.
Sizar credits Georgetown alumni with bringing the drive to the attention of organizations like Teach for America as well corporations such as Goldman Sachs.
Sizar’s long-term vision — expanding the organization nationally — appears to be well on its way.
However, at Georgetown, just four students manage the organization alongside Sizar: Charlie Long (COL ’15), who will take over the Georgetown chapter when Sizar graduates this spring, Kevin Lo (COL ’16), Jane Song (COL ’14) and Tyler Bridge (COL ’17).
The chapter works with other Georgetown groups and community partners to collect books annually; these books are then donated to Georgetown’s tutoring program, D.C. Reads, and — starting this year — the Family Literacy Project at the Georgetown University Law Center.
The foundation has received support from Students of Georgetown Inc., the Georgetown University Student Association, the Office of the Provost and various other student organizations.
The Corp has used its philanthropy committee to provide the foundation with funds; this year, it will continue to designate its coffee shops as drop-off sites for the Bring on the Books Drive.
According to Sizar, the Office of the Provost has also allied with the organization. Professor James O’Donnell was the acting provost when Bring on the Books came to Georgetown in 2011. O’Donnell continues to support the foundation as a member of the board.
“[I’m] a little bit cheerleader, a little bit mentor, a little bit quality control,” he said.
O’Donnell was attracted to the project’s intellectual priority — to foster literacy in young people — as well as its overarching pragmatism.
“I’ve seen a lot of student organizations, student groups [and] student ideas over the years, and the ones that worked best are the ones that get residents in the community and have resonance for the community, and I think this one can and has,” he said.
Provost Groves also supports Bring on the Books through campus-wide emails, enabling the team to communicate with other members of the university.
Lo, who handles the foundation’s outreach-and-communications initiatives, has enlisted help from several Greek organizations on campus, including the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.
“There should be basically no group on campus that we couldn’t work with,” Lo said.
Lo also hopes to enlist Strive for College during future book-drive efforts.
“A lot of the kids that we’re helping [in Strive for College] kind of came from the same background as those who need them [the books], so it would become ‘do you want to help out, basically, those who will be in your spot later?’” Lo said.
Bring on the Books also works with local businesses and charity organizations, which provide donations to support the foundation’s mission.
“I think the vision is so much more beyond me. … It’s really about sharing the experience with others because it is a right,” Sizar said.
The Bring on the Books Drive takes place March 7 through April 25 this year. Donation sites are available at The Corp’s Midnight MUG, Uncommon Grounds and More Uncommon Grounds locations.

The McDonough School of Business is currently accommodating 40 Latin American leaders for a 12-week Global Competitiveness Leadership Program that began in late January.
The GCL Program was founded in 2007 by Georgetown’s Latin American Board and has hosted around 250 fellows over the past seven years.
According to professor of operations and Global Logistics Research Program Co-Director Ricardo Ernst, the Latin American Board created the program to bring about change in Latin America.
“We came up with the idea that the best way to have an impact on the region was the creation of something that can help with applied leadership,” Ernst said. “In that process, we wanted to find a theme that would be relevant for all countries in the region without favoring one country over another.”
The program’s theme is competitiveness, and each class, activity and excursion is based upon this theme.
“Competitiveness is the best way that countries, companies and individuals can engage in what globalization is currently doing,” Ernst said. “I have this philosophy of globalization, competitiveness and governability being the three elements that actually determine how you should look at this region. The basic premise is that globalization is here to stay, so rather than asking if globalization is good or bad, a more relevant question is how to take advantage of globalization.”
According to Latin American Board Program Coordinator Alexandra Vallina, the admissions team evaluates many different types of candidates.
“There’s no set profile that we look at, because our participants come from the private, public and corporate sectors,” Vallina said. “What we try to do is have 40 young leaders who can bring to the program their expertise and also they can learn from each other and benefit from the program to further their leadership skills [and] their political, economic and public knowledge.”
Accepted applicants receive a $25,000 scholarship from Georgetown to attend the program but must pay an additional $1,250 of their own money. Once at the program, the 40 participants live, attend classes and tour Washington, D.C., together for 12 weeks.
Michelle Sopper, a lawyer from Brazil who is participating in the GCL Program, said that she values this closeness with her colleagues.
“There are so many people that I would never get the chance to meet and to relate to and to exchange ideas, so I’m definitely having a more broad awareness of my region,” Sopper said. “Latin America before was something very ethereal, something that I couldn’t relate to, and now I can. When I hear something is going on in Venezuela, I feel very much closer.”
The participants take business classes each day from Georgetown professors as well as guest speakers. The classes focus on four pillars: business leadership, political leadership, nonprofit leadership and personal leadership. According to the GCL Program website, content for classes includes leadership ethics and values, foundations for democracy, public policy administration, project management, civil society and civic participation, as well as many others.
“We have very broad subject classes, from democracy to business classes, and we have team-building activities and a case competition that we had last week,” Sopper said. “It’s very challenging. We learn a lot and it’s been very interesting for me to dream a little more about what life can be and about what you can accomplish.”
In addition, the students visit various D.C. political landmarks and institutions and speak to professionals at each location to get a better sense of American policies towards their region.
“It’s important to know that it’s not just a cultural thing,” Ernst said. “When they go to the Pentagon, they talk to the person in charge of defining the strategy for the region, so the idea is for them to understand the reality of the U.S. and to understand how a system operates.”
After the program, each participant is required to return to his or her country and implement a project there to improve the country in some way. According to Vallina, this project is meant to bring new ideas to the region so that they can grow and develop over time.
“By having [just] 40 participants every year, we know that the scale of the impact that we want to have is not going to be big in scope, so what we hope to have is have participants come, then go back to their countries to implement their projects and have a multiplier effect,” Vallina said. “That way, we can help out the region and change the dynamics and the situation.”
Sopper is pairing with another program participant from Mexico to create an app that encourages civic participation.
“We’re trying to develop a platform, most likely [a] mobile platform or application,” Sopper said. “Our dream is to draw people out of political apathy and make people engage themselves more in politics, even if it’s just to elect someone better or more consciously in the next election, but we’re hoping for more.”
Vallina said that each participant has great potential to make a change in Latin America.
“They’re very energetic and very passionate,” Vallina said. “They’re innovators in their fields, and they’re looking forward to strengthening the region, to form a strong network among each other and to come here to Georgetown to acquire all the skills necessary to become better leaders and to make the Latin American region better.”

Dennis P. Lockhart, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, gave the annual Tanous Family Endowed Lecture on Thursday in Lohrfink Auditorium, assessing the current economic situation and discussing the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.
Lockhart’s talk became the second lecture supported by the Tanous Family Endowed Lecture Fund, established by Peter Tanous (COL ’60) for Lauinger Library’s 40th anniversary in 2010. The inaugural Tanous Lecture was given by TV host Chris Matthews in October 2012.
Head librarian Artemis Kirk introduced the event, which was hosted by the Library Associates, and the speaker.
Lockhart, who is a member of the Federal Reserve’s chief monetary policy body and Federal Open Market Committee, currently is responsible for bank activities, including monetary policy, supervision, regulation, and payment services.
Lockhart opened by briefly discussing his connection to Georgetown: Lockhart taught at the School of Foreign Service’s graduate program from 2003 to 2007, and his daughter and son-in-law also attended the university.
He then transitioned to the primary focus of his lecture, which was the challenge of estimating full employment and its implications for monetary policy. He clarified the context for his remarks at the beginning of his talk.
“You’re hearing my personal views. I’m not speaking for the Federal Reserve,” he said.
Beginning with an assessment of current economic conditions, he remarked that, though economic growth had been slow for four years, the United States had entered 2014 with optimism, only to see weak economic indicators in the first few months. He attributed this problem to weather.
“My research staff estimates that real gross domestic product growth in the first quarter may have been reduced by three-quarters of a percentage point due to bad weather.”
These mixed economic indicators, Lockhart indicated, were not significant causes for concern, and he continued to hold out hope for growth in the second half.
“In my view, the economy’s fundamentals are stronger, and the headwinds that have buffeted the economy and restrained growth are weaker.”
Lockhart moved, then, to a discussion of the appropriateness of the current policy, pointing to recent tapering of the Fed’s quantitative easing program and continued low interest rates.
“The policy rate has been as low as it effectively can go for more than five years,” he said. “So, in spite of the phasing out of asset purchases, the intended overall position of policy, in Fed-speak, is ‘highly accommodating,’ and I think this is appropriate and needed.”
Identifying the timing of the increase in interest rates as the major concern for the public, Lockhart explained that the decision would be governed by the status of inflation and employment, and focused the rest of his talk on employment.
He pointed to the current unemployment rate of 6.6 percent as positive, but criticized it for overstating the health of the economy because of less participation in the labor force.
“Discouragement over job prospects rose during the Great Recession, causing many unemployed people to drop out of the labor force and others not to enter the labor force. People make a participation choice,” Lockhart said.
Summarizing his talk, Lockhart, while expressing belief in the resurgence of the economy, urged for a continuation of the current policy to ensure the economy’s future status.
“Even with the progress made today, a careful evaluation of the employment situation suggests to me that full employment is still a ways off, and continued monetary accommodation is necessary,” he said
Around 75 people attended the event, and those who attended were appreciative of the speaker’s clarity of thought and presentation.
“He speaks just like a central banker would, very measured in all his words; he has to be extremely careful that he doesn’t say something out of line, but central bankers have a very clear way of looking at the economy, very data-driven, and he gave a good outlook of what’s to come,” Christopher Stromeyer (SFS ’14) said.
The content of the lecture also proved applicable to material studied by college students.
“We’re going through money and banking right now in my Intermediate Economics class,” Freddy Rosas (COL ’15) said. “I enjoyed this lecture because I got so much out of it that I can use to understand what inflation and unemployment mean to the economy and Federal Reserve operations.”

Alexander Libman, an assistant professor of international political economy at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, visited Georgetown to discuss his upcoming paper on autocratic cooperation in post-Soviet countries on Wednesday.
His paper, entitled “Autocratic Cooperation and Eurasian Regionalism,” elaborates on research indicating that the autocratic governments in the former Soviet Bloc have failed to achieve economic integration and cooperation since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Even after signing progressive agreements, autocratic countries often fail to comply.
“Most post-Soviet countries are either autocratic, consolidated autocracies or hybrid regimes at best with very strong autocratic tendencies,” Libman said. “And we have a large literature… which tells us non-democracies — autocracies — should be less likely to really cooperate.”
Libman noted that while democracies sometimes fail to comply with their agreements, certain inherent factors of autocratic governments make noncompliance more frequent.
Libman used historical research to identify two basic problems with autocratic regimes.
“The first one is credibility of commitments,” Libman said. “Once you sign an international agreement, it makes sense for you to comply only if everybody complies…and with non-democracies you can never be sure if they’re going to comply or not, because they are relatively unconstrained… [and] they’re not subject to the pressure of the public.”
The second problem is that nondemocratic governments generally tend to shy away from legislation that restricts their power.
“For many non-democracies, having absolute control over any political, any economic decision is the key of how they survive,” Libman said.
Building upon this premise, Libman and his coauthor, Director of the Centre for Integration Studies at the Eurasian Development Bank Evgeny Vinokurov, aimed to outline the situations in which post-Soviet countries will likely comply with economic agreements.
“What this project tries to do is to understand how can it be that under certain conditions autocracies actually cooperate, and cooperation will mean here compliance with their economic agreements,” Libman said.
Libman outlined the four factors that countries consider before deciding to enter an agreement. These include an increase in public goods that economically benefit all citizens, the availability of private goods like national resources that are sold to increase the autocrat’s wealth, costs of implementation and exit costs.
“Autocracies are much more likely to focus on private goods than on public goods. For obvious reasons, they have lower demands to satisfy the population,” Libman said. “The second problem is they have much higher risks of losing power. If you stop being president in the U.S., you go on and write memoirs or lecture at the university, and you lead a good life, but … the risks [for autocratic leaders are] quite high.”
An audience of around ten people, consisting mostly of graduate students and Foreign Service specialists, attended Libman’s talk. Harley Balzer, associate professor of government and international affairs as well as the former director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown, moderated a question-and-answer session following the talk. Balzer mentioned that the discussion about the former Soviet Bloc is especially relevant considering current tensions in the Crimean region of Ukraine.
“One of the questions that had come up prior to recent events in Ukraine was Ukraine joining the Customs Union. And some people even suggested that the $15 billion economic support package was kind of a bribe to convince them to join the Customs Union and not the partnership agreement with the European Union,” Balzer said.
Benjamin Loring, the associate director for the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies, attended the event and noted the relevance of the topic.
“There’s the general importance of thinking about these issues for foreign policy, for U.S. policy in the region, and that is to understand why countries are coming into unions [alongside democratic states],” Loring said.
Libman’s talk has special relevance for current events in Ukraine. According to Libman, Ukraine will not be joining the Customs Union due to its supranational nature, although joining the European Union is a possibility.
“If countries are well-integrated with each other, and are respecting each other’s borders and they feel like they can trade easily, then there won’t be these sorts of issues,” Loring said. “Russia and Ukraine, if they were able to … be in an association like this, or be in something like the EU all together, then there wouldn’t be this sort of conflict.”

The Georgetown University Student Association Finance and Appropriations Committee released a budget draft Thursday for student organizations looking to receive funding from GUSA in the coming fiscal year.
The Division of Student Affairs had previously agreed to fund all student advocacy boards with 27.5 percent of the Division of Student Affairs’ overall budget. The remaining 72.5 percent will be funded through GUSA’s budget of $998,400 for the 2015 fiscal year, according to GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Seamus Guerin (COL ’16).
The committee released the budget draft after hearing the final presentation from GUSA executive-elects Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15). Appeals to the budget are open until March 19 when a final budget will be released.
GUSA’s budget comes from a $150 student activity fee that each student pays, which is included in tuition. The total comes to around $1 million each year, which FinApp divides between student groups.
According to Guerin, the new allocation system was decided upon after problems with the previous system, in which several groups had control over how much funding student groups received, and funding was not distributed as proportionally.
“The problem was created then between the advisory boards, the Finance and Appropriations Committee and the Division of Student Affairs, so the relationship between the three [groups] and between any two actors was unsure at times,” Guerin said.
According to Guerin, the FinApp advocated for the change for the sake of clarity and equality.
Previously, advocacy boards received drastically different dollar amounts and proportional funding from Student Affairs. The Georgetown Program Board was previously allocated up to 50 percent of the GUSA budget, while the Advisory Board for Club Sports received only 3 percent. This year’s proposal apportions $125,000 to GPD and $170,000 to ABCS.
The new system places the vast majority of funding for all advocacy boards in the hands of the FinApp, a move Guerin said will improve the student funding dynamic.
“To have student voices being heard throughout the process, I think, is enriching for the FinApp. I think it’s enriching for the students who are presenting; I think everybody learns something along the way,” Guerin said. A presentation in front of the FinApp does not guarantee funding, according to Guerin.
The dollar amounts that Student Affairs allocated for each student advisory board had not been changed or re-evaluated in years, according to Assistant Dean for Student Engagement Erika Cohen-Derr. The effectiveness of the new proportional system will be evaluated at the end of the next fiscal year and, proceeding, at two-year intervals.
The Georgetown University Lecture Fund, which seeks funding independently of any advisory board, is not subject to the Division of Student Affairs’ funding decisions.
According to Lecture Fund Executive Board Chair Chris Mulrooney (COL ’14), the student group requested more money than in previous years past because of an increase in speaker events.
“It has been increasingly hard for the Lecture Fund to work within our budget constraints given the level of student programming taking place on campus,” Mulrooney wrote in an email. “We’ve only been able to provide just under 50 percent of the funds requested from us due to an increased number of campus organizations submitting event proposals to the Lecture Fund.”
The Lecture Fund received $72,000 in funding.
The Georgetown Day Planning Committee also presented to the Finance and Appropriations Committee for the first time this year in order to bypass the arduous process of appealing to each advisory board for funding, but it will not receive a 27.5 percent share from Student Affairs.
The student group requested $20,000 from GUSA, equivalent to funds the group usually receives by advocating to each advisory board, receiving $16,900.
“It’s essentially the same money, just a roundabout way of getting it. … We’ll continue with our model of going from department to department asking for money, it just takes off a little bit of the burden by getting all of the advisory boards in one fell swoop,” Georgetown Day Planning Committee Chair Andi DeBellis (MSB ’14) said.
DeBellis did not anticipate impediments in procuring funding comparable to previous years from the Division of Student Affairs.
“It’s [Georgetown Day is] a very established day,” DeBellis said. “It’s not very logical why funding wasn’t established in the past because everybody expects year after year Georgetown Day to occur.”
The budget proposal also allows for $1,000 in discretionary funds for the GUSA executive and $2,000 in reserve funds. The GUSA General Fund, which featured prominently into GUSA candidates’ budgets, had a proposed allocation of $21,000.

After months of negotiations and redesigns, the university’s Northeast Triangle Residence Hall was awarded final concept approval by the Old Georgetown Board at its monthly meeting Thursday.
“We’re feeling very good about the direction the project is taking, so we have taken action to approve conceptual design,” OGB member David Cox said.
The meeting, held at the National Building Museum, was attended by several Georgetown representatives including Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey and architects representing Sasaki Associates, the architecture firm that designed the Northeast Triangle.
Since the university announced plans to construct a new dormitory July 5, the Northeast Triangle project has been beset with roadblocks. Original concept designs for the residence hall were reworked after concerns were raised by students and alumni about the design’s perceived architectural incoherence with respect to other university buildings. While the design received approval from the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E in November, architects went back to the drawing board to win the approval of the Old Georgetown Board, and the project was forced to push back its scheduled completion date from fall 2015 to fall 2016.
Georgetown University Student Association Director of Student Space Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), who served on the Northeast Triangle Planning Committee, expressed excitement that, with approval, students would soon be able to see more tangible aspects of the residence hall taking shape.
“I really think it’s an exciting and imporant step in the project,” Appelbaum said. “It’s definitely a big change we’ve seen from the initial concepts over the summer. I think it’s really exciting to see things progressing and moving forward, and I think it means that people are going to start seeing more realities of the project starting to pop up.
The university won the OGB’s approval after changing the design for the residence hall based on input received from the board. The OGB had previously approved the proposed dorm’s height, massing and siting at its meeting Dec. 5.
“We’ve continued our efforts in refining the design, integrating the feedback from the larger community and we have received what we consider significant, enthusiastic support from the larger community as well as our main clients, the student body,” Morey said in an interview with The Hoya.
The new dorm, which will house approximately 225 students in accordance with the 2010 Campus Plan agreement, will feature suite-style housing primarily for sophomore students, similar to Copley Hall.
Throughout the most recent stages of the design process, architects worked to incorporate the suggestions of the OGB without straying from the initial design concept released in June.
“We felt our team had done a good job of integrating the comments from the OGB while still respecting many of the primary tenants that students wanted to see in the building. There’s a fine balancing act there and I think that … we were successful in trying to balance all of this competing interest,” Morey said.
Although they granted concept approval, OGB members still had objections to certain aspects of the Northeast Triangle’s design.
After previous feedback suggested that the design did not address heavy foot traffic on the south side of the building, Sasaki Associates added a new primary entrance on the south side of the residence hall that will lead into a large open social space on the ground floor.
Cox said he thought that the design for this entrance could still be improved upon.
“At the south entry, you don’t have enough depth. It’s like you came to it late and it hasn’t yet taken on a stake in your minds as important,” Cox said.
The final concept also featured a facade that was altered to incorporate elements of stone, brick and glass that are reminiscent of the stone buildings surrounding Healy Lawn and the brick buildings like Henle Village on the north side of campus, after being contested by OGB members in December.
A second cause of concern was the varying sizes of windows throughout the building. In the current design, the windows vary in width, which OGB member H. Alan Brangman likened to the design of a prison.
“I’m struggling to understand the rationale behind the window configuration,” Brangman said. “As windows start to get slimmer, it starts to become reminiscent of another type of residence.”
Architects said they incorporated the window design scheme in order to maintain a high quality of natural light in the building as well as enhance the appearance of the building.
“There was a sense that there was a certain monotony to the standard repetition of the windows,” Sasaki architect Vinicius Gorgati said.
OGB members also criticized a lack of continuity between the pavement that will surround the new residence hall and those that are present already throughout campus. Architects proposed using water-resistant — or non-pervious — asphalt pavement around the Northeast Triangle to allow emergency vehicles to drive in that area.
“You’re leaving Red Square, which is all brick, and that whole sidewalk that goes behind Reiss [Science Building] is all brick, and then you transition to asphalt for this new walkway. … It doesn’t make a lot of sense that you wouldn’t want to tie this in,” Brangman said.
On March 20, the university will seek concept approval from the Commission of Fine Arts, which oversees the OGB. According to Morey, approval is anticipated.
“It’s not likely that [the Commission of Fine Arts] would overturn what the OGB does,” Morey said.
The D.C. Zoning Commission indicated that it would also issue approval after the OGB released its decision.
After receiving final concept approval, architects will continue to refine the design for the residence hall and make changes to the building based on OGB’s comments, focusing mainly on details, such as selecting the exact materials for the building. The university will seek design development approval from the OGB in May at which point it will be eligible to apply for a building permit. Construction is expected to last anywhere from 14 to 20 months.
“This allows us to really focus our resources. We know we have the concept and where we’re going with the concept, so we can further refine and design as is. We’re not going to have to do any redesign,” Morey said.
Construction of the new dorm is slated to begin in late spring or summer 2014, alongside renovations to Lauinger Library and the construction of the John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletic Center, and is scheduled to be completed by fall 2016.
An earlier version of this post used an outdated design of Northeast Triangle. The photo is now up to date with a February 2014 concept.

Possession and private use of marijuana will no longer be treated as a criminal offense in D.C. for individuals over 21 under a bill passed by the D.C. Council with a vote of 10 to one Tuesday, pending approval by Mayor Vincent Gray and Congress.
The bill will reduce the sentence for possession of an ounce or less of marijuana from a criminal offense of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine to a civil offense with a fine of $25; reduce the sentence for smoking marijuana in public from up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine to 60 days in jail; and disallow police from detaining, frisking, searching and arresting individuals based on possession of less than an ounce of marijuana or just on the smell of marijuana.
According to Grant Smith, policy manager for the pro-legalization Drug Policy Alliance, decriminalization of marijuana possession should result in fewer arrests across the District, thus saving taxpayer dollars and reducing the number of youths with arrest records.
“Our view is that marijuana should be taxed and regulated like alcohol and should be available for adults, with proper regulations and with restrictions in place,” Smith said.
Legislative Counsel K.J. Bagchi, who spoke on behalf of Councilmember Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), emphasized Graham’s support for the bill as a way to provide aid for youths struggling with substance abuse. “[Graham] understands that his focus has always been about better substance abuse treatment, and to have a system where we say, ‘Hey look, we’re going to decriminalize the use of marijuana ’” Bagchi said.
According to a 2013 report issued by the American Civil Liberties Union, D.C. touts more marijuana arrests than any U.S. state, reaching 846 arrests per 100,000 residents in 2010, a marked increase from the national average of 256 arrests per 100,000 in the same year.
D.C. marijuana arrest records also reveal a high degree of racial disparity. According to a report by the Washington Lawyers Committee, 91 percent of drug arrests made from 2009 to 2011 in D.C. were of blacks. Eighty-seven percent of blacks in D.C. live in Wards 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, which is where seven out of 10 marijuana arrests were made.
Even though a much higher percentage of blacks are arrested for marijuana possession than whites, blacks and whites report using marijuana about equally. According to the ACLU report, in 2010, 14 percent of blacks and 12 percent of whites had admitted to using marijuana in the past year.
“Those two reports actually are what really served as impetus for this legislation to move through the council,” Smith said.
Councilmember Tommy Wells (D- Ward 6) agreed that the racial disparities in these two reports were important factors in getting this bill passed. He said that he hopes the bill’s emphasis on social justice will help it advance through Congress.
“But with Congress sitting on our shoulder, I’m crossing my fingers to see if I can get decriminalization through. I feel like I’ve handled it in a way that I’ve made it about social justice, instead of a right to smoke pot,” Wells said in an interview with The Hoya’s editorial board regarding his mayoral candidacy.
As lead sponsor of the bill, Wells also voiced his support for the legislation as a means of curbing the racial inequality of marijuana arrests.
“This bill is a tremendous stride to end the disproportionate impact of marijuana arrests that keep our residents from jobs, higher education and housing opportunities. The evidence of racial disparities in arrests and the failures of the war on drugs are undeniable and the negative socioeconomic impacts on African American residents are indisputable,” Wells said in a press release. The legislation enjoyed nearly full support from the D.C. Council, as Councilmember Yvette Alexander (D-Ward 7) was the only member to vote against the legislation.
“There will not be any reduction in the amount of arrests because there will still be arrests when someone is smoking marijuana on the corner or when someone is selling marijuana on the corner,” Alexander told The Washington Post.
The D.C. Council chose not to take the opportunity to decriminalize public use of marijuana, sale of marijuana or possession of over an ounce of the drug in their ruling Tuesday. Grant agreed with Alexander that, until these three offenses are decriminalized, arrests will continue to happen.
“All three of these things are going to continue to drive an underground economy, an illegal underground economy, that’s going to continue to result in arrests, convictions, life-long records for people in D.C., and it runs contrary to what D.C. residents want, and that is a legal tax and regulated market for adults to buy marijuana, similar to what we’ve seen in Colorado and Washington,” Grant said.
The legislation, once signed by Gray, who expressed his intent to sign the bill, will go through Congress for a 60-day review period. Only three bills since 1979 have been rejected at this stage.

Already nicknamed “Francis the Frugal” by international media in the 11 months since his elevation to the papacy, Pope Francis has influenced global political thinking and prompted interfaith conversation within the Georgetown community.
Born Jorge Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1936, Francis became the first South American as well as the first Jesuit priest to hold the position of pope when he was chosen March 13, 2013.
Pope Francis’ influence on the American political dialogue has been especially visible in his increased emphasis on legislation regarding poverty, according to Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J.
“Some people who have been talking about poverty and inequality for a long time have been vindicated by Pope Francis. Other people have been challenged,” Carnes said. “Poverty seems to be something that everyone seems to be on the same side on. That’s a remarkable change.”
Professor of ethics and global development Fr. Drew Christiansen, S.J., concurred, noting Francis’ seamless ability to transcend the religious realm and enter the political.
“World leaders need a way to express their conviction in a way that takes hold. Moral authority in this world is very fragmented, and politicians have lots of competition for attention from other politicians and from the media and entertainment. The pope seems to gather attention the way few others have done, and so he has such a decisive impact that politicians want to go to him,” Christiansen said.
Carnes, an assistant professor of government at Georgetown, has observed Francis’ rhetoric affecting dialogue in his classrooms.
“I think he’s opened [students’] eyes and given them a chance to look at the Church again and understand it in a new way. I think people actually find a hope in Francis, a reason to open up and maybe believe,” Carnes said.
Patrick Denenea (COL ’17), who is Catholic, said he has seen a notable influence outside of the classroom as well.
“I definitely think that his teachings and actions have noticeably influenced how Catholics at Georgetown describe their own faith with each other and with others. Francis’ example is often turned to in homilies and spiritual discussions. I’ve also heard a lot of, ‘I’m not Catholic, but I really like your new pope,’” Denenea said.
Outside Guard for the Knights of Columbus Pat Brookhouser (SFS ’15) credited Francis’ positive influence on the Catholic community to his Jesuit roots.
“I’d say that Francis has been a great blessing for the Church. He has lived out what he said upon the announcement of his election; he has shown that the Church is not just another [nongovernmental organization]. Ultimately I think it goes back to his Jesuit formation where he experienced Christ’s infinite redemptive love and was set ablaze with the desire to proclaim that love in deed and word to the entire world,” Brookhouser said.
According to Carnes, whose research focuses on Latin America, Francis’ Latin American origins have also had a significant influence on his papal agenda.
“Historically, Latin America has the highest degree of income inequality in the world. In the pope’s experience, he regularly saw the wide wealth disparity between the poor who were living in what Argentinians call villas miserias and the big city, and these are often within a hundred yards of each other,” Carnes said.
Liberation theology, a Catholic movement that interprets Catholic teachings in relation to the poor’s suffering, has also played a decisive role in Francis’ actions as pope. Liberation theology gained popularity in Latin America throughout the 1950s and 1960s.
“You can know a man by his friends. A lot of his friends — theologically, socially and otherwise — are people who embraced a critical version of liberation theology — not the first raw versions that were more Marxist than they were Gospel, but the second-generation thinkers that took what was best with those movements and combined them with the love of Jesus,” Program for Jewish Civilization professor Fr. Dennis McManus said.
McManus said Francis has clearly demonstrated Jesuit philosophy in the way he has presented himself.
“The Jesuit way is the way he integrates everything in his life; it is the key to everything. He says, ‘I’m human, I’m imperfect, I love people, I try hard, but it’s really God who’s looked on me in my misery and lifts me up.’ That’s Jesuit life,” McManus said.
In contrast to his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI, Francis has placed an emphasis on using his personal instinct in the papacy — leading many to categorize him as more radical.
“Pope Francis’ mind works in a pastoral rather than an academic way. Pope Francis is trained in theology like any bishop, but he operates intuitively with people. Because he sees things through the heart, his answers are often radical compared to Western political thinking,” McManus said.
Christiansen agreed.
“He’s speaks out so strongly and does it so vividly that it’s out there in a way that has a lot of conviction. It’s no longer a teaching. It’s the pope expressing his deepest convictions,” Christiansen said.
Carnes pointed out that while Francis’ rhetoric about poverty is no different from that of his predecessors, he has managed to bring more attention to this rhetoric by backing it up with action.
“You understand Francis’ concern for the poor not just because of the words he says, but because you see him walking into the favela or the poorer areas of Rome. You see it and it gets you in the gut. The words are similar, but the gestures mean a lot, too.”
Francis’ reach is not limited to those within the Catholic faith. Muslim Students Association President Erva Khan (NHS ’15) applauded the pope for his promotion of interfaith dialogue and cultivation of Catholic-Muslim relations.
“As a Muslim, I commend Pope Francis for the work he has done, especially in terms of promotion of conflict resolution and interfaith understanding. I look forward to seeing the progress made by Pope Francis and the Church in the coming years, and I have high hopes that there will be great strides in Muslim-Christian understanding,” Khan said.
Secular Student Alliance Member Nicolò Donà dalle Rose (SFS ’15) echoed support for the pope’s social-justice-motivated rhetoric.
“I’m very curious to see what he will do. I think he’s changed the conversation. There’s a more open-minded approach to a lot of social justice issues,” Rose said.
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Fr. Dennis McManus as a Jesuit.

Nick:
Thanks for this wonderful article. May I ask if one small error might be corrected? Since I am not a Jesuit, the initials “S.J.” should be removed from after my name. 
Again, thanks for quite a well written piece. Much appreciated. 
Fr. Dennis McManus

Since Feb. 1, D.C. Alert has issued 27 hypothermia alerts urging residents to stay indoors. For the approximately 7,000 individuals that make up D.C.’s homeless population, this past winter has been unforgiving.
As one of the few cities in the United States with a right-to-shelter policy in place on freezing nights, D.C. has turned to alternate forms of shelter, including churches and community centers, to house its increasingly large homeless population has seen a 135 percent increase this winter, among other reasons, because of a sharp decrease in the District’s affordable housing units.
“People are more aware of the large homeless population just because it’s been so brutally cold. … It’s the coldest winter in more than 20 years,” said Gunther Stern, executive director of the Georgetown Ministry Center, which operates a homeless shelter from November to March.
In response to the overflow, Mayor Vincent Gray’s administration has resorted to renting motel rooms in the District and nearby Maryland to accommodate the overflow of homeless individuals.
Sarah Baran (COL ’14), a program assistant at the GMC founded in 1987 by the university in partnership with the Georgetown Clergy Association, has noticed an increase in homeless people coming into the shelter this winter.
“They are getting more people because it’s been so cold and because of the snow. It’s been hard on them to get more resources and accommodate the increased number,” Baran said.
James Gadea (SFS ’16), a coordinator with the Mobile Soup Kitchen, which takes soup and other foods to parks in D.C., has also noticed an increase in the District’s homeless population in recent months.
“Franklin Park is completely full on the weekends,” Gadea said. “All kinds of people come. It’s not just the homeless people that you would expect to see. There are people in suits there that come and get food as well. … The diversity of the homeless population and the number specifically at Franklin Park is tremendous.”
D.C.’s homeless population has seen a 9.3 percent increase since 2008 to 7,000 individuals, a number not seen since the 1980s, according to the Washington Post. About half of this population receives absolutely no income, according to the nonprofit organization Thrive D.C.
With the Democratic mayoral primary April 1, the issue of homelessness has been a more than frequent buzzword for D.C. politicians in recent weeks. Former events promoter and longshot mayoral candidate Carlos Allen outlined the importance of incorporating compassion into the city’s homeless agenda in a mayoral debate Feb. 26.
“I was homeless once in this city. I know what it’s like to get back on your feet. What is missing is communication between the city and those people out on the street to let them know that there are resources available to help them move forward in their lives. It’s all about bringing compassion back to this city,” Allen said.
Local politician Carolyn Cook had a different suggestion.
Cook, a commissioner for the Advisory Neighborhood Commission in Ward 4, urged the government to develop a program providing seasonal jobs like raking leaves or shoveling snow as a source of income for the homeless but received little response last year.
“It would be great for the District government to consider a plan like hiring seasonal employees. They are putting people who might be long-term unemployed into jobs,” Cook said. “They have sort of fallen through the cracks not having a home or stability in their lives with not having an income.”
The proposal was inspired by a conversation Cook overheard at a local community center for the elderly where neighbors were discussing the difficulty and danger of shoveling their own sidewalks, which is required under D.C. law. Cook also interacted with homeless people looking for warmth at the community center and seized upon the opportunity to simultaneously help both populations in need.
“The District needs to weigh at what point are people trying to increase revenue [through fines] versus putting people’s lives in danger,” Cook said. “It would be great to hire homeless people to earn some money, feel like they are contributing and see the results of their efforts.”
According to Stern, Cook’s proposal was not new to the District.
“A lot of homeless people, when it snows, head out and offer to shovel people’s homes for money,” Stern said. “They know there is a need for help and they can earn extra money.”
Cook expressed concern that resources are concentrated in certain areas of the District, leaving certain populations of homeless groups marginalized.
“We are focused on putting out the fires on the ones that need far more support than the system can provide,” Cook said. “Homeless in upper northwest, for example, have decided the homeless shelters are scary and overcrowded. For those folks, they have decided they don’t want to seek shelter, even when it’s super cold outside.”
According to Baran, Georgetown has an imperative to help the District’s homeless.
“Georgetown should do more in terms of homeless outreach. I know that the bookstore donated leftover clothes, and there are other ways like that to help out. We need partnerships to be formed and a call to action,” Baran said.

While the issue may not garner much attention from candidates and the media on the campaign trial, the epidemic of HIV in the District of Columbia is a crisis that will need to be addressed by whomever is elected the city’s next mayor come November.
According to Michael Kharfen, Senior Deputy Director of the D.C. Department of Health HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Tuberculosis Administration, about 2.4 percent of the District’s population, or over 15,000 individuals, is currently living with HIV. This is four times the national prevalence rate of 0.6 percent for the disease, according to 2011 data from the Centers for Disease Control.
“We have a significant epidemic in the District of Columbia, which is what the World Health Organization defines as any disease that affects more than one percent of a city’s population,” Kharfen said.
D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray, who is facing a crowded field in the April 1 Democratic mayoral primary, appointed Kharfen to head HAHSTA in July 2013. During Kharfen’s tenure, D.C. government has focused on expanding access to treatment for HIV, as well continuing to develop and market the city’s condom distribution program, which, according to Kharfen, is one of the most aggressive in the nation.
“Condoms are the only devices that we know of that do effectively prevent HIV. We distributed nearly seven million condoms in 2013. That’s more per capita than any city in the United States,” Kharfen said.
But Gray’s challengers, like Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), were quick to tout their own roles in the implementation of recent HIV prevention programs in the District.
“Many successful tools now used to fight this epidemic — from condom availability to needle exchange programs, medical marijuana, patient safeguards — exist because Jack worked for years with community leaders on these efforts to make them a reality,” Evans’ Communications Director Jermaine House said.
Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) called for a continuation of these programs, but also a more targeted focus on certain communities affected by HIV in the District, in a 2012 questionnaire issued by the Gay and Lesbian Activists Alliance of Washington, D.C.
“HAHSTA has implemented an award-winning social marketing and community based prevention campaign that focuses on HIV testing, condom education and distribution and accelerated treatment. Clearly there needs to be more intensive focus on transgender, Latino, youth and MSM (men who have sex with men) populations,” Bowser said.
Kharfen reiterated the importance of greater outreach to the younger generation — especially the 20 to 29 year old demographic among whom the HIV transmission rate in 2010 was one percent — but said the city’s more generalized approach is better suited to address the epidemic District-wide.
“HIV is a condition that doesn’t make choices regarding who, what that person’s race or ethnicity is, what their age is, their gender or where they live. HIV affects everyone in the District,” Kharfen said. “However, reaching that 20-29 year old age group is a difficult task. That’s why we’re looking at different social media strategies and new ways to engage young people in this effort.”
Jack Pfeiffer, Communications Director for mayoral candidate Councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), pointed to various initiatives Wells has worked on as evidence of his commitment to achieving the city’s goal of reducing new HIV cases as much as possible.
“Councilmember Wells has supported and worked on several bills to address HIV and AIDS in the District since he was elected to the Council, including the Effi Barry HIV/AIDS Program and various other bills during his time on the Council,” Pfeiffer said, referencing a program that aims to harness various community organizations such as churches and other groups in a more effective response to the epidemic.
John Kraemer (LAW ’08), assistant professor in the School of Nursing & Health Studies’ department of health systems administration, praised the city’s heightened approach to combatting HIV, though he acknowledged that the preexisting high prevalence rates from before the city increased its efforts to combat the disease have made prevention more difficult.
“D.C. is obviously way behind the 8-ball because prevalence rates are so high here. For so long the response was challenged, so that now it’s trying to dig itself out of a pretty big hole, but I think the city is doing things in a sensible way,” Kraemer said.
While lauding D.C.’s condom distribution program, which has over 140 sites in the District, Kraemer emphasized that the initiative must be coupled with an aggressive behavioral campaign if the city wants to maximize its effectiveness.
“If you want people not to get HIV, you have to make it easy for them to get condoms. Period. Having condoms is necessary, but not sufficient. You have to have good behavioral campaigns, you have to empower people to be in the position to bargain for condoms in sexual relationships,” Kramer said.
While candidates agreed that progress has been made, the consensus was that much more work has to be done to curb the HIV epidemic that has plagued the District for decades.
“We still have around 700 new cases of HIV in the District each year, and that is still 700 more cases than we would like to see,” Kharfen said.
The Democratic primary for D.C. mayor will be held on April 1, giving candidates less than a month to make their final pushes to earn a spot on the November general election ballot.
