Georgetown University students and graduates from the Georgetown Scholars Program have condemned a university decision to relocate the program’s office, raising concerns over accessibility and visibility.
Leaders of GSP, a program that provides support for first-generation, low-income students, were informed in January that the group was being moved from its original location in Healy Hall, Georgetown’s most recognizable building on campus, to a temporary office in the Leavey Center. Students were only made aware of the move Aug. 13, according to an email to GSP students obtained by The Hoya.
In response to the move, students began circulating a Change.org petition Aug. 30, calling on the university to reconsider its decision. As of Sept. 1, the petition had amassed almost 900 signatures.
GSP’s relocation comes as part of the university’s larger plans to consolidate the Office of Student Equity and Inclusion, which houses Georgetown programs and groups including GSP, the Women’s Center, the LGBTQ Resource Center, the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access and the Community Scholars Program, into a single location in New South basement office spaces. The relocation plan was delayed, however, after a structural engineer found structural concerns with the basement offices.
Consolidating multicultural programs on campus into a single space will be detrimental to the well-being of the students the groups serve, according to GSP student and former GUSA Senator Sheila Cruz-Morales (COL ’23).
“It’s very clear that Georgetown is just putting all the multicultural groups on campus in one small basement and clumping together, not celebrating, the difference and diverse identities that we all hold, and just kind of kicking us really to the curb, if we’re gonna be honest,” Cruz-Morales said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I don’t think this would be happening to other clubs that are as prestigious.” 
The university intends to improve student access to resources offered by groups within the OSEI through the consolidation, according to a university spokesperson.
“We are engaged in a process to determine how our campus spaces and resources can be optimized to serve students,” the spokesperson wrote. “We hear the concerns being raised as we work to bring together the student resource centers affiliated with the Office of Student Equity and Inclusion.” 
Yet, students like Jasia Smith (SFS ’22), a member of the GSP Student Board, are angry. 
“Our move out of Healy has been a sort of symbolic and emotional punch in the gut,” Smith wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The news is uniquely distressing considering the instability that GSPers have disproportionately confronted since the beginning of the pandemic. After a year and a half of remote learning, it’s daunting and overwhelming to come back without a permanent physical space.”
GSP, which was founded in 2004, was located in Healy Hall for years. The program is not funded by the university but instead relies on donations to sustain its operations.
For GSP student and former GUSA Senate Speaker Melanie Cruz-Morales (COL ’23), moving the program from Healy Hall and into a lesser-known building erases first-generation, low-income students’ presence on campus.
“When you put GSP students into a space that is not to the level of what Healy symbolizes, it’s just very evident that our presence is being disregarded, disrespected and just being taken away,” Cruz-Morales said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “A lot of freshmen will be coming on campus this semester. I think it will bring a lot of disillusionment and lack of community and lack of space that these students need.” 
In addition to decreasing first-generation, low-income students’ visibility, the new office location will make it logistically harder for students to access GSP resources and interact with members of the community, according to GSP graduate Rashawn Davis (COL ’14).
“Having GSP right in the center of campus I think is just incredibly accessible. I remember my freshman year and sophomore year, trying to find GSP there wasn’t an issue because we knew it was at the bottom of Healy, a very accessible place to get to, centrally located on campus,” Davis said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “GSP deserves their department space on campus. I think Healy Hall was that space.”
The university is committed to supporting first-generation, low-income students on Georgetown’s campus and their accessibility to resources, according to a university spokesperson.
“Ensuring that the Georgetown Scholars Program has a secure foundation, and can thrive in perpetuity, is a top priority for Georgetown,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We appreciate the feedback and continue to engage with students and alumni to ensure that this program can meet the needs of the students it serves.”
Regardless of its location, Davis said GSP will continue to serve students.
“GSP is going to be successful no matter where it is,” Davis said. “I think it speaks to just how great of a program that they have built, that no matter where it is, it is impactful to the students who are part of it.”

So many issues in the world (and at Georgetown) and THIS is what we are fussing over! The “woke” crowd chanting symbolism and abstract ideas is always looking for drama. This one is literally just a way to more effectively use campus spaces and Healy Hall has limited area. I think it’s a great idea to bring all multicultural and equity groups in one place. And stop misleading people by the connotation of a “basement”! The office spaces on the ground level of that New South Building are well done and have some of the most important departments (like sustainability) housed there. So stop misleading people with your rhetoric and agenda and acting like the new space is a worn-out, dark basement outside Georgetown. It’s very much central and accessible (it’s literally across from Leo’s dining hall where all underclassmen eat! I’m sure they’ll not be lost finding their way to the new GSP office! If they can get into Georgetown; I’m sure they’ll navigate their way to a rather easy route to this new office.)

CW: This article references violence in Afghanistan. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Student government leaders have released a statement calling on Georgetown University to provide student visas for students affected by the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. 
The Aug. 21 statement, written by four members of the Georgetown University Student Association Senate, calls for the university to establish a grant that would fund student visas for Afghan students, allowing them to study safely at either the main campus or the Qatar campus. This push comes after the Afghan government fell to the Taliban on Aug. 15, following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country. Many Afghans attempting to leave the country have faced life-threatening violence and disaster, with an explosion at the Kabul Airport on Aug. 26 killing over 100 individuals. 
The university must support Afghan students by both establishing a student visa grant and working with the federal government to arrange for accessible international student immigration, according to GUSA Senate Speaker and statement co-author Leo Rassieur (COL ’22). 
“No doubt this would require advocacy vis-a-vis the federal government, but that kind of advocacy is not something that Georgetown should shy away from,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We need to take a stand for this lifesaving policy and recognize that every dollar spent on such a grant would be worth it if it is able to save the life of someone in imminent danger.”
Georgetown has a duty to help students who have been affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis, according to Zahra Wakilzada (COL ’23).
“I was born towards the end of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and witnessed the impact of their regime for 12 years of my life in Afghanistan,” Wakilzada wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I hope the university acknowledges the impact that the situation in Afghanistan has and will continue to have on its Afghan students, especially those who have family in Afghanistan, and be more understanding and flexible in the upcoming semester to us as we mourn the loss of not our country but also some might mourn the loss of family members due to brutal ruling of the Taliban.”
The Taliban exercised control over Afghanistan from 1996 until the beginning of U.S. intervention in 2001 and imposed oppressive measures against the country’s population during their time in power, banning women from working and targeting those who opposed their rule. 
The university has committed to helping Afghan students through the U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council, a program initially founded at Georgetown that aims to promote Afghan women and girls education, health care and economic opportunities, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Since 2001, Georgetown has been at the forefront of efforts to support Afghan scholars and students and will continue our outreach and advocacy,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In these incredibly difficult and chaotic times, the U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council remains steadfast in its commitment to the people of Afghanistan, especially the Afghan women and girls and has shared ways the community can help.”
The university spokesperson did not provide comment regarding the funding of visas for Afghan students. 
The statement also encourages Georgetown community members to donate to local and international organizations that are providing aid to people in Afghanistan and Afghan refugees, such as the Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, which aims to resettle 2,500 Afghans in six weeks. 
Many community members have brought attention to the crisis in Afghanistan via social media, but more tangible work can be done to help Afghans directly, according to GUSA Senator Brett Guessford (COL ’23), who co-authored the statement. 
“I’ve seen a lot of awareness raised on social media along with resources being shared around, but many of the challenges of relocating Afghans to safety are still ahead of us — that’s why we made sure to include volunteer and donation opportunities regarding local DMV area organizations,” Guessford wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Rassieur hopes that the statement will prompt the university administration and the Georgetown community to reach out to those affected by the crisis in Afghanistan.
“We have been encouraged by the solidarity many in the Georgetown community have shown to Afghans and others affected and endangered by the conflict, whether in Afghanistan, the U.S., or elsewhere,” Rassieur wrote. “That being said, we must do much more to inform the community about the humanitarian toll of the Taliban’s resurgence, and the University administration in particular must take practical steps to demonstrate solidarity with the Afghan community and all those impacted.”

Local transportation advocates have reinvigorated advocacy efforts to create a gondola connecting Georgetown and Rosslyn, Va., after the Council of the District of Columbia took steps Aug. 3 to purchase property in the Georgetown neighborhood.
In its proposed budget for the 2022 fiscal year, the D.C. Council allocated $10 million toward purchasing the property that housed the former Key Bridge Exxon gas station for the purpose of expanding transportation in Georgetown. Though the purchase has not been finalized, local advocates see the budget allocation as the first step toward the possible construction of the gondola.
Under the proposed plan, the Georgetown-Rosslyn Gondola would be an aerial tram over the Potomac River connecting the Georgetown and Rosslyn neighborhoods, with two stations in Georgetown located at 35th and Prospect streets and the Key Bridge Exxon property. If constructed, the gondola is predicted to transport around 6,500 people every day.
The gondola would have many benefits for Georgetown, according to Joe Sternlieb, CEO and president of the Georgetown Business Improvement District, an organization that focuses on improving Georgetown’s commercial district. The gondola would increase access to local businesses and reduce Georgetown’s transit shed, the time it takes on average for commuters to reach the neighborhood as a final destination, according to Sternlieb.
“The economic pro is that it changes the travel shed,” Sternlieb said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It’s a relatively small area by public transit now, but if you add the gondola it becomes almost twice the size. It really does increase access to the job market in Georgetown. It’s fun and cool and different for this region. I think it would be good on the weekends for attracting shoppers and visitors to Georgetown.”
Transportation advocates have been working to advance the gondola project for several years after a study was released in 2016 by two local architecture and engineering companies stating that the project was a viable option for increasing transportation opportunities and use of public transit in the Georgetown area.
While the primary purpose of the acquisition is to increase access to public transportation in Georgetown, the acquisition also supports the long term goal of building a Metro stop in the neighborhood, according to Sternlieb.
“It’s a strategic acquisition to preserve the city and the region’s ability to bring transit to Georgetown,” Sternlieb said. “There are various different ways to do that, and the most important is a long term plan to bring Metro to Georgetown.”
Georgetown does not currently have a Metro station due to both geographic constraints and concerns over the preservation of historic parts of the neighborhood. The steep grade of the streets hinders underground construction, and the neighborhood lacks an open space for development of a project of this scale. 
Regardless of the long term plans for transportation in Georgetown, the gondola still faces an uphill battle. In order to start construction, the project would need to get approval from 27 different agencies in the federal government, Washington, D.C., and Arlington County.
The Arlington County Board has expressed disinterest in the project for several years. In 2017, the board published a letter on its website announcing its opposition to the project, specifically citing concerns about the cost and feasibility of the project.
“Given our identified and pressing transportation needs, along with some ongoing concerns about the long-term value of the gondola, the Board is not in favor of any further funding of the gondola project,” the letter reads. 
The Arlington County Board’s position on the project has not changed, with many of the board’s initial concerns still in place, according to Matt de Ferranti, the Arlington County chair. 
“I don’t know of a business plan for how this would be to Arlington’s benefit,” de Ferranti said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It needs to be more than just an idea that there’s a fun and interesting way to cross Key Bridge and instead a viable plan for an economically successful approach from Arlington’s point of view, and I don’t see that at this point.” 
Without the Arlington County Board’s approval, the gondola is not likely to be built. Still, transportation advocates and lawmakers have suggested other uses for the soon-to-be acquired Key Bridge Exxon property, including an electric vehicle charging station.
The electric vehicle charging station would help to expand transportation options in Georgetown while also supporting current efforts in the District to expand environmentally sustainable transportation, according to Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto (LAW ’17).
“The former gas station across from the Francis Scott Key Bridge is located at one of the largest arteries connecting DC to Virginia,” Pinto wrote in an email to The Hoya. “By purchasing this property, DC could establish the city’s first major EV charging station and in so doing take a significant step towards electrifying DC vehicles and provide a place to stop to charge for ride share drivers as they move to electrify their fleets.”
While the gondola’s future remains uncertain, there is still a possibility that the project could happen under the right circumstances, according to de Ferranti.
“I don’t rule anything out forever, but I don’t see a reason to pursue the gondola at this stage until we learn more from the D.C. government,” de Ferranti said.

Elisabeth Kimmel became the ninth former Georgetown parent to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal after entering a plea deal with prosecutors Aug. 16.
Kimmel, a former chief executive officer of California-based media company KFMB Stations, agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud after she worked with Rick Singer, the ringleader of the national college admissions scandal, to help secure fake recruiting slots for her two children. 
Kimmel reportedly paid $275,000 in 2012 to former Georgetown University tennis coach Gordon Ernst to get her daughter admitted to Georgetown as a fake tennis recruit. Kimmel also paid $250,000 in 2017 to have her son admitted to the University of Southern California as a fake pole vaulting recruit.
As part of the plea, prosecutors will recommend Kimmel be sentenced to six weeks in prison and two years of supervised release, in addition to being ordered to pay a $250,000 fine and complete 500 hours of community service.
Prosecutors initially charged Kimmel with bribery and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, though Kimmel’s Aug. 16 plea deal with prosecutors did not include the charges of bribery. 
Kimmel’s plea comes after her defense attorneys previously argued her March 2019 arrest caused a cardiovascular reaction that later hospitalized her, violating her constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure. Her attorneys argued the reaction was sufficient grounds for her case to be dismissed, according to documents submitted to the court May 28. 
“Given that the government has handicapped Mrs. Kimmel in her right to choose whether to testify at any trial in this case, whether now or in the future, dismissal is the only remedy that can redress the constitutional injury caused by the government’s conduct,” the attorneys’ memo read.
The motion to dismiss did not proceed, however, as Kimmel stated at her Aug. 16 hearing that she would plead guilty to the charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud but not to the charges of bribery, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Kimmel’s lawyers did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Kimmel joins a long list of former Georgetown parents who have either been charged or sentenced in the national college admissions scandal.
Before Kimmel, the most recent Georgetown parents to plead guilty in the scandal were Peter Dameris and Robert Repella. Both were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and bribery in May 2020, before shortly entering plea deals within the following month. Dameris was sentenced Oct. 5, 2020, and Repella is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 21. 
Dameris reportedly paid $300,000 to Singer to get his son admitted as a fake tennis recruit to Georgetown; however, some of the payment went directly to Ernst. Repella did not work directly with Singer but instead paid Ernst $50,000 directly to admit his daughter as a tennis recruit, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office case documents. 
Ernst has pleaded not guilty to his charges, which include aiding and abetting money laundering, conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bribery and filing false tax returns. Ernst allegedly received $2.7 million in bribes from Singer throughout the Varsity Blues operations, the Department of Justice name for the college admissions scandal, and is set to stand trial Nov. 16.
Ernst was also handed further criminal charges in his case Sept. 2020. That same month, a 10th former Georgetown parent, Amin Khoury, was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and bribery after working with Ernst to get his daughter admitted as a fake tennis recruit, though Khoury denies any wrongdoing.
The university first discovered Ernst’s actions in 2017 and has since completed an investigation and implemented new athletic recruiting policies, according to a university spokesperson.
“In 2017, Georgetown’s Admissions Office discovered irregularities in the athletic credentials of two students who were being recruited to play tennis. Neither student was admitted,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown immediately put former coach Gordon Ernst on leave, initiated an internal investigation, established a new policy concerning the recruitment of student athletes, implemented audits to check whether recruited student athletes are on team rosters, and asked Mr. Ernst to resign.”
In addition to Dameris and Repella, six other former Georgetown parents have been charged and sentenced for their actions in the college admissions scandal: Manuel and Elizabeth Henriquez, Michelle Janavs, Douglas Hodge, Karen Littlefair and Stephen Semprevivo. Kimmel is scheduled to be sentenced by District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton in a Massachusetts District Court on Dec. 9, though attorneys have requested the sentencing take place virtually, due to ongoing concerns over COVID-19.

Georgetown University announced the creation of a new master’s program Aug. 5, aimed at addressing businesses’ impact on the environment through the joint study of sustainability and business management.
The master of science in environment and sustainability management, which will launch in the fall 2022 semester, will be an interdisciplinary program between the McDonough School of Business, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Georgetown Environment Initiative, a group of faculty working to advance sustainability and environmental research at Georgetown. 
The yearlong program will focus on the study of sustainability and the environment through various lenses, including business management, environmental science and finance and accounting.
The new degree will give students the skills to understand and advance environmental science while simultaneously learning important management techniques, according to a press release from Alexander Sens, interim dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
“This new STEM-designated program will leverage the University’s expertise in both environmental science and business,” Sens wrote. “The MS-ESM program is an exciting partnership that we hope will pave the way for additional cross-university collaborations.”
The program will also aim to educate students on a variety of cross-curricular subjects vital to the study of sustainability, according to Vishal Agrawal, the provost’s distinguished Lapeyre family associate professor and one of two co-directors for MS-ESM. 
“Sustainability is inherently an interdisciplinary challenge, which requires us to marshall different knowledge bases to be effective at tackling such challenges,” Agrawal wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Moreover, in our experience, businesses today are commonly looking for employees that not only understand business, but can act as a liaison between the scientists/technical staff and the business functions.”
The MS-ESM program will consist of 30 credits and will culminate in a capstone project in which students will work directly with local companies to research, advise and implement environmentally sustainable projects in local communities.
Through these interdisciplinary studies, students will be prepared to lead public and private organizations in sustainable ways and be adaptable and flexible to succeed in an uncertain future, according to Maria Petrova, MS-ESM co-director and assistant director of graduate education at the Georgetown Environment Initiative.
“The leaders of the future will be organizations that are innovative and make sustainability their top priority and those who adopt new technologies that help them save energy, reduce energy, reduce water consumption, increase sustainability,” Petrova said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.
Applications for the first cohort of the program are set to open in the coming months and will consist of various elements to be judged holistically, including a resume, video essay, personal statement and other academic materials.
Ultimately, 40 to 45 students will be selected for the first cohort in order to foster relationships between students and keep classes small. The small cohort size will allow students to work more closely with local organizations and communities to address sustainability issues in the area, according to Petrova.
“I don’t think you’ve done anything, or you haven’t achieved much, as far as education is concerned, unless you embrace and try to solve the problems that your community has, because at the end of the day, universities are part of the communities,” Petrova said. “Not only the local community, but the global community, as well as other institutions, but especially for the local communities.” 
The MS-ESM is not the first Georgetown program examining businesses’ role in the environment. In early 2020, Georgetown launched the certificate in sustainable business, an MBA certificate focused on business sustainability and environmentalism. 
The new programs at Georgetown come as part of a larger national trend with graduate schools around the country launching academic programs relating to environmental business and sustainability. Similar programs have been created at schools including Yale University, Columbia University and American University.
Ultimately, the combination of studying sustainability and business management will better help graduates, as well as businesses, to address ongoing environmental issues in the world, according to Agrawal. 
“We are hoping that this degree will equip our students with scientific knowledge and business principles — a powerful combination that will enable them to decisively address looming environmental threats and help build a more sustainable future within almost any organization,” Agrawal wrote.
