Two Georgetown University School of Health students have been exploring reproductive and sexual health research in Ho, Ghana, throughout the Fall 2022 semester.
Clare Westerman (NHS ’23) and Emme Rogers (NHS ’22) are more than halfway through 15 weeks of academic work in the Ho Municipal District in the Volta Region of Ghana. The two are conducting research in collaboration with the Institute of Health Research (IHR), a multidisciplinary research center at the University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS) in Ghana. Rogers is studying malaria treatment education currently provided to pregnant women, while Westerman is researching ways to motivate adolescents to seek sexual and reproductive health services. Westerman and Rogers arrived in Ghana on Aug. 25 and will wrap up their research Dec. 9.
Westerman, a pre-med student, said that the semester has given her an opportunity to uplift adolescent sexual health, an often overlooked issue within the medical field. 
“I’m really interested in working with underserved communities and communities that face stigma or barriers on what they need,” Westerman told The Hoya. “And for me, sexual health digs into that. Adolescent health is something we don’t talk about enough.”
As part of her research, Westerman said she is observing the work of health clubs, educational spaces that teach Ghanaian youth about safe sexual and reproductive health practices. These clubs may provide a model for global health education, according to Westerman.
“They had everyone in a big room, and they had boys and girls together, which I thought was kind of cool, because their topic was menstruation,” Westerman said. “It was very participatory. It was kind of what I wish my health classes had been.”
Rogers said she wanted to utilize her time in Ghana to examine health education in clinics, specifically focusing on the dynamic between health providers and pregnant women.
“Pregnant women are especially vulnerable to malaria,” Rogers wrote to The Hoya. “I was very interested in knowing why women weren’t taking the drug if they were already attending the clinic. In short, my research has shown that they aren’t getting quality health information from their providers, so they don’t realize why it is important to get the complete dose.”
UHAS medical and organizational anthropologist Matilda Aberese-Ako, a visiting scholar with Georgetown’s Department of Global Health, will join Westerman and Rogers in Ghana in the coming days. She is currently teaching a master’s program on Georgetown’s campus.
Aberese-Ako said she has encouraged Georgetown students entering the IHR program to select topics that can make a meaningful contribution to Ghanaian health knowledge. 
“Because students want to learn new things, it makes it easy for me to work for them,” Aberese-Ako told The Hoya. “We love for students to do topics that are really critical to Ghana health service. We want the work to be practical and serve people in Ghana.”
According to Aberese-Ako, past Georgetown students have made significant impacts on the community in Ho. Aberese-Ako said that one student was involved with a local church and connected with the city through religion.
“When she went to the church she became so integrated,” Aberese-Ako said. “This lady was so much a part of the community that she was participating in organizing funerals and activities for her Ghanaian family. I would say she has a family in Ghana.”
Rogers and Westerman have been working remotely as Ghanaian unions representing teachers and university personnel, including UHAS scholars, have been on strike in order to seek increased educational funding in response to inflation. The protests follow an unsuccessful Oct. 14 meeting in which the Ghanaian government did not meet unions’ demands on issues including vehicle maintenance and off-campus allowances. 
Westerman said that while she would prefer to conduct her work in person, she supports the mission of the unions and the rationale behind the strike.
“I definitely miss going into the office, I am a person who likes being around other people and enjoying that set structure,” Westerman said. “It was definitely an adjustment, but I’m glad they are doing what they are feeling they need to do for their workers’ rights.”
Rogers said that working alongside experienced researchers in a new country has taught her both important technical and life skills.  
“UHAS has an incredible team of researchers. I’ve learned, and continue to learn, so much from them,” Rogers wrote. “Ultimately, this experience has honed my ability to adapt to new situations and be able to go with the flow. I’ll be forever grateful for those skills.”

Georgetown University Campus Ministry coordinated a Chaplain’s Tea centered around a Sikh holiday in an effort to further recognize Sikh students at the university.
Campus Ministry organized a celebration of Gurpurab — a Sikh holiday celebrating the birth of the first Sikh guru and founder of Sikhism — at the Nov. 8 Chaplain’s Tea, a weekly event hosted by Campus Ministry offering free tea and snacks and the opportunity for students to speak with university chaplains and members of Campus Ministry. Campus Ministry’s Director for Dharmic Life, Dr. Brahmachari Sharan, spoke on the significance of Gurpurab, alongside members of the Sikh Student Association (SSA). 
Keerat Singh (SFS ’22), one of the co-presidents of SSA, said the event was the first time a Chaplain’s Tea featured the Sikh faith during her time at Georgetown. 
“I have been attending Chaplains tea since freshman year so it was really exciting to be finally having one centered around a Sikh holiday,” Singh wrote to The Hoya.
Chaplain’s Tea represents an important step for Georgetown to engage with the Sikh community at Georgetown, according to Singh. 
“It’s important because we need to raise awareness about religions that aren’t taught in schools to both increase visibility of religions like Sikhism and to counter hate in the world,” Singh wrote.
Sharan said Campus Ministry has made changes in recent years in an aim to better reflect the backgrounds of Georgetown students, including the change of Hindu life into Dharmic life, which encompasses Buddhists, Hindus, Jains and Sikhs on Georgetown’s campus. Sharan said that he advocated for the change in order to represent a greater number of students from various faiths.
Sikh students lead Sunday Sangats, coordinating the singing of Shabads, and setting up a langer, or community kitchen, once a month when Campus Ministry organizes a space for Sikh students to gather and worship. 
According to Sharan, Campus Ministry has seen an impressive degree of coordination and self-sufficiency on part of the SSA and other Sikh students on campus. 
“Because they see that the students themselves manage the Shabads, they manage the entire event, and they’ve created a wonderful community for people — because of that, there’s just a really high estimation of the Sikh Student Association,” Sharan told The Hoya. “Because other traditions have actual chaplains on campus to help them, while these results are student led.”
Sharan said that this celebration of Gurpurab further reflects Campus Ministry’s commitment to providing space for Sikh students at Georgetown to honor their religion. 
“Over time, Campus Ministry has been really impressed by how Sikh students gather, and how they do work together, not only for their own communities, but for all the communities,” Sharan said. “So when they did start to add themes to Chaplain’s Tea, they felt it was only natural to include one of the most cherished societies that they have at this school.”
Kelly Rankin, Campus Ministry’s communications and outreach coordinator, said that Campus Ministry decides the weekly themes for Chaplain’s Tea throughout the semester and takes into account many factors, including holidays and partner availability, to honor students’ diverse backgrounds.
“We host Chaplains’ Tea to highlight the diversity of our campus community,” Rankin wrote. “We like to feature partners as a means of promoting the important work happening at Georgetown to our faith communities and to broaden engagement in these informal gatherings.”
Singh said Sikh students have noticed Campus Ministry’s recent efforts to uplift the Sikh community at Georgetown. Campus Ministry supported SSA’s efforts to organize a Nov. 9 Langar Night to celebrate Gurpurab.
Singh said she hopes the university’s support for the Sikh community will continue, with the Gurpurab celebration representing a stepping stone for recognition on campus.
“Other important Sikh holidays include Vaisakhi, in April, and Bandi Chhor Divas, which happens around the same time as Diwali,” Singh wrote. “It would be great to have other celebrations supported by Campus Ministry in the same way that they are supporting Gurpurab.”

Students protested outside the U.S. Supreme Court to protect affirmative action, as attorneys inside the court held oral arguments regarding race-conscious admissions programs.
College students from around the country organized demonstrations Oct. 31 at the Supreme Court to show support for affirmative action. The protests came on the same day the Court heard two lawsuits regarding affirmative action, both of which have caused intense division over whether or not racial factors should be considered during admissions decisions. 
The two cases — Students For Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard University and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina — have challengers calling on the Supreme Court to overrule Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), in which the Court upheld University of Michigan’s race-conscious admissions process for its law school.
Muskaan Arshad, Student Lead of the Harvard Affirmative Action Coalition and protest organizer, said the Harvard experience is rooted in diversity — and taking away affirmative action would destroy this valuable learning environment.  
“If we cannot take race into account and pretend like we are in this race-blind society, it is going to systemically take us back so many years,” Arshad said in an interview with The Hoya. “The college experience is not what it is without diversity, without inclusion.” 
Given the Court’s 6-3 conservative majority, the possibility of overruling long-upheld affirmative action policies seems increasingly tangible. At the Oct. 31 hearings, each of the Court’s six conservative justices indicated skepticism about the program and whether race should be a factor in college admissions moving forward.
David Lewis, a member of Harvard Black Students’ Association and Harvard Affirmative Action Coalition, said students mobilized to action when the Court selected the case for review.
“A lot of people immediately felt the need to do something,” Lewis told The Hoya. “There has already been a lot of struggle at Harvard to promote diversity and to fight for students of color.”
According to Lewis, over 100 students came to the protest, including students from Yale and Howard University. 
Student leaders from the University of North Carolina (UNC) showed up to the Supreme Court protest as well. Christina Huang, Joy Jiang and Sarah Zhang, who serve as the student co-leaders of the UNC for Affirmative Action Coalition, started organizing UNC students’ trip to Washington, D.C., only three weeks prior, when the trio first heard about the affirmative action lawsuits. 
The Leadership Conference Education Fund, the nation’s oldest and largest civil and human rights coalition, also made an appearance at Monday’s rally to amplify student voices. Liz King, Senior Program Director for Educational Equity at The Leadership Conference Education Fund, said working with student leaders is increasingly important for their activism. 
“Almost nobody has more at stake here than the students themselves,” King told The Hoya. “Every student on every campus has something at stake here about what this is going to mean for our future and the future of our country.”
Studies from the Education Fund indicate that a majority of Americans believe affirmative action benefits all students and want the Supreme Court to protect these programs. Studies on Proposition 209 in California also found that after California stopped the California State University system from recruiting based on race in 1996, Black, Native American and Latinx student enrollment fell.Lyssa Menendez and Kalila Arreola also traveled from North Carolina to the Supreme Court to support the UNC Affirmative Action Coalition. Arreola said that the experience was a learning opportunity for her to learn more about the issue.“Without affirmative action, I really do not think I could be at the school that I am at right now,” Arreola said. “At first I kind of did not realize how personal it was to me as well. Being around all these people who have had similar experiences has been really important.”Menendez said that Huang helped her realize her own stance on the issue. 
“As a white student, I still recognize how diversity in the school is so beneficial for everybody,” Menendez told The Hoya. “No matter the ruling, we are going to keep fighting for what we need, which is affirmative action and race conscious admissions.”
To Lewis, repealing affirmative action would diminish the overall welfare of all students, particularly students of color.
“Everyone stands to lose from affirmative action being repealed or even diminished in any way,” Lewis said. “The whole community of people of color in this country would be impacted.”

Students have voiced concerns about housing options for the 2023-24 academic year after Georgetown University announced a series of residential living changes. 
The university announced these changes Nov. 1 as a result of the construction of the new Henle residential complex, which is scheduled to begin in early summer 2023. The demolition of Henle Village will eliminate around 470 upperclassmen beds, with these apartment-style units most commonly housing third-year students. The university is planning to temporarily replace these beds by converting the on-campus Georgetown University Hotel to student housing and offering an off-campus residence hall located on H Street. 
Georgetown will also allow up to 100 juniors to apply to live off-campus outside the Georgetown, Burleith and Foxhall communities, who will be randomly selected and will receive an exemption from the university’s existing three-year on-campus housing policy. Juniors applying to live off campus will not be permitted to live within the Georgetown, Burleith and Foxhall neighborhoods, and students must provide documentation to confirm their residence is outside of these boundaries.
Aya Takegami (SFS ’25) said she feels the university did not give students enough time to arrange new housing plans.
“I was upset about the late notice and short timeline given, especially as study abroad decisions and even planning had not even begun,” Takegami wrote to The Hoya. “I think there is really no best way to go about constructing a new building, but they could offer more support and guidance toward students rather than making us make decisions blindly without much time.”
Off-campus options for upperclassmen include Georgetown’s newly built apartment-style residence hall located at 55 H Street NW, near the Georgetown University Law Center. This hall, which contains 158 furnished apartment-style units, will be open to undergraduate and graduate students, and free shuttle-bus transportation will be available for students to travel to Main Campus Mondays through Fridays.
The monthly rent to live in the H Street residential housing ranges from $1,500 to $2,472, while on campus apartment-style residence halls range from $6,140 to $8,102 per semester. The university did not clarify in its announcement regarding the housing changes whether undergraduate students will pay the same rate for the 2023-24 academic year. 
Takegami says the H Street option will pose a financial and social problem for upperclassmen.
“I think it’s crazy that GU even considered this an option for students that are not part-time or doing the program in D.C. with Georgetown (CALL),” Takegami wrote. “A commute to school with public transit, especially when juniors aren’t even able to be fully off the meal plan makes a huge financial barrier and burden for students. It really shows that GU doesn’t care about promoting a community or bonding within the student body for juniors since these students would be completely isolated.”
Mikaela Catto (COL ’25) said the lack of transportation to campus on the weekends will isolate students living on H Street and disadvantage low-income students.
“If you can’t even take the Circulator or the bus to see them on the weekends, then that just means you’ll be even more isolated on the weekends, and so I just think that that’s really sad, and also for students who can’t necessarily afford to use their own transportation to campus that’s just not an option for them,” Catto said in an interview with The Hoya.
Rooms in the hotel will become single, double and triple private-bathroom units and provide 298 residential beds for upperclassmen. The hotel will have some of the amenities included in other Georgetown dorms, according to a university spokesperson, including a laundry room and access to a community kitchen.
Takegami said she is worried the hotel is not conducive to dorm-style living and thus does not intend to rank it highly, although she acknowledged the hotel as a good temporary option. 
The university says it is working with students to address their concerns about the new housing options.
“University leadership has been working closely with student leaders since the spring, including GUSA and the two student Advisory Neighborhood Commission commissioners, in their effort to address the university’s residential capacity changes,” a university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya.
Maya McDonald (COL ’25) said she is worried she may not be able to have a full college experience if she has to live on H Street.
“Personally, I feel like being on campus is vital to my college experience, and part of why I chose Georgetown was because it has such a small campus,” McDonald said in an interview with The Hoya. “It takes away that entire experience, and even if it has transportation, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s coming every single second of every single day, and my schedule changes.”
Takegami said she hopes to secure an on-campus apartment for next year given her concerns regarding the other housing options. 
“I don’t want to live off campus nor have the resources/knowledge to get a lease for next year,” Takegami wrote. “I worry that the changes may cause the sense of community or bonding among dorms and junior class will decrease.”

Georgetown should either allow students to live nearby in  Georgetown, Burleith & Glover Park or should reduce incoming  class numbers to allow more on campus housing for current students. This is not what these students , who due to Covid spent freshman year at home, envisioned for their college experience.

Panelists spoke to Georgetown University community members about Argentina’s humanitarian visa for people displaced by disasters and the example the program sets on the global stage.
The Institute for the Study of International Migration (ISIM) — a multidisciplinary center inside Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service — hosted the virtual event, entitled “Argentina’s Innovative Humanitarian Visa: Responding to Disaster Displacement.” Andrés Pérez Esquivel (GRD ’19) — director of international affairs at the National Directorate of Migration, a government agency responsible for managing Argentina’s migration policy — spoke at the event and shared his insider perspective on the program’s development and implementation.
Other speakers at the Nov. 7 event included Susan Fratzke (GRD ’12) — senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a non-profit immigration think tank — and Atle Solberg, head of the secretariat at the Platform on Disaster Displacement, an international, state-led initiative to protect displaced peoples.
In May 2022, the Argentinian government created a new humanitarian visa that enabled people displaced by climate disasters from Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean to reside in the country for three years without migratory fees. Under the program, refugees are guaranteed access to housing, food and other essential support for integration such as health care services throughout this period by a civil society sponsoring organization.
The humanitarian visa program represents the latest step in Argentina’s extensive history of welcoming immigrants, according to Esquivel.
“We have a long tradition of receiving migrants as a country. Even our national constitution promotes immigration,” Esquivel said at the event. “According to our migration law, migrating is an essential, inalienable right of persons. We have equal treatment in both duties and obligations for nationals, as well as for foreigners.”
Esquivel said responding to the crisis of climate-driven displacement is a global issue that must be addressed by nations across the globe.
“Human mobility in the context of natural disasters and the adverse effects of climate change represents one of the greatest humanitarian challenges of the 21st century,” Esquivel said.
Since 2010, weather emergencies have displaced around 21.5 million people a year across the globe. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 90% of refugees come from countries deemed the most vulnerable and least ready to adapt to the effects of climate change, and the same countries host about 70% of displaced persons.
The existing international protocol of asylum systems is unprepared to efficiently handle the large-scale movement of populations displaced by climate disasters, according to Fratzke.
“Within asylum systems, in the frameworks that we’ve built to deal with the asylum application, you typically see people making individual claims, going through an individual adjudication process,” Fratzke said at the event. “This is intensive, time consuming and leads to mounting backlogs and delays.”
Fratzke said that, without specific programs developed for individuals displaced by natural disasters, these migrants often face denied entry into other countries when seeking safety.
“We know that individuals with complex needs can find it difficult to qualify for asylum,” Fratzke said. “Within the U.S. asylum system, we know that often they have complex cases that don’t clearly meet the criteria for refugee protection and that can leave them in a vulnerable position.”
The United States does not currently offer asylum to people impacted by climate disasters, and can only apply for asylum if they can show their reason for emigration is that they have faced or have reason to fear persecution due to o race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.
Current asylum systems require migrants to face many risks prior to beginning the formal immigration process, according to Fraztke.
“Asylum only kicks in once you reach a state’s territory, and it can thus require people to engage in difficult and dangerous journeys to even access the opportunity to apply for asylum,” Fratzke said. “You end up layering additional vulnerabilities on top of the things that actually drove someone to seek protection and move in the first place.”
Solberg said he expects other countries to follow in Argentina’s lead, given the increasing importance of climate emergency response.
“I’m more and more convinced that with global warming and with further environmental degradation, there is a need to prepare more for these types of movement,” Solberg said at the event. “I think we should recognize that this is an important initiative in South America that will most likely benefit an important number of people.”
Fratzke said Argentina’s humanitarian visa is an inspiring and needed step forward that will help to address global flaws in the immigration process.
“If we continue to try to solve everything through our asylum systems, we will fail, and we will lose our asylum systems,” Fratzke said. “Argentina’s approach is a fascinating first step and will be a fantastic test case.”

To be in charge means to be committed and true to oneself, fashion designer and inventor of the wrap dress Diane von Fürstenberg told Georgetown University students. 
The event, titled “Women Rising: A Conversation with Diane von Fürstenberg” and held Nov. 9 in Copley Formal Lounge, featured von Fürstenberg, an acclaimed fashion designer and founder of the fashion company DVF, in conversation with Ambassador Melanne Verveer, the current executive director of Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS) and former U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues. The event was co-hosted by GIWPS and the Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS).
At the event, Verveer presented von Fürstenberg with the GIWPS 2022 International Trailblazer Award, which recognizes female leaders making a more peaceful, equitable and safe world. 
Three international female Georgetown students, Bahar Ghandehari (COL ’23), Olha Kovach (SFS ’26) and Salma Alokozai (GRD ’24), spoke alongside von Fürstenberg and Verveer, speaking on women-led revolutions and resistance movements currently taking place in their respective home countries of Iran, Ukraine and Afghanistan. 
Credited as the creator of the popular wrap dress, von Fürstenberg reflected on her start in the fashion industry as being born from a simple dress and a desire to empower herself and, subsequently, other women. 
Having launched InCharge, a platform that seeks to connect, empower, inspire and advocate for women around the world, von Fürstenberg said she designs for women in charge. 
“I wanted to be a woman in charge, I wanted to be able to design my life, pay my bills and do anything a man does,” von Fürstenberg said at the event. “And I was lucky I became that woman. I became the woman I wanted to be because of a little dress.” 
Von Fürstenberg said her sense of purpose and commitment to freedom is deeply rooted in her identity as the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. 
“When I think about my birth, I realize that because my birth was a miracle, I had already won the minute I was born,” von Fürstenberg said. “I was a shoot of green in a field of ashes and so my purpose, I think, has been, and will be, until I die, to honor life and to be grateful for life.”
University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) introduced the event and welcomed von Fürstenberg to Georgetown, noting her exhaustive work to empower women across the globe. 
“She has dedicated herself to efforts that celebrate and support women leaders, establishing in 2010 the DVF Awards to honor and provide grants to women leading impactful social change and serving on the board of the Vital Voices, an organization co-founded by Ambassador Verveer, focusing on supporting global women leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs,” DeGioia said at the event. 
At the event, students spoke on women-led revolutions, including Ghandehari, who spoke about the protests currently taking place across Iran. 
The protests were sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, who was arrested by morality police in Tehran for allegedly violating Iran’s hijab law. Amini died three days after her arrest from what protesters believe to be the result of police beatings. 
Ghandehari said that the protests taking place in Iran are part of a woman-led revolution. 
“One thing that’s so different about this protest is that people didn’t start protesting because of economic reasons or mismanagement that have been the reasons for a lot of protest in previous years, but they started because a woman died and she should have been alive and she could have been alive right now in any other country,” Ghandehari said at the event. 
Kovach said that since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, Ukrainian women have been fighting in large numbers on the front lines, trying to maintain a sense of normalcy for their families after being displaced, and experiencing heightened amounts of gender-based violence as a result of the war. 
“I believe that the least everyone can do is to continue to talk about Ukraine, continue to think about people who are staying there right now,” Kovach said at the event. “Another thing we can do is to support different local organizations, different initiatives, because they have a chance to talk to these women, to these populations specifically, and they can make sure that they have everything they need.” 
Reflecting on the injustices women are facing in her home country of Afghanistan, Alokozai said that Afghan women and girls are making their voices heard as the Taliban continues to deny them their basic right to education. 
“Women are protesting, they are taking the risk, they’re getting out there and still raising their voice because now they know only they, themselves, can help themselves get out of there,” Alokozai said at the event. 
Revolution symbolizes a collective fight for freedom, equality and individuality, von Fürstenberg said.
“It’s about being able to be who you are and being able to be educated and being able to, you know, dress and to be you. I think that is the Revolution,” von Fürstenberg said. “I think that is the common ground that we have to fight for.”

Longtime Georgetown University history professor Judith Tucker will be awarded for her contributions to history scholarship following four decades of work.
Tucker will be awarded the American History Association (AHA) Award for Scholarly Distinction, which is given to senior historians for lifetime achievement in the field, for her work studying Middle Eastern history. Following the Oct. 24 announcement, winners will receive their awards at the annual AHA meeting, which will take place in January.  
Tucker joined Georgetown’s history department in 1993 and spent four decades teaching at Georgetown prior to her retirement in May 2022. Tucker was a professor of history and also served as the former director of the Master of Arts in Arab Studies program. Tucker said throughout her career, she focused on the intersection of gender and Middle Eastern history, publishing numerous books on the topic. 
Tucker said she became interested in women’s history and published her first book covering women in 19th century Egypt in the 1980s, at a time when women’s history was still an under-researched topic in academia.
“Women’s history was just finding its feet, I think,” Tucker said. “ There was not a single monograph about women’s history in the Middle East.”  
According to Tucker, as her career progressed, she explored gender patterns and how social change impacts the development of law, particularly Islamic law, and aimed to broaden women’s history beyond a solely western focus.
“My initial interest was just trying to adjust western women’s history, which didn’t necessarily ask the right questions when it came to the Middle East, but at least it was a point of departure, a springboard of sorts to get into Middle East women’s history,” Tucker said.  
Thomas Lohman (SFS ’24), who took Tucker’s “Traveling: Europe/Middle East Encounters” course in Spring 2022, said Tucker’s character and expertise came through in her teaching style.
“She created a great atmosphere, bringing together different perspectives while guiding discussions with thoughtful questions grounded in the readings,” Lohman wrote to The Hoya. “I always felt like Tucker’s main goal was helping our learning instead of stressing us out with strict requirements or bureaucracy.”
Tucker said that while she was initially surprised to receive the award due to the AHA’s previous focus on historians who research U.S.-based issues, she is honored to be recognized by fellow historians. 
“To be recognized for contributions you’ve made over the course of your career, which is what this award is about, was needless to say, I felt very, very grateful,” Tucker said. “I felt seen, perhaps, in a way that I had not felt before. That’s kind of huge to be seen by my history colleagues.” 
In Spring 2021, Tucker received the Georgetown Career Research Achievement Award and Distinguished Achievement in Research Award, which similarly honored the work Tucker had done in historical scholarship throughout her time at Georgetown 
Georgetown history professor Osama Abi-Mershed, who worked with Tucker at Georgetown, said Tucker’s work has played an important role in the promotion of women’s and human rights across the globe. 
“While the AHA award acclaims historians ‘who have spent the bulk of their professional careers in the US’, it is equally important to highlight Professor Tucker’s global stature and outreach through her widely acclaimed publications, her public conferences, and her activist involvement in promoting women’s and human rights,” Abi-Mershed wrote to The Hoya.
Tucker retired from teaching in May. Tucker is currently working with two colleagues from Georgetown on a textbook for women’s and gender history, aiming to create a guide Tucker wishes she had when she taught courses at Georgetown. 
“I’m currently working on a textbook on women’s and gender history,” Tucker said. “When I taught the 099 for those years, there really wasn’t any textbook for this subject, that actually really lends itself to teaching a survey like this.”  
Abi-Mershed said the Georgetown history department honors Tucker’s work studying the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and is proud of her achievement in receiving the AHA Award for Scholarly Distinction.
“Her impact on historical studies of the MENA is rigorous, profound, and unmistakable, and we are honored to join the AHA in recognizing and celebrating her professional excellence and academic stature,” Abi-Mershed wrote.

Rat numbers are increasing across Washington, D.C., as the city recovers from the pandemic, with rat-related complaints more than doubling in the District from 2018 to 2022.
The resurgence in rats comes as restaurants reopen, students move back into dorms and people return to the office. D.C.’s service hotline received over 13,300 rat complaints this fiscal year, more than twice the reports it received in 2018. Other major cities are also facing an increase in rats, with New York reaching 21,600 rat complaints last month, a 71% increase from the number of complaints made in Oct. 2020, according to New York’s Sanitation Department. 
Bobby Corrigan, a leading urban rodentologist at RMC Pest Management Consulting and a former research scientist for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the repopulation of D.C. — and the associated food and trash humans create — is driving the increase in rats.
“This rat in our cities almost depends entirely on you and I for sustenance and shelter,” Corrigan said in an interview with The Hoya. “And so, during the pandemic as you know, we all know, the pandemic pause affected us. It affected lots of animals, but all of a sudden the rats in March of 2020 found themselves without the gravy train anymore.”
The brown rat, which rodentologists refer to as the Norway Rat or by its scientific name, the Rattus norvegicus, is the most common species in D.C. 
Corrigan said that in the first month of the pandemic, areas that typically have crowded restaurants which produce high volumes of food and trash, such as Capitol Hill and Foggy Bottom, were closed, bringing rat numbers down.
“All of a sudden there’s no food,” Corrigan said. “You can’t reproduce, obviously. You can’t live for too long, and stress suppressed all these populations.”
Corrigan said rodentologists cannot specifically quantify this year’s increase in rat numbers, because it is difficult to accurately track creatures who are so mobile and who hide in so many places like sewers and drains. 
However, Corrigan has conducted surveys with pest professionals who provide services to those dealing with rat problems. He said his surveying involves contacting three long-tenured pest control companies in major cities nationwide a few times a year to gather estimates on the demand they’ve received for rat issues. According to his surveying, there has been a 15-35% increase in service requests for rat-related issues across the eastern megalopolis, which stretches from Boston to D.C. 
Corrigan said another way to measure the increase in rats is to look at the spike in complaints the public has been making to the government and D.C. Health. 
D.C. Health did not respond to The Hoya’s requests for comment.
Even though rats carry multiple pathogens that cause diseases including the bacterial disease leptospirosis, and monkeypox, which can lead to symptoms like fevers and rashes, Corrigan said the likelihood of rats actually transmitting a virus to humans is low. 
Still, Corrigan said rats can cause emotional distress.
“If you go home tonight and there’s a rat and you can hear it scurrying about in your ceiling,  psychologically that’s going to really get to you,” Corrigan said.  
Zayan Baig (NHS ’25), a resident assistant in Darnall Hall, said he’s seen multiple rats on the northeast side of campus. 
“I find that no matter when I’m walking in that area, especially at night, I find at least one if not multiple rats scurrying around campus, so it’s just something that you see everywhere,” Baig said. 
Baig said he worries the increase in rats will have implications students don’t fully consider, one of which is that rats will enter Epicurean and contaminate the food offered to students. 
“Based on how frequently those rats are moving around in the area, I would not be surprised if one just got in there,” Baig said. “It’s not very well guarded. You only have the two double-doors to get in.” 
A university spokesperson said officials monitor and respond to reports of rats and other rodents on campus, but they have not seen any increase in rat reports this year. 
The spokesperson said students, faculty and staff can report rodents by submitting a service request.
“While we have not observed an increase in rats on campus this year, rodents and other pests are not uncommon in an urban environment, especially when the weather outside becomes extremely cold or hot,” the university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “The Department of Planning and Facilities Management coordinates pest control inspections on campus.”
Baig said running into rats frequently has recently become a normal part of his experience at Georgetown. 
“This is a reality I have to adjust to unfortunately,” Baig said. “I think I’ve kind of become, and I hate how I say this, I feel like I’m desensitized to it now. I see rats and I’m just like ‘oh cool.’”

D.C. Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto (LAW ’17) will teach an intensive, one-week course at the Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) over the winter break in January 2023.
Pinto will teach the course — “Law and Policy in the Capitol City,” — alongside Georgetown Law Professor Meryl Chertoff, who serves as the executive director of the Georgetown Project on State and Local Government Policy and Law (SALPAL). Pinto will teach the course in accordance with the D.C. Code on Ethics and Government Accountability and as such will  not accept payment for her services. 
Pinto said she hopes to form the same kind of connections with students that she was able to find with her professors during her time studying at GULC. 
“Returning to my alma mater to teach a course to law students is an enormous privilege,” Pinto wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “My time at the Law Center was filled with professors who made meaningful impacts on the trajectory of my career.” 
The course will focus specifically on Washington, D.C., and its complex system of governance as a federal district but not a state, allowing law students to examine the challenges the D.C. Council faces when aiming to navigate governance.
According to Chertoff, inspiration for the course grew out of her previous teaching on state and local government law. 
“We’re going to be talking about things including D.C. statehood, but we’re going to go well beyond questions of of D.C. statehood,” Chertoff said in an interview with The Hoya. “And we’re going to be talking about the way that the district government is set up — the D.C. Council, the court system, the regulatory agencies — we’re going to be talking about developments in the city transportation, housing and education and how D.C. faces some unique challenges.”
The course will enable students living in and around the District to better understand the legal context of the city, according to Chertoff.
“Given, of course, that all of our students are here, either actually living in Washington, D.C., or commuting to law school, we thought that it was very important to set into context what they were experiencing in Washington D.C.,” Chertoff said. 
Chertoff said Pinto’s expertise as a representative for Ward 2 — which houses Georgetown’s main campus — will help her foster conversations about the ways in which the university itself interacts with the D.C. government. 
“She is very interested as a pedagogical matter on questions of D.C. governance,” Chertoff said. “We decided it would just be terrific to work together on doing something for the law students, and lifting up some of these issues, which I know interest her as they interest me.”
Pinto said her time in the classroom at GULC was accompanied by experiences volunteering that fortified her connection to the District.
Andrew Kales (LAW ’03) said GULC students have a unique opportunity to learn about the legal system through D.C., and that Pinto and Chertoff’s course will enable them to understand how the city functions on the most local level.
“Georgetown Law students come from all over the country because they want to study in DC, but most of the classes focus on federal law and the federal legal system,” Kales wrote to The Hoya. “This type of class will give them a unique perspective on the city they’re living in.
Kales said he also believes the course will grant students a deeper connection to the D.C. community.
Pinto said her goal for the class is to inspire students to care about issues pertinent to the District and utilize the skills they are gaining at GULC to give back to the community.
“My hope in teaching this class is that students are galvanized to continue to expand their learning about the community they call home for three years and use their gifts and talents to serve and support District residents,” Pinto wrote.

The Rubell Museum D.C. — a new contemporary art museum free to all Washington, D.C. residents — opened in Southwest D.C. Oct. 29.
Named after longtime art collectors Mera and Don Rubell, the museum on 65 I Street SW comes as the culmination of a $20 million effort to transform a former junior high school into a space for art. The museum’s location used to be the site of Randall Junior High School, a historically Black school that closed in 1978. George Washington University’s Corcoran School of the Arts and Design purchased the property in 2006 before selling it to the Rubells in 2010 for $6.5 million. 
The Rubell couple began collecting artwork in 1964. They have spent the majority of their careers in Miami, showcasing works to the public from their collection of over 7,400 pieces. The Rubells also supported many well-known artists at the beginnings of their careers, including Jeff Koons, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Cecily Brown.
Rubell Museum Director Caitlin Berry said the museum’s historical setting encourages artists to take on the role of teachers and challenges viewers to learn about complex issues like race in society. 
“The museum’s unique setting in the former Randall Junior High School emphasizes the important role of artists as teachers,” Berry wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In the galleries, students will encounter thought-provoking works by the some of the most compelling artists working today, offering new frameworks for exploring themes such as race, gender, and the environment.”
Berry said the museum’s focus on contemporary art will help enrich the variety in the District’s art scene.
“Joining the city’s already vibrant landscape of cultural institutions, the Rubell Museum DC further diversifies the city’s wealth of offerings as an institution focused solely on contemporary art,” Berry wrote. “The museum is a platform for sharing diverse viewpoints that speak to our current social, political, and cultural moment, providing added opportunity for DC audiences to reflect on lived experiences that are both personal and universal.”
Unlike other art museums in D.C. — like the Smithsonian Institution’s museums, which receive funding from the government — the Rubell Museum is funded by grants, sponsorships and the Rubells’ own contributions. Entry fees for non-D.C. residents range from 10 to 15 dollars. 
Beyer Blinder Belle (BBB) — an architecture firm based in New York City — helped the Rubells design the building. The Rubells added artwork to the building without changing its original layout of classrooms and offices. 
However, the new museum building features a new glass pavilion at the entrance to the school, which includes a bakery, bookstore and terrace, according to Hany Hassan, a partner at BBB. 
“The Rubell Museum is a transformative project in the heart of the historic Southwest area,” Hassan said in a press release shared with The Hoya. “It will give a new life to the historic Randall School — an iconic building with a rich social and architectural history.” 
Mera Rubell was a teacher making $100 a week and Don Rubell worked as a doctor when they first started collecting art in the 1960s. Mera Rubell said her experience as a teacher prior to becoming an art collector influences her view on the role of art. 
“As a former teacher, I see artists and teachers playing parallel roles as educators and in fostering civic engagement,” Mera Rubell wrote in a press release shared with The Hoya. 
The museum’s inaugural exhibition, titled “What’s Going On,” features more than 190 pieces of work from 50 artists. The exhibit’s title stems from the 1971 album by Marvin Gaye, an alum of Randall Junior High School, which critiques issues such as the Vietnam War, drug abuse and environmental destruction.
The exhibition also includes the work of famous American pop artist Keith Haring. The Rubell Museum showcases his composition “Untitled (Against All Odds),” which features more than 20 works that bring viewers into a dystopian world full of Haring’s concerns, including environmental destruction and oppression.
The 32,000-square foot museum also features a solo exhibit by D.C. abstract painter and Howard University graduate Sylvia Snowden. 
Berry said the museum will continue to highlight several works from the Rubell Family Collection, which includes paintings, photographs, sculptures and site-specific work from around the world. “As with the inaugural exhibition, What’s Going On, future presentations will draw together works from the family’s holdings that demonstrate the importance of artists’ voices in contributing to a national dialogue,” Berry wrote.

Washington, D.C. residents voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers, including restaurant servers, bartenders, hotel staff and other workers in the service industry. 
Initiative 82, a ballot measure proposing the end of tipped wages, passed with 74% of the vote in the 2022 midterm elections. In accordance with the measure’s passage, the District will gradually increase the hourly minimum wage for tipped workers from $5.35 until it reaches $16.10, D.C.’s current minimum wage for non-tipped workers, in 2027. Initiative 82 comes as a follow-up to Initiative 77, a 2018 referendum in which D.C. voters narrowly voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers. Despite voters’ support for the initiative, the D.C. Council voted to repeal it Oct. 2018. A majority of D.C. councilmembers have indicated support for Initiative 82, likely eliminating the possibility of a repeal.
Saxa Strategies, a Georgetown University political consulting organization, worked with the D.C. Committee to Build a Better Restaurant Industry to create advertising in support of Initiative 82. Meriam Ahmad (COL ’26) worked on the team this semester and said the passing of the initiative will help D.C. workers who may be struggling financially. 
“We wanted to support this important progressive cause because, if passed, it would guarantee all D.C. workers in the especially difficult service industry a fair wage,” Ahmad wrote to The Hoya.
According to Ahmad, Initiative 82 would allow workers to earn the mandatory minimum wage without having to rely on tips for income.
“Initiative 82 would most certainly have a positive impact on D.C. workers,” Ahmad wrote. “Currently, the minimum wage for tipped workers in DC is $5.35 an hour, and although employers are legally required to compensate their employees up to minimum wage ($16.10 an hour), they often don’t. That’s because employees have to go out of their way to request compensation if they don’t make up the difference in tips.”
One Fair Wage (OFW), a nonprofit organization working to end subminimum wages across the nation, is campaigning for ballot measures, including Initiative 82, to raise the minimum wage in 25 states by 2026. According to Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, the passage of the initiative will level the playing field for workers and may encourage people to enter the restaurant industry.
“OFW initiated Initiative 82 because the subminimum wage for tipped workers is a direct legacy of slavery that, even before the pandemic, forced a workforce that is majority workers of color and women restaurant workers to suffer from the highest rates of economic instability and sexual harassment of any industry because they have had to put up with so much from customers in order to get tips to feed their kids,” Jayaraman wrote to The Hoya. 
In the eight states that have eliminated the tipped minimum wage, workers and businesses in tipped industries have lower poverty rates and more employment growth.
Jayaraman also said the COVID-19 pandemic led to decreases in tipping, which contributed to financial struggles for many tipped workers in the District.
“With the pandemic, these challenges worsened; workers reported that tips decreased dramatically and harassment went up further, with thousands of women reporting they were regularly asked to remove their masks so male customers could judge their looks and decide their tips on that basis,” Jayaraman wrote. 
While the initiative passed, it still faced strong opposition from some employees and restaurants. Vote No on 82, a nonprofit organization that was organized in opposition of the initiative, raised concerns about the impact the initiative will have on tipped employees’ wages and on the costs restaurants and other businesses may incur to pay these workers.
“The tip credit guarantees that servers and bartenders receive the minimum wage but enables tipped employees to earn well above that amount—about $26 per hour, on average,” Vote No on 82 wrote in a statement. “Initiative 82 would eliminate the tip credit and upend this system, harming servers and bartenders across the District.”
Julie Sproesser, interim executive director of the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington, said the measure will create additional difficulties for the D.C. restaurant industry amid attempts to recover from the pandemic. 
“We are disappointed with its passage and the new reality that awaits our vibrant industry during a time of already challenging economic recovery,” Sproesser wrote to The Hoya. “This measure will disrupt our city’s hundreds of small and independently owned restaurants and limit the earning potential of tipped employees, while also having regional repercussions.” 
Despite the concerns restaurants and employers raised regarding the impact of the initiative, others remain hopeful that Initiative 82 will facilitate positive growth in the industry after its passage. States with fair wage policies have higher restaurant industry job growth rates and small business growth rates, according to Jayaraman.
“With the Great Resignation, One Fair Wage is the inevitable future of the restaurant industry,” Jayaraman wrote. “Over 100 DC restaurants are already paying One Fair Wage and are not going to be able to go back down to $5 an hour. There is only one future for the restaurant industry, if it wants to have enough workers to survive – pay people a full livable wage that allows them to feed their kids.”

CW: This article discusses sexual assault and gender-based violence. Please refer to this article on thehoya.com for on- and off-campus resources
Journalist and activist Yasmin El-Rifae discussed the increase in sexual violence against women in the aftermath of the 2011 Egyptian revolution.
At the Oct. 27 event, El-Rifae shared insights from her book, “Radius: A Story of Feminist Revolution,” which tells the story of Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment (OpAntiSH), organized and led by women, including El-Rifae herself. Georgetown’s Center for Contemporary Arabic Studies (CCAS) and the Department of Arabic and Islamic Studies hosted the booktalk, where El-Rifae discussed her book with Elliott Colla, an associate professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at Georgetown University.
OpAntiSH was an organization of hundreds of volunteers that intervened in the mass sexual assaults committed against women protesters from 2012 to 2013. El-Rifae said the book works to integrate her own memories of the protests with other OpAntiSH members’ perspectives on the challenges and dangers they faced while bringing women to safety.
“It [Radius] is about women and men taking huge risks to save people from violence but also to insist on women’s rights to be full political agents,” El-Rifae wrote to the Hoya after the event.  “It is the story of the group and how it came together — the challenges, dangers, and divisions it faced — as told through the perspectives of four characters, with my own memories and reflections woven in.”
CCAS Events and Program Manager Coco Tait, who helped organize the book talk, said that literature, such as El-Rifae’s, brings a much-needed intersectional and story-driven lens to international affairs. 
“I do hope that they push to read books like this, you know, whether it be Southeast Asia or Africa,” Tait said. “Representing voices that are not with the homogenous, you know, straight white male trope of U.S. policy. So looking at a broad range of voices and opinions and experiences.”
According to El-Rifae, her experiences within OpAntiSH helped her understand the activist power women in Egypt hold.
“The thing that was a bit distinct about the OpAntiSH was that it identified itself not only as a sort of emergency response group or that was trying to rescue women from this violence, but also that it considered itself part of the Revolution,” El-Rifae said at the event. “OpAntiSH considered itself its mission to sort of fight for women’s ability to be full participants in political action and in revolutionary action, and it’s all part of its work to sort of push that into the center of the wider revolution.”
El-Rifae said she held interviews with survivors without the resources to come forward about their assault or didn’t feel comfortable doing so. Tait said El-Rifae’s book helps give a voice to sexual assault survivors and individuals whose stories often go untold, culminating in a work that represents the voices of many.
“And it’s not just her own memoir,” Tait said to The Hoya. “It’s a collective memoir of people who don’t have the capacity to write something that she did.”
According to El-Rifae, the Egyptian Revolution pushed for  liberal reforms and justice for minority groups, while simultaneously resulting in the assaults of many women. El-Rifae said she and other activists worked to point out the hypocrisy in the situation.
No progressive change can be successfully made without the support of women activists, according to El-Rifae. 
“What kind of social justice can you achieve if you don’t have women as part of the revolutionary movement, or if you have them barricaded off in some women-only section of Tahir?” El-Rifae said.
El-Rifae said she incorporated multiple perspectives into the book in an intentional effort to avoid sugar-coating the reality of the revolution’s violence. 
“I didn’t want to write a story about heroes,” El-Rifae said. “Once we define them as heroes in a narrative, they lose the qualities that make them human. The fear itself that they feel, and the forces that cause fear, or the violence that they are facing becomes flattened.”

The Library of Congress will open a new gallery focused on the lives of Indigenous groups who lived in the Americas prior to European colonization.
The gallery will feature the personal collection of Floridian businessman and philanthropist Jay I. Kislak, who will donate nearly 4,000 artifacts, rare books, maps and artwork from numerous indigenous groups over the course of his lifetime. The exhibit will be called “Voices of the Early Americas: The Jay I. Kislak Collection” and will contain artifacts that date back to 1,000 B.C.E., according to a Nov. 1 press release from the Library. It is expected to open at the Library’s Thomas Jefferson Building in 2024.
In 1984, Kislak founded the Jay I. Kislak Foundation in order to conserve and study material from the early Americas. The foundation made a $10 million donation that will fund the creation of the gallery and a permanent endowment for future updates and maintenance.
Curators will display the items in Kislak’s collection alongside items from other collections in the Library to comprehensively present the stories of the Americas prior to 1492.
Leah Knobel, public affairs specialist at the Library, said the installation will detail the ways Indigenous groups in the Americas preserved their cultures and identities.
“The Library hopes to provide a fuller narrative and chronology of the early Americas, giving voice to the pre-Columbian cultures of the Americas,” Knobel wrote to The Hoya. “‘Voices of the Early Americas’ aims to show how complicated this story is, how Native Americans cultures were violently conquered, sometimes enslaved, and how vibrant they are today.”
One of the primary focuses of the exhibit is revealing lesser-known truths about the lives and cultures of Native Americans before and after European colonization, according to the press release.
“There are a series of treasures that will be displayed, not just pre-Columbian archaeological objects. From that realm there will be things like a carved Maya panel from La Corona representing a ball player, many examples of classic Maya ceramics and some of the oldest pieces in the collection from the Olmecs. From the contact period, which includes the first encounters of Native cultures, we will be displaying Columbus’ Book of Privileges and very rare Indigenous manuscripts like the Codex Quetzalecatzin.
Mark Giordano, a geography professor and the vice dean for undergraduate affairs in the Walsh School of Foreign Service, said much of U.S. history is taught from a Western European perspective, and that this new gallery could help repair an often-flawed understanding of history.
Giordano said exhibits like the gallery will promote a more holistic understanding of Native American and Indigenous history, especially for those who may not be experts on the subject.
“If the artifacts are presented well, it helps us understand history in a much broader way,” Giordano wrote to The Hoya. “At the School of Foreign Service, our focus is obviously international relations. But even so, almost no one knows that the first treaty the U.S. signed was with the Delaware. It wasn’t with a European state. Once you understand that, you start to think differently about what it means to be a nation and where we are today.”
Knobel said the new gallery is part of the Library’s larger effort to broaden the scope of the information it provides to the American public.
“The Library is pursuing a multiyear plan to build a “Library for You,” transforming the experience of its nearly 2 million annual visitors, sharing more of its treasures with the public and showing how Library collections connect with visitors’ own creativity and research,” Knobel wrote. “This gallery builds on the Library’s mission to engage, inspire and inform the American people with a universal and enduring source of knowledge and creativity.”
