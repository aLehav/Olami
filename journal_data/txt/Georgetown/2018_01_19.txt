The prospect of a war between the United States and a nuclear-capable North Korea has become increasingly likely, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) said Thursday night in a speech in the Healey Family Student Center, warning that President Donald Trump’s “irresponsible” rhetoric threatens U.S. national security.
“I am hearing the drums of war being heard again, and they are growing louder each and every day,” Duckworth told a capacity crowd of about 100 students. Her comments came in an event titled “The Rush to War on the Korean Peninsula and Recalibrating Congressional War Powers,” the Georgetown University Lecture Fund’s inaugural event this semester.
Duckworth, first elected in 2012, previously represented the state’s 8th district for two terms in the House of Representatives. An Iraq War veteran, Duckworth is also the first woman with a disability to be elected to Congress and the first elected Asian-American congresswoman from Illinois.
The senator specifically called out a series of recent tweets, in which Trump taunted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and threatened him with the use of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, as drawing the United States closer to potential conflict.
In his most recent tweet about North Korea on Jan. 2, Trump appeared to mock the North Korean leader.
“North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the ‘Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.’ Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works,” he tweeted.
“Donald Trump is basically writing Kim Jong Un’s propaganda for him,” Duckworth said. “With every threat, we get a little bit closer to war, and we don’t have room to spare.”
Tensions with North Korea have escalated in recent months as the regime claims it has the capacity to launch an attack on the U.S. homeland. Fears of conflict escalated Saturday, when a Hawaii state agency accidentally sent a false emergency alert notification to state residents warning of an incoming ballistic missile.
Before entering politics, Duckworth served for 23 years in the U.S. Army Reserve Forces, including as a helicopter pilot in the Iraq War. She was awarded the Purple Heart after losing both of her legs piloting a Black Hawk helicopter over Iraq in 2004.
Duckworth’s range of political and military experiences makes her particularly knowledgeable on the threat North Korea poses to U.S. security. Lecture Fund Chair Aiden Johnson (COL ’19) said while introducing Duckworth to the audience.
For Duckworth, who returned from a trip to the Korean Peninsula just two days before the event, the threat North Korea poses to the United States and its allies is unquestionably serious, but the specific risks are still surfacing.
“Much of what will unfold in the coming months is still unclear, but one thing is very clear,” Duckworth said. “Kim Jong Un poses a serious and deadly threat.”
The United States must try to understand North Korea’s capabilities so they can develop an effective counterapproach, Duckworth said.
“I don’t think most Americans have a full grasp of what’s really at stake here,” Duckworth said. “There’s a lot more Congress should be doing to ensure that the military is prepared for whatever comes their way.”
To develop answers to these questions, Congressional committees must have extensive discussions, Duckworth said, even if Trump continues to act “irresponsibly.”
“Trump may be acting irresponsibly, but that doesn’t mean Congress should also,” Duckworth said. “Congress must have an honest debate about what going to war really means for our service members and the future of our country.”
Duckworth said ultimately any U.S. military action in North Korea would likely result in mass civilian and military casualties.
Various options floated by foreign policy professionals for potential U.S. strikes in North Korea include attempting to destroying the regime’s nuclear launch sites, a targeted attack on the state’s political leadership or a one-off “bloody nose” attack that would frighten Kim Jong Un into negotiation. Some policy experts have said any of these strikes could lead to all-out war on the Korean continent, if not strikes on the U.S. homeland.
“There’s no such thing as a surgical strike when it comes to North Korea,” Duckworth said, “Once you strike North Korea, you’re talking about a ground invasion.”
Concluding her speech, Duckworth touted Americans’ strength to overcome military threats.
“Our troops need to know they have the legal backing of our country,” Duckworth said. “The strength of our nation doesn’t come from a president flaunting our nuclear weapons, it comes from our people and our values.”

The Office of Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) granted permanent housing to 422 Washington, D.C. residents formerly experiencing homelessness through its Home for the Holidays initiative, which began in November 2017 and concluded Jan. 10.
The initiative, which exceeded its original goal of placing 400 households into permanent residences in two months, is part of Mayor Bowser’s five-year plan to improve services for individuals experiencing homelessness and reduce the occurrence of homelessness in the District.
Bowser announced this plan, Homeward D.C., in 2015.
The rate of homelessness in the District fell 10.5 percent from 2016 to 2017, during the first full year of the program’s implementation, according to a Jan. 10 news release from Mayor Bowser’s office.
Rates fell 22 percent among families, 15 percent among veterans and 3 percent among individuals between 2016 and 2017, the first full year of the program’s implementation.
Throughout the winter campaign, the D.C. Department of Human Services coordinated with local landlords to provide affordable housing for participants in the program and will continue to do so after the end of the initiative, Bowser said.
“Over the past two months, we’ve seen landlords step up and answer our call. Now, we want to build on that momentum,” Bowser wrote in a Jan. 10 news release. “This campaign may be ending, but our efforts to partner with landlords to get more residents on pathways to the middle class will continue until every resident has a safe place to call home.”
Bowser established the Landlord Partnership Fund in October 2017 to encourage landlords to provide affordable housing for Homeward D.C. targets. The fund was designed by the Downtown DC Business Improvement District and the Coalition for Non-Profit Housing and Economic Development and is designed to cover some costs to landlords with tenants whose rent is subsidized by the DHS. Covered costs include property damage or unpaid rent.
Combatting rampant homelessness in the District has been a key component of Mayor Bowser’s term.
“My Administration is committed to making homelessness in D.C. rare, brief, and nonrecurring and the Landlord Partnership Fund as well as the improvements we are making to our homeless services system are going to help us reach that goal,” Bowser wrote in an Oct. 6 news release.
Residents who have been placed in housing through the Home for the Holidays initiative will pay rent, but they will receive aid through subsidies determined by their financial situation.
In addition to landlords providing affordable housing, community members donated new and gently used home goods and children’s toys for the newly housed.
DHS Director Laura Zeilinger said the initiative would not have been successful without community members’ support.
“It’s through the gracious and rapid response of our community partners and stakeholders that we’ve reached the placement goal of this ambitious campaign,” Zeilinger wrote in the Jan. 10 news release. “Our work doesn’t end here. We continue to ask landlords and District residents to work with us to reform the homeless services system and end long-term homelessness in the District.”
The final week of the program coincided with #PathwaysTotheMiddleClass Week, during which Mayor Bowser highlighted several of the programs her administration launched to expand economic prosperity across the District.
Home for the Holidays, as well as the greater Homeward D.C. plan, has eased the struggle to find affordable housing experienced by the District’s poorest. Edweana Rucker, a student who has a 2-year-old son and works part time, expressed her appreciation for the assistance provided by the initiative.
“It’s been a real struggle for me, so this is a very good opportunity,” Rucker told WTOP in December. “We’re excited, so thank you.”

Students pursuing university recognition of a graduate teaching assistant labor union will continue activism to persuade administrators to accept their proposal for the right to vote following a university email announcing new willingness to reexamine the issue of unionization.
In a Jan. 9 email, Provost Robert Groves and Executive Vice President for Health Sciences Edward Healton amended a Dec. 4 decision not to recognize a unionizing proposal from the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees, a graduate student group working with the American Federation of Teachers, to create a labor union. Groves and Healton wrote that the university would consider GAGE’s proposal to work with “a neutral third party rather than the NLRB.”
GAGE plans to continue their efforts to unionize by organizing with the National Labor Relations Board or American Arbitration Association, groups that take action to safeguard employees’ right to organize and to decide whether to have unions serve as their bargaining representative with their employer. GAGE members will accomplish this by administering elections in order to comply with the university’s request that all unions have a legal vote about whether or not they want union representation.
The Office of the Provost declined to recognize GAGE’s proposal, setting back a nearly yearlong effort by graduate teaching assistants to establish a union, after saying the university regards its relationship with graduate student teaching assistants as that of an educational institution and its studentsnot of an employer and its employees, protected by its Just Employment Policy.
This new announcement also comes after the Dec. 7 resignation of seven of the eleven committee members of the Advisory Committee on Business Practices, a group of students, professors and administrators formed by President DeGioia in 2004 to address labor compensation and other workplace issues at Georgetown.
Members of the ACBP resigned after unanimously passing a resolution urging the university to recognize the rights of graduate students to unionize during a meeting with the Provost and other senior administrators Dec. 7.
“Instead of raising this issue with the standing university committee created by President DeGioia specifically to consider labor issues on campus and to advise on the implementation of the JEP, the university opted for a rushed, unilateral, and poorly considered decision-making process,” members of the ACBP wrote in their letter of resignation.
While this language was repeated in the Jan. 9 letter, Groves and Healton expressed the university’s willingness to reconsider GAGE’s proposal.
“Georgetown is seriously considering this proposal to determine whether it might provide an opportunity for a framework that recognizes that our graduate students’ relationship with the University is fundamentally an educational one, while also responding to some graduate students’ desire to have a stronger voice in our continuing work to create the conditions under which they can flourish,” Groves and Hearst wrote.
According to the letter, this decision was reached in part due to GAGE’s willingness to enter into an agreement for an election that would be administered by a neutral third party rather than the NLRB.
Former members of the ACBP said failing to recognize graduate students’ rights to unionize flouts Georgetown values and national labor law. The NLRB has issued varied rulings over the past four decades on whether graduate students in certain teaching and research positions at private universities are eligible for unionization. The National Labor Relations Board ruled in 2016 the graduate assistants are employees.
“To uphold current labor law, our values, and our institutional integrity, the university should recognize the rights of graduate assistants to hold a union election. By refusing to recognize these rights, the university is abandoning its principles and its past practice of recognizing the rights of workers to choose a representative for collective bargaining,” former ACPB members wrote in their resolution.
Obed Ventura (SFS ’19), one of the members of ACBP who resigned in December, has cast doubt that the university’s recent response reflects its genuine intentions.
“They are blatantly violating a ruling, in my opinion, in order to wait until Trump’s appointments to the [National Labor Relations Board] have a chance to reverse their previous ruling,” Ventura wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Deidre Nelms, a third-year doctoral student and a member of GAGE, said the efforts conducted by members of GAGE, including a letter written and signed by 50 faculty members, planting flags in Healy circle and the resignation of members of the ACBP all contributed to the change in the University’s policy towards graduate student unionization.
“The university has since changed its stance, as a result of public pressure and graduate organizing,” Nelms wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Ventura said he hopes the resignation of the majority of ACBP members will push the university to listen to the demands of students and committees before students must resort to more extreme actions like sit-ins and resignations.
“I hope they realize they cannot just establish committees and then not go to them because they don’t like the advice we will give them,” Ventura wrote in an email to the Hoya.
Groves and Healton said the administration is willing to work with GAGE to improve graduate student resources.
“We want to continue working with graduate students, including all of you, to determine how best to enhance the resources offered to students. We will continue, for example, to increase stipends and to work with students on ideas for enhancing graduate-student health insurance, working with outside experts to develop specific options for consideration,” they wrote in a letter to GAGE members December 4.

“GAGE plans to continue their efforts to unionize by organizing with the National Labor Relations Board or American Arbitration Association, groups that take action to safeguard employees’ right to organize and to decide whether to have unions serve as their bargaining representative with their employer.”
This is not an accurate sentence. NLRB is not a group, it is a government body that issues legally binding labor rules. AAA is just a general group of arbitrators, who Georgetown and GAGE may use to privately settle the negotiations for a union vote. It has no particular expertise or interest in safeguarding employees’ right to organize.

Undergraduate tuition rates in the 2018-19 academic year are set to increase by 3.5 percent to $53,520 from $51,720, Provost Robert Groves announced in a campuswide email Wednesday.
The increase, identical to last year’s change, falls below the university’s earlier projections for 4 percent hikes through 2020. Tuition has risen every year since 2012, when full-time undergraduates paid $46,200 annually. The rate of increase has slowed slightly in more recent years. Last year’s 3.5 percent hike followed a 4 percent increase in 2016 and a 4.3 percent increase in 2015.
Groves emphasized greater support for students in the form of financial aid. Specifically, he committed to allocating over $200 million for financial aid next year, the university’s largest ever investment according to Groves.
Rates for housing are also slated to increase, according to Groves. Room rates for residence halls, upperclassmen suites and apartments will increase by 2 percent and rates for townhouses will increase 3.6 percent for single rooms and 4 percent for double and triple rooms.
Meal plan costs are set to increase by 4 percent from the 2017-18 academic year level, though students will be offered a range of new meal plans to customize their spending. The cost of study abroad programs will also increase to $26,670 from $25,860, in line with the overall rise.
“In setting tuition rates, we must balance the competing needs of academic programs, students, faculty, staff, facilities and infrastructure,” Groves wrote in the email. “We continue to prioritize cost containment efforts, and have renewed our commitment to securing scholarship funding.”
To fulfill its competing interests, the university expects to direct 43 percent of tuition funds to instruction and 21 percent to financial aid and graduate student support.
“We are actively working to minimize tuition increases, and we maintain our deep commitment to attracting the brightest students regardless of their financial circumstances,” Groves wrote.
Georgetown relies on withdrawals from its endowment – 5.6 percent of the total fund, according to the Investment Office – to finance scholarships.
Compared to the endowments of top 20 schools on U.S. News and World Report’s National Universities Ranking, Georgetown’s $1.484 billion endowment is the smallest. Emory University and University of California Berkeley, which rank directly below Georgetown, have endowments of $6.402 billion and $4.045 billion, respectively.
“Georgetown is one of only a few dozen colleges that maintain a commitment to a ‘need-blind, meet-full-need’ admission and financial aid policy for undergraduates, meaning that every student admitted to Georgetown through a rigorous selection process can attend regardless of their ability to pay,” Groves wrote.
The Office of the Provost, Georgetown University Student Association and Georgetown University Graduate Student Government hosted a roundtable on tuition in November to solicit student feedback and explain university expenses.
In his campuswide email, Groves acknowledged the burden on students inevitable in increasing tuition.
“We are very much aware of the significant investments students and families make to pursue a Georgetown education,” Groves wrote. “University leaders, faculty and staff take these investments seriously and work hard each year to reduce direct costs, increase philanthropic support for scholarships and mitigate rising expenses of providing a Georgetown education.”

So essentially anyone who pays full tuition is subsidizing $11,239.20 toward someone else’s tuition and $19.267.20 to non-instructor costs (e.g., fat administration, inefficiency, etc.). Higher education in 2018 is a total joke and a total SCAM. For shame, Georgetown, for shame.
