Eleven bicycles have been stolen from a variety of locations on campus since the beginning of 2011, and seven of the thefts occurred in the past two weeks.
Most of the stolen bikes had been attached to bike racks with cable locks, which are not as secure as metal U-locks, according to Joseph Smith, associate director of the Department of Public Safety.
John Accarino (COL ’14) discovered Sunday that his bicycle had been stolen from the bike rack just outside Darnall Hall.
“I came outside Sunday morning, my chain was clipped, and the bike was gone,” Accarino said. “You could see that they used a hedge clipper.”
Accarino said he thought that the thief would probably sell his bicycle for scrap metal.
“My bike was such a piece of junk. The brakes don’t work,” he said. “It’s been my bike since I was 12 years old.”
Bikes have also been stolen from racks outside Village A, O’Donovan Hall, Reynolds, Copley, the Hariri Building and Yates Fields House, among other campus locations.
This increase in bike thefts marks a reversal of recent trends, according to Smith. The number of bike thefts had gone down over the past several years, he said.
There were 30 bike thefts in 2009 and 44 bike thefts in 2010, according to DPS crime log archives.
Campus police are taking measures to address the recent surge in bike thefts, Smith said.
“DPS has stepped up its uniform patrols of the bike racks and plans to take other operational measures as well,” Smith said in an email.
Meanwhile, Smith urged students to be cautious.
“We recommend that students use the U-locks for their bikes, to check their bikes frequently and to report suspicious persons around the bike racks to DPS,” Smith said in an email.

With the last of the 2010 Census data in, D.C. is set to redraw its districts beginning next month.
This year, the process has become even more contentious than usual because of a push to ensure that D.C.’s 100,000 graduate and undergraduate students are fairly represented.
Justin Wagner (COL ’03) was one of two student Advisory Neighborhood Commission representatives in 2001 when the current ANC districts were drawn. He and Justin Kopa (COL ’03), the other student representative from 2001, drew up a plan that would have divided districts more equally among students and residents.
“We were really concerned with making sure that students and residents had an opportunity to interact, and we thought having more mixed districts facilitated a conversation that was very helpful,” Wagner said. “We thought it would be better for people to be in a district and work together and find a candidate that would appeal to both sides, as opposed to packing all the students in one district and all the neighbors in another.”
According to Wagner, the proposal gained a great deal of support among students and residents. But the need for a consensus required that Kopa and Wagner compromise some aspects of their plan, resulting in the ANC districts as they are today.
“I don’t think it was the perfect plan and at the time I advocated for a different approach,” Wagner said of the current organization of districts. “But ultimately I don’t think it was unfair.”
Current students, however, say that the way the districts were arranged in 2001 was unfair, purposefully excluding students.
DC Students Speak, a student group with representatives from five of the city’s seven major universities, is trying to get more students engaged in the process of reorganizing districts. According to the group’s co-chair Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13), the seven districts of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E are drawn in a way that limits student voices.
Georgetown has 6,000 undergraduates and each of the seven single-member districts in ANC 2E consists of 2,000 people. Students are spread out among four single-member districts, only one of which is represented by a student.
“There could easily be three Georgetown ANC representatives, but there aren’t,” Stirrett said. “That largely has to do with redistricting. That’s the fundamental factor … Throughout D.C., the ANCs are gerrymandered in a way that minimizes student involvement.”
Currently, Jake Sticka (COL ’13) is the only Georgetown student representative serving in ANC 2E. He represents a single-member district that includes New South, Village A, Village C and the Southwest Quadrangle. The remainder of campus is divided among three other single-member districts that also include swaths of the Georgetown neighborhood, making it difficult for any of those districts to elect a student representative.
“I would agree that the boundaries as they currently are do inhibit more than one Georgetown University student from being elected,” Sticka said. “I think it is fair to say that the current system has led to underrepresentation for Georgetown students. It’s definitely a problem.”
Stirrett said that the current ANCs could be detrimental to the student voice.
“[A lack of students elected to ANCs] will cause a decline in student activism in D.C. It’s really important that we draw seats that are competitive, that are fair, and that’s not how things are now,” he said.
In an effort to ensure students are better represented, DC Students Speak is planning a drive to get students more involved in the redistricting process. Stirrett said that he is hoping to get students on the Ward Task Force, a body appointed by city council members that is responsible for redrawing the districts. He eventually hopes to help draft a student proposal for how the districts should be mapped out.
“If we’re looking at the endgame of making sure student interests are represented in the District of Columbia, students need to be involved in redistricting,” Stirrett said.
Sticka also stressed the importance of student involvement in the process.
“Students being aware of the prospect, being vocal about the prospect and showing that they do know about what’s happening and they do care will ensure that [the districts] are drawn fairly. If students make it clear that this is something that is important to them, then that’s something that has to be responded to,” he said.
Representatives of ANC 2E declined to comment. D.C. Councilman Jack Evans could not be reached for comment.

Georgetown said goodbye to one of its leaders Thursday evening, and a sheepish smile played across the face of Daniel Porterfield (COL ’79) as he exited stage-right to a dramatic round of applause.
Porterfield, vice president of strategic development, was honored one final time during a reception in Copley Formal Lounge before he leaves today to begin preparing for his new role as President of Franklin and Marshall University in Lancaster, Pa. He assumes his new position on March 1.
“I feel like I’m bringing a lot of Georgetown with me to Franklin and Marshall,” Porterfield said in an exclusive interview with The Hoya two weeks ago. “Georgetown has a belief in our students, in their talent, in their potential. Education is about inspiring people to become the best they can be — that’s something I learned from Georgetown professors past.”
University President John J. DeGioia served as the host of the reception, which included Georgetown senior administrators, Jesuits, Georgetown alums, students and friends and family of the Porterfields.
“[Porterfield] has been a leader, teacher, colleague, mentor and friend on the Hilltop,” DeGioia said in his opening remarks. He later presented Porterfield with a parting gift — a replica of the original charter of Georgetown University passed by the House of Representatives.
“It’s hard to know what [ideas were] me and what were you,” Porterfield said of DeGioia. “Thank you for having faith in me.”
DeGioia (COL ’79, GRD ’95) first met Porterfield when the latter was a sophomore living in Copley Hall and the future university president was serving as the hall director. Porterfield would eventually find himself back in Copley in 2003, living in the basement of the hall with his wife, Karen Hurling (COL ’80), and their three daughters. The couple met while both were working as resident assistants and were eventually married in Dahlgren Chapel by Fr. Otto Hentz, S.J., a former professor of Porterfield’s.
“I do have blue and gray blood in my veins. I’m always an alumnus. I was formed, in many ways, at Georgetown,” Porterfield said in his exit interview, discussing his continuing relation with the university. “But also, anyone who has ever taught somebody has a continuing responsibility to that student.”
According to DeGioia, Porterfield has done more than live up to that heavy responsibility.
“You have given so many Hoyas the opportunity to understand what it means to live in and contribute to and create community,” a teary-eyed DeGioia said before an eruption of applause.
Recruited by former University President Fr. Leo O’Donovan, S.J., to return to the Hilltop in 1997, Porterfield only agreed to work for the administration on the grounds that he was allowed to teach, prompting his hiring and eventual tenure in the English department. Porterfield’s last course was entitled “Those Who Teach, Lead,” which took 27 students to New York for a weekend last fall to meet with leaders in education.
“I think real education grows out of each individual’s needs. As a professor, you try to be responsive to each person’s eminent individuality,” Porterfield said two weeks ago. “There are times where I haven’t been as aware as I’ve wanted to be. But you try, and people appreciate if you try.”
Living up to the title of his course, Porterfield has been instrumental in developing a relationship between the Cristo Rey Network and Georgetown, which, according to Porterfield, is the leader in matriculating students from Cristo Rey.
“We’re number one in recognizing the extraordinary achievement of the students who graduate from Cristo Rey,” Porterfield said. “We have outcompeted Brown, Duke, Northwestern and Chicago, for specific students, in the last few years, and it is great to see us set a goal and go achieve that goal.”
Reina Garcia (COL ’11), a student from Cristo Rey Chicago, has interned for Porterfield for three years and now serves as a mentor for 24 Cristo Rey high school students.
“I probably would not be at Georgetown right now if it weren’t for you,” Garcia said to Porterfield at the going-away party. “I cannot imagine Georgetown without you.”
Porterfield also leaves behind a legacy of heavy involvement in the D.C. Schools Project and Teach for America. He previously served as interim athletic director from 2009 to 2010, when the current AD, Lee Reed, was hired.
“We will miss Dan,” Reed said. “Athletics certainly, but the university and students will feel the impact of not having him around. But he has a great opportunity in front of him.”
Porterfield acknowledged that had Reed not come along, he would have served another year as AD. Yet fate intervened, and Porterfield plans on teaching a course at his new home next spring, depending on what the students want him to teach.
“You remove one person, it doesn’t make much of a difference,” Porterfield said at the event last night. “The network is [Georgetown’s] strength.”
Porterfield then raised his phone, and began discussing a different type of network.
“I’ve announced on Facebook that I am now on Twitter!” Porterfield said to laughter. “So I’m sending my first tweet right here from the podium: ‘To Georgetown, from the Porterfield’s, thank you and we love you.'”

A new proposal to reform the Residential Judiciary Council — a body of students and administrators who oversee the discipline of peers who violate the residence hall code of conduct — would reinstate the council and establish position elections for the first time.
The reform was presented at a town hall meeting Tuesday night, and a final version will be passed on to administrators for approval this week. If approved, elections for the representatives will occur in March.
The council was put on hiatus this academic year due to persistent criticism and a lack of student interest.
“The approach we’re taking, I hope, will motivate students to want to be a part of this,” Ed Gilhool said. Gilhool is the associate director of Residence Life and was the council’s advisor before it was discontinued this fall.
Founded in 1999, a year which saw an unusually high number of disciplinary infractions, the RJC aimed to foster an environment of student responsibility. Before it was put on hold, the council handled Category A violations of the Code of Student Conduct, which include defacement, disorderly conduct, minor alcohol and drug offenses, ID card offenses, noise violations, violation of the guest and party registration policies and other housing rule infractions. The council also dealt with the simplest Category B violations, which are typically more serious and largely handled by the administration.
In recent years, however, some felt that the council was not doing its job.
“The RJC had been sort of shrouded in mystery for a long time,” said Natalie Punchak (COL ’11), a former chairperson of the council and one of the four members of the student review team that proposed the reforms.
Shea Houlihan (SFS ’13), InterHall’s vice president for student advocacy and a review team member for the council, said that last year a majority of InterHall members did not realize that the RJC even existed.
“There were just a lot of misconceptions,” he said.
The students on the review council hope that the reforms will change these perceptions.
Each class would elect three representatives, with freshmen elections to be held in fall. Previously, students applied to be a councilor through the Office of Residence Life.
“We not only gain greater visibility; we also gain a greater ability to represent students,” Punchak said.
The reform would also shift sanctions away from the more traditional ones imposed by the administration and streamline the meeting process. Instead of meeting four nights a week, the group would meet once a week with a different set of members each hour to hear cases.
Members of the review team said they hoped the change would make the time commitment more manageable for students interested in joining.
The basic structure of the council would remain the same under the current proposal. Sessions would consist of one chairperson, three student councilors and one hall director.
Although not all details of the proposal have been finalized yet, the review team plans to submit a revised proposal to the administration next week. If it is approved, they will host a second town hall meeting during the first week of March.
The March session would also serve as a meeting for students interested in running for positions on the council; elections would be held a week later. Punchak said she hoped the partnership with Georgetown University Student Association and InterHall would encourage a wide variety of candidates to apply.
“My hope is that this is seen as a leadership opportunity,” Gilhool said.
Ryan Gavigan (COL ’11), a resident advisor and the InterHall president, said that as a campus resident he felt it was important for students to have an option like the RJC.
“It was frankly a shame that we discontinued it,” he said. “But I’m excited for these new ideas. I think they’ve done some wonderful work.”
Gavigan said that he was concerned about some of the finer points of the proposals, however.
“There still needs to be some work on hashing out the details.”
Tyler Holl (COL ’13), a member of the Honor Council, said he was excited to see the RJC return.
“It’s important to have that student input,” he said. “College students are adults.”
Holl also said he supported the proposal to hold elections for the council positions.
“When student voices are heard, it’s the voices that students themselves have picked.”

At Georgetown, landing a dream internship or job can be as difficult as maintaining a full-time job, and not just because of the competitive interview process.
Faculty attitudes on attendance policy and having to schedule on and off-campus interviews vary. Students often find it difficult to juggle academic commitments, post-Georgetown career goals and having to miss class to accommodate first and second-round interviews for summer internships and jobs.
“The process is stressful and demanding. At one point I missed an entire week of classes for final-round interviews that were all crammed into a few days,” Andrew Brewster (COL ’11) said. “Aside from that, even when you can schedule appointments around classes there is almost no time for homework or writing papers.”
Already under pressure due to the current employment situation, most students will prioritize job interviews ahead of class attendance.
“I always put interview opportunities in front of academic commitments. I will make a reasonable effort to go to class, but getting a job is my number-one priority,” Andrew Provost (MSB ’13) said. “Once you get a job, especially in finance, it doesn’t really matter how well you do in school.”
Sometimes it may not be just the time conflict between the interview and class, but also the taxing nature of the job search process that leads students to miss class.
“I tried to schedule interviews around class, but even so, I mentally have not been in class,” Todd Reese (MSB ’12) said. “I’ve skipped some class after interviews because mentally it is impossible to unwind.”
According to Mike Schaub, executive director of the Career Education Center, the official policy of the center is that students have the flexibility to schedule first-round interviews around their schedule. For second-round interviews, employers must always offer alternate dates if the time originally offered conflicts with another first-round interview or academic commitment.
“In the event of a conflict, our recruiting team advises the student how to approach a recruiter to request an alternative second-round option,” Schaub said. “We also let students know that we are willing to directly approach employers on their behalf when there is a scheduling conflict.”
While Schaub stated that students’ candidacies are not negatively impacted by requests to reschedule a second-round interview, students still feel pressure to always accommodate the potential employers’ requests.
“Given how competitive some of these positions are, and how qualified I know my fellow classmates are, I see it as completely possible on a subconscious or maybe even conscious level that postponing a final round would adversely impact my chances of getting the job,” Lin Chen (SFS ’11) said.
Aside from being a potential inconvenience to firms, rescheduling a second-round interview may also indicate that the student is not serious about the opportunity.
“To me, asking to reschedule isn’t an option, as it shows that you aren’t committed. I missed all my classes last week because of interviews,” Reese said.
Faculty members have varying attendance policies for their courses and also have different perspectives on how to treat absences that result from interviews. Some place the blame on employers.
“I think it is inconsiderate and obnoxious for employers to assign interview times without asking students about their class schedules and for them to assume that students will skip their classes in order to attend an interview,” said Marc Howard, a professor in the government department.
For many professors, the majority of the responsibility to minimize class absences still falls on the students.
“Even those seeking jobs need to remember that they are still students at Georgetown and respect that status as well as their teachers and classmates,” said Rebecca Boylan, a lecturer in the English department.
While Howard generally considers these absences to be unexcused, other faculty members take different approaches.
“The students should not be penalized in any way for missing a class for an interview, unless it is a special class. Professors need to announce special classes that cannot be missed long before the class,” said David Walker, a professor in the McDonough School of Business.
Marius Schwartz, a professor in the economics department, agreed.
“I realize that job interviews are a ‘necessary evil’ so I’m willing to excuse one to two absences, provided the student makes up the work by getting notes from a classmate and seeing me later if there are remaining questions,” Schwartz said.
Some professors may not place as much emphasis on day-to-day attendance as much as general performance in the course.
“My attitude has always been that university students should be able to manage their time themselves and to make choices responsibly. If they feel they need to miss class then I leave that entirely up to them,” said Billy Jack, an associate professor in the economics department.
Upperclassmen have had varying experiences when working with professors during recruiting seasons.
“When necessary, my professors were extremely understanding and accommodating, allowing me to push back work and, in one case, granting me an extension for two weeks on a big paper,” Brewster said. “I got the sense that most professors realized what seniors were going through and were more than happy to work with us.”
According to Reese, one of his professors requested that he receive confirmation from the dean’s office to ensure that he would be in New York for an interview. For another course, his professor set up time to review the material, but still gave him zero credit on the pop quizzes that he missed.
Both students and faculty members say constant communication remains the solution to relieving tension between both parties.
“I am not sure that there is one right answer and compromise is always the best response,” Jeff Oliver, instructor in the Landegger Program in International Business Diplomacy, said.
Brewster said that he understands both sides of the issue and stated that students and professors must come together to form a solution that is acceptable to both.
“Professors are justified in wanting the student to do his utmost to schedule around classes and his academic obligations, the real reason we are here at Georgetown,” Brewster said. “However, sometimes that is simply impossible and professors should be flexible as long as the student has legitimate conflicts, respectfully approaches the professor in advance and makes it clear that he will get the work done in due time.”

Funding for District programs hangs in the balance as negotiations for the 2012 fiscal budget continue this month.
President Obama’s budget proposal, which was released on Feb. 14, allotted funds to the District to support job creation, the public and charter school systems and the Metro transit system. The budget would also support for Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton’s (D-D.C.) home rule objective, which calls for allowing the D.C. budget to be passed without congressional review, according to a Feb. 14 press release from Norton’s office.
“The president’s budget focuses directly on our highest priorities, largely preserving our federal funding for jobs, education and Metro in particular,” Norton said in the press release.
The budget also increases funds for higher education. It provides $2.5 million for the Community College of the District of Columbia and $35 million for the District’s Tuition Assistance Grant program, which provides District residents with grants to attend state and private schools. Since its launch in 2000, DCTAG has helped double college attendance in the District, according to the D.C. government website.
“The funds for DCTAG are indispensible for our students in college and those who will go next year at a time when the jobs in this region increasingly require college training,” Norton said in the release.
Other provisions would continue funding for HIV/AIDS prevention programs, the local court system, the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority and create a $5 million grant for local non-profit art organizations.
But Republicans in the House are looking to cut District spending in an attempt to save federal funds. Last week the GOP proposed a spending resolution that would remove $80 million worth of federal payments to the District, according to The Washington Post.
Targeted budgets would include the District’s public school system, the “Reconnecting Disconnected Youth” program and a controversial needle exchange program, among others. Local officials are especially worried about additional cuts that would remove $150 million of funding from Metro over the next eight months, according to The Washington Post.

A new order passed by the Metropolitan Police Department allows university police officers to take a more active role in handling off-campus incidents involving students.
MPD officers have been directed to inform campus police departments when they receive calls from campus-affiliated locations, such as off-campus student residence buildings. Per the new orders, they should also invite the campus police to respond to the site, according to the Georgetown Dish.
Georgetown officials are pleased that members of the university’s Department of Public Safety will now consistently be present when students interact with city law enforcement agents, according to Georgetown Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh.
“This order makes clear that campus safety officers and MPD work cooperatively to address incidents on or near campuses. The order does not extend jurisdiction but does allow campuses and MPD to work together to best allocate safety resources,” Pugh wrote in an email.
Jake Sticka (COL ’13), the student representative to Georgetown’s Advisory Neighborhood Commission, said that this protocol is a positive development.
“In general, I think this should be a welcome change for students. If anything, [DPS officers] will moderate the response from the MPD,” Sticka said.
John Mitchell (COL ’13), who lives in the off-campus residence LXR Hall, expressed approval for the new order, but had some reservations.
“If you’ve made a call to the Metropolitan Police, but you’re still on campus jurisdiction, it seems fair to involve DPS or whatever campus officials,” he said. “But, it would seem unfair if you were doubly penalized for any illegal activity by MPD and DPS.”
The new policy is the result of dialogue between MPD and the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area.
Georgetown ANC Commissioner Ed Solomon said that he thinks MPD will continue to respond to all 911 calls. MPD will notify campus police when the calls come from properties that are owned or controlled by the university, but not necessarily if they are called to locations where students live outside of the university’s jurisdiction, such as group houses.
“It’s a courtesy to the campus police,” Solomon said.
The new order comes shortly after the enactment of the noise law amendment that enacts stricter punishments for violations.
Students hope that the presence of DPS officers will ensure that they receive fair, reasonable punishment for any transgressions.
“If you’re abiding by the same rules of campus housing, even if you’re technically off campus, I think it’s fair that you’re held accountable,” Mitchell said.
MPD and DPS could not be reached for comment.

With a $350 million capital campaign for faculty excellence in the works and a new science building on the horizon, the university’s evolving role as a research institution is becoming more vital than ever before.
“The mission of a research university is both to create new knowledge — research — and advance that knowledge — teaching. Conducting research keeps faculty members highly engaged in the latest developments in their field, which is then translated into classroom experience for students,” said Timothy Barbari, associate provost for research, in an email. “Students who get to share in research, either directly through their participation or indirectly through the classroom, develop a high sense of the importance of lifelong learning.”
Georgetown officials certainly recognize the need for more research. At the spring 2011 faculty town hall meeting on Feb. 3, University President John J. DeGioia described the $350 million capital campaign’s goal for faculty excellence.
“This pillar of the campaign is a way to strengthen Georgetown’s excellence in our academic mission … supporting a more balanced and diverse portfolio of academic strengths in what we know is a very competitive landscape for higher education,” DeGioia said.
Part of this campaign could provide funding for research programs on campus. But deciding who gets a piece of the pie brings departmental interests to the foreground.
Professor YuYe Tong, chair of the chemistry department, says that the sciences are in need of the most funding. “[Georgetown] wants to define [itself] as a student-centered research university. But in doing that, you need a leadership that has the courage to put money into science, not once but in a sustainable way,” Tong said. “A strong, nationally competitive, internationally competitive science program is a must.”
He added that the sciences require more costly equipment to effectively engage in research.
“In terms of humanities and social sciences, you need a desk, a brain, a computer and you can do your research,” he said.
But professor John Morrell, chair of the art and art history department, said in an email that his program could also benefit from increased capital campaign funding.
“With increased support for faculty excellence, art and art history faculty would have additional funds for research travel, art supplies and studio spaces,” Morrell said. “Eventually, we plan to have faculty and visiting artist studios on or near campus. This would enhance faculty research and dramatically increase the learning opportunities for students to interact with faculty in their professional research activities.”
The capital campaign’s timing coincides with a rising interest in research, according to Sonia Jacobson, director of the Georgetown Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program. GUROP is funded by the Office of the Provost as well as by individual faculty members’ research grants. The new capital campaign will expand funding for various initiatives and grants as well as infrastructure.

A Georgetown debate team won its first automatic invitation to the national debate championship since 1998.
Andrew Markoff (SFS ’14) and Richard Day (SFS ’14), a team of two freshman debaters, learned earlier this week that their team had been approved for a guaranteed bid, which will send them to the University of Texas in Dallas at the end of March to debate in the national championship. Theirs is the second all-freshman team in the tournament’s history to be named in the first round at large.
The round awards an advance spot to the top 16 debate teams in the country. In order to be approved, teams compete in six to eight tournaments during the regular debate year and then apply for approval from a national committee.
Now that they have received the committee’s blessing, Markoff and Day will spend the next month and half preparing for the tournament by researching and developing debate strategies that they hope will give them a leg up on their opponents.
According to Debate Coach Jonathan Paul, the duo has an enormous amount of preparation ahead of them.
“To put it into perspective, these guys will all spend their spring break doing research,” Paul said.
Though the invitation assures the team a place in the tournament, it does not guarantee that they will see success in Dallas. According to Paul, the team will face formidable opponents.
“This gets you there, but it doesn’t at all effect how you do at that tournament,” Paul said.
Markoff agreed, saying that the competition will prove difficult.
“There are definitely people who it would be a surprise if we beat,” he said.
To that end, Markoff and Day plan to log a number of hours studying emigration policy, which is the topic of this year’s national debate for universities.
“There’s a hundred different things you can say about emigration policy,” Paul said. “There’s kind of a surprise value if you have ideas that people aren’t prepared to debate against.”
The team’s success has largely been due to its commitment. Markoff said that he and Day have been honing their style and content since before the academic year, forfeiting much along the way.
“You don’t get a lot of sleep, and you miss some of the basketball games” Markoff said. “You have to make some sacrifices like that. We get here early and we have to stay over spring break.”
Georgetown Debate is also planning to send another team to the district championships in hopes that it will qualify for the national tournament as well. Most teams that attend the 72-team championship win their spots through such district tournaments, which pit local teams against each other with the winner advancing.
According to team members Anton Strezhnev (SFS ’13) and Andrew Arsht (COL ’14), the key to advancing past the district level lies in knowing and outsmarting your opponents.
“My partner and I are going to pull out new tricks,” Arsht said. “We’ve seen the competition at this tournament before, and this gives us a little insight into what we are facing.”
According to Paul, Georgetown Debate has seen a remarkable amount of success already.
“We’ve been advancing two teams to the elimination rounds at national tournaments,” Paul said. “That hasn’t happened in a decade.”
