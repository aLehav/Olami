New transportation options are coming to Georgetown just in time for the holiday travel season, with multiple low-cost airlines moving into Ronald Reagan National Airport last Monday and Amtrak expanding its rail options.
JetBlue, a small airline known for its competitive prices, began flights from Ronald Reagan National Airport on Nov. 1. Its fares for travelers who buy tickets on the spot are now the lowest walk-up fares at Reagan Airport.
JetBlue now offers seven daily flights from Reagan to Boston Logan National Airport, one daily flight to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and one flight to Orlando International Airport.
Despite JetBlue’s reputation for low prices, its arrival at Reagan will not necessarily have significant impact on students’ travel plans this year. Baltimore-Washington International Airport remains a practical option for students, offering flights from Southwest Airlines and AirTran, JetBlue’s competitors.
“I didn’t think about JetBlue,” Neil Menon (MSB ’13) said. “I usually take Southwest. BWI is farther, but because fewer people fly out of it, they usually have lower-priced tickets.”
Lauren Meigs (COL ’11), also flies out of BWI Airport because JetBlue’s scope is not wide enough.
“It is cheaper to fly from BWI, so I take I bus there,” she said. “[I would consider JetBlue] if they were to have lower prices and were going to my destination.”
Southwest does not currently fly from Reagan due to a government slot system that regulates the amount of takeoff and landing spots offered to each airline. However, a merger between Southwest and AirTran announced in late September will allow Southwest to establish service there.
In addition to new airline options, a new Metrorail line to Dulles International Airport set to be completed in 2016 will improve Georgetown’s access to the airport. The new Silver line, which will be added to the Washington, D.C. Metrorail System, contains 11 new stops, including one at the Dulles International Airport. Dulles is currently only accessible by bus or taxi.
The new line is expected to make transport between Dulles Corridor in Northern Virginia to downtown D.C. faster and more cost-effective. Georgetown students said that they think it would make travel more
convenient.
“I normally drive to Dulles, but I would probably take the Metro,” grad student Peter Sima said. “I’d probably spend a lot less [using the Metro].”
Students traveling home by train will also have more travel options come Thanksgiving. Amtrak, the nation’s largest train system, has also made significant improvements to its services. Amtrak has added wireless service to the Acela route from D.C. to Boston, and plans to extend the service nationwide. Amtrak also has plans to add faster trains to the Acela route starting in 2013.
In addition, Amtrak has announced plans to upgrade the Acela route to cut the time to travel between D.C. and Boston to three and a half hours. The project will take $118 billion and 25 years to complete, however.”

Georgetown grad Denis McDonough (MSFS ’96) was appointed deputy national security adviser to President Obama two weeks ago.
He is replacing Thomas Donilon, who was promoted to the position of national security adviser earlier last month.
“For years, I have counted on McDonough’s expertise and counsel on national security issues,” Obama said in a press release. “He possesses a remarkable intellect, irrepressible work ethic and a sense of collegiality that has earned him the respect of his colleagues.”
cDonough’s alma mater congratulated McDonough on his appointment.
“[Masters in the School of Foreign Service program] is very proud of Denis McDonough,” Director of Georgetown’s MSFS Anthony Clark Arend said. “He reflects the best of the MSFS tradition as a person who came here with a commitment to service and has now moved into a position [in which] he is able to serve the country and serve the international system.”
cDonough has worked in the government and public service for most of his life. After his graduation from Saint John’s University in 1992, he worked as a high school teacher in Belize. He returned to the United States to enroll in Georgetown’s MSFS program.
“He was a diligent, respectful and earnest student,” history professor John McNeill said. McNeill taught McDonough in a first-year required history course. McNeill described McDonough as “a nice guy [and] a great basketball player,” but also “as hardworking as anyone in the executive branch.”
“When an opportunity comes up, he’s prepared and he seizes it,” McNeill said.
cDonough went on to work in Congress as an aide and foreign policy adviser and has served as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. He was one of Obama’s top foreign policy advisers during the campaign, and prior to this promotion he was chief of staff of the National Security Council.
“[McDonough’s] commitment to service, his commitment to the higher goals of humanity, are part of something that has animated the School of Foreign Service,” Arend said. “He stands out as an exemplar of the type of activity we love to see our alumni engaging in.”
cDonough is among many Georgetown graduates serving in the White House, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (GRD ’74) and White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer (COL ’98).”

The cobwebs that have grown in the abandoned tunnels located beneath Dupont Circle may soon be cleared away to make room for a new arts district in the area, as the city attempts to reclaim the potentially valuable space.
The space was used for transportation and storage until the mid-1990s, but has not been used since. In July 2010, however, the Arts Coalition submitted a proposal for renovating the space. The coalition plans to create an arts institute that will contain galleries and art studios.
“By reclaiming this ideally sited piece of subterranean infrastructure . we seek to establish a local and emergent arts institution that will put the city on the cultural map,” The Arts Coalition for Dupont Underground stated on its website.
On Oct. 20, the coalition released initial plans for the project. The coalition said that work can begin as soon as the new lease is approved. The tunnels are public property owned by the city; evaluations can only take place once a lease has been negotiated.
According to the coalition’s website, the project will take about two years to complete and will cost about $10 million.
All plans are still in the preliminary stages, however, Robin Diener, president of the Dupont Circle Citizens Association, said.
“There are no plans for funding – it’s all speculation at this point,” Diener said.
Diener also said that the city will not pay for the development or the evaluation of the space. She stressed that the community, the coalition and city officials must collaborate more to develop a feasible plan.
“The city doesn’t have the ability under its usual planning processes to deal with this project,” Diener said.
According to The Washington Post, the 100,000 square feet of space was used to house trolleys until 1962 and was a fallout shelter until as late as 1975. There has been one previous attempt to revamp the tunnels: a food court that opened and quickly failed in the mid-1990s. While residents have not received many details on the new project, Diener remains positive.
“Enthusiasm for the idea in the community is very high,” Diener said.”

Members and supporters of Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice delivered a letter of protest to the office of University President John J. DeGioia Thursday afternoon, citing concerns over an alleged lack of administration support for reproductive rights issues on campus.
Before making their way to DeGioia’s office in Healy Hall, about 20 participants gathered in Red Square at 1 p.m., drawing a crowd of about 15 listeners at an event featuring students who recounted problematic experiences encountered on campus regarding reproductive issues.
As passersby crossed paths between classes, Plan A supporters held banners inscribed with messages like “What is Georgetown’s Plan A?,” and some covered their mouths with tape to represent what they considered a silencing of dialogue by the administration.
In testimonies to observers, several students cited failed attempts to acquire contraceptives, difficulties receiving the HPV vaccine on campus and the lack of coverage for contraceptive pills in Georgetown’s student health insurance package. At the end of each story, the speaker said, “My voice, my thoughts, and my needs have been silenced.”
The accounts drew some applause from the bystanders, and no students walking through Red Square expressed vocal opposition to the event.
After gathering in Red Square for about 20 minutes, about 15 of the participants walked to the president’s office, where they requested to speak to DeGioia. Once the students were informed DeGioia was not on campus, they asked to speak with a representative of the administration. While waiting for an audience, they presented the petition to an executive assistant, and a member of the group filmed statements made by the participants.
Chief of Staff Erik Smulson then listened to a prepared statement from Plan A, promising to hand over both a letter and a tape recording from the group to DeGioia.
The letter was a response to another letter sent Feb. 24 by Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson denying the group’s appeal for university support. Plan A leaders were frustrated over DeGioia’s lack of response and Olson’s reply, according to Marion Cory (COL ’10) of United Feminists, which pooled efforts with H*yas for Choice to form the nascent Plan A coalition.
Plan A was founded to address an alleged need for material and educational resources about reproductive issues on campus. According to Cory, the group represents under-served interests in the university community.
“We have support from the majority of Georgetown students. We have received a lot of positive feedback – the event was a success,” Cory said. “The feedback that is negative comes from a place of misunderstanding what this group is about. Often the issue gets polarized. This is not about that, it is about making necessary changes. This is not at all about attacking Catholic and Jesuit values, or how they are offensive to pro-choice students.”
Cory said she hopes the university changes its policy toward the group.
“This is an attempt at figuring out how the Catholic and pro-choice dialogues can coexist. It is about freedom of speech and dialogue. It is an attempt to more fully fulfill Jesuit values. It is in consistency with the moral values of the university,” Cory said.
United Feminists and H*yas for Choice plan to increase Plan A’s activity on campus in the coming weeks, according to Cory. A Plan A event slated to take place after spring break will feature three male panelists in favor of abortion rights speaking on the role of men in the abortion rights movement.
In a 5-4 vote Monday evening, the Student Activities Commission approved United Feminists’ funding request for the panel discussion, despite concerns raised by some SAC commissioners about a potential conflict with the university’s policy of denying sponsorship of groups or events in conflict with Catholic teachings.
“SAC’s vote was a great encouragement. We don’t anticipate the administration blocking SAC’s decision, and we hope some administrators come to the event,” Cory said.
