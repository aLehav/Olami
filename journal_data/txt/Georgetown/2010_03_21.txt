A burglary and theft of items valued at over $5,000 were reported in a university-owned townhouse on the 1400 Block of 36th Street Friday morning, the third in a string of burglaries and attempted burglaries this week.
The gate and rear door of the residence were unlocked, which is how the burglar gained access to the residence, according to the Public Safety Alert. Among the items stolen was a 42-inch flat-screen television. The student, who awoke at 7:40 a.m. Friday to find items missing from his residence, was unharmed.
According to Joseph Smith, associate director of the Department of Public Safety, the incident occurred in a townhouse, but DPS could not confirm whether it was linked to the burglary and attempted burglary that occurred in two townhouses on the 1200 Block of 37th Street on Monday, March 15. The investigation is ongoing, and is being handled by the Metropolitan Police Department, according to Smith. MPD was unavailable for comment.
