While University President John J. DeGioia and other top administrators formally cut the cord on the Healy Pub proposal Monday, they reassured student leaders in a meeting that their push for more social space and a greater student presence in Healy Hall could come to fruition over time.
In a long-awaited meeting of university leadership and the Healy Pub task force, the students pressed to have a say in the future of the New South Student Center pub area as well as added student space in Healy Hall. According to Georgetown University Student Association Deputy Chief of Staff and Healy Pub Student Space Working Group Leader Chris Pigott (COL ’12), the group of administrators has already warmed up to the idea.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and DeGioia each told the group that the Healy Pub Student Space Working Group would be considered “significant stakeholders” in planning for the design and functionality of the space, Pigott said. The group hopes to submit a model of its ideas, including its status as a student-run venture with administrative oversight, in the next few months.
“We deserve the ability and the right to present a model where it would work,” Pigott said, citing other universities’ successful student-run pubs.
As for Healy Hall, DeGioia said that he recognizes the need for student space in the iconic building that houses mostly classrooms and administrative offices, according to Fitz Lufkin (COL ’11, GRD ’12), the Healy Pub Project Leader and co-author of the 2010 Report on Student Space.
“They agreed that students have a right to have space in Healy. They recognized the importance of that,” Pigott said.
“They would like to move those offices, but they need a space to move them,” Lufkin added.
In order to address a call for more student-centric space in and around campus’s most prominent building, administrators said they were looking to refurbish the buildings surrounding Dahlgren Quadrangle in order to make the area a center for academic life and mission and ministry.
According to Pigott, once the university builds up enough funding for the revamp, university leaders will make it their next big project along with renovations to Lauinger Library.
Olson, Chief Operating Officer Chris Augostini, Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara and Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson weighed in on the discussion along with GUSA President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12).
GUSA Speaker Adam Talbot (COL ’12) and Chairman of GUSA’s Finance and Appropriations Committee Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) were also in attendance.

Speaking to an audience in Gaston Hall Monday night, U.S. Poet Laureate Philip Levine shared how his background as both a factory worker and professional academic has shaped his award-winning work.
Levine engaged the audience with readings of selected poems and anecdotes from his working life, which has transformed from job in a Detroit automobile factory in the1940s and 50s to a career as a renowned professor at universities nationwide.
“I decided to live on my wits,” he said.
The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Levine drew inspiration from his life experience, particularly his time at work in the auto industry.
“Those years were a gift because of the people, the sense of community, solidarity, love and tenderness,” he said.
Jennifer Luff, research director for the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor, which sponsored the event, introduced Levine as one of the few authors in contemporary literature who gives voice to modern laborers.
Levine, 83, spoke negatively of the arduous nature of his factory jobs and said that it took him a long time before he felt comfortable writing about his past.
In the works he selected to read, Levine focused heavily on individual people and memories.
“I discovered that the real wealth I had was contained with the people I worked with,” Levine said.
Levine, who was appointed poet laureate in August by the Library of Congress, has received numerous awards for his work, including the 1991 National Book Award for “What Work Is” and the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for “The Simple Truth.”
Maureen Corrigan, book critic for NPR’s Fresh Air and critic-in-residence and lecturer at Georgetown, moderated a discussion with Levine after he shared his works aloud. Corrigan addressed the role that literature and poetry currently play in movements including Occupy Wall Street.
“I’m nobody’s voice but my own,” Levine said. He expressed his desire to continue to stay involved with labor rights issues despite his appointment as poet laureate. The only real difference, he pointed out, is that the new position expands his readership.
Levine explained that he began rehearsing poetry so he could stay focused while he undertook taxing manual labor. He realized later that he felt called to poetry, a revelation that kicked off a career as a poet and lecturer.
“Although my poetry doesn’t always turn out well, it’s something that I have to do,” Levine said.

Ward 2 city council candidate Fiona Greig mistakenly released an internal spreadsheet of campaign finances that classified one donor as “super wealthy” and another as “homosexual” on Sept. 30.
The Georgetown Patch reported Friday that when Greig provided the District’s Office of Campaign Finance with a list of donors to her campaign, she additionally turned in this unofficial list of potential donors. Yet according to the Washington City Paper, the notes were made by a volunteer during a brainstorming session that included Greig.
Georgetown Advisory Neighborhood Commission representative Jake Sticka (COL ’13) added that the incident should not affect Greig’s prospects for election.
“This is an unfortunate event but it is important to note that it was a volunteer, and clearly an inexperienced one, that put this list together, not Ms. Greig herself,” he said.
Campus campaign manager Craig Cassey (COL ’15) said that the Greig camp has faced significant backlash from the incident.
“[Some are saying] she’s done with, and commenting ‘Rest In Peace,'” Cassey said.
Regardless of the submitter, the comments have also prompted a harsh reaction from within the Georgetown community.
Meghan Ferguson (COL ’15), co-programming chair of GU Pride, said that she found the contents of the spreadsheet discouraging.
“I am disheartened by the fact that Greig felt it was necessary to differentiate between heterosexual and homosexual donors because a person’s sexual orientation has nothing to do with the matter at hand,” she wrote in an email.
According to the Patch, Greig issued an apology for the phrasing on the spreadsheet.
“I convey my deepest and most sincere apologies for anyone who might take offense,” Greig said to the news outlet. “I have family members who are gay.”
Cassey commended the apology.
“Her choice to apologize is not a rookie move, but is what we would want to expect from an elected figure,” Cassey said.
Sticka added that, while critics have focused on Greig’s spreadsheet blunder, discrepancies in the Evans camp have gone underreported.
“I also think that if we’re discussing campaign finance, it is worth noting that Jack Evans has been far from perfect,” Sticka said.
Fiona Greig could not be reached for comment and Jack Evans declined to comment on the incident.

The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center brought its research fundraising total to over $18 million for the last 25 years at its 25th anniversary gala Saturday night.
The gala, which included a dinner and award presentation, is a decades-old Lombardi Center tradition.
Most of the gala’s proceeds come from the silent auction, where attendees can bid on a wide range of donated luxury items including vacations, art, wine and jewelry.
Event co-chair Paul Schweitzer, who first became involved at Lombardi when his mother was treated there for breast cancer, has been attending the gala for the past 20 years. According to Schweitzer, though the layout of the gala has changed very little since its inception, each year it brings in larger donations.
“We’ve attracted a younger crowd, every year we bring new people in,” he said, adding that this year the center is now using BidPal, an electronic bidding technology, to facilitate the donation process.
This year’s special guest and honorary chair was DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the National Football League Players’ Association.
Smith’s wife is a breast cancer survivor, as are the wives of several of his friends and players.
During his speech, Smith urged the audience to take out their BidPal devices and use the “make a donation” button. As members made donations, their names would appear on a screen next to the stage.
Later in the evening, the center presented the Margaret L. Hodges Leadership award to Thomas and Elizabeth Donohue. The Donohues have a long history of working at the event, including serving as the co-chairs of the 2006 gala. According to Laurie Hodges Lapeyre, who presented the award, the event raised over $1.5 million dollars that year, the most successful night in the gala’s 25-year history.
Every year the Hodges award is given to a Lombardi volunteer who has demonstrated leadership and made great philanthropic contributions. Named after the gala’s original director and Lapeyre’s mother, Margaret Hodges, the award celebrates her creation of the event to aid in the center’s fundraising efforts.
But executive committee member Kim Baich said the event has been consistently well attended each year.
“In spite of the economy, people still come out to support cancer research,” Baich said. “It speaks to leadership at Lombardi and talent and dedication of researchers, but also to the steadfast dedication to the cause that the D.C. community supports.”

Gathering in Gaston Hall to celebrate the legacy of Rev. Jesse Jackson in an emotional event Monday, academics, activists and students looked back on Jackson’s contributions to American society.
The event, organized by professor Michael Eric Dyson to coincide with Jackson’s 70th birthday, featured prominent speakers and a panel discussion before Jackson himself took the stage.
Describing him as “one of the most extraordinary figures in American history,” Dyson emphasized Jackson’s role in shaking up politics.
“Without Jesse Jackson, there would be no Barack Obama,” he said.
Jackson, who spoke last, said that he had sought to continue the legacy of previous civil rights leaders in his own work.
“I have never, in some way or another, stopped trying to serve,” he said.
In a speech peppered with both biblical references and barbs aimed at politicians, Rev. Al Sharpton said that Jackson’s skill in both politics and activism played a critical part in protecting the gains of the civil rights movement after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.
“You had to play the Beltway and the march route,” Sharpton said.
Like Dyson, Sharpton pointed to the importance of Jackson’s 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns, along with his role in organizing for several mayoral races during the ’80s.
“All of these were steps toward empowerment,” he said.
According to Sharpton, Jackson’s role is often under-recognized today. Drawing parallels between Jackson and King, he told the story of a mayoral election in which King led voter registration drives but didn’t receive any recognition for his role.
“The people you pull through don’t invite you to the party,” he said, to applause from the audience.
Former Georgetown men’s basketball Head Coach John Thompson Jr., and his son, current coach John Thompson III, made an appearance at the celebration, which also featured a panel of activists and academics moderated by Rev. Marcia Dyson, Michael Eric Dyson’s wife.
One of the panelists, James Peterson, director of African studies and a professor of English at Lehigh University, was unable to hold back tears when he expressed his gratitude to Jackson. Dyson herself also began to cry as she concluded the panel discussion.
The last speaker to take the stage before Jackson was Rev. Frederick J. Haynes III, who delivered what he called a thank you note to Jackson in the form of a thundering, lyrical sermon. He thanked Jackson for serving as an inspiration and for fighting to address systemic issues.
“Rev. Jesse Jackson, you’ve taught us that it’s a structural issue,” he said.
Tyler Bilbo (COL ’12) said Haynes’ talk was his favorite part of the celebration.
“He delivered a great sermon,” Bilbo said.
Throughout the event, speakers emphasized the breadth of issues that Jackson has become involved in. While some of his projects have seen more success than others, Jackson and panelists said his continued activism raises issues that others have been unwilling to bring to the public’s attention.
“I am really a seed-thrower. Some hit the rock, and some hit the air and some germinate,” he said.
Closing his talk, Jackson referenced the ongoing Occupy movements as continuing a legacy of engagement.
“Dr. King’s last act was to Occupy the mall,” he said, adding that he thinks students in particular should be troubled by rising student debt. “Somebody’s got to say something, it seems to me.”

At least 10 Georgetown students joined an estimated 10 thousand demonstrators in front of the White House Sunday to protest the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline.
Protestors urged the government to reconsider plans to construct the pipeline, a 1,700-mile-long structure which will carry oil from Alberta, Canada to refineries in Oklahoma and Texas’ Gulf Coast. Because the pipeline is slated to cross the Canada-U.S. border, its creation must be first approved by President Obama.
In a press briefing yesterday, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Kerri-Ann Jones said that the State Department has not made a decision about the project.
“The Department of State is committed to an impartial, rigorous, transparent and thorough process for the National Interest Determination to determine whether or not this pipeline proposed by Keystone XL is in the national interest,” Jones said.
The protestors joined hands to form three concentric circles around the White House to symbolically “hug” the president, calling on Obama to reject the pipeline plan.
“It was really powerful [and] one of the best-organized actions I’ve ever seen,” protest attendee CodieKane (COL ’12) said.
According to fellow protestor Madeline Collins (COL ’13), who was arrested for participating in a sit-in against the project in September, the pipeline could cause serious environmental damage.
“It would cut through national parks and rivers and farms. It’s unsafe and could hurt various indigenous communities,” she said. “This is a really important issue for environmental advocates and students.”
Many at the protest, including Eli August (COL ’12), said that the government has been too favorable in its treatment of the pipeline.
“I think there is a sketchy relationship between TransCanada and the State Department,” August said.
The New York Times reported Tuesday that the State Department will conduct an investigation of the government’s interactions with TransCanada in response to a request from 14 members of Congress last month that the department’s relationship with the company be more closely scrutinized.
According to the Times, in a Nov. 4 memorandum to members of the inspector general’s office, senior official Harold Geisel said that the administration will ensure that all parties in the pipeline approval process complied with the law.
For Collins, the protests are a way to publicly appeal to President Obama.
“We were trying to send a message,” she said. “Obama can just say no [to the pipeline]. The protests were a way of telling him to do the right thing.”

There are 18 people in Healy 103, and all of them are annoyed with the Greeks.
“If you guys have Greek friends, kill them. My best friend is Greek, and I want to kill him,” Graham Robertson (COL ’12) says in a joking manner.
It may sound like a gathering of ancient Persians, but in fact it’s a meeting of the Georgetown Collegiate Investors, and Robertson is their CEO.
For the past week, they have been anxiously watching the stock market wobble over speculation about Greece, which is facing a severe debt crisis. On this night, the major concern is whether or not the country will leave the Eurozone, the economic and monetary union of states that adopted the euro as their official currency.
This is how the Georgetown Collegiate Investors spend their Wednesday nights. They analyze their holdings, pinpoint rising companies and struggle to understand what global events mean for the American markets. They look like college students, but they talk like partners in an investing firm.
In fact, they are both. Georgetown Collegiate Investors, LLC, is the nation’s largest student investing firm, with over 240 members and $100,000 to work with. They are entirely separate from the university, filing their own taxes and investing their own money. And for the past few years, they have been growing.
That’s an impressive statistic, especially considering the fact that the United States has been in a recession since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the first semester of college for this year’s seniors.
Perhaps more impressive, though, is the fact that their returns on average beat the S&P 500 index. In every man’s language, that means that a group of college students is beating the market average for making money.
Unlike day traders, who focus on buying and selling stock in the same day for a profit, GCI is a long-term investment firm, looking to make a profit over a four-year window. This gives them the opportunity to ride out the peaks and falls of the daily market without worrying about losing it all at once.
“The one thing that really determines how you look at investment is time horizon,” Robertson said. “Absolutely, if you’re a day trader, you’re in the market saying ‘ … Greece is in trouble, sell, sell, sell.’ But we’re interested in that four-year horizon.”
Statistically, stocks generally trend up two years out of three. To GCI, that means that intelligent investing in stable companies should provide a positive return after four years.
Looking past that horizon and focusing on the recession or the financial crisis in Greece, though, can be a recipe for disaster.
“I don’t know if you’ve heard this, but ‘in the long run, we’re all dead,’ is a common phrase that economists will use,” he said.
If that sounds ominous, it isn’t meant to be. The quote actually comes from John Maynard Keynes, an economist who was active during the Great Depression. He wrote the phrase to counter his contemporaries, many of whom were reluctant to focus on short-term gains. Keynes’s point, and the goal of GCI investors, is to capitalize on smaller windows of time rather than trying to strategize around something as long as a recession.
Keeping that in mind, the GCI investment strategy is really fairly simple: invest in stable and profitable American equities on a four-year horizon. The challenge for partners is to find those qualities in the market today.
For that, GCI and investment tycoon Warren Buffet share the same mantra. As Buffet has said, “Do a lot of reading.”
“We look deep into a company’s balance sheets and compare key financial ratios with those of competing firms,” said Caspian Tavallali (SFS ’14), GCI’s secretary of the board. “We also concentrate on learning about the company’s management and understanding their impact on the company.”
With that knowledge, partners then pitch stocks to the investing body, and the rest of the group votes in a majority rules system. Once the money is invested, the partners keep up with the activities of the company and constantly reevaluate the company’s standing.
Take, for example, Apple, Inc.
“Following the unfortunate death of [former Apple CEO Steve Jobs], we have had to reassess Apple, one of our oldest and best-performing holdings, so as to evaluate whether the incumbent Mr. Cook will continue pushing Apple’s innovative culture forward,” Tavallali wrote in an email.
The business plan is fairly fluid, allowing new members to cycle in and take the initiative to research opportunities on their own. Some investors do so right away. Others invest their money and don’t show up to meetings at all. Individually, their experience pales in comparison to their competition in the rest of the market. Together, though, they have plenty.
According to GCI leaders, the key to their success may actually be the fact that they are amateurs.
“Our inexperience is actually an asset, because it allows us to look at things in a different way than the rest of the market,” Robertson said.
That is the message that they preach to their partners.
“Looking for things that the market doesn’t see should be our goal,” Chief Risk Officer Christina Taranenko (COL ’13) told the small dedicated group that gathered Wednesday night.
That strategy isn’t a novel idea, but it is working, in large part because the members of GCI are after more than just money. According to Robertson, most members join because they want to better understand the stock market, which means that as they expand their knowledge, they get a chance to look outside the box.
Christian Crosby (MSB ’13) can attest to the benefits. When he began investing with GCI, he knew a little about the markets, but probably not enough to excel on his own. His investment, as he saw it, was an educational one.
“It seemed like a great opportunity to learn about markets and investing with a good group of people that were genuinely interested in the markets and teaching others about them,” he said.
With that peer schooling, he has since been able to take on much more initiative in the firm.
“GCI has taught me the skills necessary to make sense of the market, manage a large portfolio, manage a group of analysts (I’m currently our healthcare sector head) and successfully pitch a stock to a large group,” Crosby wrote in an email.
With a constantly changing membership and a flexible strategy, GCI is unique among stock market funds. The fresh-minded group has set about finding paths around hurdles like Greece, for example, that other investors may be blind to either by habit or knowledge.
That is the company’s real draw to potential investors, according to Robertson.
“The reason that students invest with GCI is that you believe that our 240 partners collectively know more than the rest of the market. And so you’re trusting us,” he said.

A $1 million donation to the LGBTQ Resource Center will help expand its presence on campus according to its director, Sivagami Subbaraman.
Chairman of the Board of Directors Paul Tagliabue (CAS ’62) and his wife, Chandler, allocated one-fifth of their $5 million donation to the center as part of the capital campaign drive two weekends ago.
“This is an opportunity to elevate the conversation around gay issues to be a Georgetown issue,” Subbaraman said. “Tagliabue realizes that it is not a narrow issue in a corner — it is relevant to all of campus.”
Dubbed “The Tagliabue Initiative for LGBTQ Life: Fostering Formation and Transformation,” the push will fund work by students and student organizations to make the campus more accepting as well as establish an advisory group comprised of faculty, staff, students and alumni.
“The way I see it, LGBTQ life is not separate from or apart from all other diversity on campus,” Subbaraman said. “For me, Georgetown’s Jesuit identity means allowing flourishing. Gay students have not always had to right to or the ability to flourish.”
Subbaraman hopes to use the money to bring high-level speakers to campus and involve more student groups in promoting campus diversity. For her, this is critical to countering the perception that the donation is going to a marginal group.
“I think it’s really important for all students to know that the endowment is for all students to live in a better community,” she said.
In a statement to the university, the Tagliabues wrote that they hope the gift will help establish a safe and inclusive environment on campus.
In a statement to the university, the Tagliabues wrote that they hope the gift will help establish a safe and inclusive environment on campus.
“The center is inspired by Catholic and Jesuit principles of respect for the dignity of all and education of the whole person, and we are very pleased to support its services,” they wrote.
Paul Tagliabue received a scholarship to play basketball at Georgetown, graduating as both a Dean’s List student and president of his senior class. He graduated from New York University School of Law in 1965. Before beginning his term on the board of directors, Tagliabue served as commissioner of the National Football League.
Subbaraman said that Tagliabue is proud of the center, both as a member of the university community and as the father of an openly gay son, Drew, who serves as executive director of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays in New York City.
James Saucedo (MSB ’13), the treasurer of student organization GU Pride, also said the donation is critical to fostering a community of acceptance and awareness at Georgetown in the coming years.
“The donation is such an amazing way to kick off the Campaign for Georgetown,” he said. “So much of our understanding of what the university will be like in 10 or 20 years depends on what financial resources we have now.”
Subbaraman hopes that the Tagliabues’ donation will set a precedent to encourage all parents, gay or straight, to support their children by working to improve campus life.
“Traditionally, high levels of giving go to buildings or academic programs,” Subbaraman said. “Because Paul and [Chandler’s] donation is going to need-based scholarships and athletic scholarships as well as the LGBTQ center, it raises student life and affairs to the same level of priority, which is essential for the health of the entire campus.”
The first of its kind at a Catholic university, the LGBTQ Resource Center was established in 2008 in the wake of a student campaign, Out for Change, spurred by an anti-gay hate crime on campus.
Subbaraman said that while the center has grown rapidly since its establishment, she hopes that one day it will become more than just a resource center for students.
“In the three short years since we’ve been established, there have been visible, dramatic changes on campus. I don’t even recognize the place anymore,” she said. “My dream is to build on this endowment, so that one day we will have a full-fledged research center, unique to Georgetown, where scholars can publish on topics at the intersection of LGBTQ topics and interfaith topics.”

In a push to better coordinate disparate elements of the environmental movement on campus, students, faculty and administrators gathered Monday night to discuss strategies for improving sustainability efforts.
The three-hour workshop was held by a steering committee that included student representatives from EcoAction, the Georgetown University Student Association, the Meditation House and Georgetown Energy.
According to GUSA Secretary of Sustainability Jessie Robbins (SFS ’12), one of the driving forces behind the workshop’s organization, this event has been in the works since last spring.
“It seemed like there was a lack of awareness of energy issues on campus, but at the same time, there was a concern for what the university was doing for the environment,” Robbins said. “We thought what better way to get some momentum going than to have a planning forum on all student input on sustainability issues.”
According to Robbins, the event was the first step in a larger plan to implement new sustainability initiatives. The findings from Monday’s discussion will be recorded in a detailed report to be sent to administrators in the spring.
The conversation will then shift to a town hall meeting with student leaders and faculty, at which point the work of coming up with timelines and implementation strategies for the initiatives will begin.
Robbins added that underclassman interest is extremely important to the plan’s success.
“When you look around this room, most of the students are young,” she said. “They will be the ones who will make things happen two or three years from now.”
Audrey Stewart, Georgetown’s sustainability coordinator and the committee’s adviser, said she was thrilled to see a high turnout of both students and administrators at the event. “I’m so excited to see the student enthusiasm,” she said. “I think this will be a great opportunity for the sustainability initiative to learn more about what is interesting to students.”
Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., vice president for mission and ministry, kicked off the event.
“When we speak about men and women for others, we at Georgetown can expand that to not simply fellow students but also to the natural world,” O’Brien said. “We have to properly steward what we have been given. We steward the natural world given to us today, but we also are stewards for future generations.”
Director of Student Programs Erika Cohen-Derr emphasized how important sustainability issues have become in her work with student organizations. She urged students to find the best way to communicate with faculty members in order to ensure that their efforts will not be lost.
“We want you to think about how you can connect all of us so that the energy you expend to make this a more sustainable campus will continue,” Cohen-Derr said.
For the second half of the event, students divided into discussion groups that focused on more specific issues, such as energy efficiency, food sourcing, purchasing and procurement, waste management and transportation. Following a series of brainstorming sessions, the groups recorded their ideas and shared their key findings with the others.
Scotie Conner (MSB ’15), one of the GUSA senators who attended the forum, said he hopes that Georgetown can begin to put green efforts first.
“I really care about creating a more sustainable society, and I think that universities are a great area for that because we can really harness the energy of young people to make positive changes,” Conner said.

At the break of the 20th century, the ground floor of LXR Hall wasn’t housing students; it was housing dead bodies.
While today the building serves as a dormitory, its bottom floor functioned as the morgue of Georgetown University Hospital from 1898 to 1947.
The hospital originally sat at the corner of 35th and N Streets in the building that is currently LXR and Nevils, which is now home to students’ rooms and apartments, music practice rooms and lounge areas.
Former University President J. Havens Richards, S.J., constructed a comprehensive hospital complex in order to address an increase in the school’s size, according to “A History of Georgetown University” by Robert Emmett Curran, an emeritus professor of history at the university. Richards also wanted to encourage faculty clinical practice and serve the general community.
In the 49 years after the hospital opened outside the front gates in July 1898, its staff contributed to the study and practice of medicine as the hospital’s emergency room became noted for its practice of aseptic surgery, which emphasizes maintaining the cleanliness of the operating room. Additionally, the National Laboratory of Hygiene, the first facility devoted to bacteria research in United States, was founded within the new complex.
During these years, medical school administration standardized the curriculum and increased the length of study from two to three years. In 1947, the university officially opened the current Georgetown University Hospital on Reservoir Road and saw through the building’s transformation into what is now LXR.
Students now reside in what used to be hospital wards, operating rooms and mortuary facilities. Though the university does not hide this fact, students are often surprised by the building’s origins.
“I actually didn’t know [it used to be morgue],” Max Barrett (MSB ’14). “I’m kind of freaked out now.
“The mice are a bigger problem than the morgue,” David Finkelstein (COL ’14) said. “But I still think it’s better than [Village C West].”

The Department of Public Safety is in the process of repairing 24 of the 188 emergency call boxes throughout the medical center and main campus after discovering they were out of service during a routine test on Friday.
Low battery power caused the boxes to stop working, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr. Though technicians were able to repair 14 of the boxes between Friday and Monday night, the remainder will be fixed in the coming days. All of the broken boxes have been labeled as such by DPS.
Nineteen of the inoperable boxes are among the 159 newer wired call boxes that DPS is able to check daily through automatic updates from the boxes. Of these boxes, five are still out of service.
“Those are expected to be fixed as quickly as the technicians are able to fix them,” Kerr said.
In the review, DPS also found that five of the university’s 22 wireless call boxes were inoperable. DPS will now be checking these older boxes, which were previously checked twice a month, once a week.
“They’re 32 years old … and showing signs of [their] age,” Kerr said.
According to her, one box has been used to make an emergency call in the past four years.
Though the boxes rarely see any use, students expressed concern that the boxes were inoperable.
“[The call boxes] symbolize some type of safety. With so many out of order, I think the effect is more psychological if anything,” Nadir Zaidi (COL ’13) said.
Priya Sharma (MSB ’15), who noticed the outages while walking with friends this weekend, agreed that the boxes typically make her feel safe.
“It made me uncomfortable to see that something [that is] supposed to provide safety … was broken,” she said.

The Georgetown University Student Association plans to release a draft of a student bill of rights this Monday as part of its efforts to reform the Student Code of Conduct.
In a meeting Sunday, members of GUSA’s executive branch laid out the main points of the bill, including a right to freedom of expression, freedom from discrimination and prompt notification of disciplinary action.
In order to be incorporated into the code of conduct, the bill must be passed by the Disciplinary Review Committee, a group that consists of GUSA cabinet members, the director of student conduct, the associate vice president for student affairs, two faculty members and two students appointed by the vice president for student affairs.
According to Michael Barclay (COL ’12), a member of the Student Code of Conduct Reform Committee and the chief of staff for the GUSA executive, the group hopes to gain student support for the bill by holding a campus-wide referendum. In many cases, the bill of rights would codify liberties that students already exercise, Barclay said.
“By adding the bill to the Student Code of Conduct, we hope to have the university explicitly recognize these rights and expectations of students,” he wrote in an email.
He added that the code of conduct reforms are also intended to give students a better understanding of their own rights and responsibilities.
The previous administration, under President Calen Angert (MSB ’11) and Vice President Jason Kluger (MSB ’11), also attempted to revamp the Student Code of Conduct. Reform Committee member and Deputy Chief of Staff for the GUSA executive John Morris (COL ’13) said that during the last revision process, several people each reviewed a separate section of the code, making the final product jumbled and incompatible.
“Bringing them all together into one cohesive code of conduct was a nightmare,” Morris said.
The reform initiative failed to make significant progress before the administration changed hands.
In an effort to correct past problems, the current committee has fewer people working on the initiative than the previous one, and every member is reviewing the complete document, Morris said. He added that the group is also interested in studying documents created by the Alcohol Policy Working Group, an initiative that submitted five alcohol policy-related recommendations to the Disciplinary Review Committee in 2008 but ultimately failed to make any changes.
According to Morris, one of the primary goals is to clarify the expectations of the Student Code of Conduct.
“There’s very little common standard,” Morris said. “We’re hoping to flesh it out a little and make it more black-and-white.”

Students and professionals gathered Friday at the university’s ninth annual International Development Conference, an event organized by student group UNICEF-Georgetown.
The conference focused on development of universal education for children worldwide. The keynote speaker for the conference, United Nations Children’s Fund Chief of Staff Cynthia McCaffrey, said that raising awareness of global poverty was the most important mission for college students.
“You have a voice,” she said. “You are among the smartest people in the world, and you have to take that to the people making the decisions.”
Georgetown’s chapter has raised over $6,000 for UNICEF this year, according to President Susan O’Rourke (COL ’12).
“The group and I are committed to carrying on UNICEF’s mission,” she said.
The conference began with workshop sessions in which speakers shared their perspectives on various topics relating to international development. Speakers included World Bank Senior Governance Officer Susan Hume, International Center for Religion and Diplomacy Reseach Associate Henry Burbridge and Vice President of Afghan education for A Better Tomorrow Nahid Aziz.
After the workshops, speakers and students gathered in the Copley Formal Lounge for a dinner and McCaffery’s talk.
Emphasizing the importance of equity in UNICEF’s work, McCaffrey said the group must focus on the poor in both urban and remote rural areas of developing nations.
“Reaching every kid is just the right thing to do,” she said.
McCaffrey concluded her speech with an anecdote about a visit to a center for former child soldiers in the Congo.
According to McCaffery, the teenagers living there told her that they wanted to focus on the future, not their brutal pasts. She thought they would ask her for a new truck or latrine, but, they only wanted to thank her.
“We ask you to tell everyone you meet ‘Thank you,'” McCaffery described them saying. “To UNICEF, to the United States: We will not let you down.'”
Janine Duffy (COL ’14), technology chair for UNICEF-Georgetown, stressed that the opportunity to connect with leaders was important.
“We’re actually interacting with professionals in the field and learning about their hands-on experience,” she said.

In danger of losing around $3 million of State Department funding, the Fulbright program’s future is tied up in budget negotiations on Capitol Hill.
Allocations for the program, which provides grants to U.S. citizens to study, teach and conduct research abroad and for non-U.S. citizens to come to the states, were decreased by $16.4 million in 2011, giving it a $237.4 million budget for this year. A bill currently being considered in the House of Representatives would reduce the budget for next year by a further 10.1 percent, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Such a reduction could affect the more than 50 Georgetown students who apply for scholarships from the program every year.
According to Maryam Henson, associate director of the Office of the Fellowship Secretary, 56 students applied, 22 students won Fulbrights and about 40 faculty members received support from the program in 2011. This year 55 students and graduates are hoping to win grants.
Though the program is primarily a function of the American government, in the past, several foreign governments also allocated money for Fulbright projects.
Chile led the way in 2010 with $8.2 million with Germany, Brazil and Spain following closely behind.
But, according to Henson, many foreign governments do not have the capacity to provide Fulbright scholars with the necessary financial aid and will not be able to make up for the U.S. cuts.
“Some foreign countries that are not able to support grants without U.S. government support may reduce the number of grants they make available, while other countries may be forced to cancel the grant entirely,” she said.
If the government continues with cutbacks, Henson said the program could become much more competitive and reduce the opportunities for undergraduate students to take part in it.
Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming said that the university will continue to push for government assistance.
But he added that he is unsure of what Congress will decide about the future of the Fulbright program.
“It’s not clear at this point how the House will react to this. It won’t be resolved for another six to seven weeks,” he said.
The bill has also caught the attention of the Obama administration. Though the president’s office pushed for increased funding for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which runs the Fulbright program, it also lobbied for a smaller cut of $1 million from Fulbright funds.
Fleming added that the program has fared well compared to other educational programs whose budgets were slashed by the government, such as Pell grants.
“We … all think, ‘Wow we dodged a bullet,’ because it is a relatively small cut,” he said.

The federal government will conduct the first nationwide test of the National Emergency Alert System Wednesday at 2 p.m. EST.
The run-through, sponsored by the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Emergency Management Agency, will test whether the system can notify the public of immediate threats. Lasting 30 seconds, the message will be transmitted by television and radio stations in all U.S. states and territories.
The EAS was set up in 2006 as a public warning system to alert Americans to national and local crises, including terrorist attacks, weather emergencies and missing children.
The FCC and FEMA will use the test as a way to assess which local systems are unable to properly provide the information.
According to Phil Petree, president of NWA, Inc., local alerts do not actually test that particular device’s ability to receive critical alerts from the Emergency Alerting System.
“By sending emergency codes throughout the entire network, FEMA will find the failure points in the system,” he said.
Petree said that FEMA is notifying citizens about the test because it does not want the message, which will interrupt broadcasting services, to inspire panic. He said that uniformed citizens could misinterpret the test and overload 911 centers with unnecessary calls.
“No matter how large or small your community [is], your 911 center is sized, equipped and staffed to handle a normal amount of 911 calls. If all of a sudden, 1 percent of your population calls 911, your system will not be able to respond and you may suffer a 911 outage,” he said.
On its website, FEMA said that it will conduct the test at 2 p.m. to minimize the disruption to citizens’ daily routines and that programming will resume as normal after its conclusion.

Former Director of the U.S. Secret Service Brian Stafford spoke in Copley Formal Lounge Monday, describing the close calls and working relationship with four presidents during his 33-year career in the organization.
“I had a front row seat to history,” Stafford said.
Stafford began his time in the organization after returning from a tour of duty in Vietnam, protecting Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton.
Stafford told stories about his interactions with the presidents he served, describing Reagan as a practical joker.
“[Reagan] was the kind of guy who had a joke for you every day and expected a joke in return,” he said.
Stafford also discussed the difficulty his job presented in protecting politicians, who often seek public exposure, offering an anecdote from his time in the Clinton administration.
When Clinton once asked him to stop his car in a bad neighborhood, Stafford said he pretended he could not hear him. On the third request, Clinton jokingly threw his newspaper at Stafford and said, “I know at least one of the agents in this car isn’t deaf.”
For some students in attendance, these anecdotes were the highlight of Stafford’s talk.
“It was really cool to hear firsthand experiences of what it is like to be working next to the president on a day-to-day basis,” Brooke Heinichen (SFS ’12) said.
In addition to sharing the challenges he faced in trying to maintain control of security when the president travelled overseas, Stafford discussed that the U.S. Secret Service handles security when foreign heads of state travel here.
“It’s the ugly American syndrome,” he said. “We’re in charge here, and we’re in charge in their country. And they point that out to us regularly.”
In addition to sharing his experience working in the Secret Service, Stafford discussed the history of the agency. During his tenure, the Secret Service switched from primarily investigating counterfeit money to providing security for the president.
He also encouraged students to consider a career in the Secret Service, explaining the many different career paths available within the agency.
Numerous times throughout the talk, Stafford emphasized his devotion to the Secret Service and his pride in his career.
“It was a labor of love,” he said.
Now that he has retired, Stafford hopes to make the Secret Service a family tradition. Just before he retired, his son joined the organization.
“The most exciting thing was swearing in my son, passing the torch.”
