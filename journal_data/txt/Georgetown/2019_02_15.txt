Colombian President Iván Duque Márquez (GRD ’07) called on countries to unify their support for the diplomatic blockade against Nicolás Maduro, whose position as the president of Venezuela has been a subject of international scrutiny, at an event Thursday.
The event, titled “The Policy Agenda for Latin America,” was hosted in Gaston Hall by the Latin America Leadership Program, the Center for Latin American Studies and the Colombian Law Students Association at Georgetown University Law Center. Dean William Treanor moderated the event.  
Duque urged countries and leaders around the world to continue putting pressure on Maduro and to push to allow humanitarian aid to enter Venezuela.
“We should do everything we can to let the Venezuelan people liberate from the most cruel dictatorship we have seen in years,” Duque said. “As president of Colombia, I will continue promoting the diplomatic blockade to get Venezuelan people free of Nicolás Maduro.”
A staunch critic of Maduro’s presidency, Duque denounced Maduro for human rights abuses in front of the International Criminal Court in September 2018 and encouraged the continuation of the diplomatic blockade of Venezuela, according to The New York Times. 
The blockade has the support of over 50 countries that are denouncing Maduro and recognizing Juan Guaido, the current president of the National Assembly and leader of the opposition, as the true president of Venezuela. The effort began July 5 in response to multiple accusations against Maduro of illegitimate re-election to office in May 2018 and his authoritarian rule, according to CBC. 
International support is essential to ensuring the success of the diplomatic blockade, according to Duque.  
“I always said that we need to create a diplomatic blockade,” Duque said. “We have now more countries in the Western hemisphere recognizing Juan Guaido as the president. Now we have most of the European countries, and yes, we have to keep on channelling that diplomatic blockade.”
Maduro has been described as a dictator by many countries and leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as mainstream media. His presidency, which began in November 2013, has withstood instability because of the decline in Venezuela’s socio-economic status and the increase in crime, hyperinflation, poverty and hunger during his tenure. 
In addition to fighting for humanitarian aid to enter Venezuela, Duque said Colombia would help liberate Venezuelan refugees from Maduro’s oppressive regime.
“It is our moral duty, first of all, to express fraternity,” Duque said. “The second thing to recognize is that in the 20th century, many Colombians went to Venezuela in search for a home, and Venezuela brothers opened their arms and received them. So we will do all we can to be well-organized and to help with the migration of citizens.”
With socio-economic conditions in Venezuela deteriorating, an estimated 4,000 people cross the border into Colombia every day, according to Foreign Policy. 
Duque, who received his Master’s in Public Policy Management from Georgetown, was invited to speak in Gaston Hall as a part of his first official visit to the United States as president after his June 2018 election. Duque not only shared Colombia’s foreign policy, but also domestic issues with the campus community. 
Duque emphasized the need for a gradual replacement of the illegal drug economy with a more legitimate, legal economy to support the Colombian people.
“My goal is by the end of my administration to eradicate more than 60 percent of the illegal drugs that we have — but more than just eradicate, make people that are living off of an illegal crop be part of the legal economy,” Duque said.
Colombia recently signed a historic agreement with the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime in 2017 to address the country’s widespread coca cultivation, according to the UNODC. The area under coca cultivation in Colombia reached the highest-ever figure of 171,000 hectares in 2017, according to the UNODC’s Coca Cultivation Survey Report for Colombia.
Colombia has collaborated with the United States to address drug issues in the past, according to Duque. 
“Our relationship has been, for a long time, a brotherhood relationship,” Duque said. “I am very glad and pleased that we keep receiving support from the White House and also from Congress when it comes to things like the drug problem.”
The drug problem in Colombia is often attributed to high levels of domestic production of illegal drugs, according to Duque. In 2016, an estimated 866 metric tons of cocaine were produced in the country, according to the UNODC. However, the issue of drug consumption within the country should also be taken seriously, Duque said. 
“We need to put an end to the exponential growth of the illegal drugs, and we also need to consider that Colombia is no longer a producing country, but also a consuming country,” Duque said. “We have 800,000 people consuming drugs in Colombia, and we are a low-income country.”
Despite the drug crisis that has plagued the country, Colombia has achieved incredible economic growth, according to Duque. 
“When we talk about Colombia, always the conversation of drugs comes into the table, but in fact, Colombia has a very vibrant economy,” Duque said. “I would say that one of the things that we have to praise is that during the last 20 years, Colombia passed from being considered a failed state to a vibrant economy.”

Georgetown University’s campus in Doha, Qatar, was named one of the 10 U.S. colleges with the most restrictive censorship by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education on Tuesday.
FIRE, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the civil rights of university students and faculty, selects schools based on the severity of censorship and university attempts to rectify the suppression, according to Sarah McLaughlin, senior program officer for legal and public advocacy at FIRE.
GU-Q’s placement on the annual list was a result of the cancellation of an Oct. 9 religious discussion planned by the GU-Q Debating Union as part of a series called “Pardon the Interruption,” according to a FIRE news release.
At the debate, two professors, alongside student participants, were set to consider the question of whether major religions should portray God as a woman, according to GU-Q professor of world literature and one of the planned debaters, Ian Almond.
GU-Q tweeted Oct. 8 that the debate had been cancelled because of the organizers’ failure to obtain university authorization.
The GU-Q Office of Communications referred to safety risks associated with the event, according to an Oct. 10 statement to The Daily Q, the student newspaper of Northwestern University’s Qatar campus.
“GU-Q is committed to the free and open exchange of ideas, while encouraging civil dialogue that respects the laws of Qatar,” the statement reads.
FIRE interpreted GU-Q’s statement as a reference to a Qatari blasphemy law that prohibits speech insulting or offensive to Islam. FIRE perceived GU-Q’s cancellation of the event as censorship of a sensitive religious topic and placed the university on its top-10 list, according to the press release.
“In the case of Georgetown’s Qatar campus, we found it uniquely disturbing that a university committed to free expression would seemingly censor speech on the basis that it could be perceived as ‘blasphemous,’” McLaughlin wrote.
Qatar, which has notable laws restricting free speech, ranks No. 125 among 180 countries in terms of freedom of press, according to Reporters Without Borders, an organization that advocates for reporters worldwide.
Still, GU-Q is committed to freedom of expression and debate in accordance with Georgetown’s Policy on Speech and Expression, a GU-Q spokesperson wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
“Faculty members and student groups with access to university benefits may host events on campus that are in accordance with Qatari law,” the statement reads.
Despite these national limitations, FIRE faults GU-Q for its restrictions on student speech, according to McLaughlin.
“FIRE recognizes that American universities operating branches in other countries may be subject to speech restrictions that would violate the First Amendment in the United States,” McLaughlin wrote. “But in those cases, universities should not make promises to students that they cannot deliver.”
The debate’s poster, featuring a reimagining of the famous Michelangelo painting “Creation of Adam” with Ariana Grande in the role of God, sparked backlash after it surfaced on Twitter, including a trending Arabic hashtag, roughly translatable as #GeorgetownInsultsGod, accusing Georgetown of blasphemy.
GU-Q Dean for Student Affairs Brendan Hill received death threats in response to the poster, according to Almond. FIRE was not aware of any death threats made to the dean and based its assessment of the cancelled debate on GU-Q’s public statements, according to McLaughlin.
The university opened a dialogue with students about their right to free expression after its public statements about the cancellation, according to Fatima Farooqui (SFS-Q ’21), a former member of the Debating Union.
“I really do believe that it was for the safety and security of students. I don’t think it was a violation of our free speech,” Farooqui wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Student Life staff was readily available for the next two days to talk to students and reassure them that these things are things we can talk about, especially within Georgetown.”
FIRE weighed this incident too heavily in deciding to place GU-Q on its list, Almond said.
“It’s a very liberal and open campus, and in fact one of the reasons why students here at Georgetown-Qatar were angry that the debate was cancelled is precisely because they perceive it as a very different place in comparison to other campuses,” Almond said. “It is perceived as a place where, as an academic and as a student, you are more or less allowed to do or say what you want.”
GU-Q’s campus is the result of Education City, an initiative by the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development created by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa during his time as emir. The Education City project incentivizes U.S. universities to build programs in Doha. Other U.S. colleges in Education City include Northwestern University, Carnegie Mellon University and Texas A&M University. 
FIRE considers Georgetown’s main campus a “red light” institution, meaning it has at least one policy that restricts free expression, for making incivility and disrespectful behavior a punishable offense in the code of student conduct. 
The university was also ranked on FIRE’s 2015 top-10 list for not recognizing the pro-abortion rights group H*yas for Choice; FIRE accused Georgetown of violating its own free speech policy by refusing to recognize HFC because of the group’s stance on abortion. Georgetown appeared on FIRE’s 2017 list after the Georgetown University Law Center prevented students from campaigning or engaging in partisan political speech on campus.
Georgetown adopted a new free speech policy in June 2017 modelled after that of the University of Chicago, which prohibits suppression of offensive speech. This step was important but insufficient to raise Georgetown’s overall rating, according to FIRE.
The GU-Q administration and Student Government Association launched Red Square, a replica of the main campus’s forum for tabling, flyering and other forms of public discourse, on Jan. 15. While the project had been in progress before the October event, the cancelled debate accelerated the process of creating Red Square, as the administration wanted to ensure students had a platform for free expression, according to Farooqui.
“The Red Square at the Qatar campus is a combined effort by the administration and the SGA here to encourage people to talk more freely about things that they feel like they cannot talk about,” Farooqui wrote. “It is a great step towards progress. So far, it has been pretty successful.”

Prominent U.S. political leaders convened Thursday at Holy Trinity Catholic Church to commemorate the life of John Dingell Jr. (CAS ’49, LAW ’52), a former representative of Michigan and the longest-serving member of Congress in U.S. history.
At 92 years old, Dingell died at his home in Dearborn, Mich., on Feb. 7, following complications from prostate cancer. Notable attendees at Dingell’s funeral included former Speaker John Boehner, former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68), former Secretary Hillary Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
Bill Clinton paid tribute to Dingell’s work ethic and dedication to public service in his eulogy at the funeral, which was open to the public. 
“He was a remarkable man,” Clinton said. “A patriot, in some cases, without peer in the history of America. He spent more time in the Congress trying to fulfill the Founders’ admonition to form a more perfect union than anyone else.”
A reception was held in the Healey Family Student Center after the funeral. Dingell’s wife Debbie Dingell (SFS ‘75, GRD ‘96) (D-Mi.), who assumed his seat after he stepped down, was in attendance at the closed event. John Dingell will be interred at Arlington National Cemetery on Friday morning.
A service for Dingell was held earlier in the week in Dearborn, Mich., where former Vice President Joe Biden gave a eulogy. Biden remembered Dingell for his commitment to his work as a representative.
“Generations of Americans are going to study his work, know they are better off because he lived,” Biden said. “Remember a man who could always be found standing firm on the right side of history. And when he had to, stand alone.”
Dingell had represented what is now Michigan’s 12th district from 1955 to 2014, a record 59 years. He was in the House of Representatives during the administrations of 11 of the United States’ 45 presidents, and for more than a quarter of Congress’s existence. 
Dingell’s legacy as a politician and a public figure will outlast his death, former President Clinton said in 2005, Dingell’s 50th year in the legislative body. 
“Presidents come and presidents go,” Clinton said. “John Dingell stays forever.” 
Up to the end of his life, Dingell remained a part of the Georgetown community, regularly visiting campus, speaking at Georgetown events and attending John Carroll Weekend.
Dingell honored the 225th anniversary of Georgetown’s founding in the Congressional Record in January 2014 and praised the university for remaining true to its founding principles.
“I can attest to the University’s commitment to addressing the challenges faced by our society and its consistent focus on developing students who are ready to contribute to future prosperity and positive civic leadership,” Dingell wrote.
Dingell’s family possessed strong ties to the university as well. Both his brother James Dingell (C ’54, GRD ’57, GRD ’63) and his wife Debbie also attended Georgetown. 
Dingell was honored by the Law’s school with its Robert F. Drinan, S.J. Law Alumni Public Service Award in 2013. 
Dingell was known, however, as much for his accomplishments in the House as he was for the length of his tenure, Rebecca Hollister (COL ’21), chair of Georgetown University College Democrats, wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“We are very appreciative of Representative Dingell’s service to our country, its people, and the Democratic party,” Hollister wrote. “He was essential in the fights for healthcare and welfare for all who needed it in the nation and for that we are immensely grateful. Our loving thoughts are with his family and friends at this time.”
From 1981 to 1995 and again from 2007 to 2009, Dingell chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee, an influential committee with a wide-ranging policy portfolio, affecting legislation from consumer protection to the environment. Dingell helped pass landmark legislation in the House of Representatives, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 1965 passage of Medicare. 
After graduating the university, Dingell went on to hold a number of jobs in the legal profession, working for a private firm and as a prosecutor in Wayne County, Mich. When his father died of tuberculosis in 1955, Dingell ran in and won a special election for his seat in the House, representing a district outside of Detroit. 
In 2014, after he announced that he would retire the following year, Dingell received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor awarded by the U.S. government.  
Dingell was dedicated to serving his constituents throughout his time in Congress, former Secretary of State James Baker wrote in a Feb 8. statement following Dingell’s passing. 
“America was built on the shoulders of great leaders like John Dingell who dedicated their lives to serving our nation,” Baker said.

Two Georgetown graduate student groups were awarded a combined $5,000 grant by the American Association of University Women to continue their work in advancing female leadership in business and science.
The funds will be used to support women in fields where they are currently underrepresented, with the grant directed to Georgetown Graduate Women in Business and Women in Science and Education, according to Daniela Rodriguez (GRD ’20), GWiB co-president.
GWiB and WISE collaborated to apply for the grant, which required a proposal for how they would advance women leadership using the funds. The AAUW announced the grant winners Feb. 11.
The grant money will go far in supporting their goal of advancing women, according to Rodriguez.
“Both WISE and GWiB leaderships are very excited to receive this grant, which is a consequence of hard work and dedication,” Rodriguez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our primary goal is to empower graduate women and men who work to lift women at Georgetown, and this grant will permit us to have a significant impact on our community.”
The graduate groups are using the funds to host a series of events, which was initially proposed in their grant application. The programming will focus on gaining confidence, improving negotiation skills and helping other women, according to Rodriguez.
“Our joint initiative is to advance the professional skills of female graduate students while emphasizing how to overcome obstacles traditionally faced by women,” Rodriguez wrote.
The groups co-designed programming with three events: a negotiation workshop, anti-harassment and bystander training, and an event featuring author Valerie Young. Young is set to speak about impostor syndrome, a phenomenon where women fear that they are not worthy of leadership roles.
“This tendency to discount or diminish obvious evidence of our abilities is called the imposter syndrome,” Young said in a June 2017 TED Talk. “Some of the coping mechanisms are things like flying under the radar — not raising your hand, not asking for promotions, not giving your ideas and sharing in meetings.”
Of the 500 largest companies in America, only 24 have female chief executive officers, according to Fortune. Young’s event will teach women methods to identify imposter syndrome and overcome these negative sentiments to realize their leadership potential, according to Allison O’Connell, WISE president.
By discussing obstacles women face in the professional world, the events will fill a gap that is often missing from coursework, according to O’Connell. 
“Together, we feel these events will teach professional skills that, while are essential for successful careers, are often overlooked in traditional graduate student curricula,“ O’Connell wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The projects organized by the student groups are important steps in advancing equity through supporting the professional development of women, according to Kimberly Churches, the chief executive officer of the American Association of University Women.
“I look forward to seeing the impact these projects — and the students who are responsible for them — will have on our society in the years ahead,” Churches said in a Feb. 11 news release.
In deciding which organizations should receive grant funds, AAUW focused on the long-term effects the groups will have, according to Andrea Martinez, a manager in fellowships at AAUW.
“We’re looking at what impact they’re creating. Not just the number, like how many women they’re impacting, but, ‘What is the potential for this to have long-term implications on the campus?’” Martinez said in an interview with The Hoya. “Is this something that can continue on when these women are no longer receiving funding from us?”
AAUW’s Campus Action Project also gave grants to organizations at 10 other universities that seek to advance women in leadership, according to Martinez. In addition to women’s leadership, the association also works to support female economic security and education and training.

A bill that would legally mandate pastors, rabbis and other clergy to report instances of child abuse or neglect is pending review by the Washington, D.C. Council.
Under current D.C. law, teachers, school officials, medical professionals and daycare workers are mandated reporters for suspected child abuse or neglect. Mandated reporters are required to report incidents of abuse to the Metropolitan Police Department or to child protective services. 
The bill, titled Protecting Children Through Mandatory Reporting Amendment Act of 2019, was introduced Jan. 23 by Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine and referred to the Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety on Feb. 5. If the 13-member D.C. Council and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) approve Racine’s proposal, the bill will be enacted into law.
If passed, the bill would also raise the penalty of failing to report a suspected instance of abuse up to a fine of $2,500 and 180 days of jail time.
Following The Boston Globe’s 2002 report on the widespread sexual abuse in the Catholic church, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops approved a charter that required all dioceses, including the Archdiocese of Washington, to report allegations of abuse toward a minor to the public authorities. 
The bill is a necessary expansion of the protection of minors against sexual assault, Fr. Gregory Schenden, S.J., director of campus ministry at Georgetown, said. 
“Such a bill will make legal what has already been in effect for the Society of Jesus (and other Catholic religious orders) nationally since shortly after the sexual abuse crisis in 2002,” Schenden wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is most encouraging to see the District of Columbia rising to these standards in striving to protect minors.”
Under the proposed legislation, any information revealed during confession remains confidential and outside the realm of mandatory reporting. Worldwide, confession remains a privileged space, according to Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., the chaplain-in-residence in Kennedy Hall.
“Across the board in every state in the United States, confession is considered sacred and privileged, and that is true actually around the world too, because of the particular nature of the relationship with an individual who is confessing something they’re trying to deal with in their minds,” Carnes said in an interview with The Hoya. “A good confessor, a priest, would really encourage the person then to go out and report something they themselves have done or if it’s something they might’ve been hurt in.”
This exemption could potentially be exploited, according to Becky Ianni, the D.C. leader of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, an advocacy group for survivors of institutional sexual abuse.
“I am glad that the bill is adding ministers to those who must report child abuse but am afraid the exemption for confession or penitential communication may be misused to protect the perpetrator,” Ianni wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Carnes hopes that confession will continue to assist sexual assault survivors by providing them with resources for psychological and sexual assault counseling.
“I remember in my very first confession counseling class the first thing we talked about was making sure you always have the resources around in case somebody needs additional counseling,” Carnes said. “So confession, whilst this privileged space, hopefully leads to then those other options.”
The bill also requires any mandated reporter to take a certification course, which focuses on the process of filing a report and the legal definitions of abuse and neglect. Any mandated reporter who fails to complete the course is fined $300.
The mandatory training will aid prosecutors in pursuing those who claim they did not report due to lack of procedural knowledge, according to Ianni. 
“I am pleased with the training of mandatory reporters. This will help prosecute offenders when they use excuses such as I didn’t know that was abuse, I didn’t know who to report to, and so forth,” Ianni wrote. 
The proposed legislation comes amid sexual assault accusations against notable members of the Catholic clergy.
Cardinal Donald Wuerl’s resignation from the position of D.C. archbishop was accepted in October following a Pennsylvania grand jury report that revealed Wuerl had mishandled cases of sexual abuse during his time as bishop of Pittsburgh. 
In July 2018, former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, Wuerl’s predecessor, resigned from the College of Cardinals after an investigation found credible evidence of several decades of sexual abuse. Wuerl was aware of an allegation of sexual assault against McCarrick as early as 2004, and kept his knowledge of the accusation confidential until late in 2018. 
Both Wuerl and McCarrick hold honorary degrees from Georgetown. Student have called for the university to revoke the degrees since August. In November, Georgetown formed a working group to reevaluate the honorary degrees and has yet to announce a decision.

A new university fund will provide $300,000 in grants to student, faculty and staff-proposed projects that seek to combat local and global sustainability challenges, Georgetown announced Jan. 29.
The Laudato Si’ Fund, named for Pope Francis’s 2015 letter on environmental justice sent to Roman Catholic bishops, will provide grants for six to 10 projects in the range of $10,000 to $50,000. Members of the Georgetown community can apply by Feb. 27. The grants, which are funded by donations, are set to be awarded to the winning proposals this spring. 
Previous student, faculty and staff initiatives have led to projects such as greater sustainability-focused courses in academic departments, a student-led beehive and the green roof behind Village C Residence Hall, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
The Office of Sustainability, which oversees the fund, looks to further the collaborative aspect of the university’s environmental efforts, according to Hill.
“This fund will strengthen our commitment to sustainability and encourage our community to further positively impact our University, our external communities and partners and meaningfully and materially improve our planet,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Student-run environmental advocacy efforts have been led by the Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network, an organization for environmental awareness and advocacy, the Georgetown University Student Association Sustainability Policy Coalition, and GU Fossil Free, an organization campaigning for the university’s divestment from fossil fuel companies, among others.
These organizations have worked in tandem with the Office of Sustainability, established in 2013, to advance the university’s sustainability goals. However, Georgetown has previously  lacked a formal, centralized process for submitting sustainability-related proposals, according to GUSA Sustainability Chair Samantha Panchèvre (SFS ’19).
“We applaud the Office of Sustainability for launching this fund and believe it will be a great catalyst for supporting projects that promote sustainability with tangible results,” Panchèvre wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Students have long needed an institutionalized mechanism for taking their projects to the next level, and this Fund can do that!”
Pope Francis, the first Jesuit pope, has encouraged Jesuit universities in particular to take up the issue of environmentalism. Francis’s 2015 letter critiqued the degradation of the earth’s resources and urged “swift and unified global action” against climate change and environmental exploitation. 
As a Jesuit university, Georgetown seeks to address sustainability issues through the fund in order to advance positive outcomes for people, University Provost Robert Groves said in a Jan. 29 news release.
“As a global research university guided by our Catholic and Jesuit heritage, Georgetown University is committed to addressing the complex issues of sustainability to advance the common good for current and future generations,” Groves said. 
Laudato Si’ is a continuation of past efforts on campus to make Georgetown more environmentally conscious. The university pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2020, a goal it achieved six years early in 2014.
Arrupe Hall and the Thompson Athletic Center, two of the university’s most recent construction projects, have received LEED Gold certification, the second highest rating for environmentally responsible construction from the U.S. Green Building Council. Since 2009, all new construction has been certified at least LEED Silver. 
Proposals can be submitted by faculty and staff, and by students with at least one academic year remaining at Georgetown. The Office of Sustainability is looking for projects that pursue research, educate leaders on sustainability issues, lead through institutional action and engage with either the local or global community in fighting environmental degradation. 
The Office of Sustainability is responsible for reading the proposals submitted by members of the Georgetown community, according to Aubrey Stewart, the office’s director.
“I’m excited to see the breadth of proposals from students, faculty and staff and to learn more about the ideas that our University community wants to take forward to make Georgetown an ever more sustainable university,” Stewart wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Successful applicants will have to implement their projects or programs by April 15, 2020, and will have to document the results of their plans and submit them to the university.
The fund is a continuation of the Office of Sustainability’s collaboration with William McDonough, a sustainable development expert at William McDonough + Partners, an environmental design firm.
