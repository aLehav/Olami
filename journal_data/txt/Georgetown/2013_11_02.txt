DC Bread & Brew
1247 20th St. NW
$$$$
Nestled away on a side street off of Dupont Circle, DC Bread & Brew would be easy to walk by. The cafe offers healthy food that is sure to satisfy. Its pizza selections, with toppings such as spinach and artichoke hearts, are baked on a delightfully chewy homemade crust. A variety of breads form the basis for an extensive selection of sandwiches, and quiches and salads are also offered — all for less than $10. Daily specials showcase seasonal, local food. For those of you over 21, the cafe is known for the dozen or so beers it has on tap that make it a favorite pub crawl location. The vibe of this restaurant is eco-chic; plates are accompanied by reusable, burlap napkins, and rainforest leaves adorn the walls. Because the cafe is relatively isolated, it’s the perfect place to study for a few hours or get into a deep lunch conversation with a friend.
 
Juice Joint Cafe
2221 Eye St. NW
$$$$
Most people think of juice as a beverage for kids, but make no mistake: Juice Joint Cafe serves choices for the more refined palate. Featuring both signature blends and the option to build your own flavor, the cafe’s juices range from sweet to spicy. The Melon Cooler is a blend of melon, strawberry and ginger, and the 24 Karat is a more traditional combination of orange, pineapple and carrot. Usually ginger is more of an undertone in a juice, but in the Melon Cooler it is much more of a prominent flavor, so be prepared for a little heat. For a richer beverage, Juice Joint also blends up smoothies, made entirely with fresh fruit and juice and with no added sugar.  The cafe also features a full menu of salads, sandwiches, stir-fries and wraps, with many vegan and vegetarian options. Thecaprese salad is made with amazingly fresh mozzarella that makes the simple dish something special. Take the opportunity to also stock up on healthy snacks while at Juice Joint. The cafe carries a huge selection of vegan and gluten-free sweets and features a small marketplace that sells dried fruit, trail mix and other similar items. Juice Joint Cafe is located just a few blocks away from the McPherson Square Metro stop. Make sure to plan your trip wisely though, since the cafe is only open from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday and stops serving food at 4 p.m.
 
Pho Viet & Grille
1639 Wisconsin Ave. NW
$$$$
If you have a craving for pho, the delicious broth-based Vietnamese soup, then Pho Viet & Grille will provide it. The small restaurant is a 10-minute walk up Wisconsin and has a pleasant atmosphere with about a dozen tables downstairs, a secluded upstairs area and a back patio that is lovely on a warm day. While the menu has steak, chicken and fish dishes, the real highlight is the pho. Their five varieties come in ceramic porcelain bowls substantially larger than the size of your head. If you order the regular instead of the appetizer size, you may not be able to finish it alone. The pho is accompanied with the classic fixings: bean sprouts, lime, sriracha sauce and jalapenos. These accompaniments add flavor to what otherwise could be a simple soup. Inexpensive like the rest of the experience, the prices are reasonable and the service is friendly.
 
Firefly
2122 P St. NW
$$$$
For gluten-free diners, finding a restaurant that satisfies both the tastes of their dining companions and their dietary restrictions can be a nightmare. Firefly offers the perfect solution to this problem. Conveniently located in Dupont Circle, this cozy restaurant goes out of its way to create a comprehensive menu that includes choices for everyone, regardless of allergies. While the complimentary rolls are amazing, don’t let that stop you from also ordering a starter. Of the 10 dinner entrees, seven were already gluten-free and two were easily customizable to be so. Despite being gluten-free, the fresh Atlantic salmon paired with truffled cauliflower puree, spaghetti squash and mushrooms doesn’t taste like you’re settling for a mediocre meal. Make sure to not only arrive at Firefly with an empty stomach but also make sure to save room for dessert. The caramelized banana split is the perfect ending to a meal pleasantly free of compromises.

Dolcezza Artisinal Gelato
1560 Wisconsin Ave. NW
$$$$
Dolcezza Artisanal Gelato has many of the features of a coffee shop but focuses on something sweeter. Its gelato, with flavors like maple syrup and Madagascar vanilla, are fresh, tasty and well worth their high-end prices. ThoughDolcezza has a location in Georgetown, its Dupont Circle store has the seating and space that allows for a productive afternoon with lots of studying and delicious treats. The space has one large table in the center with many chairs around it where you can sit amongst others. If you’re looking for more privacy, however, there is also a bar by the window. One thing Dolcezza lacks is Wi-Fi; computer users may find this problematic, but those who need to do some reading may enjoy the forced break from the web. For those who would prefer something sweet to something strong while getting down to work, Dolcezza acts as a nice alternative to the traditional coffeehouse.
 
Chinatown Coffee Co.
475 H St. NW
$$$$
At Chinatown Coffee Co., java is no joke. The coffee selection at this cafe changes every week and features beans from all over the globe; the barista will prepare them in a French press or by hand pour upon request. Regardless of the way the the coffee is made, it will be strong, flavorful and satisfying. Everything about this coffee shop feels straightforward — no artsy decor, no elaborate menu and no expensive prices. Although there are plenty of seats, it might be difficult to find an empty one but once you do, it’s pretty easy to dive right into studying. For one, almost all of the customers have laptops out, taking advantage of the free Wi-Fi. The music, which sounded like a Rolling Stones Pandora station, never gets too loud, and the ambience is pleasant without being hectic. If you find yourself lacking motivation, you’ll definitely find some at Chinatown Coffee Co., either from a cup of Joe or the productivity buzzing around you.
 
Tryst
2549 18th St. NW
$$$$
Located in Adams Morgan, Tryst calls itself a coffeehouse, bar and lounge. Unlike most coffeehouses, however, Tryst has table service. This may, at first, startle those who have been conditioned to Starbucks, but it makes for a more luxurious studying experience. The music sets a great, relaxed vibe for the cafe, but it may get a little loud for someone who wants to focus. In the same way, art lines the walls, giving the place charm but also providing studiers with many other places to look besides their notes. The menu includes an expansive selection of reasonably priced salads, sandwiches and small plates, as well as many desserts and drinks. The waiter will stop by every so often and ask if you want anything else. And whether it’s their signature lavender hot chocolate or one of their delicious sandwiches, chances are you will enjoy an indulgent break from studying.
 
Soho Tea & Coffee
2150 P St. NW
$$$$
Those who like a homey study environment may find it in Soho Tea and Coffee. From its festive red and yellow walls to its friendly staff, this cafe in Dupont Circle feels cozier than most other coffee shops. It has a large menu of sandwiches, sweets and drinks, which are in Mason jar mugs. With their coffee, they avoid the typical and instead introduce new flavors like the Bahama Mama, a coconut and banana latte. The coffee shop gets a lot of students and people looking for a place to work, and they seem equipped for the task. If you plan on using a laptop, Soho asks for a minimum purchase of $5 to use the Wi-Fi. Soho Tea & Coffee doesn’t close earlier than midnight all week, meaning customers can stay for long stretches of time to get work done. Overall, this cafe provides most of the amenities a studier could want, along with warmth, character and charm.

From 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Erica Lumpkin’s schedule is like that of any other student: class, recitation, lab and then homework. But when the clock strikes 3 p.m., she swaps her backpack and civilian clothes for a badge and a blue uniform bearing the words “Georgetown University Department of Public Safety.”
Lumpkin is one of six DPS officers currently enrolled in a degree-granting program via a contract benefit that grants Georgetown employees free tuition at local universities. As a member of Georgetown’s post-baccalaureate program, Lumpkin has had to juggle her pre-med coursework with a full-time job as a DPS officer.
“It’s been a slow journey,” she said. “One of the great things in my department is they are really flexible in terms of scheduling our shifts around school. … Even though we have a commitment to the community, we have a commitment to ourselves as well, and the department really honors that.”
DPS Chief of Police Jay Gruber said the offer of free tuition is a significant component of what draws many officers to the Hilltop.
“It is a big recruitment tool that we have here,” he said. “A college education here costs a lot of money, so many officers forsake a traditional university [experience] to get access to this opportunity.”
Unlike other institutions, Georgetown offers its educational benefits in terms of credit hours instead of a flat monetary amount. According to the university’s website, 120 total credit hours are allotted to Georgetown staff employees, the only stipulation being that one year of service must be completed prior to receiving eligibility.
This benefit is what led Andrew Powell, assistant director of DPS and a law student at American University, to work at Georgetown. After completing his degree, he plans on joining his wife in York, Pa., where he will take the bar examination and begin his law career.
“There are a handful of officers here who are very upfront about wanting to complete their degree, obtain their degree or get their masters, myself included. The first day I walked in the door, I knew I wanted to get some sort of degree and then move on,” Powell said.
Patrol Officer Eric Vilhelmsen, the son of a former DPS officer who is pursuing a paralegal certificate at Georgetown, said that the program can be a boon to DPS’ recruitment efforts.
“It seems to me that officers actually tend to stay here a little longer if they have school,” he said. “When you hire somebody, you never know how long they are going to stay. But if you’re hiring somebody for education, there’s a pretty good bet they’ll stay here for a few years.”
In the meantime, DPS officers enrolled in university courses must balance the standard college student set of obligations with life on the police force.
“It’s hard,” Vilhelmsen said. “The first thing to go is sleep. Today, I got a solid five hours. I had class from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. and then work from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.”
Interacting with students while in the classroom and on duty poses its own set of challenges. For the 28-year-old Lumpkin and other officers in her position, it is important to keep the job and their personal lives separate.
“It’s kind of weird to be in class with a bunch of undergrads in plain clothes and then get into uniform and take on the role [of] an officer. … I’m certainly older than your average undergrad,” she said.
Nonetheless, Lumpkin and her classmates share more than just coursework.
“I still find it’s easy to relate to students,” she said.
Lumpkin is no stranger to balancing work and education. Having graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 2007 while serving as an officer there, she has never experienced college life without the added responsibilities of working in law enforcement, and the two parts of her life frequently collide.
“Students will come to me and they are like, “Oh my gosh, I know this is kind of weird, but are you a DPS officer?” she said.
Lumpkin added that her Georgetown classes help her to better relate to students while on the job, alleviating the often tense relationship between undergraduates and DPS officers.
“There is this perception that at DPS we are aggressive party busters,” Lumpkin said. “When the general community here at Georgetown sees us operating in our normal lives, it helps them to relate to us better.”
Powell agreed that studying among Georgetown students can create a beneficial link for DPS officers who take classes on the Hilltop.
“I have an appreciation of what the students are going through,” he said. “Having been a student myself, I know the pressures and the thinking. … When I was an officer — and now, too — I was able to see things from a student perspective.”
But Lumpkin also emphasized that there is still a code of conduct that cannot be broken.
“You have to operate in an unbiased way, period,” she said. “When you put on a uniform, you have to get into that mindset that you are going to help a community in whatever way you can and you have to do so in a fair way.”
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Erica Lumpkin carried a gun. DPS officers do not carry guns. The corrected version was posted 12:45 p.m. Nov. 2.

For many upperclassmen, serving as a teaching assistant provides a fresh perspective on the classroom.
Unlike graduate students, who are often required to be a TA as part of their research or fellowship, undergraduate students choose the position themselves.
“I love it actually; it’s like one of my favorite things. I like it more than the classes I am taking, and it’s actually really fun,” Probability and Statistics TA Patrick Owens (COL ’14) said.
For Crystal Huang (MSB ’16), a teaching assistant from China, being a TA for a Chinese class gives her a unique perspective on how outsiders see her culture.
“I come from China, and I think it’s really fascinating to see my fellow American students learning Chinese,” Huang said. “I think we have a great Eastern language department, and it’s been a great opportunity to get to know faculty members.”
Matthew Howard (COL ’14), found his time as a TA for both an introductory biology course and an ecology course a useful review of his own knowledge.
“It’s kind of a combination of looking at it from a teaching perspective and then also going through the material again; for me, I found it pretty helpful for studying for the MCAT,” Howard said.
The desire to review the basics spans disciplines. Conor McNulty (COL ’14), an economics major, wanted to be a TA to review the foundations of his major.
“I think it is a great opportunity to teach, but I think it shows really well how you understand something if you can teach it to someone else,” McNulty said.
Oded Meyer, professor of mathematics and statistics, uses exclusively undergraduate students as teaching assistants. When he was first hired, the department gave him graduate TAs, but Meyer chose to switch to undergraduate TAs for his courses.
“I find the undergraduate students to be very loyal, very enthusiastic, and I’ve always had good experiences with undergraduate TAs,” Meyer said.
Meyer also believes that it adds to the undergraduate experience by opening an opportunity to see class from a different perspective.
“It really enriches the undergraduate student’s experience in college to be on the other side and to be part of a teaching team of a course, even if it is only a TA and grading, you are on the other side,” Meyer said.
Owens chose to be a TA because he aspires to be a teacher.
“I want to teach high school math, so I figured this would be a good experience and sort of give the inside scoop for what it is like to be a teacher,” he said.
As undergraduates, many believe that they have a better understanding of the students and what they may be struggling with compared to the graduate students who are TAs in departments such as government, philosophy and the physical sciences.
“A lot of the time, since we have taken the classes that we are TAing for, we know the ropes and the tricks,” Howard said.
Many undergraduate teaching assistants see this as a strength of undergraduate versus graduate TAs.
“I think being a student and not so far removed from having taken the class yourself actually makes undergraduates better TAs for some of these basic courses because sometimes graduate students haven’t taken the course in a while and sometimes it may be a little more challenging for them to understand why someone doesn’t get such a basic concept,” McNulty said.
However, the connection between upperclassmen teaching assistants and their students can make it difficult when grading.
“Needing to grade things is difficult because if you have a personal connection to your students, which I did, and it’s really difficult to dock major amounts of points if you know that they did something wrong, but you still really want to support them through the class,” Lena Bichell (COL ’15), a biology teaching assistant, said.
Requirements for becoming a TA differ widely across departments. While several departments, including Chinese, economics and math, have application processes, TAs in the biology department are chosen directly by professors.
The responsibility of teaching assistants also differs with department. In biology, the TAs assist labs under professor supervision, while economics TAs run recitation sessions independent of professors.
With responsibilities varying greatly, teaching assistants are also compensated in different ways for their services. TAs in departments such as Chinese and economics receive payment, while biology TAs may be eligible to receive credit for an introductory biology course or payment, depending on the class for which they are a TA.
For some, like “Introductory Biology” TA Elizabeth Tubridy (COL ’14), the position comes with less tangible benefits.
“I kind of wanted to do it just as a chance to get to know my professors better and also to give back to the program,” Tubridy said.
