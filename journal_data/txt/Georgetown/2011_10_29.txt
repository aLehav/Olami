A fire broke out Sunday around 3 a.m. at 1930 37th Street. Six fire trucks and at least two ambulances responded to the scene, along with the standard Metropolitan Police Department deployment.
MPD taped off the 1900 block at the time, and fire trucks began to leave the residence at 3:40 a.m.
Firemen at the scene declined to comment, and D.C. officials could not be reached for comment.
Check back for updates throughout the day.
