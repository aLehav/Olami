Aramark workers on Georgetown’s campus negotiated a mutually satisfactory contract with Aramark management last Tuesday, implementing a fair process for worker unionization and improved work and wage conditions in O’Donovan Hall, Hoya Court and the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center.
The deal, ratified 94-0 by workers during a meeting on Thursday night, includes a plan for unionization, a 40-hour paid workweek, an agreements process to report managerial abuse, a cheaper healthcare insurance plan and the creation of a food sustainability committee.
In the past months, workers and members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee have protested against Aramark on allegations of managerial interference in the unionization process and poor work conditions. Workers at the hotel claimed that they were surveyed by managers while they spoke with members of the GSC about the prospect of joining UNITE HERE, the same union that workers at Leo’s, Cosi and Starbucks joined in March 2011.
In January, the GSC created a petition in support of the workers’ demands, which amassed 2,021 signatures from students and other community members.
According to Josh Armstead, a worker at Leo’s who was part of the negotiations committee, Aramark was unwilling to comply with the workers’ demands during the initial stages of the negotiations.
“When we first went into the negotiations, [Aramark] said, ‘Why are you here? We don’t see the need to have a raise or any other benefits,’” Armstead said. “It’s not at the standard of other Aramark universities in D.C. like Catholic, American. Why are we being treated as second-class employees when we work for the same company in the same city, and go through the same circumstances as our brothers and sisters? Their refusal [to listen] was what drove the workers to this victory.”
According to UNITE HERE Local 23 Union Representative Sam Geaney-Moore (SFS ’12), who represents Aramark employees at Georgetown, workers will be able to unionize under the renegotiated contract. Geaney-Moore was a member of the GSC while attending Georgetown as a student and helped fight for workers in Leo’s, Starbucks, Cosi and Wolfington Hall, which unionized in 2011.
“The parties have agreed to a fair process through which all unrepresented employees of Aramark of the Georgetown campus will be able to decide whether or not to join a union prior to the 2015 academic year,” Geaney-Moore said.
Francisco Lopez, a worker at Elevation Burger in Hoya Court, said that unionization provides more opportunities for upward mobility.
“You don’t have to be worried about a new person coming in and taking your spot or a spot that you’ve always wanted, because you have the seniority in placement too, so they have to respect that. They can’t bring somebody else from the street and say ‘Here’s your new boss’ while he doesn’t know anything,” Lopez said.
The renegotiated contract will also enforce a 40-hour workweek so that workers will have the opportunity to work for more paid hours. Currently, the average workweek is 37.5 hours.
In addition, the contract includes a minimum wage increase of 50 cents per hour, with an additional 25-cent increase for workers who fall behind the pay scale. These wage conditions are in conjunction with those of Aramark workers at Catholic University and American University.
Workers will also be covered by a new healthcare insurance plan with increased coverage and no deductibles.
Armstead, a worker at Leo’s who was part of the contract negotiations committee, said that the new insurance plan will reduce the costs of paying for separate coverage.
“You’re no longer paying for separate coverage that will eat your paychecks. Most workers will see definite savings, [in both] single [and] family [plans],” Armstead said. “A lot of our workers have family members — sons, daughters, mothers, fathers — that they’re taking care of. This will help them in terms of health care.”
Lastly, the contract includes the creation of a new food sustainability committee, where workers will be able to provide input on food safety and sustainability practices on campus. Workers will undergo 16 hours of training regarding these practices.
Armstead said that the idea for the committee originated from the workers’ desire to become more involved in discussions regarding the quality of food served on campus.
“Essentially, [we want to] put better food. We actually hear students. I eat the same thing as the students. Most of the time it’s pretty good, but it gets repetitive when you’re at late night and it’s chicken fingers again,” Armstead said.
Overall, Aramark workers at Georgetown have expressed support for the new contract.
Armstead said that he was optimistic about the benefits included in the renegotiated contract, particularly in reference to the wage conditions.
“I believe I should start experiencing this American dream that people keep talking about, ‘cause so far I haven’t seen it,” Armstead said. “I believe that now, I can afford just to be able to live and not feel like I’ll go broke every month. I believe that many workers feel the same. This will help lift them and their families up.
Armstead said that the deal represents a victory for the workers after months of negotiating with Aramark for better treatment in the workplace.
“I can get a general sense that it is a victory that most workers can definitely feel good about. I saw people whose faces showed gloom and doom light up. Most people, who doubted that it wouldn’t happen, finally saw that there’s power in labor. They should feel powerful, not powerless,” Armstead said.

The Westboro Baptist Church announced last weekend that it will picket outside the front gates of Georgetown University next Monday, prompting students to organize two counterprotests in response to the church’s controversial views.
The WBC, which is categorized as a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League of America, has regularly conducted anti-gay protests and picketed military funerals, among other controversial acts, since 1991. The church will be picketing at Georgetown as part of its D.C. tour, during which it will also picket at the White House, the Supreme Court and the Pentagon.
In a campus-wide email sent by Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, the administrators confirmed that the WBC has received a city permit from the Metropolitan Police to picket in the public space outside of the main gates from 4 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Monday.
According to the WBC’s website, church members decided to organize the protest on the basis of Georgetown’s acceptance of LGBTQ students.
“WBC will picket Georgetown University in religious protest and warning: God is not mocked,” the website read. “All people affiliated with the universities of this nation have given themselves to the f – – agenda.
In particular, the WBC cited the LGBTQ Resource Center’s hosting of “OUTober,” a month honoring LGBTQ history and progress, and a quote from former Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) that reads, “Society is changing and God is in that change.” The quote originally appeared in a column written by Tisa for The Hoya in October 2012 prior to his term as GUSA president. The quote was later reprinted in an article by The New York Times, which was referenced by the WBC.
“I would have been less brazen about being a target of their attacks as a 15-year-old in the closet,” Tisa wrote in an email to The Hoya. “For those who lack family and community support, live in areas that share some level of anti-gay sentiment or are struggling with their sexuality, this hate speech cuts deep.”
Tisa said that he will be participating in the counter-protests on Monday to demonstrate his solidarity with Georgetown students against the WBC’s message.
“As a Georgetown alumnus I am proud to be part of a community that stands in solidarity against this message of hate. I really hope we use next Monday’s protest as a force for positive change beyond this group’s half hour of fame,” Tisa said. “I will be joining other Hoyas at the front gates on Monday and hope others will join me in donating to groups [supporting LGBTQ youth].”
In their email, O’Brien and Olson wrote that Georgetown maintains a religious tradition of respect for all individuals and does not condone the views of the WBC.
“We realize that their presence near our campus could be upsetting. At Georgetown, we are deeply proud of our religious tradition and recognize the inherent human dignity of every member of our community,” O’Brien and Olson wrote. “As an institution that values inter-religious understanding, inclusion and respect for all persons, we find the viewpoints of this group offensive, degrading and hateful.”
Several students have begun organizing counter-protests in response to the WBC’s plans for next Monday. In 2011, a group of Georgetown students attended a counter-protest at American University when the WBC picketed at the university.
GU Pride planned a solidarity event, which will take place at Red Square on Monday. 892 people have responded to the Facebook page of the event at press time.
The solidarity event will consist of a prayer led by Fr. Raymond Kemp, as well as activities with other student groups such as cultural and campus ministry groups. Signs will also be distributed for students to use at the Supreme Court the following day, where the WBC will hold another protest expressing their views against gay marriage.
GU Pride President Campbell James (SFS ’17) said that he hopes the solidarity event will demonstrate to the WBC that Georgetown not only accepts, but values diversity.
“GU Pride hopes to counter the hate speech from the WBC by creating an environment where all Hoyas can be celebrated for their diverse backgrounds,” James said. “We want to show the WBC that Georgetown students do not tolerate attacks on any of their students.”
Breanne Kincaid (COL ’16) is also planning a counter-protest at the main gates where the WBC members will be picketing. Although the counter-protest is not organized in affiliation with any student groups, Kincaid has received support from individual students willing to help her with the counter-protest. At press time, 660 people RSVPed to the Facebook page of the event.
Like James, Kincaid said that she would like the counter-protest to dwarf the WBC’s protest.
“I want to overpower the WBC with our sheer numbers,” she said. “I want to be more vocal, more passionate and so overwhelming in our presence that the WBC can’t help but see that they are fighting a losing battle by protesting against human rights on our campus.”
Kincaid said that she plans on silencing the WBC at the protest by using loudspeakers and megaphones.
“If everything falls in the right place these next few days, I should be able to get loudspeakers and megaphones so that the air is so saturated by our message, the WBC can’t get a word in,” Kincaid said.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly included “S.J.” as Fr. Raymond Kemp’s post-nominal title. He is not a member of the Society of Jesus.

“We want to show the WBC that Georgetown students do not tolerate attacks on any of their students.”
Except, you know, when students are “offended” by an innocuous editorial cartoon about GUSA candidates.

The worst thing that can happen is if students try and beat these idiots “with numbers.” Their message is assanine;  t.he only thing that keeps these idiots relevant is through well intentioned people fueling their fire with chest thumping anti protests,Howev this doesn’t mean they odd Scott free. For instance …have somone with a stop watch and the SECOND after 430 call he police and get them  legitimately arrested for trespassing/loitering

I find it interesting to see the Georgetown community’s response to the Westboro Baptist Church at the same time that Georgetown Alumni is appointing the author of this article to the Board of Governors: https://www.thehoya.com/same-sex-kiss-photo-mocks-gus-legacy/

The Georgetown University Law Center, along with law firms Arent Fox LLP and DLA Piper LLP, will open the D.C. Affordable Law Firm, a new nonprofit law firm aimed at serving lower-income individuals, in fall 2015.
Initially, the firm will consist of six lawyers, all of whom are GULC students set to graduate this year. Employees will be paid $20,160 for their efforts over a 15-month period, but donations and other revenue could increase that salary to over $40,000. Applications for the firm, open exclusively to GULC students, closed last Friday.
The firm will focus on providing legal services for lower-income clients, charging approximately $50 per hour.
Sheldon Krantz, a retired DLA Piper partner and current GULC professor, will serve as executive director.
Krantz said the basic idea for a ‘low bono’ firm, one that provides discounted legal services, came from an observed lack of quality legal aid for those who cannot afford the average cost of an attorney, which can range from $200 to $1,000 per session. In family court, 90 percent of citizens choose to represent themselves due to a lack of sufficient funds to pay for a lawyer.
“There are probably well over a hundred thousand people in the D.C. area who have very little income but don’t qualify for legal aid,” Krantz said. “The three organizations, Georgetown, DLA Piper and Arent Fox, all feel that it’s really important to make sure that lawyers are available to help this group.
GULC Dean William Treanor added that D.C. Affordable Law Firm targets a large, underserved demographic in the Washington, D.C. area.
“The ‘low bono’ law firm that we are creating will provide legal services at a reduced rate for people who earn two to four times the poverty level,” Treanor said. “That’s an enormous amount of people. In Washington, D.C., alone, that’s 100,000 people.”
Marc Fleischaker, a partner at Arent Fox who helped bring the deal together, explained that the majority of people with moderate incomes, which he defined as anywhere from $20,000 to $90,000, cannot afford legal coverage. The members of this group fall between those who can generally afford legal coverage and the individuals who have a low enough salary to qualify for donated legal aid.
“Most people with moderate incomes … can’t afford to pay what lawyers cost,” Fleischaker said. “It’s just not a fair and balanced contest.”
GULC professor Peter Edelman, who has been active in working to increase legal service accessibility for lower income citizens, also helped with the development of the nonprofit firm. After discussing the matter with Treanor, Edelman approached six law firms and gauged their interest in creating a ‘low bono’ firm. Arent Fox agreed to help.
When Krantz heard of Edelman’s efforts, he asked his former law firm, DLA Piper, to also become involved with the project. They agreed to join with Arent Fox to provide advice and training for the new lawyers.
Arent Fox will be working in close capacity with each of the new lawyers, and will provide the nonprofit firm 10 lawyers, partners and associates, as well as a few staff members, for training and mentorship. Additionally, Arent Fox will provide a conference room for the firm and an office for each attorney.
“We’re involved in a lot of different ways,” Fleischaker said. “Hopefully, [we can] help teach the new lawyers how to be successful.”
Edelman said the assistance of Arent Fox and DLA Piper is a unique aspect of GULC’s partnership.
“There are a few somewhat similar programs sponsored by [other] law school[s],” Edelman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “[B]ut there aren’t any that we know of that involve a partnership between a law school and major national law firms.”
Treanor also emphasized how unprecedented the project is and praised Edelman for his leadership in bringing the nonprofit firm together.
“This is the first firm of its kind,” Treanor said. “This has more training than any of the other models and the participants will also get a graduate law degree.”
In addition to Krantz’s role as executive director, the program will also consist of a three-member board for the firm. The board, which has yet to be selected, will include representatives from the GULC, DLA Piper and Arent Fox.
Krantz described his position as akin to a new full time job in addition to his responsibilities as a professor, but added that he is passionate about the project.
“I’m really looking forward to taking the challenge on,” Krantz said. “I’m [running the law firm] on a pro bono basis because I really care about it.”
GULC faculty will review the applications to the firm in an initial screening process, but the final decision will be left up to the board of the firm in the coming weeks.
“We’ll be reviewing all those applications,” Krantz said. “We’re sure because of the high quality of GU law students, we’re going to have a very strong group of lawyers.”
Krantz highlighted his excitement at seeing how the law firm will function and expressed hope that other law schools will be inspired to develop similar nonprofit firms.
“What we’re starting, which is this nonprofit law firm, is a pretty unique undertaking,” Krantz said. “We think it’s going to be important here in the District, and we think it could serve as a model for others.”

“Low bono” law firm? That sounds ridiculous – about as ridiculous as a major for-profit law firm could make it out to be.  Sounds like a great scheme to gift jobs to unemployed graduates while still charging a fee.  Don’t conflate the line between whatever the hell  “low-income” means and poor – or who is most deserving of legal services.  GULC upped the income qualifications to justify charging a fee and to turn these students into small-time private practitioners rather than real providers of legal services.

The Student Advocacy Office has been restructured to include branches for student workers, mental health and free speech, under the direction of Director Ryan Shymansky (COL ’16) and Georgetown University Student Association President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16).
Esmeralda Huerta (SFS ’17) will serve as the student workers’ advocate, Vincent DeLaurentis (SFS ’17) will serve as the free speech advocate and Emily Fish (SFS ’17) will serve as the mental health advocate.
In addition, Jack Nalen (COL ’17) will serve as the students’ rights advocate, a position that will fulfill the SAO’s current goal to educate students about their rights.
The new SAO is intended to be more efficient and responsive to concerns about students’ rights.
“The restructuring … will allow advocates to aid students with issues in student rights, student worker rights, free speech and mental health, but it will also consolidate these services under a single advocacy body for maximum efficacy,” Rohan said. “This will allow advocates to better collaborate and respond to more students in a more meaningful manner.”
Another addition to the SAO is an “on-call” advocate, who will be able to respond to enforcement of the Speech and Expression Policy in real time.
Luther said that these changes will enable the SAO to take on a larger role and address the needs of more students.
“The SAO has been very successful in the past in terms of advocating for students and keeping them informed of their rights,” Luther said. “This restructuring looks to build on that success and increase the capability of the SAO to advocate for students in all areas of campus life.”
The changes to the SAO are primarily administrative and will not affect the day-to-day functionality of the office itself, beyond expanding its focus into new issue areas.
Shymansky said that the consolidation of services into the SAO will allow GUSA to function as a more streamlined advocacy body.
“The SAO is by far the best avenue available to GUSA for providing help to individual students, and so it’s an incredibly important resource to house within the executive,” Shymanksy said. “We’ve seen how far the SAO has come in four years. … I know that it is possible to replicate this with new offices focused on equally important issue areas.”
The newly formed Office of the Free Speech Advocate will create and promote resources explaining the university’s Free Speech and Expression Policy.
It will also provide training to groups and individuals interested in learning how to stage protests without facing disciplinary action, in addition to serving as an advisory body for students writing and presenting complaints and appeals.
DeLaurentis said that he will work closely with Secretary of Free Speech Sam Kleinman (COL ’16), Under-Secretary for Unrecognized Groups Kala Deterville (COL ’18) and other GUSA secretaries to engage students at the forefront of free speech and expression on campus.
“I hope to enhance protections for student speech, especially in more confrontational iterations,” DeLaurentis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I want students to feel like they should not be afraid of university reprisal in the expression of their speech, especially if that speech criticizes or embarrasses the university.”
Georgetown’s policy has come under fire from organizations like the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which named the university as one of the nation’s 10 worst colleges for free speech.
Kleinman emphasized the distinction between his position and that of DeLaurentis, both of which engage free speech on campus.
“I definitely focus a bit more on larger policy changes and ensuring that policy in broad strokes is properly enforced,” Kleinman said. “The Office of the Free Speech Advocate is focused a bit more on case work and ensuring individual cases and protections from policy.”
Nalen is responsible for overseeing the customary SAO office, where he will work with Shymansky and the Office of Student Conduct on conduct policy.
“Right now the biggest issue for our office, and for students’ rights in general, is that many students don’t really know about either,” Nalen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I want to make sure we are establishing awareness of students’ rights and important conduct policies as soon as students arrive on campus.”
Shymansky believes that this SAO will be better suited to deal with the intersections of conduct and free speech on campus.
“We’ve seen how interrelated many of these topics can be,” Shymanksy said, citing the incident in March in which GU Fossil Free members stormed the stage during World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim’s speech. “Having the resources available to advise students on more than one front is thus enormously beneficial the Georgetown student community as a whole.”

A talk by author and former philosophy professor Christina Hoff Sommers, who discussed her views on feminism, sparked student protest and dialogue throughout campus.
Sommers spoke Thursday night, giving a talk titled “What’s Right (and Badly Wrong) with Feminism” at the invitation of the Georgetown University College Republicans. Members of campus groups such as H*yas for Choice and Sexual Assault Peer Educators protested before and during the event, citing her prior statements regarding sexual assault.
In May 2014, Sommers wrote an article in TIME in which she described rape culture as “a panic where paranoia, censorship and false accusations flourish.” Sommers also wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post in January 2012, which claimed that the Center for Disease Control’s 2010 study on sexual violence in America “overstates the problem.”
Student protesters posted trigger warnings around the Healy Hall classroom in which the speech took place, alerting students that Sommers’ speech would contain potentially anti-feminist dialogue that may be traumatizing to survivors of sexual assault. Protesters also stood at the back of the room, but they remained silent during the speech.
Additionally, student groups Take Back the Night and SAPE set up a “safe space” in Maguire Hall, with the goal of supporting survivors emotionally triggered by the event. SAPE members provided information about sexual assault resources in the room.
Sommers began her speech by defining her ideology of “freedom feminism,” which rejects the notion that females receive unequal treatment in society.
“I rejected the idea that American women are an oppressed class,” Sommers said. “I describe feminism as a great American success story that women are flourishing in so many ways, and it’s no longer possible to say who’s better off because it’s a complicated mix.”
According to Sommers, freedom feminism is influenced by traditional versions of feminism in that it also rejects conformity to gender roles.
“Freedom feminism draws aspects of both the egalitarian and maternal tradition of feminism. It shares with the egalitarians an aversion to rigid gender roles,” Sommers said. “If I had to reduce its message to a single sentence, it would be that in pursuit of happiness, men and women tend to choose somewhat different paths.”
In addition, Sommers said that since the main differences between the sexes are biological rather than societal, members of both sexes have free will in determining their futures.
“We should credit one another with free agency. … There is no need to socially engineer a society,” Sommers said.
Sommers also said that contemporary feminism propagates incorrect and misinformed statistics.
“There’s a lot of bad things that happen to men that aren’t talked about. It happens to be the case that in universities, there is a lot of exaggeration. In women’s studies textbooks, they tend to exaggerate women’s vulnerability and understate the problems of men,” Sommers said.
In reference to the trigger warnings posted in response to her speech, Sommers criticized the censorship against potentially controversial speakers on college campuses.
“On campus, you see cries for censorship for speakers. The most extreme thing I saw was a feminist leadership conference in London and they had a trigger warning that you should not clap because that was causing anxiety and that you should instead use jazz hands,” Sommers said.
H*yas for Choice member Michaela Lewis (COL ’18) stood outside the event while holding a sign that read “This event may be triggering.”
Lewis said that she was standing in solidarity with sexual assault survivors, whom she accused Sommers of trivializing.
“We’re here tonight to silently protest. [Sommers] has, in the past, made statements trivializing survivors of sexual assault and saying that survivors are not legitimate. We are here in solidarity with survivors,” Lewis said.
Students standing at the back of the room held signs that read “Feminists Against Rape Apology,” “We respect your opinion, but we wholeheartedly disagree with you” and “Survivors, I support you.”
Adrianna Zinn (NHS ’15), who volunteered in the safe space in Maguire Hall, said that it was important for the community to stand in solidarity with survivors.
“I decided to be in the safe space because I didn’t feel comfortable going to the event and not being triggered, which is why trigger warnings are important,” Zinn said. “We’ve had people coming in and out all night showing solidarity and processing things and it’s been really helpful for people.”
GU College Republicans President Amber Athey (COL ’16) said that she did not feel it was necessary to provide a trigger warning for the event, as it was not originally intended to cover the issue of sexual assault.
“I don’t believe GUCR had an obligation to provide a trigger warning for the event,” Athey said. “GUCR believes that survivors of sexual assault are responsible enough and more qualified than we are to decide whether or not they can attend an event. Furthermore, the talk was not supposed to cover sexual assault until the topic was raised by some students.”
Students who attended the event had mixed responses.
GU College Republicans board member Paul Spezia (SFS ’17) said that he enjoyed the dialogue that Sommers’ speech prompted.
“I’m glad everyone came out to have the discussion. I was a little worried that we weren’t going to have a diversity of opinions and it was nice to see that,” Spezia said. “I thought it was a different view and a discussion that I think needs to be had.”
College Republicans member Erica Tillotson (COL ’18) agreed with Spezia and said that she was pleased that the speech brought a different perspective to feminism.
“I thought it was a very thought-provoking dialogue and it’s very necessary for us to have it and for both parties to speak as well as listen to the other side to make progress on the issue,” Tillotsom said.
SAPE member Queen Adesuyi (COL ’16) criticized Sommers’ comments that males are repressed and not succeeding in school environments. According to Adesuyi, Sommers neglected the factor of race in her discussion.
“It was an extremely problematic talk. She was racist, ableist and her [statistics] on boys being suspended is extremely racialized,” Adesuyi said. “Her insensitivity to race was absolutely ridiculous.”
Students also took issue with Sommers’ use of language throughout the speech. Stephanie Estevez (COL ’16) said that Sommers’ usage of the term “Asperger-y” was  ableist.
“She was making fun of people with Aspegers, she was making fun of flapping and when we came up to her to tell her she was being ableist, she basically said ‘Whatever, it doesn’t affect me so I don’t care,’” Estevez said.
Correction: An earlier version of the article said that Tillotson was pleased with Sommers’ different perspective of feminism and sexual assault. Tillotson’s quote is in reference to only Sommers’ views on feminism, not on sexual assault.

Congratulations to Amber, Paul, Erica, and all the CR’s for bringing to campus an important intellectual at the forefront of the discussions about the rot that has become modern feminism.
Sommers does a great job using facts, statistics, and common sense, to dispel feminists myths like the wage gap nonsense and the hysteria surrounding the presumed prevalence of campus rape. Diverse ideas like her’s are what’s needed at Georgetown since we know we won’t find them in campus media.  
While this article has some really lame behavior and insane comments from certain students, (Queen, for instance, quickly pulling the race card and going ad hominem . . . girl, you have a great future in the grievance industry as a professional victim), what’s really sad is the accompanying editorial which says data, evidence, facts, and logic about the rape on-campus don’t matter, and are just “distractions” we should ignore.  They even called the conversation “harmful,” which can only mean they think students are so immature, weak of mind, and cowardly that they cannot deal with adult discussion.  
Ladies and gentlemen, we don’t have a “rape culture” at Georgetown, on college campuses in general, or at Georgetown.  Rape culture doesn’t exist, except perhaps in prisons.  
Name a university administrator, professor, student, or campus club that endorses, supports, or excuses rape.  You can’t.
Name an American politician, public intellectual, business titan, or institution or business, that endorses, supports, or excuses it.  You can’t.
How many editorials in campus press or the media have you seen endorsing, supporting, or excusing it?  How many speeches?  How much programming do we have on campus to increase the amount of rapes?  The answer to all these questions . . . none.
A plethora of free resources exist for those who allege rape, both on-campus and off. When rape allegations occur, steps are taken to investigate it and hold rapists accountable. 
The fact is we have an anti-rape culture.  It is not in the interest, however, for feminist to acknowledge this, as it impacts their funding and their ability to secure special treatment for women.  They do the same with the bogus wage gap statistics, and many more, which those with a basic understanding of math can tell are false.  
By the Queen, you should research and discover the amount of men who go to college vs. women and the number who go and actually graduate compared to women.  Also look at grades.  You’ll see that women do far better than men in academia.  When you’re done, you may want to look at male vs. female incarceration rates, who is more likely to be a victim of crime, who has more suicides, who dies on the job more, who is more likely to be homeless, and who dies earlier.  You’ll find that it’s the men.

Well done! It’s nice to see a student run University paper present opposing viewpoints in a comprehensive unbiased manner. A rare thing these days.

As a parent I expect a certain amount of babble from students and the Academic environment. Neither is the real world and both basically have no experience in which to support their views. However it troubles me greatly that now with all of the diversity nonsense, inclusion, exclusion and so on there are now warnings for “trigger events” I’m just sitting here laughing my ass off. How are you people that need these warnings going to get thru life ???????

Isn’t “Trigger Warning: Anti-Feminist” basically just saying “Trigger Warning: Does not Agree With You”?

Queen should look at this data. Apparently boys of all races are more likely to be suspended than girls.

Creating Survivors, a student-run nonprofit dedicated to mental health issues, has plans to expand its Georgetown chapter to provide services to more students.
The nonprofit, which was created in September 2014 by Jairus Nytes (COL ’16), provides students with free access to licensed psychotherapists to prevent teen suicide and assist students struggling with mental health. Nytes intends for the Georgetown chapter to be a pilot upon which other universities can base their own Creating Survivors programs.
“As I have re-evaluated how health services are offered in general on college campuses, it became very clear to me that the need is present here on college campuses,” Nytes said. “Just because services are out there doesn’t mean they are the most effective services that students need.”
The university has received criticism for its poor management of the Georgetown Counseling and Psychiatric Service, which critics argue receives insufficient funding and training for its counselors.
The program has a three-pronged approach: advocacy for funding for psychotherapists in schools and for minors without parental consent; counseling and support for students struggling with mental illness; and training for educators to inform them about the intricacies of mental health. These services are available to Georgetown students.
To Nytes, peer counseling is the most effective method of preventing the problems related to mental health. He cited his own experience as an example of the positive peer counseling he wishes to impart on others who look to Creating Survivors for health services.
“Counseling radically changed my life,” Nytes said. “It helped me focus on my education so that I could continue and get to Georgetown.”
Currently, the group is working with CAPS to create a master curriculum for its peer-counseling program, in which participants will be educated about recognizing depression and suicidal tendencies among peers. This curriculum also includes student-led support groups focused on specific issue areas such as substance abuse and eating disorders.
CAPS President Philip Meilman explained that he looked to Cornell University’s student-led, free counseling program, Empathy, Assistance and Referral Service, as an inspiration for Creating Survivors. Meilman provided advice and support to Nytes, utilizing Cornell’s program as a template.
Cornell’s EARS program, which was established in the early 1970s, provides professional peer-counseling services for members of the university community.
“We provided Jairus Nytes with background information regarding the peer support program at Cornell University,” Meilman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Nytes plans on improving the existing program by increasing the number of free psychotherapy sessions that students can receive, reforming Georgetown’s medical leave of absence policy to better suit students’ needs and reorganizing the budget for the next year to increase the amount of money spent on mental health.
According to Nytes, the original target audience for the program was middle and high school students. However, after discussing his idea with other students at Georgetown, he received an overwhelmingly positive response and realized that the program should be utilized at Georgetown, and eventually, at other universities and high schools.
“We were going to start the program here in the Georgetown area and get college students interested and have them run this program in high schools,” Nytes said. “[But] as I was talking to more and more students, the response that I continuously got was ‘That’s awesome, but can you do it at Georgetown too?’”
After learning of students’ and administrators’ desire for a larger mental health program on campus, Nytes decided to focus exclusively on mental health at Georgetown. After discussion with the program’s board of directors, which includes Georgetown students, Nytes opened peer counselor applications for Georgetown students.
Nytes expressed his gratitude to Georgetown’s administrators, students, faculty and alumni for offering to help him hone his ideas for Creating Survivors.
“Creating Survivors would not exist without Georgetown University,” Nytes said. “Creating Survivors is filling a gap that a lot of students have wanted to be filled.”
Gabby Johnson (COL ’18) sees the need for a more supportive, student-led, on-campus counseling option and believes that Creating Survivors will provide an important avenue of therapy for students who may not be comfortable talking to traditional psychotherapists.
“Students may also feel more comfortable talking to other students because they may be able to better relate to someone closer to their own age,” Johnson said. “It’s important to keep the conversation going about mental health.”

Along with the recent announcements of several 2016 presidential campaigns, Georgetown students with experience working with both Democratic and Republican candidates have expressed optimism about the future of the race.
Jenna Galper (COL ’17) previously worked with the Ready for Hillary political action committee, and expressed excitement about Clinton’s campaign, which was announced with a two-minute YouTube video released April 12.
“I’m absolutely excited that Hillary Clinton is running and I think she’ll make a great President,” Galper wrote in an email to the hoya. “My time working at Ready for Hillary PAC has made me even more excited for her candidacy, because I got to meet and interact with such a diverse group of supporters from all over the country who are just as passionate about electing her as I am.”
Immediately following her announcement, Clinton began her campaign with a three-day road trip from New York to Iowa, with several stops along the way.
Galper said that she believes Clinton’s campaign thus far demonstrates a sense of humility.
“As we’ve seen from her first week of campaigning, Clinton certainly isn’t acting like she’s inevitable,” Galper wrote. “By roadtripping to Iowa and avoiding large press events, Clinton is demonstrating that she’s committed to spending the campaign season listening to the concerns of real Americans, regardless of what pundits are saying about her electoral chances. She is clearly running a people-focused campaign, and not a coronation.”
President of Young Americans for Liberty Mitchell Tu (SFS ’17), who previously interned with Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), who announced his candidacy on April 7, said he supports his campaign, but is also open to other candidates.
“I would love him to win, though to be honest I have more doubts now, due to a slight change in views,” Tu said.
Chair of the Georgetown College Republicans Amber Athey (COL ’16) also said she supports Paul as a presidential nominee, but highlighted other possible candidates as well.
“I have been following Rand Paul’s campaign quite a bit and really identify with his ideology,” Athey said. “However, I believe Jeb Bush has the experience and composure necessary to lead, so I’m torn.”
On the Republican side, two other candidates have already begun campaigning. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) was the first to announce candidacy on March 23, with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) following on April 13.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, the rest of the nation is similarly torn across potential Republican nominees. Potential candidate Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, has a slight edge with 17 percent of support, but numerous contenders follow closely behind in the poll. Paul, Rubio and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, a potential candidate, stand at 11 percent each, with Cruz at 7 percent.
Both Athey and Tu said they believe that the Republican Party is moving in a more libertarian direction.
“The Republican Party has become increasingly pluralistic, as the ideas of economic conservatism and individual liberty resonate with many voters,” Athey said. “I expect that this trend will continue and we will see an increase in Republicans who are economically conservative but socially more liberal.”
Tu added this possible ideological shift could be attributed to views of younger voters.
“The future of the Republican Party, as driven by necessity, will involve more young people and Libertarians,” Tu said. “That is, of course, barring any big changes in the future.”
On the Democratic side, the poll shows a much clearer leader in Clinton. She is still the only Democratic candidate to officially announce a presidential campaign.
According to the poll, nearly 70 percent of Democrats support Clinton over potential candidate Vice President Joe Biden, who came in at 11 percent. Other potential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT), former Senator Jim Webb (D-VA), former Governor of Rhode Island Lincoln Chafee and former Governor of Maryland Martin O’Malley rounded out the poll with less than 5 percent of the votes each.
Chair of College Democrats Matthew Gregory (SFS ’17) said that Clinton is in a strong position to secure widespread support due to her experience, despite some dips in poll numbers likely due to the recent controversy surrounding her use of a personal email account while serving as Secretary of State.
“She is right now absolutely best positioned among a weak Democratic field to gain significant nationwide support and win the party nomination,” Gregory said. “Clinton is uniquely qualified for the office after a multidisciplinary career in government, and moreover, has attained consummated levels of familiarity with a number of foreign and domestic issues with which many competitors lack even minimal prior knowledge.”
However, Gregory added that there is no guarantee Clinton will ultimately be elected as the Democratic presidential nominee.
“I would hesitate to say that Hillary Clinton is necessarily the inevitable winner of the Democratic primary,” Gregory said. “A dark horse candidate could still emerge and exploit any signs of complacency Clinton may exhibit.”

A lighting storm left university buildings without power and students without Wi-Fi connectivity throughout much of campus Monday night.
According to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey, power outages and Wi-Fi failure occurred in the Rafik B. Hariri Business School Building, Darnall Hall, sections of Leavey Center and parts of the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital complex.
“The power outages were caused by the passing storms typically resulting from faults in the power grid and the power feeders safety shutdowns,“ Morey said.
With students’ taking to social media to express discontent with the lack of power and Internet in Darnall, the outages are estimated to have lasted over an hour.
Morey was unable to provide a specific time frame for repairs, but estimated that everything would be back to normal by the start of business Tuesday.
“Our utilities team is on site working to reset our feeders and bring power back to affected buildings,” Morey said.
Bianca DiSanto (MSB ’17) said that the Wi-Fi failure exacerbated the progress of her work.
“I was working on a Google Doc for a group project when the power and Wifi went out. It basically solidified why everyone hates group work,” DiSanto said.
Likewise, Sebastian Velastegui (MSB ’18) said that the power outage was inconvenient especially as it occurred at such a late hour.
“The power loss was more of a struggle because both my laptop and phone were dying with no power outlet in function to charge, and I needed to have my alarms working so that I could make it to class on time in the morning,” Velastegui said.

Executive Director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State Rev. Barry Lynn, Esq. (LAW ’78) discussed the role of religion in government at an event hosted by the Secular Students Alliance on Thursday night at White-Gravenor Hall.
In the past few decades, Lynn has advocated for the separation of church and state through his position as a minister in the United Church of Christ and various media appearances.
Lynn started the lecture by affirming the separation of church and state as a constitutional value, while noting the scale of religious influence and the discrimination against non-theists in political campaigns.
“I don’t think you should make policies in the United States based on anybody’s understanding of the Holy Scripture,” Lynn said. “We make decisions based on commonly shared values in everyone, so often articulated so well in the Constitution: equal protection under the law, freedom of speech [and] separation of church and state.”
According to Lynn, politicians from earlier periods of American history have advocated for the separation of religion from politics more than current politicians have. For instance, he cited President Ulysses S. Grant’s banning of religious teaching in public schools and President John F. Kennedy’s declaration of the separation of church and state.
“I don’t think there’s any candidate in either political party today, not even sure about the minority parties, who would make a statement like [Kennedy’s] and not fear that he or she would be ostracized and probably defeated for public offices,” Lynn said.
While he conceded America’s high level of religious freedom in comparison to other countries, Lynn said it is challenging to achieve the separation of church and state with 20 percent of the electorate self-identifying with the religious right.
“I think the country today does not have a problem with Christians being subjected to discriminatory treatment,” Lynn said. “It does have a problem with two things. … [One is] inertia, as when something gets started, it’s hard to stop it. The other is momentum.”
Lynn then discussed his involvement with the creation of the Federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. While the FRFRA influenced the ruling of the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. case, Lynn questioned the legal basis for defining corporations as religious.
Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. was a landmark decision that allowed closely held for-profit corporations to be exempt from a law if its owners religiously objected to it.
“I don’t believe it was a reasonable assessment of what this bill [FRFRA] is about, because going through the entire debate, there was no reference to this ever covering corporations except the Church,” Lynn said.
Lynn also questioned the recent events surrounding Memories Pizza in Indiana, which refused to cater a gay wedding under the Public Accommodation Act.
“You just have to be served,” Lynn said. “The service is catering. The service is photographing [an] event. That’s what public accommodation does.”
Lynn said that he was disappointed in President Barack Obama for maintaining the faith-based initiatives and for allowing tax-exempt groups, including churches, to endorse candidates for public office.
“Leaders, I think, are supposed to lead,” Lynn said. “They are supposed to be people who make the arguments that other people can now look up to and not to wait for everybody or the critical mass.”
SSA President Katherine Landau said that Lynn was representative of a larger secular movement beyond Georgetown’s campus.
“It was really good to have that voice from the secular community in D.C.,” Landau said. “As the Secular Students Alliance is gearing more towards the community aspect, giving the atheists a community on campus, it was really good to dig into our roots to hear about those current issues and what he has to say about them. He was a very eloquent speaker.”
SSA member Mallory Vial (COL ’18) said that she enjoyed hearing about Lynn’s perspective and his personal approach to discussing secular issues with students.
“Barry was very engaging and personally interacted with everyone there, even calling us by name,” Vial said. “While Barry lobbies for secular issues, he is also a reverend. As most members of our group identify as non-theists, Barry’s secular but religious perspective was very interesting to hear about.”

The Hoya has transitioned to a new editorial and publishing staff for fall 2015. The new staff, who began their terms April 20, produced their first print issue today.
Former Campus News Editor Katherine Richardson (COL ’17) begins a semesterlong term as executive editor, taking over from Carolyn Maguire (COL ’16).
“I’m so excited to read and help develop content in multiple sections of The Hoya as executive editor. My background in news has given me a comprehensive knowledge of campus issues, but I’m ready to expand my knowledge base and learn more about our school and the D.C. area,” Richardson said.
Former Photo Editor Daniel Smith (SFS ’17) will serve as managing editor, replacing Alexander Brown (COL ’16).
“As photography editor last term, I was able to work extensively with The Hoya’s visual identity. Now I get to have an impact on our words, and for that, I am truly excited,” Smith said.
Former Multimedia Editor and former Campus News Editor Molly Simio (SFS ’17) is the new online editor, succeeding Jess Kelham-Hohler (COL ’17).
“I am excited to continue to expand The Hoya’s online presence in this position, which is still relatively new,” Simio said. “My term got off to a rocky start; the demise of SaxaNet within my term’s first few hours had the potential to cast the role of online editor into irrelevance, but I am hopeful that it can only improve from this point.”
Christina Wing (MSB ’16) begins a yearlong term as chair of the board of directors, taking over from Sheena Karkal (COL ’15). Wing previously served as director of corporate development in spring 2014, and was the chief coordinator for The Hoya’s Anniversary Gala.
“I’m really looking forward to take on my new role as chair of the board. After planning The Hoya’s 95th Anniversary Gala, I believe I can continue to advance The Hoya as an institution,” Wing said. “Coming from the publishing side, I hope to apply my business background to ensure a lifelong, lasting legacy and am excited to work more closely with editorial.”
Mallika Sen (SFS ’16) will continue her yearlong term as editor-in-chief, and Brian Carden (MSB ’16) will continue to serve as general manager in his yearlong position.
