Though the American University in Cairo reopened the week of Feb. 14, none of the 15 Georgetown students who began their semesters there will return.
University spokeswoman Julie Bataille stated that the students, who were evacuated on Jan. 24 amid riots against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak’s regime, were given four options to complete their semesters. They could choose to return to D.C. or continue to study abroad at locations in Qatar, Morocco or Turkey.
Students embarked for each location, according to Jennifer Chao (COL ’12), one of the evacuated students.
Michelle Saks (COL ’12), who chose to join the America-Mideast Educational and Training Services, Inc. (AMIDEAST) program in Rabat, Morocco for the semester, expressed disappointment at the limited number of options the students were given,but felt Georgetown handled a unique and difficult situation well overall.
“I wish we would have had more choices in terms of locations and programs, but given the short time frame and fact that most programs are already well on their way I understand that there were not many options,” Saks said in an email.
Chau chose to finish her semester in Doha at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service in Qatar because she felt it would allow her to meet many of the same goals she had had for her stay in Cairo. She was disappointed that her experience in Egypt was cut short but expressed enthusiasm for her new environment.
“I feel lucky to have been able to witness history in Egypt and I am continuing to witness history in the making at Qatar,” Chau said in an email. “It’s a very special time to be in the Middle East right now and I know that this will be an experience that I will remember throughout my life.”
Saks said she is going to make the most of her semester, regardless of the unusual circumstances.
“I am really looking forward to taking advantage of this semester, learning a new dialect and exploring another North African country,” she said . “Of course I wish I could return to Egypt, but given the situation it’s best that I use what … Cairo has taught me and make the most out of what Morocco and this program has to offer.”
Chau made her decision based on the courses offered at each program.
“The Turkey option offers no Arabic and the Morocco option didn’t offer many classes which would satisfy requirements for Georgetown,” she said in an email. “Doha was best in terms of fitting in requirements since it’s Georgetown as well.”
Bataille was unable to give an exact number of students who selected each program. She emphasized that Georgetown is working to ensure that the rest of the semester runs as smoothly as possible.
“At this point it’s important for them to be able to focus on the remainder of their semester and make it as successful as possible,” Bataille said.
The Office of International Programs could not be reached for comment by press time.

Bucking national university trends, a liberal arts college in Tennessee announced its plans to lower tuition by 10 percent this fall on Feb. 16.
Lowering tuition will enable Sewanee College to compete with other public institutions’ rates as well as compete with private institutions’ tuitions that are likely to be raised for this fall, according to The New York Times.
Sewanee Vice Chancellor John McCardell attributed the tuition drop to the fact that many Americans who are struggling economically consider the affordability of higher education one of their top concerns, according to a video on the Sewanee website
“Higher education is on the verge of pricing itself beyond the reach of more and more families.  The goal is very simple — to make a top rated liberal arts education more accessible to more of the best students,” McCardell said in the video.
At this point, Sewanee is financially stable enough to carry through with the tuition cuts so that endowments can fill in the tuition gaps where necessary, according to The New York Times.
The education of a single student at the college level costs more than the tuition itself, but subsidies are responsible for covering the rest of these costs, according to a study by the Delta Cost Project, an organization based out of Washington, D.C. that collects data and analyzes information necessary to help improve college affordability.
The amount of money required to educate a student has remained fairly constant, according to the Delta Cost Project website. Rising tuition rates are caused not by rising costs but by a drop in the amount of subsidy money going toward that education.
With this shift in funds, increases in tuition have become the general pattern seen at universities today.
About 12 schools have frozen their tuitions this year and none have lowered them other than Sewanee, according to the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.
Some schools, however, are making efforts to moderate the amount by which they raise their tuitions.
Georgetown has raised its tuition by about 3 percent for the past three years. The 2.9 percent jump for the 2009-2010 academic year was the smallest percent increase since 1973 for the school.
University Provost James O’Donnell said that tuition here at Georgetown is expected to rise in the future but that the university does what it can to keep an education on the Hilltop affordable.
“We’re always looking to balance what it takes to deliver the best possible experience with our awareness of the challenges that tuition increases mean for our students and families,” O’Donnell said.
Georgetown, like many other schools, has programs in place that help students pay for an expensive education, despite some students’ lower incomes and difficulties securing loans.
“We have the 1789 Scholarship Imperative underway, designed to raise money to make sure that wherever tuition goes, we can continue to make Georgetown affordable by ‘meet-full-need’ financial aid at a level that we can be proud of,” O’Donnell said.

Diversability held its second annual art night on Wednesday, inviting students to come together and express their views on ability and disability through pencils and paintbrushes.
The student group seeks to raise awareness about issues of disability, including access and unfair assumptions. Started during the 2009-2010 school year, it was recently approved by the Student Activities Commission.
With the walls of McShain Lounge covered in artwork from last year, Diversability volunteers stacked the tables with paper, paints and markers. Attendees were able to work on their own art contributions while discussing the setbacks that face students with disabilities and the alternative abilities that those persons develop. Some students simply wrote words or phrases on the large sheets of paper, while others painted or drew pictures.
This year, the artists focused their efforts on producing portraits of ability. The event aimed to broaden the narrow conceptions of ability and disability and demonstrate areas in which unrecognized ability can be discovered.
According to Eric Reed (COL ’11), president of Diversability, many of the artists this year focused on their definition of ability and messages of hope.
“In terms to approaching the event, this year we wanted to focus more on ability. Last year several of the pieces included some of the older language, such as ‘handicapable’ and applied them in new cool ways. It has become the projecting image for this year, and hopefully we’ll keep running with that,” Reed said.
Diversability currently has 25 official members, four of whom comprise the organization’s board of directors.
“The group is designed to raise awareness and shape how people think about disability,” Diversability’s Director of Public Relations Kate Newman (COL ’13) said.  “We want it to be considered as less of a disadvantage and more of a different quality in a person.”
According to Reed, this year’s event brought out a larger crowd than the inaugural event with about 15 students. Reed said that he looked forward to seeing the results of the artwork.
After last year’s event, the artwork was displayed in Sellinger Lounge. As for this year’s art, Reed hopes it will get the same exposure.
“I hope it will be displayed somewhere to help start a conversation and help publicize,” he said.

Russian political opponents faced off Monday evening at a Georgetown University Student Association-sponsored event.
Featuring Mikhail Mamonov, head of the international relations department for the Federal Agency on Youth Affairs of the Russian Federation, and Ilya Yashin, opposition activist and protest organizer, the open forum held in the Intercultural Center auditorium fostered a discussion about current government initiatives to encourage openness and entrepreneurship in Russia.
Mamonov helps run the Seliger International Youth Forum, which is one of those programs.
Seliger has been controversial in the United States and Europe, however, as it was originally sponsored by pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi, which has been linked to attacks on foreign diplomats and journalists as recently as November.
Now under direct government control, the camp “seeks to set up a global network to promote mutual understanding, cooperation and education among the young people,” according to its website.
“I’m here to persuade you that Seliger international camp is not actually an al-Qaida boot camp,” Mamonov joked as he urged Georgetown students to attend the camp, which will be held at Lake Seliger in the Tver region of Russia this summer. “And to persuade you that Russia is opening up.”
He cited the Skolkovo innovation center project — also known as the Russian Silicon Valley — and his presence as examples of Russia’s progression. “A sign of Russia opening up is me being here and talking to Ilya, who is one of the most vehement critics of the incumbent regime,” he said.
However, Mamonov’s description of a government eager to democratize was contested by Yashin, who was arrested as recently as New Year’s Eve for protesting against President Dmitry Medvedev’s administration. Yashin dismissed Medvedev, calling him a “good blogger, [but a] bad president,” and pegging Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as the leader of the Kremlin’s continued corruption and censorship of Russian media.
“We want you to understand what is really happening in our country. We know there is propaganda from Putin’s regime, we know there is propaganda from the Kremlin and pro-government movements, and we just want to give you more information for you to have the big picture,” he said.
Yashin also counseled students not to participate in the Seliger camp, saying that government officials will use students’ good reputation to boost the regime’s integrity.
“The only thing I have in this world is my reputation, and I don’t want to share my reputation with absolutely dirty and corrupted and criminal persons,” he said. “They tried to make these summer camps as a [state-sponsored] non-politic[al] camp, but they cannot do this.”
The two opponents answered student questions ranging from the use of social media in the opposition movement to speculation about Putin’s plans for the upcoming election. The debate remained civil despite heavy accusations and slight barbs from both sides.
“Hearing kind of the fact that neither of these two people would speak together in this kind of a setting in Russia, makes it really interesting — really how they would handle each other and really as Ilya said, that he wasn’t sure that his opponent would come,” Neza Bevc (COL ’11) said afterward.
“I thought it was very interesting. I thought watching the facial reactions was the most interesting of all,” GUSA Chief of Staff Daphne Panayotatos (SFS ’11) said. She helped organize the event along with outgoing GUSA President Calen Angert, who met Mamonov during a trip to Russia in November and invited him to speak.
“I just think it’s really valuable when you have these kind of connections to bring something new to students that maybe they wouldn’t hear, they wouldn’t hear in the classroom, they wouldn’t read online,” she said.

The Georgetown University Legislative Advocates seek to redefine their role this semester, heading beyond the gates to expand their political impact on Capitol Hill.
According to club co-presidents and twins Joey and Ronnie Christie (COL ’12), the group, whose 11 members are trained as lobbyists, aims to be a resource for other student organizations across the District.
On March 18, they are planning to distribute letters on Capitol Hill that will detail the group’s future intentions. Key among these is facilitating communication between Georgetown and other District universities’ students groups. GULA’s Outreach and Partnership Director Allison Theveny (COL ’14) has contacted DC Students Speak, a similarly minded group geared at upholding students’ rights, in order to coordinate their efforts.
The Christies hope to be able to extend their reach beyond just student organizations, however. They also want to make their voice heard on major national policy issues.
“We’re definitely trying to be a resource, but we’re trying to branch out,” said Joey.
Particular targets are the possible federal budget cuts and their effect on Pell Grants, a form of federal financial aid. GULA plans to begin advocating for government spending on education through a student letter writing campaign.
The new stress on federal issues is part of a larger attempt to increase GULA’s presence in the D.C. community.
“If we mobilize the youth vote, we can get progress made,” Ronnie said.
While the Christies have set lofty goals for the organization, they do not expect to be able to fulfill all of them. Rather, they said, it’s about creating a precedent.
“We’re not going to see GULA become what we want to see it become, so we’re prepping a foundation,” Ronnie said.
Established on a bipartisan ground, GULA has tackled a variety of issues in the past. The club has previously focused more on on-campus issues, such as the maintenance of Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle bus routes, the institution of wireless Internet around the school and increasing space available for student meetings. It also works to partner with organizations that need legislative help.
“We rely on different legislative issues to come up,” Ronnie said.
This semester, GULA has found a potential policy project partner in Georgetown Energy, a club championing solar energy in D.C. Theveny is currently in talks with the club about the possibility of a future collaboration.
As a symbolic measure to compliment their broader goals, GULA has also unveiled a new club logo. The Christies are currently working on branding GULA and hope to be a much larger presence at the Student Activities Commission Fair next fall with the help of fortified marketing campaign.
“Before that, all we had was a cardboard sign,” Joey said.

University President John J. DeGioia has racked up frequent flyer miles this academic year, visiting Britain, Singapore, India, Switzerland, Qatar and Mexico since July.
As his travels take him across the world to speak in scholarly settings and economic forums, DeGioia seeks to propel Georgetown onto the global academic scene.
“What I have tried to do in each of my talks is raise a key theme, which is that we have allowed globalization to be defined in market and economic terms,” DeGioia told The Hoya. “The real contribution of the academy is to bring characteristics of the ethos, the characteristics of the university, to bear on globalization.”
To kick off his summer travels, DeGioia visited Wales in July. There he received an honorary fellowship from Owain Glyndwr University.
During his trip to Singapore in August, he delivered the second annual S.T. Lee Distinguished Lecture on Universities for a Global Society at the National University of Singapore. Lee Bollinger, president of Columbia University, delivered the speech for its debut run last year.
Touching on his broad international experiences, DeGioia explained that every place he visits teaches him something new.
“Each place has its own distinct character and culture with a unique set of questions,” said DeGioia. “The lens in which I explore the different countries and cultures is through the lens of higher education. I tried during my travels to engage my colleagues to discuss the contributions higher education can make to expand the meaning of the term ‘globalization.'”
In November, DeGioia devoted a week to developing higher education in India, heading a delegation of university leaders visiting New Delhi to study the educational infrastructure and seeing the Child Rights Information Center in Badarpur.
Presenting the keynote address at the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, DeGioia spoke on reforms in Indian higher education. Yale University President Richard Levin, Oxford University Chancellor Chris Patten and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers delivered the past few keynote addresses.
DeGioia’s mission to improve higher education abroad is not without reason. The president said that there is a need for 40 million new jobs to meet the demographic trends across the Arab world, for example. In order to meet job demands, higher education has to expand not just in the Middle East but everywhere.  In India, there has been a calculated need for 600 new universities, DeGioia explained.
“What I have tried to do in each of my talks, and there are some similarities and some differences between them, is raise the key theme that there is a need for more higher education,” said DeGioia.
January took him to Davos, Switzerland, where he participated in the World Economic Forum annual meeting. The president also launched his Facebook page that month, and followers could read about the sessions he attended at the conference including “Yes is More: The Architecture of Inclusivism” and “Insights on China.”
On Feb. 15, DeGioia was in Mexico for the board of trustees meeting at the Monterrey Institute of Technology, one of the largest universities in Latin America. There he joined former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, President of Arizona State University Michael Crow and President of the Monterrey Institute of Technology Rafael Rangel Sostmann to discuss the impact of globalization on higher education.
“We must recognize the urgent need to deepen and expand our opportunities for access,” DeGioia said at the conference. “We must leapfrog, using technology to ensure all of our people have access to the learning necessary for participation in a global economy.”
In true jet-setting fashion, DeGioia had arrived in Mexico after coming from Doha, Qatar, where he had celebrated the official opening of the new Georgetown School of Foreign Service-Qatar building in Education City.
The travels forge connections not only with other universities but with Georgetown alumni as well. International alumni clubs, such as the ones in Singapore and New Delhi, have welcomed DeGioia around the globe and 50 members from the New Delhi alumni center honored him with a reception ceremony.
DeGioia’s Facebook page serves as a hub for students and alumni to keep track of the president’s travels. On the page, he writes of his intention for students to “learn more about the privilege I have of representing Georgetown in many different contexts, whether here on the Hilltop, in the city of Washington, D.C., or in various locations around the world.”
The territory covered is vast, in terms of both geography and the topics on tabs, but DeGioia summed up his travels succinctly.
“It’s been a conversation.”

The Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E released a draft of its report in opposition to Georgetown’s 2010 Campus Plan Wednesday, recommending that the university address issues of undergraduate enrollment and off-campus student life.
The draft resolution’s introduction reiterates the commission’s opposition to Georgetown’s plan, which has been the subject of tense debate in the surrounding neighborhoods since the university began drafting it in 2009.
“We have deep concerns about the plan presented by the university,” the draft states. “The GU plan as proposed would have serious adverse effects on the community and would be highly objectionable.”
The report will be considered Feb. 28 at an ANC meeting, with representatives from the community and the university both set to attend. The report proposes measures including an annual audit of the enrollment cap, restrictions on bus routes and student cars, the elimination of Magis Row and an ultimate goal of housing all undergraduates on campus.
ANC 2E Chairman Ron Lewis wrote the report based on community response, especially opinions voiced at a Jan. 20 ANC meeting.
“I drafted what I think reflects the community’s sentiments,” Lewis said. “I always hope the university will listen harder to the community and respond positively.”
The report lists negative effects Georgetown has had on the community under the previous 10-year campus plan, before making its recommendations.
“We have also learned from long experience that GU cannot be relied upon to control the disruptive off-campus situation through the GU-sponsored off-campus student life program,” the draft states.
Georgetown officials maintain that the university has continued to work to address community members’ concerns.
“Georgetown’s campus plan presents modest, targeted growth opportunities that meet the university’s strategic needs for the future while also reflecting our sustained commitment to the local community,” Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said in an email.
ANC Commissioner Jake Sticka (COL ’13) said that he feels many of the draft’s provisions are unfair.
“Some of the specific measures in this resolution go even further than we need to,” Sticka said. “I obviously don’t agree with the majority of what’s in there.”
Sticka is the only Georgetown student on the commission. He said that he expressed his opinions to the other commissioners, but most of them disagree with his views. Though Sticka said that he will vote against the resolution, he believes the other commissioners will support it when it appears on their agenda Monday.
“Based on discussions that we’ve had on the ANC before and gauging the general community opinion, it seems likely that the resolution will pass,” he said.
Sticka added that students, not just residents, should voice their opinions on the report.
“It would be my hope that if any student representatives are present [at Monday’s meeting] that they are also able to comment,” he said.

Five candidates for a seat on the D.C. Council butted heads on topics including school reform, taxes and spending at a debate Wednesday. But they all agreed on one thing: opposition to campus plans recently proposed by D.C. universities, including Georgetown.
“The council should oppose the campus plans,” candidate Vincent Orange, a former representative of Ward 5, said in response to a question about how the council would deal with the problem of more undergraduate students living off campus.
Upon hearing the question, the room burst into applause.
Orange added that he thought the council should oppose the Georgetown campus plan in particular, the final version of which was submitted in December and is scheduled for review by the D.C. Zoning Commission in April.
“I know what happens when students move into the community,” Orange said. “It’s parties every single day.”
The debate, for an at-large seat which was vacated when Councilmember Kwame Brown was elected chairman of the D.C. Council, was held in a packed room at the Safeway on Wisconsin Avenue. The event was moderated by Beth Solomon of The Georgetown Dish and Davis Kennedy of The Georgetown Current.
A total of 11 candidates have gathered enough signatures to run in the April 26 elections, but only those who had either won previous races or raised a certain amount of funding for their campaigns were invited to participate in the debate.
Many candidates said that they wanted to ensure that all increases in enrollment were matched by increases in on-campus housing, including candidate Bryan Weaver, a community organizer based in Adams Morgan.
“You have to provide 100 percent housing for these students,” he said.
Weaver, who called the current American University campus plan “ridiculous,” said it was important for the council to help universities work around zoning restrictions, such as limits on building heights, to allow for more on-campus housing.
“There has to be carrot and stick proposals,” Weaver said.
Candidate Joshua Lopez, who also said he would oppose current campus plans, said that schools needed to think more creatively. He pointed to the University of Maryland as a model for expanded housing to cope with increased enrollment. At UMD, some campus residences are not located on the main campus, but the university provides shuttle transportation for students. Lopez said he thought a similar model might work for Georgetown.
“Let’s look around the city,” he said.
While the comments about campus plans elicited some of the more enthusiastic responses from the audience, much of the debate centered on school reform and strategies for dealing with the city’s current budget crisis. The first question, referencing recent criticism of Council Chairman Brown’s purchase of a high-end SUV using city funds, asked candidates how many cars they own and when the last time they took public transportation was.
Toward the end of the debate, a sixth candidate was added to the discussion. Dorothy Douglas joined Orange, Weaver, Lopez, Jacque Patterson and current at-large Delegate Sekou Biddle. Douglas, a representative to the Board of Education, was late because she had to attend a board meeting.
Another point of agreement among the candidates was that the election will play a pivotal role in deciding many of the issues slated to come before the council in the coming months.
“It could be the deciding vote to determine if we’re going to continue on the path we’ve been on,” Weaver said.

For college applicants, the hours spent calculating the likelihood of getting into college may soon come to a close, as a new Facebook application will estimate the odds within minutes.
AdmissionSplash, created by Allen Gannett, a junior at The George Washington University, calculates the user’s likelihood of undergraduate admission to various universities based on queries about academics, interests and other factors.
“We give students a general idea of where they stand and find out what their chances are for getting into schools,” Gannett said.
To generate its results, the application requests a wide range of information from the applicant, including GPA and SAT scores as well as personal interests, Gannett said. Users can also provide their gender, high school and anticipated major before the results are calculated.
Gannett devised his formula using data from previously admitted college students. Testing his method against 75 students who were accepted to New York University, he found AdmissionSplash to be 90 percent accurate in predicting the admissions results of the group.
The application launched Feb. 8 and is part of a greater network called CampusSplash, created by Gannett on Jan. 19. The CampusSplash website provides articles and online resources for high school and college students that investigate campus life and the admissions process.
DormSplash, an individual network within CampusSplash that allows students to rate their dorms and read reviews, is officially launching on Tuesday. As an incentive for students to submit information about their college dorms, Gannett and his two co-workers are offering a cupcake party to the school that provides the most reviews.
Caitlin Koury (NHS ’13) and Pete D’Amato (MSB ’13), childhood friends of Gannett, have helped advertise his endeavors on Facebook and Twitter and have participated in his organizations. They said that he began his business endeavors at a young age — and for the most part, they have been successful.
“Allen’s been doing businesses since elementary school,” D’Amato said. “He started a website, a weekly newsletter online, in fourth grade.”
D’Amato and Khoury mentioned other projects Gannett has developed over the years, including a non-profit organization called Future Civic Leaders, which provides high school students with political internship opportunities and ways to solve civic issues within their communities.
“One thing you can take away is, in whatever Allen does, he uses his connections to his best advantage,” D’Amato said.
AdmissionSplash in particular has been a resounding success, according to D’Amato.
“It kind of blew up all of a sudden,” D’Amato said. “CNN has written an article; Huffington Post wrote about it; a local news network in Dallas picked it up.”
Gannett stated that he does not plan to stop at the undergraduate level.
“In a couple of months, we are launching GradSplash for MBA, law school, medical school, and Masters of Education,” Gannett said.
He also mentioned InternSplash, another program that he plans to develop further in the future.
“We try to keep up with him as fast as he moves,” Koury said. “He is the definition of a college entrepreneur.”

Victor Reinoso (SFS ’91) will return to the Hilltop as Georgetown’s senior adviser for new project development, the university announced in a press release Thursday.
Reinoso will be a direct adviser to University President John J. DeGioia and Chief Financial Officer Chris Augostini. According to the press release, Reinoso will specialize in “innovations in international education, distance learning and long-term strategic development in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.”
“We are pleased to welcome Victor back to the university community,” Augostini said in the press release. “Victor’s more than 15 years of experience in senior leadership positions in government and the private sector will serve the community well as he helps to implement new strategic opportunities for Georgetown.”
Reinoso majored in humanities and international affairs at Georgetown and also holds an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management.
In his professional life, Reinoso has spent time working in the private sector as a consultant at AOL and Inter-American Development Bank and as chief executive officer at RadioFutura.
He transitioned to public life in recent years, serving as the deputy mayor of Washington, D.C., under Mayor Adrian Fenty from 2007 to 2010. In that position, he was often viewed as a silent presence behind the more vocal Fenty and former D.C. schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee. De’Shawn Wright, who was appointed by Mayor Vincent Gray, replaced him under the new mayoral administration.

A group of 46 student leaders, including 30 club executives and 12 Georgetown University Student Association senators, executives and executive candidates, sent a second open letter to SAC Thursday night, urging the committee to incorporate student feedback into the revised guidelines.
“The point of the vote is to mandate feedback and the incorporation of feedback,” said International Relations Club President Eitan Paul (SFS ’12), who has spearheaded the effort.
The message would come less than a week after the first open letter, which was sent Feb. 18 and demanded a formal mechanism whereby student groups could provide input before the new guidelines were released. While SAC did not hold a forum before issuing the new guidelines, commissioners said that much of the feedback that had been provided during the semester was incorporated into the revisions.
At a meeting earlier this week, SAC commissioners discussed an amendment to their constitution that would allow revisions to funding guidelines during the fiscal year, according to SAC Commissioner Ruiyong Chen (SFS ’13). The constitution currently states that once adopted, guidelines are binding for the year.
 
If the amendment — which will go to vote Monday — is adopted, SAC might consider holding one or more town halls to allow for formal student feedback.
“SAC recognizes and takes responsibility for the fact that certain processes have been rushed this semester, but we’re looking forward to working with student groups on working to make the funding process better,” Chen said.
Possible revisions would be incorporated into the guidelines later in the semester, after groups have submitted their Programming Arcs — the plans that clubs must submit detailing the events they will hold in the coming year — on March 1.
“We’re keeping to our current deadlines,” Chen said.
Commissioners have emphasized the importance of allocating early so that groups have time to reserve campus spaces.
But Paul stated that he is not entirely appeased by the proposal of town halls, saying that while he appreciated the sentiment, he thought it might only create the illusion of real change.
Matt Bernstein (COL ’13), treasurer of the College Democrats, said it was important for the guidelines to be put to a vote because SAC commissioners do not have as much experience with programming as club leaders.
“SAC is a body that consists of 12 students and a university employee,” he said. “[A vote] could best and most accurately depict what students think.”
Paul added that if the majority of clubs are satisfied with the current guidelines, he will stop pushing for changes.
“I’m pretty confident that the majority of clubs who care enough to vote would say they are dissatisfied,” he said.
Chen said SAC may consider putting the guidelines to a vote, as the club leaders have demanded.
Paul has also charged SAC with violating parts of a GUSA resolution passed last year to reform the conduct of advisory boards such as SAC. The letter cited four violations, including failure to comply with provisions for an appeals process and a requirement that advisory committees hold meetings open to the public.
Chen said that the commission does have an appeals process, it just isn’t widely known.
She also pointed out that the meeting in which the guidelines were revised wasn’t closed.
“It was more that we didn’t publicize it,” Chen said. “It wasn’t intentional and malicious. We were just working in crunch time.”
William Kim (SFS ’13), who was a SAC commissioner during spring 2010, said he signed the letter because he thought the revised guidelines have hurt clubs more than they have helped.
“Originally, it was supposed to be easier for everyone,” he said.  “It turns out, at least from my perspective, that it isn’t.”
Kim hoped the letter would allow for a more open conversation with SAC. Similarly, Paul stressed his optimism that the letter signatories would be able to work with SAC commissioners to find a solution. He said that he hopes the vote will allow student groups to begin to working directly with SAC instead of trying to pressure them through outside routes.
“I really do believe they have our best interests at heart,” Paul said.
