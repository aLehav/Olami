The School of Continuing Studies will consolidate its programs in a new center in the Gallery Place-Chinatown neighborhood scheduled to open in late 2013.
The university signed a lease today for four stories in an office building at 650 Massachusetts Ave., NW, which will house all of the SCS’s programs. The programs are currently spread between the main campus and a satellite location in Clarendon, Va.
In the past three years, the SCS has increased its enrollment by about 360 percent. A new location for the SCS has long been a goal of the university and will allow it to continue to expand in the coming years, beginning with the addition of two new master’s programs in 2013 in urban and regional planning and emergency and disaster management.
“For nearly two years SCS has worked to find a new home that achieves our vision for a state-of-the-art learning environment for our community of students and professionals,” University President John J. DeGioia wrote in an email to the university community. “This milestone for SCS reflects our commitment to providing an education marked by rigor, excellence, collaboration and innovation.”
The university also committed to finding a new location to house 1,000 SCS students as part of the negotiations regarding the 2010 Campus Plan.
According to a university statement, the 91,000-square foot property, termed “Georgetown Downtown” by the university, is slated to include administrative offices, classrooms, group study rooms, meeting spaces, a contemplative space, media and library resource centers and a cafe. The university is working with New York-based firm STUDIOS Architecture to redesign the space.
The university’s most recent financial plan estimated that the new space would cost about $11.5 million between fiscal years 2011 and 2013, but it is unclear what the lease will cost.

Cash was stolen from a student’s residence in LXR Thursday night, according to an alert from the Department of Public Safety.
DPS’s public safety alert stated that the burglary was reported around 8:15 p.m. There were no signs of forced entry and the alert does not contain a description of potential suspects.
This is the second on-campus burglary to be reported by DPS this month.

The impact of last week’s torrential storms and the Lombardi Cancer Center’s need for new radiation technology dominated discussion at Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E’s monthly meeting Monday.
According to Betsy Emes, chair of Trees for Georgetown, the District of Columbia has received 1,400 work orders related to Friday’s storm. Twenty of these orders were from the Georgetown neighborhood; seven tree removals have now been scheduled, including the large fallen tree on the corner of Prospect and 35th Streets.
Emes said that overworked crews have had to prioritize removing trees that block streets or pose a threat to public safety.
“[The crews] are getting to everything as fast as they can … but they just can’t keep up. They’ve got the heat to contend with. They’ve got trucks that are full to overflowing that have to be taken back to the yard to be emptied,” Emes said. “They have not been able to get to much in Georgetown yet.”
Emes said she was hopeful that the work would be completed early this week.
According to Emes, no wires were damaged with the storm, but the large tree on Prospect Street did damage a parking meter. Pepco was able to restore power but was unable to remove the tree.
Emes urged residents to submit their work orders online to ensure all the trees would be removed.
“We have over 3,000 tree boxes in Georgetown, and so it’s very easy to miss something,” she said. “If you see something … write it in.”
Later in the meeting, M. Joy Drass, an executive vice president for MedStar Health, asked the ANC to support MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in obtaining a certificate of need for proton therapy capability. While the hospital will have to obtain approval from the D.C. government and undergo zoning processes, Drass wanted to secure the support of the community in demonstrating the center’s need for this new therapy.
According to Drass, the new therapy reflects new developments in radiation treatment that do less damage to the tissue surrounding tumors.
The proposal was unanimously approved.
“We are committed to supporting the hospital,” Commissioner Ed Solomon said.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that M. Joy Drass was a doctor at the Georgetown University Hospital. She is actually the MedStar Health’s executive vice president of operations for the Washington region. The corrected version was posted at 8:06 a.m. on July 19.
