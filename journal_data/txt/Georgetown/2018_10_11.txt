The Washington, D.C. Council Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety unanimously passed a measure to decriminalize fare evasion, or the failure to pay for metro travel, for Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority riders Oct. 4.
If approved by the full D.C. Council later this month, the bill will downgrade the penalty for Metro fare evasion from up to 10 days in jail and a $300 fine to a civil offense with no potential for criminality and a $50 fine. Under existing legislation enacted in 1978, fare evasion was considered a criminal offense if the resulting fine was not paid.
A large number of fare violations led WMATA to install extra security measures last year in the forms of new alarms and swing gates, according to an Oct. 4 WTOP article. Despite these measures, over 8,000 citations were issued this year alone, resulting in a loss of up to $25 million, according to the WTOP article.
If passed, the proposed legislation would exacerbate WMATA’s lost revenue, which indirectly affects riders who pay the fare, WMATA Manager of Media Relations Sherri Ly wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Metro is strongly opposed to the decriminalization of fare evasion, as it is unfair to the overwhelming majority of riders who pay their fare every time,” Ly wrote. “It would create a huge budget hole with no meaningful enforcement mechanism, effectively legalizing theft.”
The proposed legislation comes after findings that enforcement of fare evasions has disproportionately affected African American youth in D.C., according to a Sept. 13 report by the Washington Lawyers Committee. Ninety-one percent of people issued summons for metro fare evasion were African American, according to the report.
In addition, MTPD has faced criticism for its treatment of fare evaders. Past fare evasion cases enforced by MTPD have involved pinning a woman to the ground and pepper spraying teenagers, according to DCist.
Only a small number of citations for fare evasion actually lead to arrests, according to Ly.
“The fact is the overwhelming majority of violators receive a citation, pay the fine and there is no criminal record. Only 8 percent result in arrests, and that’s usually for an open warrant or assault on a police officer,” Ly wrote. “In D.C., if an individual pays the fine, there is no criminal record, making many of the arguments made in support of this legislation moot.”
Council Member Trayon White, Sr. (D-Ward 8) originally introduced the bill in July 2017 because of harsh penalties for fare invasion in the district, around the same time WMATA upped its security measures.
Though nine out of 13 councilmembers had signed onto the measure at the time of its introduction, the bill only began to gain momentum when Chair of the Council Judiciary Committee, Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), endorsed it.
D.C. should improve the level of support for low-income residents rather than reduce the penalty for fare evasion, Ly wrote.
“There are some who want to decriminalize fare evasion, they say, because ‘poverty is not a crime,’” Ly wrote. “We absolutely agree with that statement; however, the solution is for D.C. to create a program to support low-income residents, not to say we’re going to turn a blind eye to theft of service.”

“Government jobs offer young people an unparalleled way to create policy,” Former White House LGBTQ Liaison and Adviser to the Biden Foundation Gautam Raghavan said at an event Tuesday hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service.
The event discussed “West Wingers: Stories from the Dream Chasers, Change Makers, and Hope Creators Inside the Obama White House,” a book edited by Raghavan and published in September, which includes narratives from members of former President Barack Obama’s White House staff.
The event, part of the Institute’s literary discussion series, featured contributors to the book, including Former Director of the Domestic Policy Council and Vice President of New America Cecilia Muñoz, Former White House Liaison to the Creative Community and Managing Director of Funny or Die D.C. Brad Jenkins and Former National Security Council Spokesman and Director of Policy and Communications at National Security Action Ned Price. Jennie Fay, director of fellows and career programming at GU Politics, moderated the event.
Government jobs provide a large sphere of potential influence, Raghavan said, and he encouraged Georgetown students to explore government work.
“The work you can do in government is unlike anything else,” Raghavan said. “Nothing else compares to the sheer scope and reach of what government can do.”
Raghavan, who served as the Department of Defense outreach lead, noted the potential in government jobs to craft tangible policy on a range of issues.
“The agencies are actually where most of the work actually happens,” Raghavan said. “They touch every single issue from sexual assault to ‘Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.’”
The passion of his coworkers at the Department of Defense made his experience with the organization rewarding and impactful, Raghavan said.
“The year I got to spend on Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was amazing,” Raghavan said. “The people I found there were phenomenal, and very mission focused and cared deeply about the issues.”
Jenkins emphasized the role young voters can have in swaying the results of the upcoming Nov. 6 midterm elections.
“If 70 percent of millennials voted, this country would fundamentally change overnight,” Jenkins said. “If young people don’t vote, 92 percent of incumbents stay in office.”
A willingness to try new things and work diligently earned him his White House tenure, according to Price.
“Never turn down an opportunity,” Price said. “Frankly it’s how I ended up in the White House. I just kept saying ‘yes.’”
The Obama administration’s success in 2008 and again in 2012 reflects how politics can influence generations, Jenkins said.
“[Obama] is a once in a generation candidate,” Jenkins said. “It was very empowering for a whole generation. I think we seized the moment.”
Obama’s character of personal accountability while in office guided the president’s interactions with the public, Price said, citing a 2015 incident in which two hostages were killed in a U.S. counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.
“The world of intelligence is very murky,” Price said. “There’s a lot that can stay secret. […] But, the course [Obama] chose instinctually was to own up to families and to the American people.”
Muñoz initially turned down the job offer as director of the Domestic Policy Council, as she wanted to ensure a work-life balance with her kids. She eventually accepted the position, on condition that she would be able to maintain a balance between her career and her role as a mother, she said.
“I said no [to the job] twice because I really didn’t want to turn my kids’ lives upside-down. Fortunately, I managed to persuade the people I worked for, mostly men, that it would be okay,” Muñoz said. “So I walked out of there at 5:45 to pick up the kids at day-care, and nobody batted an eye. I did what probably all of us with kids do, which is after they’re in bed, then you go back to work.”
He also grappled with the conflict between his personal life and his political career, Raghavan said.
“You can have it all, but you can’t have it all at once,” Raghavan said.
As a woman of color, Muñoz faced pressure to prove herself throughout her career in a male-dominated sector, she said.
“The notion of out-work, out-prepare, be on top of your game, especially for a woman of color, is just plain true,” Muñoz said.
Students can to look to their peers as mentors and as people who will help them succeed later in life, Jenkins said.
“The people to your left and right, your peers, can potentially have a lot more impact,” Jenkins said. “You don’t need a really esteemed powerful person to give you a leg up. Your leg-up is right in this room.”

Former U.S. Ambassador to Romania Alfred Moses (LAW ’56), who served in the 1990s during the rebuilding of Romania after the fall of communism, chronicled his time as ambassador at a book talk Tuesday in Gaston Hall.
Moses served as the U.S. Ambassador to Romania from 1994 through 1997, during the country’s transition from communism to democracy. Before his time as ambassador, Moses worked as a lawyer for Washington, D.C. law firm Covington & Burling and served as special counsel to President Jimmy Carter from 1980 to 1981. He also served as Vice President of the American Jewish Committee, a Jewish advocacy group that focuses on civil liberties.
Moses’ book “Bucharest Diary: Romania’s Journey from Darkness to Light” was published in July and describes his experiences as ambassador to Romania during the country’s transitional period.
The Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies and the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy co-hosted the event, which was moderated by CERES professor Dennis Deletant.
As ambassador, Moses helped the Romanian government recover from the collapse of the Soviet Union and transition away from communism, he said.
“The U.S. in the eyes of the Romanians had defeated the Soviet Union and freed them, and so I was there to help them,” Moses said. “I was the one carrying the torch, so I felt I had to light the way.”
In the mid-1970s, Romania was under Communist rule, led by Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu. Communism lasted for over 20 years in Romania, from the early 1960s until the Romanian Revolution in 1989. Moses said this period of communist rule left Romania and its citizens in poverty.
“Romania was devastated by communism. If its sister countries were poor, Romania was destitute,” Moses said. “If you had an apartment, the government owned the building. If you had a house, the government owned your house.”
Following the Romanian Revolution in 1989 and the execution of Ceausescu, the country was left without any political structures or politicians, according to Moses.
“There was no political class after Ceausescu was shot,” Moses said. “With the entire leadership gone and no successors, the country had to start from ground zero.”
The United States was reluctant to provide economic assistance because of Romania’s history with communism, Moses said
“Those who just didn’t like communist regimes were opposed to giving any kind of favorable economic breaks to communist governments,” Moses said.
His role as ambassador was to represent U.S. interests as Romania rebuilt its government, according to Moses.
“You represent the U.S., you don’t represent the country you’re stationed in,” Moses said. “You represent the history and the aspirations of the U.S. I was confident what my government wanted me to do and if I wasn’t my government would tell me to stop it.”
Moses’ interest in Romanian politics was piqued when he first traveled to Romania in 1976 at the request of the American Jewish Committee, and was told that Jews in Romania were struggling.
“When they told me they needed my help, that became my cause,” Moses said. “They were treated very poorly; many went to jail, including those who had been active in the communist party. It was a purge. That was one of the sins of the communism.”
Moses’ experience working in the Carter administration paved the way for his appointment to become ambassador to Romania, Moses said.
“I became the U.S. Ambassador only because one of my staff when I was in the Carter White House knew I was interested in Romania and sent my nomination to the senate,” Moses said. “Three months later I was in Bucharest for three years.”
Moses’ efforts were a key factor in paving Romania’s alliance with the US today, Deletant said in an interview with The Hoya.
“The problems facing Romania were greatly helped by his attempts to address them,” Deletant said.

The special education system contributes to the marginalization of people with disabilities, author Eli Clare said at an event Thursday hosted by the LGBTQ Center in the HFSC Social Room.
The event, held in honor of the center’s upcoming 10th anniversary, addressed the intersection of disability, race and transness in society today. Clare, the author of two books and a collection of poetry, identifies as genderqueer and has cerebral palsy.
The current model for special education contributes to the marginalization of people with disabilities, especially for students of color, according to Clare.
“Right now, special education is such a way to segregate, such a pipeline from education to prison, particularly for black and brown kids,” Clare said. “There’s no coincidence to that.”
Clare offered a vision of a reformed education system that integrates students with disabilities into the classroom so all students’ needs are met.
“I’d get rid of special ed, and in its place, I’d create education that has many doorways, that meets everyone where they are, that gives everyone challenge, so everyone is met with challenge and access at the same time,” Clare said. “For most of us, that would probably mean integrated classrooms. We would have to change and become more flexible by creating access that’s built into the curriculum, not added on as accommodation.”
Mainstream ideas about physical and mental abilities incorrectly differentiate between capabilities of the body and of the mind, according to Clare.
“In white Western dominant culture, we’re taught that minds are one entity and bodies are a second entity, not connected at all,” Clare said. “But in my experience, bodies and minds are really connected in a variety of ways. I use the phrase body-mind to remind us of those connections.”
Instead of searching for a cure to disability, activists should start framing addressing disability as restoration, Clare said.
“First, cure requires the existence of damage, deficiency or defectiveness, locating this harm entirely within the individual human body-minds, operating as if each person were her own ecosystem. Second, it grounds itself in an original state of being, relying upon a belief that what existed before is superior to what exists currently. And finally it seeks to return what is damages to that former state of being,” Clare said.
The language of cure and disability extends to transness and gender dysphoria, according to Clare.
“Gender transition as an open door, transness as a defect to fix, gender dysphoria as disability, transgender identities as non-pathologized body-mind differences — all these relationships to defectiveness and cure exist at the same time.”
Clare encouraged allies of historically marginalized groups to listen to those individuals, in order to advocate for them more effectively and to focus more on the effects of their behavior than on their identities.
“We choose to do allied work. It’s the difference between identity and behavior. In this case, behavior is far more important than identity,” Clare said. “The key to doing allied work is to listen hard, listen more than we speak.”
Allies must advocate for those with disabilities by carrying out what activists ask them to do rather than what allies assume is correct, Clare said.
“When we hear the things we are being asked to do, we follow those directions, we show up, and we keep showing up,” Clare said.
Advocating for marginalized people requires years of commitment, according to Clare.
“You will make mistakes and you will be called out and you will need to be accountable,” Clare said. “Doing allied work means learning from mistakes, not making those mistakes over and over again. It takes time; it’s not work measured in days, weeks, months or semesters. It’s measured in decades. Part of doing allied work is figuring out how to do it sustainably.”
Advocates should continue to protest and fight for equal treatment, Clare said, noting there is hope for a future of equality.
“The body-minds of marginalized peoples are more than the ways we’ve been sorted as normal and abnormal, whole and defective, more than histories of violence, more than the objects of pity and bullying, more than signs of pathology, more than targets of police brutality,” Clare said. “I insist upon the body-mind as protest, resistance, everyday truth.”
