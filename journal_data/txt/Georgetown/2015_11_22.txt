Georgetown graduate Hannah Schneider (COL ’15) has won a Rhodes scholarship to pursue a two-year master’s of philosophy degree in music at the University of Oxford. Schneider plans to specialize in composition while at Oxford.
Schneider, one of 32 Americans to win the scholarship in 2016, is Georgetown’s 24th Rhodes scholar and the first Georgetown student to receive the award since 2011.
While at Georgetown, Schneider majored in Russian and minored in government, achieving advanced proficiency in Russian, Chinese, Italian and Hebrew.
An avid violinist and conductor, Schneider deferred her Georgetown admission to study at the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory. During her time at Georgetown, Schneider developed a program with Carnegie Hall to find musical talent in the North Caucasus region of Russia, served as concertmaster of the Georgetown Symphony Orchestra and served as editor-in-chief of Ultraque Unum, Georgetown’s undergraduate research journal. Schneider is also a McTighe Prize winner, a 1789 Scholar and a John Carroll Fellow.
Schneider is currently the director of special projects for the Marinsky Foundation of America, a foundation dedicated to fostering greater partnerships between the United States and Russia through music and theater. Schneider also serves as an assistant to Russian conductor Valery Gergiev.

The ExxonMobil gas station on the corner of 36th and M streets was robbed at gunpoint Saturday night around 11 p.m., according to a Georgetown University Police Department Public Safety Alert sent to the university community Sunday morning.
The university’s emergency notification system, HOYAlert, was activated and reported an armed individual in or around Main Campus with police en route around 1 a.m. last night. An official “all clear” message was sent out shortly after at around 2 a.m.
The Georgetown University Police Department and Metropolitan Police Department are currently investigating the incident, according to a Public Safety Alert sent to the university community shortly before noon today.

A male suspect, described in the Public Safety Alert as wearing dark clothing, pointed a handgun at the station clerk and demanded money before fleeing in an unknown direction. No arrest has been made yet.
GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said that there is no current threat to the campus community.
“There was a threat for a very short period of time when we sent the alert out, and an abundance of precaution,” Gruber said. “We have a very, very vague suspect description, and the incident occurred quite some time ago.”
Gruber said that the GUPD is not taking any additional measures and encouraged community members to remain aware of their surroundings.
“There’s really nothing specific we’re doing in regards to this incident. … It’s a pretty straightforward crime, it happens all the time in Washington, this time it just happened close to Georgetown,” Gruber said. “We always ask our students just to remain vigilant off campus.”
