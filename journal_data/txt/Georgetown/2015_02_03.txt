Provost Robert Groves announced Wednesday the establishment of a standing committee on diversity comprised of select students, faculty and administrators to be housed in the Office of the Provost.
“The Provost’s Committee for Diversity will directly advise me and work with me on issues related to diversity, race, ethnicity and social justice,” Groves wrote in a campus-wide email. “The committee will focus on the student experience — including student life, educational and co-curricular opportunities, and alumni engagement.”
Groves said that the new permanent standing committee — a permanent group that meets regularly — is the culmination of a long process of advocacy on behalf of undergraduate students interested in race, social justice and ethnic diversity.
Diversity committee student members will serve a 15-month term, which begins February 2015 and concludes March 2016. Student applicants from any undergraduate or graduate grade level can apply online for the committee until Wednesday, provided they are available for a 15-month term, including summers. Members will be evaluated and selected by the Office of the Provost.
“Due to the leadership of some undergraduate students last year, a set of concerns and proposals with regard to activities in and out of class, curricular ideas and alumni ideas that would enrich the experience of students from minority racial and ethnic status was proposed,” Groves said. “Those issues came to the forefront and were presented to President DeGioia for discussion and resolution. This was also linked to larger national concerns that manifested themselves in the Twitter campaign of #BBGU — Being Black at Georgetown University — last year.”
#BBGU, a hashtag part of a Twitter protest in December 2013, provided a forum for students of color to discuss their experiences on campus. The Georgetown administration supported the protest, posting about it on the office Georgetown Facebook page and joining the conversation on Twitter. Inspired by the #BBGU campaign, two movements #BLGU — Being Latino at Georgetown University and #BAGU — Being Asian at Georgetown University developed online later in December 2013.
According to Groves, the foremost goal of the committee is to create an inclusive environment at Georgetown through discussion and new initiatives.
“The overarching issue is how can we construct an environment where people are open to those who are different from themselves, that we learn how to understand and work together, and become better through working with diverse groups,” Groves said. “This has impact on the structure of social activities outside of classes, but also whether there are inside-the-classroom issues that we can become better on.”
In addition to tackling issues involving inclusiveness, the committee will explore the implementation of a diversity course requirement that would affect undergraduate students from all four Georgetown schools.
“One issue that we are forwarding now through the faculty approval process is the construction of a requirement that can be met through many different courses in the existing curriculum that would educate with regards to issues of race, influence, power, social relations and so on, to make sure that the curriculum reflects those kind of values,” Groves said.
In April 2009, DeGioia launched a Main Campus Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness in response to a series of bias-related incidents on campus. The initiative, comprised of three working groups that focused on academics, admissions and student life, released recommendations for improving overall campus inclusiveness in May 2010. The university has yet to address many of the group’s recommendations, including a proposal to develop a minority studies program and implement a diversity course into the core curriculum of each undergraduate school. Ferrara said that the new committee will provide a forum to address these problems and make changes that involve the Office of the President.
“We understand the importance of having an ongoing forum to promote greater diversity and inclusiveness on campus,” President John J. DiGioia’s Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara wrote in an email. “We also understand the vital perspective that students have on these issues. This committee ensures that student voices have a central place in this conversation, something that is very important to President DeGioia.”
The university has a long-term commitment to supporting an inclusive community, according to Ferrara. In October, the Office of the President released an initiative to fund cultural and advocacy group heritage months. The Office provides $500 in funding each year, and $1,000 for groups with demonstrated need, to fund events such as LGBTQ History Month, Black History Month and Women’s History Month.
“The President’s Office will be working closely with this committee, and we are hopeful that this effort will have an impact in the near and long-term,” Ferrara wrote. “This committee is a long-term commitment — over the course of many years, we will be deeply engaged in strengthening our efforts to support a diverse and inclusive environment.”
Aubrey Guthrie (COL ’08, GRD ’12), an advisor to the committee, believes that continual feedback and engagement with the greater Georgetown community is essential to the committee’s future success.
“As they conduct their work, members will work to gather information and feedback from the Georgetown community,” Guthrie said. “Student leaders who worked with us to plan the committee emphasized three broad areas to focus ongoing work: student life, academics and alumni engagement. We anticipate the committee will engage in each of these areas and may also decide to undertake new projects and build connections between existing efforts on campus.”
Prospective committee applicant Sebastian Velastegui (MSB ’18) said he values the approach that Georgetown is taking in regards to issues of diversity, race and ethnicity.
“I think having this committee is a great start because it shows that Georgetown is taking initiative on this dilemma that we have on campus; it is a great way to power through these problems and to find tangible solutions to engender everyone into a closer, tight-knit Georgetown community,” Velastegui said.
Students representatives from GU Women of Color, The Georgetown Solidarity Committee and the Black Student Alliance, groups involved with pushing for a diversity course requirement, did not respond to requests for comment.
Groves said that this committee is not serving to just address the concerns of today, but also the issues of diversity and equality in the future.
“This is going to be a permanent committee, it is not going to be something that will be created and will fade away. It is now a permanent locus for these kind of issues to bubble up and be resolved at the highest levels of the university,” Groves said. “We care about this; we are going to make it work.”

The university will begin converting the second and third floors of the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center into student dorms in May 2015, four months before students will move into the space.
As part of the 2010 Campus Plan to provide campus housing for 385 more students by summer 2015, the renovation will convert 70 hotel rooms into temporary housing intended for sophomores, and will be converted back into hotel rooms after the completion of the Northeast Triangle dorm, planned for fall 2016. The hotel has a total of 146 rooms, which means that students will take up almost half the available space.
According to Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey, the renovation will have minimal impact on the architecture and layout of the hotel. The current plan mainly involves the logistics of housing students in a hotel with guests.
“A lot of rooms have king-sized beds, so we’ll put in double beds for two students to be in there,” Morey said. “There will be some minor plumbing renovations and minor electrical renovations, but the primary part of the work … [is] the logistics of how to get the students in and out of the hotel. For student safety we want to minimize the amount of interaction between the hotel guests and our students.”
Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center General Manager Kevin Morris said that the hotel, which is managed by Aramark, has been working closely with the university on the renovation project in order to minimize concerns over how the changes will affect the hotel’s business, which includes providing accommodation for conference and wedding guests.
“Any time 50 percent of your available inventory is taken away, that poses significant changes to your business model,” Morris said. “To that end, the hotel is taking a very proactive stance in sourcing new business and partnering with other local hotels that can supplement hotel rooms for larger conferences.”
Morris said that students living in the hotel will still have to follow university policies.
“We are actively working to make the hotel a space that is comfortable for both students and hotel guests,” Morris said. “We are committed to working with Georgetown in aligning student policies while living in the hotel as closely as possible with current university policies.”
Additionally, students will not have access to hotel amenities such as room service, although the rooms will have their own bathroom.
The hotel renovations will provide housing for 140 students, while the reconstruction of the former Jesuit Residence will account for 148 students. Housing for the remaining 97 students will be created through the reorganization of unused or non-essential space on campus.
“It’s primarily turning large doubles into triples, and there’s a few common space areas we’re converting into rooms,” Morey said. “We’re also taking some townhouses that were not student residences before and turning them into student residences.”
The university expects the final project design to be completed in February, at which point it will be sent to the board of directors for authorization. When the design is authorized, construction companies will compete for a construction contract that will be awarded in May. The funding for the contract will come from a combination of university reserves.
Although the project is only in its preliminary stages, students are excited about the possibility of living in the hotel and the convenience that it will offer.
“The hotel has great access to Leavey and that’s good because I like to study in Sellinger and Regents,” Benjamin Lillian (COL ’18) said. “Also, I’d like to be able to stop by Einstein’s or Uncommon Grounds for a quick breakfast on the way to a morning class.”
Kristen Sullivan (SFS ’17) said that the rooms, although useful for providing space, may create a fractured campus.
“Honestly, I think if the university transformed the hotel into dorm rooms, it would create a strange dynamic on campus,” Sullivan said. “Not only would the hotel be an isolated living space, but more people would filter through the hotel area and the food court, and I’m not entirely sure how that would impact the hospital crowd.”

Sure, student safety is the reason…

About 300 students participated in the first ever Multicultural Week, which celebrated the diversity of cultures on campus and ran Jan. 27 to Feb. 1.
The week was hosted by the Georgetown University Student Association Multicultural Council, and in addition to the student organizations that sponsored the individual events, the Council collaborated with Corp Philanthropy, Interhall Council, the Georgetown University Student Association Fund and the Office of Campus Ministry to put the week together.
“Our goal is to expand and enhance the experience for Georgetown students in regards to multiculturalism,” Multicultural Council member Jackson Shain (COL ’18) said of the organization as a whole. “We’re trying to advocate for student groups on campus that are underserved culture groups and improve the funding structure that exists right now for minority status groups. We’re very much population-based, which isn’t very conducive for the cultural groups on campus that may have smaller populations.”
The idea for a Multicultural Week came about after the success earlier in the year of the World’s Fair, which was put on by the Multicultural Council and Welcome Week and brought multiple cultural groups together on campus. The fair only lasted a day, however, and the council wanted to find a way to replicate the event in a prolonged format, according to Multicultural Council Chair Eng Gin Moe (SFS ’16).
Overall Moe said that the week was big success for the council and the Georgetown community as a whole.
“I think Multicultural Week was a great experience in exposing the many aspects of cultural diversity to the greater Georgetown community,” Moe wrote in an email to The Hoya. She added, “[W]e had people come who are not necessarily associated with any of the clubs part of the Week. These participants were able to learn that these organizations not only exist but that they welcome everyone to their events, ideally leading to greater numbers of people who aren’t in those organizations to go to future events of those organizations.”
The week began with an event titled “The Taste of the Mediterranean” sponsored by the Turkish Club and the Hellenic Association that featured free Mediterranean food and live performances.
About 50 to 60 people attended the event in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room, though only about 30 people were expected, according to Hellenic Association President Vasiliki Dimopoulos (COL ’15).
“We don’t really think to reach out to other cultural groups and work together, so the Turkish Association and the Greek Association thought it would be fun to work together,” Dimopoulos said. “We had always kind of talked about it jokingly and then the opportunity was presented.”
The main goal of the event, according to Dimopoulos, was to raise student awareness of the Hellenic Association and the Turkish Club.
The Multicultural Week continued Thursday with a “Minority Health Disabilities Panel,” which focused on the challenges minorities face in the healthcare system. The panel was hosted by the Asian American Student Association and the Native American Student Association and was held in the HFSC Herman Meeting Room.
The Latin American Student Association and the Georgetown University Mexican Student Association sponsored a “Dia de los Reyes” event on Thursday evening in the HFSC Herman Meeting Room. The event featured Mexican hot chocolate, rosca de reyes — a traditional Spanish and Latin American pastry — and music.
The Multicultural Week concluded Sunday with the Multicultural Brunch, which featured food from around the world and photos from the week’s festivities. Multiple singing and dancing groups from around campus performed at the brunch, held in the HFSC Social Room.

The Switch It Off Challenge, a five-week-long competition between the four freshman dorms to increase sustainability efforts, announced Harbin Hall as its winner on Thursday at an award ceremony in Gervase Hall.
The winning dorm was determined by the amount of energy saved and student engagement. Harbin Hall saved 11,300 kilowatt hours of energy and received sustainability pledges from 59 students. In total, the residence halls saved 28,936 kilowatt hours of energy, with 291 students signing the energy conservation pledge.
The Office of Sustainability, which organized the challenge, measured energy usage on a kilowatt meter and compared the results to the amount of energy used in each dorm last year in order to calculate energy savings. Student engagement was measured by the number of students from each dorm who signed a sustainability pledge to commit themselves to reducing their energy usage.
Two student representatives from Harbin Hall will be awarded two iPads with solar chargers in recognition of their efforts. eleven percent of students in Darnalll Hall made the energy pledge, putting the dorm in second place. One random student from Darnall will be awarded an iPad Mini.
Office of Sustainability Director Audrey Stewart, who measured and charted weekly savings, said that sustainability is a core value at Georgetown.
“Sustainability and conservation at Georgetown are a natural extension of the university’s mission, our Jesuit heritage and our value on justice and the common good, reflecting the Catholic and Jesuit concept of care for creation,” Stewart said.
The sustainability pledge helped students remember to take small steps every single day to conserve energy. Harbin Hall President Jackson Shain (COL ’18) found the pledge to be a successful way of encouraging sustainability efforts.
“I signed the Switch It Off pledge, and what I loved most about it is that you could tailor the experience to something you felt you could hold yourself responsible to,” Shain said.
The pledge listed small acts that contribute to energy saving, with students checking off which conservation efforts they pledged to take part in throughout the competition.
Harbin Hall resident Ali Forger (COL ’18) found the pledge to be simple yet effective.
“It was cool because you could kind of pick and choose the things that you could commit to, like turning off the lights when you leave the room, turning off the water when you brush your teeth and taking shorter showers,” Forger said.
Stewart noted that Georgetown would greatly benefit from increased sustainability efforts. If all campus dorms saved as much energy as Harbin did and had as much participation, there would be over 1,000 students on campus taking a pledge to save energy. The university would save over a million kilowatt hours of electricity within one academic year, which would save Georgetown over $100,000 in energy costs.
“What you guys did by coming together shows that these small, everyday actions, such as turning the lights off or taking the stairs may seem like little things, but if we are doing them collectively and habitually, it can really add up to a big impact, and it plays a big role in our overall sustainability goals,” Stewart said.
At the awards ceremony, Vice President of Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said that the competition was an easy way to get students thinking about energy conservation.
“We were looking for low-cost, no-cost ways to reduce our cost, be more sustainable, reduce our energy consumption, and this is one of those,” Morey said. “So things such as turning off lights … these things are important. We thought this was a fun way to do it [and] get students engaged.”
Morey also said that while the university is dedicating itself to decreasing energy consumption on the demand side, they are also working to supply more sustainable energy.
“We are working hard to purchase power agreements that will bring us green power instead of power that’s generated by petroleum and fossil fuels,” Morey said. “We are also looking at the efficiency of all of our campus operations.”
University Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Chris Augostini announced his plans to discuss conservation efforts in two different staff forums, one for day staff and one for overnight workers, during every quarter.
“We hope to extend this conversation to our employees to see if we can get them more involved,” Augostini said.
While the competition is over, there remain other ways to stay involved in Georgetown’s sustainability movement.
“There are many ways that students can plug in to sustainability initiatives on campus — from getting involved with a student group, to exploring sustainability and the environment in the classroom, to alternative spring break trips and more,” Stewart said. “Our website offers a number of resources where students can discover more ways to get involved.”
Students who took part in the challenge reflected on the importance of conserving energy throughout the competition.
“To me, energy conservation is important not only to help the environment, but to save money that can be used for other important things on campus,” Harbin resident Jennifer Henry (NHS ’18) said.

Georgetown’s graduate international affairs programs and Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service program were ranked first and fourth in the nation, respectively, for the study of international affairs, according to a list compiled by Foreign Policy magazine released Jan. 26.
The survey last ranked schools in 2012, since it is not released annually and is conducted in coordination with the Teaching, Research and International Policy Project at the College of William and Mary. In that edition, and in the previous 2007 and 2009 lists, the graduate program also received the top ranking, while the BSFS program was fifth in 2012, passing Columbia University to claim fourth spot this year.
Foreign Policy compiled the rankings from a survey of 1,615 international relations scholars. The programs were evaluated based on academic excellence, connections with professors and faculty, location and the strength of the alumni network. While the full list has yet to be released on the magazine’s website, Foreign Policy highlighted the graduate school’s two-year program that includes faculty mentorship as a primary reason for its top ranking, according to a university press release.
The recognition of the graduate programs spans the eight international affairs master’s degrees offered by the university, including the Master of Science in Foreign Service, Master of Arts in Security Studies, Master of Global Human Development and regionally focused Master of Arts programs in German and European Studies, Arab Studies, Latin American Studies, Asian Studies and Russian, European and East European Studies.
SFS Associate Dean and Undergraduate Program Director Mitch Kaneda explained that the rankings recognized the devotion of the university to the examination of international issues.
“They mean a lot to Georgetown programs, faculty, students and alumni because these rankings are a testament to the passion and synergy we have for the study of international affairs,” he wrote in an email.
The three schools ranked above the BSFS program were Harvard University, Princeton University and Stanford University, though the graduate program outranks Harvard and Princeton, which rank third and fourth respectively. Among peer institutions, Georgetown’s graduate program is unique in offering a Master of Science. Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, which ranks second, offers a Master of Arts, while Harvard and Princeton fold their international affairs curriculum into Master of Public Policy programs.
Kaneda added that the fourth place ranking of the BSFS program indicates room for improvement. The SFS is currently considering adding access to minors for undergraduate students in addition to its current offering of certificates. A survey sent out by the SFS Academic Council showed 65 percent of students support the change.
“[The rankings tell] us that we have a responsibility to continue to improve our programs,” Kaneda wrote.
SFS Interim Dean James Reardon-Anderson echoed Kaneda.
“We are both proud and flattered that Georgetown University again ranks high among the schools to study international affairs,” he said in a press release. “This is a great credit to the students, faculty and staff of Georgetown and confirms the wisdom of our commitment to education for the service of humanity.”
SFS Academic Council Senior Representative Annie Kennelly (SFS ’15) said she was not surprised by these results, crediting professors and the access to internships and professors in Washington, D.C., as primary reasons for the high rankings.
“From a student perspective I couldn’t imagine getting a better education in international affairs,” Kennelly said. “For us it’s our professors and our exposure to international affairs that really makes our education. There is an emphasis in all of our classes on service for others and for humanity, as well as an expectation for us to analyze and understand how our policies and actions influence the world.”
Colette Clark (GRD ’15), a student in the Security Studies program, emphasized similar positive aspects, including location and faculty, of the graduate school program.
“A lot of the factors that feed into the undergraduate program are the same for the masters’ program,” Clark said. “It’s important that we have faculty members active in government and think-tanks and that we pull faculty in on part-time and adjunct bases … it gives students access to the city and all the city has to offer.”
SFS Academic Council President Megan Murday (SFS ’15) also emphasized the preparation for job readiness as a strength of the SFS.
“The institution is committed to a strong combination of liberal arts and a multidisciplinary approach balanced with educating students with the skills necessary to go out into the world,” Murday said.
The MSFS program, which features concentrations in global politics and security, global business and finance, regional and comparative studies and international development, particularly reflects the emphasis on job preparation, integrating a required internship into the curriculum and offering evening and weekend clinics to augment practical workplace skills.
Murday added that the rankings reflect the combined work of SFS students, professors and administrators.
“The rankings are a formal recognition of the academic rigor and unparalleled opportunities that characterize the program,” Murday said. “The willingness of the professors and administrators to mentor and support the students is what really sets apart our institution.”
Murday believes the rankings will confirm the quality of the work of the professors and management thus far and also set a precedent for the future.
“I hope that it means that both [graduate and undergraduate] programs will continue to recruit top talent in both students and faculty, and that it will open up more doors professionally and academically and really strengthen the program in years to come,” Murday said.
Kennelly echoed Murday, highlighting the focus on international relations and service throughout the university.
“It is very important for current professors and undergraduate/graduate students as well as prospective students and professors that they have made this distinction,” Kennelly said. “It really signifies that value that scholars here place on an education centered around foreign service.”
Correction: This article previously mis-identified the top ranking for the graduate school as highlighting only the MSFS program. The Foreign Policy ranking recognizes all eight international affairs master’s degree programs. The article has been updated to reflect this information.

President Barack Obama announced his proposal to permanently extend the American Opportunity Tax Credit past its current expiration date in 2017 as part of his effort to improve college affordability for middle-class students. The changes, which first appeared in the State of the Union address, reappeared in his budget proposal released Monday.
“Everybody understands [higher education] is the key to success for our kids in the 21st century,” Obama said in the State of the Union. “It’s something that’ll train our workforce so that we can compete with anybody in the world.”
The American Opportunity Tax Credit, which was introduced during the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, currently gives students from families making less than $180,000 a year up to $2,500 per year in tax deductions.
“What we have is a pretty complex system of tax incentives for higher education and families are pretty frequently unable to take advantage of the incentives,” White House Domestic Policy Director Cecilia Munoz said in a conference call with college media outlets the day after the State of the Union. “The president is proposing to simplify and consolidate these tax incentives using the structure of the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which is primarily targeted to maximize our ability to help students.”
Anthony Carnevale, the director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, explained that Obama’s proposed change aims to redistribute higher education funding, in which the upper classes would lose tax credits while the middle class would gain them.
“[Obama] believes that there needs to be a shift in the focus of public assistance for higher education toward those who are least advantaged,” Carnevale said. “He believes it’s a zero-sum game.”
The plan is currently facing stiff resistance in Congress from Republicans and Democrats alike. Carnevale said the plan, especially combined with the unlikely to pass while Obama is still in office due to opposition from a significant amount of the electorate.
“It is a bipartisan nonstarter,” he said of the proposed changes. “If you ask the American public what they don’t want taken away from them … it’s the middle class entitlements, one of which is the higher education tax benefits.”
Initial backlash against the plan resulted from the changes to the 529 savings plan. Currently, with the 529 plan, families can place money in a fund and later withdraw it tax-free to pay for their children’s higher education costs. Obama proposed to eliminate the tax-free status of the 529 plan to offset the increased costs resulting from the permanent extension of the American Opportunity Tax Credit and free community college.
“Eighty percent of the benefit for 529 programs comes for households with an income over $250,000, so we are focusing on a structure that targets the savings for folks who need it the most,” Munoz said in the conference call.
Obama dropped that proposed change a week ago, citing bipartisan opposition to the cuts on 529 plan benefits as fueling his decision to stop pursuing this portion of the plan. Carnevale said that while the debate over educational funding may not have the same implications at Georgetown as it does at public universities, Georgetown students and parents would be affected by changes in the tax breaks for families.
“Georgetown and the private [universities] rely on the private wealth of families to get their tuition fees,” he said. “[But] once you start playing with the tax code, you’re talking about Georgetown parents.”
Without the savings from the 529 plan, however, the plan faces problems simply because of limited money in the federal budget. Currently, advocates for higher education argue spending must compete with those who want increased spending on military expenditures, social security and Medicare, among other programs.
“The bottom line is [that] money’s not there,” Carnevale said. “They’re fighting for a smaller and smaller piece of the pie.”
Carnevale estimated that at least a few hundred million dollars were needed to implement the president’s plan and better the United States’ public higher education.
“We’re going to have to find the money for anything we do in the current expenditures,” he said. “So something’s got to come out of somebody’s pocket.”
Another budgetary constraint is the program of income-based repayment for student loans. It allows former students to pay off loans as a percentage of their salary rather than a fixed monthly rate.
Carnevale explained that the income-based repayment system is only financially viable if the government makes responsible loans in the first place to students who can find jobs that pay well for their level of education.
“We can’t afford to keep funding education that goes nowhere,” he said. “Economic value matters. It’s not the only consideration but it matters.”
University Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh could not say for sure how students attending Georgetown in the future would be affected if Obama’s plan is implemented, though she reaffirmed a commitment to Georgetown’s current financial aid system.
“[We don’t know] about the potential impacts to future students or families,” she said. “We remain committed to our need-blind, meet-full-need policy.”

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Public Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson announced the Empowering Males of Color initiative on Jan. 21. The initiative pledges to invest $20 million in the education of black and Latino male students in the District.
Spread over the course of three years, the funds will be used to create a mentoring program, targeting grants to specific district schools and open a college preparatory school for male students of color east of the Anacostia River.
Bowser emphasized the focus on young minority males, who comprise 43 percent of the DCPS student population, in the initiative’s official announcement.
“Too many of these young men are not reaching their full potential. We need to fundamentally change that dynamic. That’s why my administration is committed to advancing achievement and opportunity and reducing disparities for boys and young men of color in the District,” Bowser said.
DCPS School Operations Specialist Frederick Lewis explained the initiative as key to unlocking their potential.
“We are modelling our initiatives on programs that have proven successful in DCPS and elsewhere and bringing them to scale so that all our males of color can reach their potential,” Lewis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “And, with that, we strongly reject a deficit perspective that there is something fundamentally wrong with our black and Latino males — our boys are not the problem. We simply are not doing enough to support them, empower them and encourage them.”
Black and Latino male students have the lowest high school graduation rates in the District, at 48 percent and 57 percent, respectively.
To boost the rates, a new all-male college preparatory school is set to open east of the Anacostia River in fall 2016 with the help of Urban Prep Academics, a Chicago-based nonprofit organization that oversees a network of three all-male high schools in Chicago with similar missions, each of which has an average size of 350 students. One hundred percent of students in the Urban Prep system since its first class in 2010 have graduated from high school and been accepted to four-year institutions.
Urban Prep Academics Founder and CEO Tim King (SFS ’89, LAW ’93) spoke fondly about his past in D.C. when announcing the partnership with Mayor Bowser and DCPS. He alluded to his time at Georgetown, which he attended with Henderson, as well as work as a tutor in Sursum Corda and high school teacher in northeast D.C.
“I couldn’t be more excited by the prospect that Urban Prep’s first school outside of Chicago be in a city that, in a way, is where it all began,” King said.
In addition to the new high school, Empowering Males of Color will work to increase mentorship programs in elementary schools. Currently, roughly half of black and Latino fourth-graders fall below norms for their grade level.
The final component of the initiative includes a new method for schools to apply for grants, through what it calls the “Proving What’s Possible” model. Schools are asked to focus on academic development, family engagement or social-emotional supports when applying for funding.
Lewis added that the initiative will have a positive impact on all DCPS students, not just minority male students who directly benefit.
“We believe this is an equity and social justice issue, but also believe the cumulative effect of increased academic rigor and enhanced social supports that specifically target males of color will be a boon for all students, in the spirit of the idiom: A rising tide lifts all boats,” he wrote. “There is enormous untapped potential in our students. To unlock this potential, we must target how we educate students who have not yet fully benefited from the progress we have made. We are confident that our investment in young men of color will pay off for all our students, and for the entire city.”
The initiative is separate from but works in coordination with the White House’s My Brother’s Keeper project, which similarly aims to aid young minority males through collaborations with institutions across the nation. Georgetown’s Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation was approached by the Department of Education last summer to work on My Brother’s Keeper, including a data jam session in August.
In addition to community service programs such as D.C. Reads and the D.C. Schools Project run by the Center for Social Justice, Georgetown also directs the Meyers Institute for College Preparation to ready students in Ward 7 for college. Despite these partnerships, no Georgetown organizations have yet announced formal involvement with the Empowering Males of Color initiative, according to Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh.
Aligning with her commitment to increasing opportunities for the District’s disadvantaged youths, Mayor Bowser recently launched the annual Marion Barry Summer Youth Employment Program, opening the application process for students ages 14 to 21, renamed this year after the former mayor who began the program and died in November.
The university has provided around a dozen opportunities through the program in past years. Selected candidates will earn six weeks of employment and work-readiness training. Applications are open until Friday, Feb. 20 at summerjobs.dc.gov.

President Barack Obama’s proposed $4 trillion budget for the upcoming fiscal year, which was released Monday, included provisions to remove restrictions on marijuana legalization and abortion services in the District, supporting greater budgetary and legislative autonomy for D.C.
The congressional omnibus spending bill, passed in December, restricted D.C. officials from using federal and local funds to perform any abortions or enact any legislation related to the possession or distribution of marijuana.
According to The Washington Post, the budget removes the “local” portion of these policy riders in a section on page 1248 of the proposal, permitting the usage of local tax revenue to implement a tax-and-regulate system for marijuana distribution in the District, in addition to providing abortion services for low-income women.
“None of the Federal funds contained in this Act may be used to enact any law, rule or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use or distribution of any schedule I substance. … None of the Federal funds appropriated under this Act shall be expended for any abortion except where the life of the mother would be endangered,” the proposal reads.
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) expressed her support for the changes included in the White House’s proposal.
“We are grateful that the president again has demonstrated his support for D.C. to spend its local funds as it chooses and without politically motivated congressional interferences,” Norton said in a statement.
The issue of marijuana legalization has become a point of contention in the debate regarding congressional oversight over the District. While voters passed Initiative 71 to legalize possession of up to two ounces of marijuana for individuals over the age of 21, Congress added the provision in the omnibus bill.
Despite this, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) sent the initiative to Congress on Jan. 16 to begin a 30-day review period, as advocates argue that the legislation was already implemented when voters passed the initiative.
Obama’s proposal, however, could enable the D.C. Council to enact a tax-and-regulation scheme similar to the systems currently in Colorado and Washington, offering greater oversight for the council over the legalization process. Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) introduced a bill to begin such deliberations in October but was halted by the provision that prevented further legislation on the issue.
With the Monday release, the proposal will now undergo exhaustive review through committees in both the Senate and House, offering Republican opponents, particularly Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), who introduced the omnibus policy rider, plenty of opportunities to amend the legislation.
In addition to the specific policy provisions, the budget broadly extends support for D.C. budget and legislative autonomy. Obama said in July 2014 that he was “for” D.C. statehood, and the Senate held the first hearing since 1993 on the issue in September.
“Consistent with the principle of home rule, it is the Administration’s view that the District’s local autonomy should be enhanced and increased,” the proposal reads.

While students campaigning for executive positions in the Georgetown University Student Association will formally announce their candidacy Feb. 5, two mandatory information sessions hosted by the GUSA Election Commission hinted as to how the tickets may round out.
Nine students, not including campus media, attended the first session, held Wednesday, Jan. 28, including Alex Bobroske (SFS ’17), Craig Levites (COL ’17), Joe Luther (COL ’16), Connor Rohan (COL ’16), Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16), Reno Varghese (SFS ’16), Chris Wadibia (COL ’16) and Meredith Cheney (COL ’16).
More students attended the second meeting, held Monday, Feb. 2. Among them were Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16), Will Simons (COL ’16), Sara Margolis (COL ’16) and Ryan Shymansky (COL ’16).
Sources confirm presidential and vice-presidential pairings of Rosenberger and Varghese, McNaughton and Simons, Margolis and Shymansky, and Luther and Rohan. However, possible contenders cannot speak in their capacity as GUSA executive candidates until the official campaign period begins.
There will be two debates for presidential and vice presidential candidates, respectively, held Feb. 11 and Feb. 16. The election will be held Feb. 19.
To accommodate schedules and the annual GUSA budget request that typically takes place the Sunday after the election, the election dates are a week earlier than normal, according to GUSA Election Commissioners Pavan Rajgopal (SFS ’15), Alden Fletcher (SFS ’17) and Grady Willard (SFS ’18). The commissioners said that they hope this year’s campaign is fair and constructive.
“We’ve had clean campaigns for the last two or three years now,” Rajgopal said. “We want to keep that track record.”
Although candidates have not officially declared, online articles have appeared criticizing certain campaigns. The election commissioners and potential candidates declined to comment on such articles before the start of the official campaign season Feb. 5.
Rajgopal and Fletcher both said that the mix of GUSA insiders and non-GUSA candidates is good for the campaign and school. McNaughton, Margolis, Rosenberger and Varghese have served on GUSA in some capacity, while the other students at the information sessions have not been involved with the association.
“I think it provides a nice diversity of views,” Fletcher said. “People who know and have a history of working with administrators, and people who want to get more involved and see the issue from a different approach.”
Rajgopal echoed this sentiment and said that non-GUSA candidates can provide unique insight to the executive team.
“It’s good to have people with experience in student government because there are a lot of processes and procedures for which that helps,” Rajgopal said. “At the same time, it’s good that there are lots of people coming in with an outside perspective because sometimes things can get wrapped up in procedure.”
Current GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Vice President Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) offered their advice to the candidates about how to navigate the anxiety and pressure of campaigning during the Feb. 2 meeting.
“First and foremost is to do your best to keep it clean,” Tezel said. “These elections can get very passionate and heated but it’s important that all parties remember that everyone has a common goal and that it’s only by maintaining a respectful dialogue that we will be able to get there.”
Jikaria reminded candidates that this is a long process and it is important to maintain balance.
“Keep in mind that this is definitely a marathon, not a sprint,” Jikaria said. “Take care of yourself. Have fun. Be thankful for the people around you helping you.”
 
Correction: A previous version of the article did not state that Chris Wadibia (COL ’16) and Meredith Cheney (COL ’16) were present. In fact, Cheney was present at the Jan. 28 meeting.
Correction: A previous version of the article states that the elections were a week later than previous years. In fact, the elections are one week earlier than previous elections. The election will take place Feb. 19.

The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching granted Georgetown the 2015 Carnegie Classification for Community Engagement on Jan. 15, an award that was given to 360 U.S. colleges and universities and will remain valid until 2025.
“The Carnegie Classification for Community Engagement is the gold star for recognition in the important work of the university for the common good,” Center for Social Justice Director Andria Wisler said. “The process to earn this classification is both rigorous and extremely reflective, allowing many Georgetown faculty and staff members committed to these endeavors to share about their work.”
In a statement on the university’s website, President John J. DeGioia said that Georgetown’s success is because of the university’s commitment to the common good.
“Our commitment to the common good, to engaging productively and positively with our community locally and globally, is at the core of this tradition and at the heart of what we do at Georgetown,” DeGioia wrote.
Georgetown previously received the Carnegie award in 2008, and this award expired in January 2015. The Carnegie Foundation has been awarding this specific classification since 2006, and a total of 361 universities and colleges have received the distinction.
“Since 2008 we have expanded our infrastructure to support this work, including creating the Office of Community Engagement and the Office of Global Engagement, created new academic programs with strong community engagement components,” Associate Vice President of Community Engagement and Strategic Initiatives Lauralyn Lee said. “[This] strengthened much of the community service and engaged scholarship that has been central to Georgetown for many years.”
In addition to the creation of the Office of Community Engagement and the Office of Global Engagement, Wisler said the Designing The Future(s) of the University initiative was an important reason why Georgetown received the Carnegie award this year.
The initiative, which launched in 2013, is focused on engaging the Georgetown community in an exploration of the problems that higher education as a whole faces and the ways Georgetown can sustain a high-caliber education in the face of these issues.
The incorporation of community engagement into the core values of Georgetown is an important part of the Carnegie classification.
DeGioia said that Georgetown’s core educational purpose was the motivating factor behind its strength in community engagement.
“As we face new challenges in higher education and explore new ways to educate our students, we remain committed to the core purposes of the university — formation, scholarship and the common good — all tenets to which deep and meaningful community engagement is essential,” DeGioia wrote.
Seventeen Jesuit institutions, including Xavier University and Marquette University, also received the award. Wisler said that the fact so many Jesuit universities received the award is no coincidence.
“It is our shared Jesuit mission and values that provide a compelling framework and context for deep community engagement,” Wisler said.
Many different facets of the Georgetown community contributed to receiving the award, according to Wisler.
“The Center for Social Justice is proud to play a major role in these efforts, through its deep collaborations with dozens of community-based organizations, whose willingness to partner provide the foundation for sustained, impactful engagement,” Wisler said.
Assistant Director of Community Engagement Jamie Scott said that the award was the result of collaboration across all of Georgetown’s campuses, offices and programs.
“The Office of Community Engagement and the Center for Social Justice worked closely on the bulk of the drafting, with input and assistance from colleagues at the Law Center, Medical Center, Main Campus, SCS and elsewhere,” Scott said. “We are grateful for everyone that helped us collect data and draft the application.”
Despite Georgetown’s recognition, the university will continue to push itself to further improvement.
“New CSJ initiatives are always in collaboration with community-based partners,” Wisler said. “Two small examples [of new CSJ initiatives include] … a new STEM afterschool program in Ward 7 at Nalle Elementary School which includes tutoring on Tuesday and Thursday and a Robotics class on Fridays. CSJ has also deepened its partnership with Georgetown Ministry Center with the development of a Hypothermia Outreach Team among other programs.”
Lee said that Georgetown must, and will, continue its devotion to promoting high levels of community engagement.
“[We want to] bring experiential learning into the mainstream of the Georgetown curriculum, a goal of the Designing the Future(s) Initiative, and aligning our business practices with the needs of our city,” Lee said. “By understanding the needs of our community and the resources at the university, we can leverage our resources to meet those needs and design new programs and policies to help fill the gaps.”

The Point in Time count, the annual census and survey of homeless persons and families required by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, launched around the country Wednesday. The Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness began gathering results for Washington, D.C., though final numbers will not be released until April.
D.C. Department of Human Services Public Information Officer Dora Taylor explained the logistics of the count.
“[Point in Time] involves counting everyone who is what HUD calls ‘literally homeless,’ meaning that they are residing in emergency shelters, transitional housing facilities, or are unsheltered,” Taylor said. “Key demographic areas that outreach staff and volunteers are trained to prioritize collecting in their engagements with homeless persons are … [people with] chronic homeless status … homeless veterans … [and] homeless youth.”
In 2014, homelessness in D.C. totaled 7,748 people, a 13 percent increase from 2013 and a total representing 1.2 percent of the population. There were 3,953 single homeless people and 3,975 homeless people in families, inclduing 2,236 children.
Taylor said that the city could not release any numbers until April. The Winter Plan released by the Interagency Council on Homelessness in September predicted a 16 percent increase in homeless families this winter. The city has faced issues with its emergency housing capacity in the cold, with D.C. General, the District’s largest homeless shelter, running out of space in January.
D.C. Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) said his primary concern for this year’s census is determining the amount of homeless students in the city.
“I’m particularly concerned about the students that are homeless, we have over 1800 students that are homeless in the District of Columbia attending the schools,” Grosso said.
He added that he hopes to prioritize helping homeless students throughout the upcoming year.
“So what are we doing to provide them the proper services they need both from finding them a home to mental health services and other things? Hopefully we can move forward and prioritize this in the next year and make it so that there are fewer homeless in the District of Columbia,” he said.
Mayor Muriel Bowser has made the issue a cornerstone of her administration, focusing on improving permanent housing to lower the stress of shelters and decrease the homeless population.
Georgetown students involved with Homeless Outreach Programs and Education devote their time to the cause, including volunteering at soup kitchens and making scarves for the homeless.
HOPE Advocacy and Awareness Co-Coordinator Gianna Maita (COL ’15) spoke about the variety of student commitment to the cause.
“Students in HOPE do many different outreach programs that are service-based and involve providing conversation, food … to people experiencing homelessness. The most important thing … is that Georgetown students make it clear that folks who are unhoused still deserve to have their dignity recognized by our city and our society,” Maita said.
HOPE volunteer Czarina Ramos (COL ’16) echoed Maita, saying that homelessness is an important issue for Georgetown students to engage with.
“As students, it’s very accessible to tune into information about housing policy and demographics and the big numbers. Getting in touch with people experiencing homelessness and listening to what they have to say is a little bit tougher,” Ramos said. “We hope to build a culture on campus where homelessness isn’t some negative character trait, and is instead simply a living situation.”

In response to the proposed updates to national air quality standards, several Georgetown students from the College Democrats and GU Fossil Free in addition to university staff members testified at a hearing by the Environmental Protection Agency last week.
Through the testimony, they hope to give a personal twist to a national issue and encourage stricter environmental standards.
The hearing took place Thursday as part of the EPA’s effort to solicit input from the general public about national air quality standards for ground-level ozone, otherwise known as smog. It has proposed strengthening standards to a level within a range of 65 to 70 parts per billion, while taking comment on a level as low as 60 ppb. Currently, the standard is 75 ppb.
Various environmental groups on campus including GU College Democrats and GU Fossil Free encouraged interested members to attend the hearing.
The students and staff members who participated prepared for the hearing by learning about the facts and finding a personal appeal. Instead of focusing solely on abstract numbers and concepts, many of them related air quality standards to personal experiences.
GU College Democrats environmental advocacy leader Graham Willard (SFS ’18) attended the hearing on Thursday and submitted testimony. Growing up in Los Angeles, Willard said that his hometown experience remains the biggest motivation behind his dedication to environmental causes and drove him to testify at the EPA hearing.
“In Los Angeles, we have bad air quality, fires and smogs,” Willard said. “Although we are not experts on science, we do have the ability to put a human face as to why improving air quality is important.”
Nina Sherburne, a staff member at the Hoya Kids Learning Center under the university’s Human Resource department and a member of GU Fossil Free, was unable to attend the hearing in person, but handed her testimony to a friend to be read on her behalf. In her testimony, she chose to share stories of her preschool students battling asthma and other conditions to make the fight for clean air personal.
“Think about the amount of time, energy, resources and dollars that are spent battling smog and its effects,” Sherburne wrote in her testimony. “If you choose the limit of 60 parts per billion, imagine the gift of freedom you will give to this country. What might we, as a society, be if air quality was never an issue? And who might my student become if he were able to step into the world and just breathe?”
Both Sherburne and Willard said that they wanted to show the EPA that human health is just as important as other concerns people may have.
“There are a lot of people who don’t view the environment as the number one issue of importance in this country, and they believe that you either create jobs or protect the environment.” Willard said. “It is really important to get through this notion. You can create jobs and protect the environment at the same time.”
The EPA will continue to accept written comments on the proposed standards until March 17, and the agency is scheduled to issue a final rule by Oct. 1.
GU College Democrats Chairman Matthew Gregory (SFS ‘17) said that his student group will be closely following the resolution of the issue.
“If it continues to be in limbo, there is a possibility that members of the [College Democrats] might consider meeting with some lawmakers to discuss why we thought it’s important and why there should be continued push for more regulation for making business align with the interests of the common good rather than simply profit-seeking,” Gregory said.
Gregory also hopes to raise awareness among the campus population of important government policies on environmental issues.
“We plan to work together with other on-campus student groups such as GU Fossil Free and hope to get a campus movement in support of environmental measures and energy measures we feel are beneficial for the nation and for the future,” Gregory said.

Georgetown Dining began a pilot program Saturday which allows students to order Elevation Burger dorm delivery on Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The order, which is dubbed “Jack Pack,” includes four burgers, four fries and four sodas for $29.99.
The promotion was devised by the Georgetown Dining marketing team during a weekly meeting, Aramark Marketing Manager Adam Solloway said. Aramark will evaluate the program at the end of each week, but do not have a set timeline for how long the pilot will last, Solloway said.
“We are piloting the program on weekends as the business is slower, which will help ensure better execution of the pilot from an operations perspective,” Aramark Marketing Manager Adam Solloway said.
The design of the Jack Pack and its four-person serving size came with students’ studying and socializing habits in mind.
“We feel a bundled pack will generate more interest as students tend to socialize in groups and it allows our operations team the ability to maintain consistent service with the high volume of anticipated orders,” Solloway said.
The service is not being offered in the evenings because the marketing team foresaw more weekend and morning demand based on customer feedback, Solloway said.
Currently, the Jack Pack includes only an Elevation Burger with no vegetarian or vegan options. It comes with all the original toppings, lettuce, tomato and sauce, though extra toppings are an extra charge.
Delivery is free and students can pay with credit cards, flex dollars or debit dollars. Aramark employees will deliver the food.
The program may include additional labor to accommodate the delivery service after the success of the pilot is evaluated, Solloway said.
Matt Ching (COL ’18) said he thinks that Elevation Burger will have greater success now that it is offering delivery.
“Elevation Burger is really elevating their game with this new policy,” Ching said.
Austin Hong (COL ’18) said the offer is a fair price for a fair meal.
“I am ready and willing to give $30 for an equivalent amount of calories and sustenance,” Hong said.
Margot McCloskey (COL ’18) said that she is disappointed the service does not extend to evenings.
“I think that it totally should be a late-night snack, but I also think that it’s a really great idea because a lot of times at Leo’s the food gets really stingy.” McCloskey said. “I definitely think that they should add it to later times. What’s the point of stopping at 3 p.m.? I feel like they would make more money late at night because personally a lot of times it’s hard to get four people together during the middle of the day.”

Assistant to the Administrator for Policy, Planning and Learning at the U.S. Agency for International Development, Alex Thier, confronted skepticism regarding the possibility of ending extreme poverty by 2030 during the “Ending Extreme Poverty — A Story of Trajectories and Choices” event held on Thursday in the Lohrfink Auditorium.
He spoke about the progress that has been made in the past 20 years in a discussion co-hosted by the Master of Science in Foreign Service Program, Global Human Development Program and the Mortara Center for International Studies.
Extreme poverty is defined as living on less than $1.25 a day, according to Thier. “Imagine yourself having to live — not just eat, but pay for school, pay for housing and anything else that you wanted to do — with that money,” Thier said. “But it’s not just about measure of income, it’s really about choices that people are forced to make when they live in extreme poverty. Are you going to take that quarter and pay for medicine to cure a child with illness or pay for their school fees to get basic education?”
The Global Human Development Program Director Steve Radelet recognized the sizable progress that has been made so far in fighting poverty. He said that in 1993, two billion people lived on less than $1.25 a day, but by 2011 that number had dropped to one billion. This past progress gives reason for optimism going forward, according to Radelet.
“So when you think about, ‘Well, maybe I’m a little skeptical about the potential for progress between now and 2030,’ just step back and realize how much progress has been made,” Radelet said. “And it makes you realize that achieving these goals or at least coming really close to these goals is really important.”
But despite Radelet’s optimism, a debate continues regarding the real possibility of ending extremepoverty in the world.
“What we have to ask ourselves is if it is possible,” Thier said. “And here opinions diverge. Some say that the easy places have been taken off the map and that progress is going to flat line. Others think that the dynamics of the global economy are such that the growth and the process will accelerate.”
Although there has been rapid progress in the past 20 years, it does not mean that the decreasing poverty rate is a trend that will necessarily self-perpetuate without further investment, according to Radelet.
“I do believe that there is huge potential for continued progress in the next 15 or 20 years,” Radelet said. “However, given the huge progress that has been made, I do not believe that it is inevitable or automatic that this progress is going to continue. It takes decisions, it takes sacrifice, it takes investment, it takes smart allocation of resources, it takes complete changes in direction in some countries.”
Questions of how to allocate funds coming from development agencies such as USAID also arise among a high need and a low budget, according to Radelet.
“So do you allocate your resources to where the need is greatest, but the progress might be slow and hard when that means not providing resources to other countries that maybe the need is not great but the potential for progress is bigger because they have a government in place that is making the right decisions?” Radelet asked.
With the right amount of investment and sacrifices, Thier said he believes that ending extreme poverty is a goal that can be achieved within our lifetime.
“Your generation could be the one that ends extreme poverty and I believe that that would be the greatest thing that we ever accomplish as a species,” Thier said. “And it’s within our grasp.”
Attendee Sarah Gagnon (MSFS ’14) noted the accountability factor that comes with having such ambitious goals.
“The goals that are set by the international communities are obviously very lofty and ambitious and they far exceed the monetary budget that USAID and other international development agencies have,” Gagnon said. “At the same time, I think that the goals are something that keep us accountable and keep us in check, and you know this is what we are striving for ultimately. Of course it is going to take time to get there.”

The 2015 Georgetown University Student Association executive race began at the stroke of midnight yesterday, as five campaigns vied for advertising space in Red Square at the start of the official campaign period. A sixth was not present at the campaign starting line, but has nonetheless tossed its hat in the ring, making this year’s race the most crowded since 2012.
 
The six tickets in this year’s Georgetown University Student Association executive race have fielded a mixture of GUSA insiders and outsiders, a marked change from last year’s insider-dominated race.
 
The 2015 Georgetown University Student Association election, which began Thursday at midnight in Red Square, features five student pairs, who have publicized their platforms on their respective websites and social media pages. The presidential and vice presidential tickets include Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Connor Rohan (COL ’16), Sara Margolis (COL ’16) and Ryan Shymansky (COL ’16), Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) and Will Simons (COL ’16), Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16) and Reno Varghese (SFS ’16), and Chris Wadibia (COL ’16) and Meredith Cheney (COL ’16). A sixth candidate group of Mike Minahan (COL ’16) and Stephen Paduano (COL ’16) officially withdrew from the race Sunday morning. The candidates will discuss their platforms further in two debates on Feb. 11 and Feb. 16 and the race will culminate in a vote Feb. 19.
 
As the five tickets campaign for the Georgetown University Student Association executive position, hundreds of fliers and social media blasts will go up, seemingly countless meet-and-greets will be held and thousands of doors will be knocked on.
 
The next Georgetown University Student Association executive, who will be elected next week, will play an important role in the upcoming negotiations for the 2018 Campus Plan. The university and the neighboring community will negotiate to solidify plans for the next 20 years of construction and maintenance around campus as part of the 2018 Campus Plan. Contentious negotiations for the 2010 Campus Plan required the university to house more students on campus, necessitating extensive construction projects around campus.
 
None of the 10 candidates running for Georgetown University Student Association executive office hold membership in a secret society, compared to four of eight candidates in last year’s election. Secret societies dominated media coverage of the 2013 GUSA executive race, with the discovery of leaked emails revealing the identities of several members of the Second Society of Stewards, including one GUSA executive candidate and the current GUSA chief of staff. Last year, four candidates running for executive office confirmed involvement in secret societies. The Stewards and an offshoot known as the Thirds are the main secret societies on campus.
The five Georgetown University Student Association vice presidential candidates participated in Wednesday’s Election Commission-moderated debate, answering questions from campus media, members of the GUSA Finance and Appropriations committee and those posed through Twitter.

The five Georgetown University Student Association vice presidential candidates participated in Wednesday’s Election Commission-moderated debate, answering questions from campus media, members of the GUSA Finance and Appropriations committee and those posed through Twitter.

The five presidential candidates in the Georgetown University Student Association executive race participated in a heated debate Monday evening in the Healey Family Student Center.
The debate featured presidential candidates Chris Wadibia (COL ’16), Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16), Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16), Sara Margolis (COL ’16) and Joe Luther (COL ’16). GUSA Election Commissioner Pavan Rajgopal (SFS ’14) moderated the debate, which featured questions from members of campus media and the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee, as well as those posed through Twitter and written on paper by members of the audience.
 

The Hoya conducted a campus-wide, door-to-door poll of Georgetown students on Sunday night in advance of the Georgetown University Student Association executive election Feb. 18 to 19. A total of 616 Georgetown students completed surveys, which asked students about their views on the relevance of GUSA and the performance of the current GUSA executives, their views of the current election — including their vote choice — and a series of demographic questions.
 
Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Connor Rohan (COL ’16) are leading the 2015 Georgetown University Student Association executive race with 23 percent of likely voters choosing their ticket, according to a door-to-door poll conducted by The Hoya on Monday night.
 
Candidates for the 2015 Georgetown University Student Association executive election have submitted their proposed administrative budgets for the upcoming year, ranging from $29,000 to $78,410.
