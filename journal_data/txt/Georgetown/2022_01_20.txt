In her new book, “Being Present,” Professor Jeanine Turner of the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business (MSB) provides tools to communicate in a digitally distracting world. 
Published in January, her book synthesizes 15 years of original research and presents strategies for directing and allocating attention in order to be more present in the workplace and at home. A professor in Georgetown’s Communication, Culture and Technology Program, Turner has conducted years of investigation into communication technologies. She first began her research on the phenomenon of multicommunicating, engaging in multiple conversations at one time, in 2008.
Phones have become more invasive, forcing people to divide their attention among several things at once, according to Turner.
“Your number one concern is where your phone is, if your phone is ringing. Even if it’s face to face, physical presence almost becomes background noise,” Turner said in an interview with The Hoya, “And as I really started to see that happening, it made me think, wow, we need some strategies for how to better understand how we’re going to be present at any one time, because it really came on very quickly. I don’t think we realize just how ubiquitous the phone is.”
The state of “being present” is divided into four categories of presence — budgeted, entitled, competitive and invitational — all which provide scenarios for how to listen and engage with an audience despite distraction, according to Turner. Each part is subsequently split into a workplace section and an outside of the workplace section, Turner explained. 
For individuals who work at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to strategize ways to separate work and home. 
“During the pandemic, you had this collision of work and home, which made it even harder,” Turner said, “You were constantly trying to figure out: where am I going to be present? Am I going to be present in my physical space? Am I going to be present on social media? Am I going to be present texting? In my email?”
Within the MSB, Turner’s insights for effective communication have positively influenced business programs and executives for years; her book makes this work accessible for all audiences, according to Paul Almeida, dean and William R. Berkley chair at the MSB.
“‘Being Present’ is the culmination of years of original research and experience teaching communications strategies to real executives — including those within our McDonough School of Business programs,” Almeida wrote in an email to The Hoya, “We have seen the positive effects of Jeanine’s insights firsthand in organizations across the world, and now this information is available to anyone hoping to become more attentive and intentional with their approach to communication.” 
Everyone can find useful information in Turner’s book, whether they seek to improve their leadership skills or independent productivity, according to Hilary Claggett, senior acquisitions editor in global business for Georgetown University Press. 
“Being Present could not be more timely as hybrid, virtual and remote modes of work continue to blur the lines between work life and home life,” Claggett wrote in an email to The Hoya, “Jeanine Turner has deftly translated her years of research on the best ways to manage one’s social presence into recommendations that anyone can understand and deploy.”
Although digital devices can play an all-consuming role in many aspects of daily life, putting effort into thoughtful communication and relationships mitigates these negative effects and aligns with Georgetown’s Jesuit mission, according to Turner. 
“What I love about Georgetown is kind of the whole, you know, Ignatian approach to caring for the whole person and discernment and thinking about on a day by day basis: what am I doing that’s life-giving?” Turner said, “And what am I doing that I need to change that maybe isn’t as life-giving? And I feel like these strategies can really help us think in the same way about discerning the kind of communication and conversations that we want to have.”

Over 75,000 streetlights in Washington, D.C., are set to receive a significant eco-friendly upgrade, as new, energy-efficient LED lights replace the city’s old, incandescent street bulbs over the next two years. 
The D.C. Smart Street Lighting Project settled on a contract with Plenary Infrastructure D.C. (PIDC) after years of proposals as announced by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) on Jan. 12. The project is expected to be completed within two years and cost $309 million, and is currently awaiting approval from the D.C. Council.
The District’s new LED lights are more energy-efficient and will contribute to a 50% decrease in streetlight energy, saving 38,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, according to the DDOT’s executive summary of the project. 
Federal land will be excluded from the project, including areas around the U.S. Capitol, National Park Service Land and some city parks. 
Replacing street lights with LEDs is a small step toward adapting the city to a new climate reality, according to Dagomar Degroot, a member of the executive committee of Georgetown’s environmental studies program, composed of faculty, students, staff, student groups, community partners, and more, who aim to create a program which addresses environmental challenges. 
“It’s a major undertaking and it will remove more greenhouse gas emissions that the city otherwise might have put into the atmosphere,” Degroot said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Around 75,000 bytes, a unit of digital information, have been replaced, according to Degroot. 
Along with energy-saving benefits, the new LEDs will have remote dimming and monitoring features, eliminating the need for manual light outage reportages, according to the DDOT. Any light outages can be located and identified faster, and poles will have tilt sensors to alert the city to any light poles that are unstable. 
The project comes after past discussions about eco-friendly city upgrades had stalled, according to Angela van Doorn, a Georgetown environmental studies professor. 
“It’s a move in the right direction. It really kind of illustrates that D.C. is starting to take action. They’re not just talking about things,” van Doorn said in an interview with The Hoya. “They’re starting to take action in reducing greenhouse gasses, and this is a great step in energy savings.”
Creating environmental change through public infrastructure updates is part of the greater solution toward environmental protection, according to Nathan Hensely, a member of the executive committee of Georgetown’s environmental studies program.
“Investments in green infrastructure like this are really important because they help us see what’s possible when you use public investment to change the landscape of how we live,” Hensely said in an interview with The Hoya. 
This LED replacement project originally began in 2016 by testing new LED streetlights in certain neighborhoods. However, the residents living in these testing zones complained of the harsher, bluer lights emitted by the new LED streetlight bulbs. 
This project posed problems for both residents and wildlife, according to Degroot. 
“The reason that was a failure is because they replaced incandescent bulbs with LED lights that were way too bright and kind of cooler colored,” Degroot said. “But it’s also probably for environmental reasons. It’s really bright, so the lights alter the behavior of plants and animals, and they also drown out the night sky.”
Six years after the launch of the LED replacement project, the DDOT has committed to maximizing light emittance from these new LEDs lights, which will also have greater accuracy than currently used high-pressure sodium lights. The enhancement of these lights will enable more light to be cast where needed, such as on roads and sidewalks, and prevent light pollution. 
Major cities like the D.C. must continue implementing more powerful environmental policies beyond just lightbulbs, according to Hensley.
“I think that one of the things we want to ask ourselves is whether our policies for environmental change and mitigation are window dressing, or if they are part of a broader and strategic, deep-looking, social transformative agenda that would have to go much further than streetlight bulbs,” Hensely said.

LEDs are not energy-efficient because they not provide the same uniform illumination service as HPS.  LEDs as just a very low-quality, non-uniform, directed energy light and because the light is such a low-quality, it is toxic to humans.

Students will be able to provide feedback on dining policies at Georgetown University following the launch of a dining policy working group on campus. 
The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) and Hoya Hospitality launched Engage IQ, an interview process led by Katie Davis, vice president of operations for Hoya Hospitality, to gather and incorporate student opinions into dining policies. Student participants in Engage IQ will include GUSA members and chosen student representatives. The working group will meet through virtual discussion sessions to provide feedback and opinions about their dining experiences in general.
Engage IQ will combine student input, interviews and surveys to improve dining policy at Georgetown, according to GUSA Vice President Thomas Leonard (COL ’23).
“The initiative was, as far as our discussions with administrators went, focused on Georgetown University’s goals and cultures with a focus on identifying the best food-forward experience for our campus,” Leonard said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It’s going to include client engagement through stakeholder interviews, as well as market and consumer insights gained through campus surveys.”
GUSA will choose between six and eight student participants who are representative of the university’s larger student body, including athletes and members of Georgetown Scholars Program, which provides support for first-generation and low-income students at Georgetown, so that all students’ opinions are accounted for, according to Leonard.
During the fall 2021 semester, students expressed concerns about food safety following an outbreak of norovirus, a highly contagious gastrointestinal virus that spreads through direct contact or contaminated food and water. The virus infected at least 145 students on campus. Students also opposed the change in university policy requiring all students to enroll in a meal plan as of fall 2021. 
Engage IQ marks a shift toward the university taking student opinions into account when it comes to dining policy, according to Leonard.
“I think it’s absolutely a step in the right direction,” Leonard said. “I think I would even venture into saying it’s a jump in the right direction for the university to really not only put dining reform on the forefront of their priorities as far as moving the university forward but also making sure that students have a position in those conversations and that they’re a stakeholder.”
According to Davis, Engage IQ will take advantage of the opportunity to reexamine dining services at Georgetown amid and after the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“The pandemic has made us all look at dining and food with a new lens, and we hope to apply the nimbleness and innovation we have developed to the future Georgetown campus dining,” Davis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Engage IQ is coming at a perfect time, allowing us to reflect on the here and now, as well as fuel excitement for what is to come at Georgetown.”
In conjunction with Engage IQ, the administration hopes to establish a formal dining committee devoted to collecting student feedback when the public health conditions improve, according to Marc Fournier, vice president of auxiliary services and real estate at Georgetown University. 
“In the past, there was a formal dining committee on campus but the participation wasn’t very good. The team pivoted to a ‘food and feedback’ forum that was better attended,” Fournier wrote in an email obtained by The Hoya. “To be honest, the challenges of the day have impacted that opportunity. That said, perhaps we can discuss something in the interim for next semester until things get back to normal and decide on a formal committee or more of a forum strategy.”
While Engage IQ will be in operation for the next five to seven years, GUSA will also continue with its own efforts to push for improvements to student dining, according to GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (COL ’22).
“Even with this working group, you’re going to see dining kind of intersect with our plan for socioeconomic advocacy, so it’s something that is going to still be in the background but we want to make sure that students that are actually nominated and have a chance to advocate for themselves too,” Flores said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “We’re not going to just abandon dining as an issue.”
Engage IQ will only enhance the work that GUSA is already doing with regards to university dining policies, Leonard said. 
“I think Engage IQ is going to be great because it’s going to supplement a lot of the work that GUSA is doing already because they’re getting so many more perspectives and diverse student opinions outside of the GUSA space,” Leonard said. “Of course, GUSA is very much meant to encapsulate the student need, but GUSA will never be able to fully represent all stakeholders at the school, which is why external engagement is so important on that front.”
According to Leonard, active engagement from students is crucial for Engage IQ to be successful and ultimately make changes to university dining policy. 
“The most important thing you can do is be honest about what the university can do to improve in what ways the university has maybe failed you and in what ways the university may have failed your peers as it relates to dining,” Leonard said.

Students are petitioning for a tuition reduction following Georgetown University’s announcement that classes will be held virtually through Jan. 30. 
The petition, which has garnered 230 signatures as of Jan. 20, calls on the university to provide a tuition reduction for the period in which classes remain virtual and refund housing and meal plan costs for students returning to campus later in January. In anticipation of a surge in COVID-19 cases due to the highly transmissible omicron variant, the university plans to operate virtually through Jan. 30, with in person instruction planned to resume Jan. 31, according to a Jan. 5 email sent to campus community members from University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95). 
Although students were permitted to return to their on-campus residences beginning Jan. 11, they can choose to return to campus at a later date in January. Additionally, some main campus spaces will operate at reduced capacities and all dining locations are grab-and-go until further notice. Eating and drinking is also not allowed in any nonresidential campus building, including Lauinger Library. 
Dalton Nunamaker (COL ’22), who co-wrote the petition, said he was inspired to circulate the petition after the spring plan did not include a tuition discount. 
“I sort of took charge because I’m a senior and I was frustrated with a lot of these policies and the lack of respect for student interests,” Nunamaker said in an interview with The Hoya. “I just thought it was a shame that our administration didn’t see the value of being here for students.”
Last year, the university offered a 10% tuition discount, which does not include housing and dining costs, for undergraduate students who did not live on campus and graduate students a 5% discount. Although a majority of classes were held remotely, the university did offer some hybrid classes for undergraduate and graduate students in the spring of 2021.
Katelyn Rickert (COL ’24), who also contributed to the petition, said she was disappointed the university did not offer a tuition discount despite offering a discount for the 2020-21 academic year
“The main reason that we were angered by it is because they did give a 10% tuition reduction when we were fully online last year,” Rickert said in an interview with The Hoya. “The university obviously recognizes that online classes are not the same as in person classes and they’re not the same value, so that’s why we wanted to demand a tuition reduction for these two and a half weeks.” 
The petition also requests that if reductions are given, the university provides evidence that the amount refunded is adequate for each student’s situation.
“Evidence that the amount of money being refunded corresponds to what students are missing out on, whether it be from online class, choosing not to use the meal plan or not having access to the Yates Field House,” the petition reads. 
The petition does not specify a method for this explanation. 
Additionally, the petition demands a refund equal to the period students are not permitted access to Yates Field House, a campus recreation space, which is planned to re-open at limited capacity on Jan. 21. 
Yates’ closure has disproportionately impacted ROTC students who depend on the gym to fulfill their requirements, according to Jacob Adams (SFS ’23), who co-wrote the petition.
“ROTC people have to work out for their requirements and I know for a fact at least one ROTC person had to get a separate gym membership so that he could work out,” Adams said in an interview with The Hoya. “Even though they’re reopening the gym, he already had to buy a separate gym membership — it just seems extremely inconsiderate for students to make them do that.”
The current spring semester guidelines are not the value of a Georgetown experience, according to Rickert. 
“Getting a true Georgetown education, that’s what we all came here for and that’s another reason why we want to ask for a tuition reduction,” Rickert said. “We are missing out on a lot of those in person opportunities that come with what we’re paying for our tuition.”
The lack of response from administrators to students’ concerns is frustrating, according to Rickert.   
“The university just doesn’t consider these things from a student’s perspective, and it’s frustrating to see the administration officials just brush us off and not really take our demand seriously,” Rickert said. “It’s just really frustrating to attend Georgetown at the moment.”

A team of international researchers, including professors from the Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) worked with sources of past zoonotic viruses in order to develop models to predict where the next severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus will come from.
The cohort of scientists, which includes researchers from the University of Glasgow and University College Dublin, has utilized the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict which animals will serve as hosts to zoonotic viruses, which spread from animals to humans. Their findings were published Jan. 10 in a paper titled “Optimising predictive models to prioritise viral discovery in zoonotic reservoirs.”
The increase in global interest for zoonotic virus research provided an opportunity to test and refine the team’s model, according to Greg Albery, a postdoctoral fellow in Georgetown’s biology department and a joint first author of the study.
“We realised that the pandemic would inspire an unprecedented flood of research into bats and coronaviruses, and we thought that this would be an excellent opportunity to make some predictions and have them tested over a short space of time by the wider scientific community,” Albery wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The project’s objective was to use machine learning to create more complete data models in tracking virus sources, according to Colin Carlson, senior author of the study and assistant professor in Georgetown’s microbiology and immunology department. 
“There’s a few different ways we can teach a computer to solve this problem,” Carlson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The simplest is to say, take a look at which animals host which kinds of viruses, and try to predict who’s most similar to who. That can work okay on paper, but it turns out it doesn’t really hold up over time. On the other hand, if we put in data about the biology of the species we’re interested in — things like where they’re from, what they eat, or what shape their wings are — the models start to get pretty good.” 
Carlson said the project, which consisted of eight learning models, provided predictions of probable but unsampled bat hosts, and took into account the influx of data on bat coronaviruses in order to improve model accuracy.
“We sat down to run everything again, start to finish, with over a year’s worth of improved data,” Carlson wrote. “And then you have to turn all of that into something interpretable — something you can hold in your hand and make sense of, like ‘these are the 10 species we most need to sample.’ It’s a huge task, and it requires a lot of teamwork over multiple years — there’s a reason people haven’t really tried something at this scale before.”
Although scientists have not reached a consensus on the exact origin of SARS-CoV-2, there is evidence that the RaTG13 coronavirus, a bat coronavirus, had a 96% genetic similarity with SARS-CoV-2 and originated in bats. The PCoV_GX coronavirus, found in pangolins, also behaves similarly to SARS-Co-V-2. These findings suggest a high probability that the novel coronavirus also originated in bats or pangolins. 
Carlson, Albery and eight of their colleagues built their own individual analytical models in early 2020 by developing lists of priority sampling recommendations for potential reservoirs of different types of coronaviruses within bat species, according to Carlson.
The team discovered that models based on species’ characteristics work best in terms of predictability, according to Daniel Becker, a researcher from the biology department at the University of Oklahoma and one of the joint first authors of the paper.
“One of our main findings is that ‘trait-based models,’ those that use species characteristics to differentiate bats with betacoronaviruses from other bat species, perform much better than other model types,” Becker wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
In the future, the team plans to determine how this research will affect people in different parts of the world, according to Becker.
“This is really a first step, and follow up work is needed to figure out when and where those bats are more likely to be infectious, the interfaces where they have contact with domestic animals and humans, and how to balance preventative approaches to human health with bat conservation practices,” Becker wrote.

Students who tested positive for COVID-19 have expressed safety and transparency concerns over Georgetown University’s isolation protocols. 
While students who tested positive for COVID-19 in the fall 2021 semester isolated in the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center, this semester some students have been instructed to isolate in their on-campus residences. The change in procedure comes in anticipation of an expected surge in COVID-19 cases on campus due to the highly transmissible omicron variant, according to an email sent from Vice President and Chief Public Health Officer Ranit Mishori (MED ’02) to campus community members Jan. 5 
Students should expect to isolate two to a room in the hotel or in their on-campus residence hall, according to the email. Students who test positive for COVID-19 are contacted by COVID Care Navigators, who provide guidance and support for students based on public health guidelines from the DC Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  
After testing positive for COVID-19 on Jan. 11, Grayson Parisee (SFS ’24) said a COVID Care Navigator originally did not know where he would isolate, but ultimately told him to isolate for 10 days in his Village C West room because he had access to a private bathroom and because his roommate does not plan on returning to campus until his isolation period is over.  
“I got a call from a COVID Care Navigator and she basically said to stay put and that they would figure out whether I would be staying in my dorm or they would be moving me to isolation. My understanding is that people who have access to their own bathroom and are not sharing their living space, they’re having them stay in their residence,” Parisee said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Although the university has approximately 300 beds for isolation in the hotel, students who have access to private bathrooms and no roommates have been allowed to isolate in their rooms, according to a university spokesperson. 
Parisee also received instruction from the Care Navigators to pick up refrigerated meals from the Harbin Patio. The university began delivering meals to students in isolation Jan. 14, according to a university spokesperson. 
The university opted to use Harbin Patio as it was impossible to predict the number of students who would enter isolation upon arrival to campus, according to a university spokesperson. 
Parisee said he was left confused about whether or not students in isolation are obligated to alert fellow students living in the residence hall about their COVID-19 status. 
“I think some of the details are a little bit hard to get our heads around, you know what’s acceptable, what’s not, what’s expected, what’s not,” Parisee said. “Do I need to be putting gloves on to be going into the elevator, I don’t know. If somebody is standing in the elevator with me should I yell at them and say ‘Hey, I’m COVID positive,’ what does that look like?”
Students who test positive for COVID-19 are sent an email with what to expect during their isolation period, according to the spokesperson. 
“The email includes an intranet site with detailed information and contact information, including who to contact about food and resources to support the emotional wellness of students,” the spokesperson wrote. 
Delays in test results have also posed logistical issues for students; Maddie Morgan (NHS ’24) said she received a positive test result on Jan. 14, but did not hear from a COVID Care Navigator until the next day. 
“It was like the next day but my test was a rapid test late Saturday night and then I just submitted it through GU360 and literally heard nothing the next day and it was noon so then I had to email the covidcarenavigator email thing and it was only after I did that that someone called me and told me to isolate,” Morgan wrote to The Hoya.  
Elizabeth Smith (COL ’24), who tested positive for COVID on Jan. 11, said COVID Care Navigators contacted her within two hours of her positive test.  
“I would say that overall I had a pretty quick process,” Smith said in an interview with The Hoya. “The Care Navigator I think got back to me within two hours of me submitting a positive test even before my PCR came back.” 
Due to a surge of cases on campuses because of the omicron variant and delays in student responses to Care Navigator’s messages, there may be longer wait times between responses, according to the spokesperson. 
The university must work to improve the clarity of COVID-19 policies, according to Parisee.  
“Dorm buildings that have individual bathrooms makes it very likely that people will be isolating in their dorms so I think it is important that people know and that the university shares that that’s the guidance so people can make a decision of whether they want to be in their dorms right now or not,” Parisee said. 
This article was updated on Jan. 21 to correct a passage which incorrectly stated the Harbin Patio space dedicated for meal pick ups was shared with the general public.

January 20, 2022 by Katie Hawkinson 2 Comments 
In the wake of an antitrust lawsuit, questions about progress on GU272, and the COVID-19 pandemic, Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) sat down with The Hoya on Jan. 13 to discuss his thoughts on the current state of the university. 
This is the first time The Hoya has been granted a conversation with DeGioia since August 2019. 
Financial Aid Lawsuit
On Jan. 9, five individuals filed a class action lawsuit against 16 top universities — including Georgetown — alleging antitrust violations, price fixing and illegal collusion between the schools that may have resulted in admission disadvantages for students who require financial aid. The suit alleges that at least nine of the schools — including Georgetown — are not abiding by need-blind policies by favoring wealthy applicants.
Georgetown’s financial aid program has been need-blind since its launch in 1978, according to DeGioia. 
“When we launched the program in 1978, it cost us $2 million that year to meet the full need of our student body, and this year $135 million was put into this program,” DeGioia said. “It’s enabling us to ensure that roughly the 40% of our student body that requires need-based aid receive it. Forty percent are receiving $135 million of financial aid.”
When asked what he would do to rebuild trust with students who receive financial aid in light of the suit, DeGioia responded that he hoped students would presume trust in the institution.
“I just hope that what they have experienced here will be a reservoir that will enable them to presume trust,” DeGioia said.
GU272
In December 2021, descendants of the GU272 — the collective name for the 314 enslaved people sold by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus in 1838 to financially sustain the university —  hosted an event with members of Georgetown University Students Association titled “Georgetown F*cking Lied,” demanding that the university pay reparations to descendants. 
In 2019, the student body voted to pass the GU272 referendum,which called for the addition of a $27.20 semesterly fee to student bills for allocation to descendants of the GU272. Instead of reparations, the university announced a $400,000 reconciliation fund in 2019, designed to support projects that benefit the descendant community. 
In December 2021, the university told The Hoya that funds had been set aside for a spring 2022 launch of the reconciliation fund. DeGioia reaffirmed to The Hoya that funding would be distributed sometime this spring.
“And hopefully, you won’t have to ask me a question like this ever again,” DeGioia said. “Because I think we should be launched this spring.”
These funds will support projects focused on memory and reconciliation designed by a working group the university is currently forming. The $400,000 fund will become an annual investment towards projects that focus on memory and reconciliation, according to DeGioia. 
“The effort will be to ensure that we can actually distribute funds during this coming spring. We are also putting in place the new annual fund initiative that will ensure we can restore that money every year,” DeGioia said. “Every year we will be investing $400,000 in projects that will be identified by this kind of oversight group or working group. We’re in the process of putting that group together.”
According to DeGioia, the university was waiting to implement the fund until the Descendants Truth & Reconciliation Foundation, a separate entity from the university that works to support racial healing and fund educational opportunities for descendants, launched in March 2021.
Waiting for the foundation — as well as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic — caused the university to delay the launch of the $400,000 fund, DeGioia said.
“We didn’t feel it was appropriate to get ahead of the foundation. With our work, we didn’t want to create confusion in the larger communities,” he said. “I regret that it took us longer than I would have hoped because we made the commitment to do all this in November of 2019.”
COVID-19 Protocols 
With the rise of the omicron variant, Georgetown plans to hold classes virtually through Jan. 30. Students, meanwhile, can move into on-campus residence halls, and public spaces like Lauinger Library are still open with limited capacity. No university buildings permit indoor dining, including Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall, which is now grab-and-go. 
The university reported 342 positive COVID-19 cases among community members Jan. 9-15. These numbers resulted in a weekly positivity rate of 6.49%, a 5.83 percentage point decrease from the week of Jan. 2. 
Despite these restrictions, DeGioia said he was optimistic about returning to in-person classes by the end of January.
“We are still operating in a pandemic, and perhaps the most complex moment in the pandemic. I think we’re going to need to manage our commitments with even more care, and attention,” DeGioia said. “We want to bring everybody back into the classroom on January 31.”

Washington, D.C. public, charter and private schools must now provide free period products in women’s and gender-neutral bathrooms.
During the D.C. Council’s first legislative session of 2022 on Jan. 4, councilmembers unanimously passed the Expanding Student Access to Period Products Act of 2021. The bill will require period products to be made available in women’s and gender-neutral bathrooms in all middle, high and post-secondary schools across the District, as well as in at least one bathroom in elementary schools. 
Schools that do not have a gender-neutral bathroom must provide period products in at least one men’s bathroom. In addition, the legislation includes a provision requiring the D.C. State Office of the Superintendent of Schools to establish comprehensive menstrual health education standards for middle and high school District students. 
Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto (LAW ’17) introduced the legislation in March 2021. Pinto had secured funding in the D.C. Council’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget to allow the legislation to go into effect this fiscal year. 
Access to period products is directly tied to educational success, mental health and physical health, according to Pinto.
“When students don’t have access to the period products they need, they miss school, fall behind their peers, and are more likely to experience depression and anxiety,” Pinto wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “This is particularly concerning right now as the number of mental health crises experienced by teenage girls has skyrocketed during the pandemic.” 
H*yas for Choice (HFC), a Georgetown led pro-abortion student group, collaborated with advocacy groups such as Planned Parenthood to ensure the bill was considered by the D.C. Council, according to HFC President Chloe Kekedjian (COL ’22).
“We worked with the local Planned Parenthood to help gather signatures to petition the city council to hold a hearing on the bill,” Kekedjian wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is meaningful because menstrual equity is a serious problem, and can be an impediment to people’s learning when they cannot access menstrual products.”
In the past, students have raised concerns about the lack of access to menstruation products on Georgetown’s campus. Out of 43 academic buildings on campus only 15 have menstrual products available, according to a 2019 HFC received from the Office of Planning and Facilities Management. A survey that HFC distributed in 2019 found that 95.6% of Georgetown undergraduate students believed the university has a responsibility to provide period products on campus.
The bill will ensure Georgetown University provides period products to nonbinary and transgender students, according to Kekedjian.
“This bill is great because now Georgetown has a legal commitment to provide menstrual products to students, especially to nonbinary and trans students,” Kekedjian wrote. “Georgetown administration was much less enthusiastic about meeting the menstruation needs of those students and now they will have to.”
The passage of the bill will have a major positive impact on the experience of menstruating students in the District and aid in combating the stigma around menstruation, according to Sophie Axelrod, a high school senior at Georgetown Day School.
“While on my period, carrying tampons to the bathroom is always a hassle, and I have to strategically hide one in my sleeve or put in my pocket without others looking,” Axelrod wrote in a message to The Hoya. “It is annoying how I feel the need to hide the fact that I am on my period.”
Access to period products as compared to access to products like contraceptives is a double standard, according to Axelrod.
“Why should we (as female-bodied individuals) have to pay for these products when we cannot control our bodily functions?” Axelrod wrote. “In other public places (other than high schools), condoms are usually free for male-bodied people, while women have to pay for pads and tampons in bathrooms.”
Federal food assistance programs do not cover period products, disproportionately affecting low-income residents, according to Pinto. Furthermore, period poverty disproportionately impacts Black and Brown girls and women in the District, Pinto said. 
Many D.C. high school students advocated for the legislation to the Council at a hearing, according to Pinto. 
“The Council heard from several high school students including several high school boys who spoke about not being taught about menstruation in sexual education,” Pinto wrote. “Instead, they had to learn about it through their female peers. When they came to understand that period poverty was preventing their friends from attending class, they leapt into action and testified before the Council about the need for providing free period products in school bathrooms and comprehensive menstrual education for all students.”
Pinto said student advocacy efforts were key to the passage of this bill, as students helped to refute arguments that this issue should not be a priority during the pandemic.
“I hope this process has shown students that their voices are powerful!” Pinto wrote. “Their advocacy can lead to policy change and help to combat the dangerous stigma around menstruation.”

Patrons must show proof of vaccination at many public indoor establishments in Washington, D.C., including restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venues. 
The vaccine mandate went into effect Jan. 15 in an attempt to decrease the transmission of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 as cases reach record highs in the District. Patrons who are 12 years old and older must provide proof of at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and those who are 18 years old and older must also show a valid photo identification before entering establishments. Beginning Feb. 15, full vaccination, not including booster shots, will be required. 
Retail establishments, grocery stores, houses of worship and health care facilities are among the locations where patrons do not have to show proof of vaccination. 
About 68% of District residents are fully vaccinated and 89% of District residents are at least partially vaccinated, making them eligible to be indoors in vaccine-restricted public spaces. 
José Espinal, marketing coordinator at El Centro, a popular Mexican restaurant in the Georgetown neighborhood, hopes that the vaccine mandate will ultimately increase business by making customers feel safer in public spaces.
“I think most businesses will be able to adapt to the mandate,” Espinal wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think a lot of patrons were similarly concerned about rising cases, so I think this will alleviate some of their concerns about going out.”
Venues that serve alcohol and violate the vaccine mandate will face two warnings from the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration, with third and fourth violations resulting in $1,000 and $2,000 fines. A fifth violation of the vaccination mandate will result in establishments facing the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration, leading to the possible suspension of their liquor license.
The Big Board, a bar located in the H Street Corridor neighborhood, became the first establishment in the District to receive a verbal warning for not requiring proof of vaccination or posting appropriate signage. The bar came under scrutiny for a tweet last week stating that everyone is welcome despite the mandate. 
Communication to patrons in advance of the vaccine mandate’s implementation made the transition easy and safe for entertainment venues, according to Jordan Silberman, general manager of Capital One Arena. 
“We had a great system in place to comply with the Mayor Bowser’s vaccination mandate,” Silberman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We proactively messaged to our guests about the new policy, instituted the use of the CLEAR Health Pass App (which we had previously used for some concerts last year), and had knowledgeable staff who were able to help fans quickly and safely into the arena.”
Individuals can show proof of vaccination with an official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccination card, a digital photo of their vaccination card or a COVID-19 vaccination app, such as CLEAR. Individuals with medical or religious exemptions must bring proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken in the past 24 hours.
According to Zayan Baig (NHS ’25), who lives in the Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area and visits the Georgetown neighborhood frequently even when not on campus, the vaccine mandate will help students feel comfortable when they leave campus, where the student vaccination rate is 98% and booster shots are required.
“Even though we are in the greater D.C. area, I have some comfort knowing that within our Georgetown bubble, most everyone on campus is vaccinated and that should contribute to a little bit of herd immunity, at least on the campus level,” Baig said in an interview with The Hoya. “I personally have no problem with having to show vaccine cards, I think it helps with feeling a little bit safer.”
The vaccine mandate should help keep employees, patrons and District residents safer, according to Espinal. “There is always some challenge with new regulations, but our team has been so great at adapting to all the ups and downs of the past two years,” Espinal wrote. “I’m confident that they’ll be able to adapt to this change as well. Hopefully, this new change will help push DC’s vaccination rate up.”

Georgetown University faculty and administrators anticipate that a new Korean major will be approved and available to students by the fall 2022 semester. 
Members of the department of East Asian languages and cultures in the College at Georgetown University began developing the Korean major in early 2021 as part of an ongoing effort to strengthen Korean studies and East Asian studies as a whole, according to Philip Ivanhoe, chair of the department of East Asian languages and cultures. This addition is reflective of growing student interest in the language as Korea becomes an increasingly important political, economic and cultural player globally.
For Ivanhoe — who said that implementing the major was one of his top priorities while chair of the department — the addition of a Korean major is part of an ongoing movement to strengthen Korean studies and East Asian studies at Georgetown. 
“The cultures and societies of East Asia are among the oldest, culturally richest, and strategically most important on earth and Georgetown needs to make a concerted effort to bolster and support teaching and research in this area,” Ivanhoe wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
New major program proposals must go through budget reviews by the Provost and Main Campus Finance Office before being submitted to the board of directors for approval. The Korean major has been approved by the curriculum committee and the executive committee and is now awaiting confirmation from the board of trustees, Ivanhoe said. 
If approved, the Korean major will follow a similar structure to other language majors offered at Georgetown and will include grammar, writing, reading and speaking, as well as topics of culture and literature in the curriculum. The Korean major will expand upon the existing Korean minor and will include a study abroad requirement, as well as classes in advanced Korean language, business and current affairs.  
For Autumn Andrews (COL ’25) — who originally planned to minor in Korean — the addition of the major will open up more opportunities to deeply explore the language and culture. 
“I have been learning Korean for 4 years now so it would be nice to major in a language I am interested in. I also knew that deep in my heart, I did not want to settle for a Korean minor,” Andrews wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The increased popularity of Korean classes demonstrates student support for a Korean major, according to Victor Cha, vice dean for faculty and graduate affairs. 
“There’s a real demand for it. We see this in our Korean language classes, which are at full capacity,” Cha said in an interview with The Hoya. “They had to add new sections because so many students want to take Korean. And it’s not just heritage students. It’s not just Korean Americans or Korean Canadians. There’s a demand for Korea because it’s in all different aspects of people’s lives.”
Cha had five students in his first Korean language class 26 years ago, but 40 students were interested in his course titled “Korea and the World” last semester; meanwhile, the department added a second section of Intensive First Level Korean I — the first class students take when starting to learn Korean — due to increased student interest. 
In recent years, the number of undergraduate and graduate students taking Korean classes increased by 44.7% in the United States, according to the Modern Language Association. 
According to Andrews, the Korean major will likely be popular among students as a result of the increasing prevalence of Korean pop culture in the United States. 
“Within the last decade, there has been a tremendous influx of international interest in Korean culture called the ‘Hallyu Wave’ or the ‘Korean wave,’” Andrews wrote. “Some examples of the Hallyu wave are the success of Korean media reaching international audiences through cinema, kdramas (Korean dramas) and KPOP (Korean pop music).”
“Parasite,” a Korean film that not only won four Oscars in 2020 but also became the first foreign language film to win Best Picture, and the international success of BTS, a Korean band, demonstrate how Korean pop culture is reaching the United States. 
The addition of the Korean major will not only improve language learning at the university but will also be incorporated into other disciplines beyond the department of East Asian languages and cultures (EALC), making for a more dynamic education as a whole, according to Min Koo Choi, Korean language coordinator and professor. .     
“EALC faculty members as well as those teaching Korea-related subjects in other departments and schools here at Georgetown University have all been supportive of a Korean major,” Choi wrote in an email to The Hoya. “A Korean major will enhance the academic curriculum here at Georgetown, where we want to encourage and nourish global and multicultural perspectives in teaching and research.”
Korea’s geopolitical location and rising tensions in the region also make the Korean language a popular course of study for students in the School of Foreign Service, the government major or international business, Choi said.
The courses within the Korean major will combine language classes with other liberal arts classes about Korea-related topics, according to Andrew Sobanet, vice dean of faculty at the College. 
“There are some very exciting offerings on Buddhism, Confucianism, gender and sexuality, film and literature, and current events and business,” Sobanet wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Bryanna Penn (COL ’24), who hopes to switch from minoring in Korean to majoring in Korean when it becomes available, is looking forward to the opportunity to complement Korean language skills with other facets of Korean studies.
“Learning the language is a given, but beyond that I really hope to learn about and engage with Korean culture by delving into courses of history, literature, philosophy, and media through this major,” Penn wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Penn, who always hoped to pursue Korean studies in college, said the new major opens exciting new doors for academic exploration. 
“Georgetown was the school I really wanted to be at even though there wasn’t a Korean major so compromises were made, but it is beyond exciting to think I will actually be able to fulfill that initial desire in the end,” Penn wrote.

Rev. Michael Rozier, S.J., assistant professor of health management and policy at Saint Louis University, will serve as a visiting Jesuit chair this semester in the department of health systems administration at the School of Nursing & Health Studies (NHS).
Rozier will be the first visiting Jesuit chair of the NHS, a position that aims to develop and advance the department’s degree offerings. As part of this role, Rozier will instruct a semester-long class in the health care management and policy program titled “Delivering Care Across the Continuum.” The class will explore questions of where and how health care in the United States is delivered, who pays for it, how health care quality is measured and the political aspects of policy reform. Rozier will also deliver the annual NHS Values Based Lecture, where NHS faculty reflect on their work through the school’s core values. 
Rozier said the opportunity to collaborate with members of the Georgetown community and conduct research in Washington, D.C., attracted him to the position.
“It’s a great opportunity to be in a great university for a semester and to teach really talented students, to meet colleagues across the university with whom I might continue my research and to be in Washington, D.C., for somebody like myself who studies health policy,” Rozier said in an interview with The Hoya.
His course, which is intended primarily for sophomore students, will cover the basics of health care delivery in the United States, according to Rozier. 
“We’ll be looking at all of those questions through the lens of patients, their family and friends who care for them and the physicians, nurses, therapists and other caregivers who encounter them,” Rozier said. “The goal is to consider the health care system through the lens of the people at its center.”
Having received a Ph.D. in health management and policy from the University of Michigan and a Master’s degree in Divinity from Boston College, Rozier’s work has centered on the intersection between ethics and public health policy, a combination of interests that contributed to his hiring, according to Rev. Mark Bosco, S.J., vice president for mission and ministry.
“Fr. Rozier is a young, vibrant Jesuit scholar and an outstanding addition to Georgetown as the Visiting Jesuit Chair this spring semester. He brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise on health ethics and public policy,” Bosco wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The renewed focus on health inequity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the NHS’ selection of Rozier as its Jesuit chair, according to Christopher King, chair of the department of health systems administration.
“Numerous events over the past few years have reminded us of the relationship between injustice and health. Moreover, COVID and its implications are testing the bandwidth of our healthcare infrastructure,” King wrote in an email to The Hoya. “At a time of so much uncertainty, these circumstances make this an ideal moment for a Jesuit Chair in the Department of Health Systems Administration.”
The World Health Organization has warned that rolling out COVID-19 booster shots in developed nations while vulnerable populations in developing nations struggle to receive their first dose could prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Rozier said his Values Based Lecture titled “Health Systems and Human Dignity: Moral Imagination as a Tool For Reform,” which will cover the necessity of technical solutions and the consideration of moral questions in managing health systems, has been framed with the challenges posed by the pandemic. 
“One of the things that I hope that it does in the long term is that it gives us a greater sense of solidarity, that we see that my health is not just about me or my close connections alone. My health and everyone else’s health is impacted by people who are towns, states and countries away,” Rozier said.
As a Jesuit, Rozier’s said religious vocation has informed his people-first approach to teaching and researching health care management and policy.
“In our Jesuit formation, we work alongside communities that are marginalized. I’ve worked throughout Latin America. I’ve worked with people experiencing homelessness. I’ve worked with asylum seekers,” Rozier said. “And it’s been being with those people as they try to access the health care system and to get the kind of care that they desperately need and finding that there are often too many barriers.”

The Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees (GAGE) launched a survey of its members to gather feedback about priorities for the union’s second contract, which they can begin negotiating with the administration this fall.
GAGE negotiated its first contract with the university in May 2020, which established better policies for teaching remotely and will expire in June 2023. The 2021-22 bargaining survey includes questions for GAGE members about their income and living expenses, resources available to them in the workplace, health benefits, safety and inclusivity, diversity of graduate student workers, and personal priorities.
The survey is one of the first ways in which GAGE hopes to obtain members’ opinions and desires when negotiating a new contract, according to Dominick Cooper (GRD ’24), vice president of GAGE.
“Our bargaining survey is the first step towards achieving a contract that best addresses the needs and priorities of our diverse membership,” Cooper wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our upcoming contract campaign, like our first one, is above all a collective and democratic effort driven by many GAGE members. This effort begins by gaining an understanding of what all of us care about, and how we want to see our work lives within the Georgetown community continue to improve.”
The survey will provide the GAGE bargaining committee with data on its members’ priorities for the upcoming contract, according to Jewel Tomasula (GRD ’22), chair of the GAGE bargaining research committee.
“Our bargaining survey includes an issues ranking section that will help GAGE members form consensus on our priorities for our second contract,” Tomasula wrote in an email to The Hoya. “From our organizing conversations, one thing we already know is that grad workers are experiencing financial stress from the inflation surge and costly emergencies brought on by the pandemic. We’ve also learned that we need to make explicit in our contract our right to have a voice in health, safety, and other matters that impact grad workers.”
The university, GAGE and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) will collaborate during negotiations, according to a university spokesperson.
“We are looking forward to working together with GAGE-AFT on this process,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
While the negotiation process cannot begin until fall 2022, the bargaining survey is an essential step in ensuring its members’ objectives are represented, according to Cooper.
“The survey is a way for GAGE members to connect with one another and talk about how our work lives are collectively going and how they can be improved,” Cooper wrote. “This takes lots of organizing amongst GAGE members, and the conversations we have with one another now will form the bedrock of our contract campaign during the 22-23 academic year.”
Graduate student workers must ensure that their new contract maintains the same protections amid the changes in learning and teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Cooper.
“The COVID-19 Pandemic, unsurprisingly, has changed a lot of the ways in which we think about safety and well-being in the workplace, as well the ways in which our current stipends, employment policies (especially those of hourly workers and international grad workers), and health care plans are still falling short in some ways to meet the needs of our membership,” Cooper wrote.
In September 2020, GAGE entered into the arbitration process with the university, alleging that the university violated their contract by refusing to continue negotiating about Georgetown’s fall reopening policies. In January 2021, after the arbitrator ruled that the university failed to bargain in good faith with GAGE about policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the two parties were required to return to negotiations about issues including health services subscriptions and COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Ultimately, student workers were guaranteed equipment for remote teaching and face masks, among other COVID-19 protections and resources.
The COVID-19 related side agreements, the result of the negotiations following the arbitration process, allowed GAGE to advocate for and expand its protections under the contract, according to Cooper.
“The side agreement that GAGE members won during the pandemic last year helped to fix some of these problems, and we are learning from these lessons as we look to implement them permanently and on a bigger scale in our next contract,” Cooper wrote.
GAGE hopes to improve the graduate student worker experience at Georgetown by advocating for its second contract, according to Tomasula.
“Our first contract was a huge step forward in making graduate work at Georgetown more accessible and inclusive because we won significant pay raises, new benefits like dental insurance, and more equitable policies,” Tomasula wrote. “But the reality is that Georgetown still has room for improvement, and we’re excited for another opportunity to make conditions better for graduate student workers here.”
