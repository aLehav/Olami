The Georgetown Department of Athletics has received $5 million, its largest gift ever, from Edward (COL ’66) and Irene Shaw.
Four million dollars will be used for the construction of the Intercollegiate Athletic Center, a facility for student-athletes that was originally proposed as part of the 2000 Campus Plan. The building is expected to cost about $55 million in total.
The remaining $1 million of the Shaws’ gift is marked toward improving Kehoe Field, which will be renamed Shaw Field in honor of the couple’s contribution and support of men’s and women’s soccer teams.
Edward Shaw expressed his belief in the importance of Georgetown athletics.
“Irene and I have always been firm believers in the value of intercollegiate athletics to gather our community, build school spirit and enhance the undergraduate experience —not only the team members but also for their classmates and friends,” Shaw told Georgetown Athletics. “Our commitment reinforces this belief, along with the value of nationally competitive programs to enhance Georgetown University for now and years to come.”

Top government official Lisa Brown will become Georgetown’s new vice president and general counsel in March, according to a university press release.
“I’m incredibly excited about coming to Georgetown,” Brown said in the press release. “Educating and preparing students to contribute in a global world and to actively work to make society better for those less fortunate is very appealing and is at the heart of Georgetown’s mission.”
Currently, Brown is the acting chief performance officer at the Office of Management and Budget and was previously an assistant to the president as well as staff secretary for President Obama.
During President Bill Clinton’s (SFS ’68) administration, she worked for four years as a deputy counsel and counsel to Vice President Al Gore.
Brown was also a partner at the law firm Shea and Gardner and executive director of American Constitution Society for Law and Policy.
According to the release, Brown will be on an executive management team that will address the campus master plan, globalization and the role of technology.
“Lisa Brown is a longtime public servant whose experience in the private sector and at the highest levels of the federal government will be an exceptional asset to our university,” President John J. DeGioia said in the press release.

More than 10 years after his first lecture in the United States, held in the same location, Afghan President Hamid Karzai visited Georgetown this evening to talk about the future of Afghanistan’s relationship with the United States.
In his talk, “Afghanistan Beyond 2014: A Perspective on Afghan–U.S. Relations”, held in Gaston Hall,Karzai acknowledged that expectations had not been met on either side of the partnership but expressed confidence that peace and stability are assured in Afghanistan’s future.
The Afghan president, who met with President Obama earlier today for what the White House called bilateral meetings, also announced an expansion of his country’s relationship with the United States in a bilateral security agreement. This new dynamic entails the reduction of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, a limitation in the use of these same troops after 2014, the continuation of U.S. training efforts and the transition of the control of security and border protection into Afghan hands.
Karzai, who holds an honorary doctorate degree from Georgetown, began his speech by commenting on the progress made so far on the goals undertaken by the United States and Afghanistan in 2001, which included freeing the world of terrorism, removing the Taliban from power and establishing a democracy in Afghanistan. According to Karzai, the partnership was successful in freeing Afghanistan from the control of the Taliban. He particularly credited the return of women to the workplace and classrooms as well as the growth of technology in the country as examples of this progress. However, the two nations have made less advancement in other areas.
“The second part — freeing us all from terrorism and radicalism — didn’t work as smoothly as we expected,” Karzai said.
In that vein, Karzai noted the complaints of both Americans and Afghanis, saying that the war on terror has been costly to both the U.S. and Afghan people. Despite that, he believes that Afghanistan is moving in the right direction as it approaches its third set of presidential elections and the reduction ofU.S. operations in its territory.
Karzai particularly expressed confidence in a more mature relationship between the United States and Afghanistan and the future success of a peace process that will retain the elements of social progress made since the Taliban’s fall. Going forward, Afghanis on a local level advocate the continuation of U.S. support but also U.S. acknowledgment of their sovereignty as a nation.
“We will forget the less than pleasant aspects of our relationship, and we will move forward in the gratitude of the [Unites States],” Karzai said.
After speaking for less than 20 minutes, Karzai ended his talk with a revised version of the end of Robert Frost’s poem “Stopping by the Wood on a Snowy Evening.”
“The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep and miles to go before we sleep,” he concluded.
After the lecture, the floor opened to five student questions, one taken from an open poll on Facebook and four drafted by Georgetown student groups. These included the International Relations Club, the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association, the Muslim Students Association and the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, which helped organize the event. Students posed queries about the threat of Al Qaeda, Afghanistan’s unemployment problem for former fighters on both sides of the civil war, the government’s plans for education policy and the hope that Karzai can offer against claims of corruption and worries about the nation’s security. The president responded vaguely to each of the questions, stating that Al Qaeda is no longer a security issue and that the government will continue to be concerned with the education of women.
Through both his lecture and question answers, Karzai attempted to diminish concerns about the stability and future of Afghanistan as a nation and its relationship with the United States.
“The hope has already been offered in Afghanistan,” he said.
