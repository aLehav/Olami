During the Image Panel of the OWN IT Summit, CBS This Morning Co-Anchor Norah O’Donnell, Washington Post Political Correspondent and Pulitzer Prize-Winning Journalist Mary Jordan and New Yorker Cartoonist Liza Donnelly came together to discuss issues of gender stereotypes, confidence and self-evaluation that impact women’s progress.
Each speaker shared her daily routine to begin the discussion. O’Donnell impressed the audience with her intense daily schedule: She wakes up at four in the morning, attends numerous meetings and production sessions during the day and sometimes works late into night. This is accomplished alongside her efforts to raise three young children and fulfill household duties. However, despite this workload, O’Donnell still very much enjoys her work as a journalist.
“Being a journalist is one of the most exciting careers in the world because you get the front-most seat to history,” O’Donnell said.
Despite having only minimal ideas about her future path when she entered Georgetown as a freshman in 1991, O’Donnell used her time in college to explore different activities and to build up her confidence.
“Confidence is key — the feeling that ‘I can actually do it.’ And, to have confidence, women need to develop an expertise in a subject. You might not know where your expertise is, so I sampled a lot of different careers,” she said.
Jordan and Donnelly echoed O’Donnell’s call for strong confidence in women.
“The confidence issue matters; just go for it, put yourself out there. It’s all about the strength in you to keep going,” Jordan said.
All panelists agreed that discovering one’s true passion is an important step in defining career goals.
Donnelly mentioned that she became aware of her love for drawing cartoons when she realized that she could easily spend hours on a cartoon and still remain engaged.
“You need to listen to your time and find what is the thing that will help you lose track of time,” Donnelly said. “I just lose myself when I’m drawing cartoons.”
O’Donnell also stressed the importance of hard work.
“When I just started, I was working alongside very experienced producers. The way to make up for this is to work harder than anybody else,” O’Donnell said. “Until this day, I still use highlighters with newspapers.”
Three panelists also talked about their approaches to dealing with stress and unexpected obstacles.
“I almost quit in the 1980s, but then I met my husband — also my partner — who encouraged me to continue with my career,” Donnelly said.
“I think everyone needs to build a support system around you, a support network with people who care about you and look out for you,” O’Donnell said. “My husband and I, we try to be each other’s greatest champion.”
Carmen Rollins (COL ’16) said she found the talk inspirational and helpful since it was applicable to women of all ages.
“They were talking about the struggles that they have had, and it’s great that they are openly sharing it with everyone here,” Rollins said. “Speaking up is really useful here because it does go a long way to help people make themselves heard. It’s sometimes scary to make that first step, so it’s great to hear that other women are doing the same.”
Amy Zhang (SFS ’18) said that the discussion prompted her to think more deeply about her goals in life.
“It’s good to hear what these women leaders have been through and what they learn from their journeys, and that kind of inspire me to think more about myself and what I can do to really focus on my journey, and what next step I can take to get where I want to be,” Zhang said.

Technology leaders discussed the evolving landscape of technology and emphasized the importance of social impact to innovation during the Innovation Panel of the OWN IT Summit.
The panel, which was held in Gaston Hall and came in the middle of the summit, featured 2013 Thiel Fellow and The CRATED Co-Founder Madison Maxey, eBay Chief Marketing Officer Richelle Parham and Anthea Watson Strong, a member of Google’s Civic Innovation Team. Re/code Executive Editor Kara Swisher moderated the discussion.
Swisher began the panel by asking each of the speakers to define “innovation.” All three noted the importance of making a social impact in their definitions, while Maxey particularly touched on finding new uses for existing technologies.
“We’re finding things that often exist with new combinations that are mutually productive,” Maxey said. “I think innovation these days is finding ways to use your passions to think about how we can impact our daily lives.”
Parham explained that innovation is forward-looking.
“It’s how you think about today and how you think about the future and bringing those things closer together,” Parham said.
Noting that innovation disrupts the status quo by changing the world and challenging the public to keep up, Swisher explored the different applications of technology used by the various sectors in which the women work.
Although Strong acknowledged the slow pace of change in public policy, she explained that technology can be a powerful tool to involve the public in policymaking.
“[In public policy,] you don’t have to be the ones coming up with the best ideas or the brightest. You just have to take what is the best and the brightest and apply it in creative ways,” Strong said. “One of the things the Internet could do is reduce the cost of voting. … Reducing the cost of being able to make an informed decision. There are civic decisions that are happening every day … and the data for that is very complicated. How can we pull that out and service it in a way that people can participate how they want to?”
Maxey, a fashion designer and expert in wearable technology, noted that when wearable gadgets become more flexible and ubiquitous, they can allow users to access information even more easily.
“How do we make something that isn’t visible give you exactly what you need?” Maxey said. “It shouldn’t be hard to call someone.”
Parham said shopping is headed toward increasing digitization and added that this online shopping can be more personalized as well.
Following the panel was a question-and-answer session in which students brought up gender and racial disparities in the technology industry.
“It’s an absolute challenge. I think that every company in Silicon Valley has a responsibility to create some change here,” Parham said. “When you have diversity of race, of gender, of all of these things, you actually create better products. We can’t just make products for white guys. We need an environment where people feel welcomed and all ideas are brought to the surface.”

CEO Angela Rye and editor Julie Zeilinger discussed the themes of identity and experience as female leaders at a panel moderated by history professor Marcia Chatelain. The discussion took place in Gaston Hall Saturday afternoon as part of this year’s OWN IT Summit.
Zeilinger, a staff writer for mic.com and the editor of thefbomb.org, a feminist blog she founded when she was just 16, called for the term “feminist” to be unpacked and freed from some of its negative stereotypes.
“I stand by that word, and I stand by the movement. It’s a huge part of my life,” Zeilinger said. “I stand by that word, but I wish there was some more space.”
As an editor, Zeilinger said that she hopes to act as a voice for underrepresented women, using the Internet as a forum to display those otherwise unheard voices.
“I receive submissions from so many young women, all over the world, all over the country, from so many different backgrounds, and I’ve always sort of seen myself as a conduit of those experiences. It’s never been my blog or about me personally,” Zeilinger said.
Rye, a political contributor as well as the director of IMPACT Strategies, a government relations and political consulting firm, said that she hopes to provide a voice and perspective that would be relatable to women. She cited one instance in which a woman came to her and told her that she felt Rye’s voice was representative.
“There’s nothing better than that moment when you know that someone who has not had … that access feels like they can relate to something that I’m saying,” Rye said.
Zeilinger, who focuses on women in social media, addressed the online harassment that women face when posting their opinions online.
“The online space is so gendered, especially when it comes to harassment. And, I think that women on Twitter face this harassment not because of the content they’re putting out there, but because they have opinions in general,” Zeilinger said. “It’s just sort of this systemic issue of wanting to push back on women who are sort of pushing against that passive gender role.”
Drawing on her own experiences, she stressed that women should not take this sort of negative commentary personally.
“You have to sort of divorce that commentary from your ultimate mission,” Zeilinger said.
Rye concluded the event with a call for women and other marginalized groups to demand equality.
“Here we are now, women, 51 percent of the demographic in this country, and still don’t have what we deserve. Imagine what we could do if we teamed up with people of color, disabled people, LGBTQ people,” Rye said. “We would kill it, in a good way, in a very OWN IT way.”

In the final event of Saturday’s OWN It Summit, a panel of women in technology, non-profit and service work discussed impactful action and how to measure its success.
Head of Global External Affairs for Airbnb Courtney O’Donnell moderated the discussion, which featured United States Chief Technology Officer and former Vice President of GoogleX Megan Smith, Dosomething.org Chief Operating Officer Aria Finger, and Malala Fund Co-founder Shiza Shahid.
O’Donnell started off the panel discussion by asking the speakers to share their personal motivations.
Shahid recounted her experience growing up in post 9-11 Pakistan. Having witnessed suicide attacks within less than a mile’s radius, she devoted herself to advocating for social justice in the developing world.
“[I] try to understand how to bridge the resources and mentorship network that exists here to really empower people in the developing world, leaders, innovators, entrepreneurs to bring change in their community,”Shahid said.
Smith said that she is constantly motivated to improve the U.S.’s technology.
“If we are the country that makes Amazon, Facebook and Twitter and all these amazing things, why should our websites be not good?” Smith said.
Finger described how the use of text messaging enhanced her organization’s communications with young community leaders. She said that connecting with young people interested in making changes in their communities motivates her to work every day.
“We used to be all about the elite people at the top of the pyramid who are creating non-profits or doing incredible things and I actually thought that we are leaving folks out,” Finger said. “There are a lot of young people who couldn’t access anything.”
Relating lessons from her careers, Shahid suggested searching for both passions and strength.
“It’s knowing what draws you and also what you are good at,” Shahid said. “That’s a life-long process of reflection.”
Smith also emphasized that passion is necessary for success and urged students to be open to all different topics and models.
“There are so many people in the world,” Smith said. “If you feel obligated to do something, that’s probably not the reason to do it. You should do it because you are invested in it. … It may not be that you have a specific idea, it may be that you hear an idea.”
Finger said that each young person should pinpoint something that they excel at and constantly work to improve that skill.
“Know what you are not good at and know what you are good at,” Finger said. “It’s way better to be really, really good at what you are good at. And those are the people who can be really successful.”
O’Donnell also asked the panelists about their hopes for the future.
Smith said she hopes that technology can help reduce poverty rates as the world enters the digital age.
“If we do collaborate between science and technology and Internet and network ourselves to discover solutions that already someone has, we really will get to the point where poverty is something in the museum,” Smith said.
Finger said she sees hope in the younger generations, and is encouraged by their passion and drive.
“The next generation is what makes me hopeful,” Finger said. “You talked to old people. They are not excited. They are not idealistic. They are not thinking about the right thing. Then I see 13,000 internship applications in the summer for our summer internship program.”
The panelists then participated in a question-and-answer session and discussed cultivating self-awareness and entrepreneurship in STEM education, among other topics. Capri Starks (GRD ’16) said that she was inspired by the impactful women on the panel and their discussion of politics and socio-economic issues.
“I absolutely loved it,” Starks said. “Especially because it’s the first group that is about politics and socio-economic issues. That really speaks to one core and also the fact that STEM jobs are really lacking especially in this country. To see women so empowered in those industries and driving those industries like Megan was fabulous.”

Actress in the Netflix original series Orange is the New Black Danielle Brooks spoke in the Imagination Interview at the OWN It Summit in Gaston Hall Saturday morning. Co-Executive Editor of Re/Code Kara Swisher moderated the panel.
Brooks spoke about the role of Orange is the New Black in shifting the way women are depicted on television.
“Everyone’s story is valid and finally people saw themselves represented on television, whether that’s being of color, age, transgender, whatever your religious take is,” Brooks said. “You saw your mom, you saw your aunt, you saw yourself in these characters. … We were telling true stories.”
Brooks became emotional while speaking about the support of her mother, who was in the crowd.
“My mother was a huge influence on where I am,” Brooks said. “It was my mom who was like ‘You have a talent here is a door and we are going to open it.’”
Brooks began acting in church plays as a child, and at the age of 17, she auditioned for and earned a spot at The Juilliard School.
“You have to have drive, you have to want it. You have to just go for your dream,” Brooks said.
Brooks has just finished filming season three of Orange is the New Black, which will be released on Netflix June 12. However, Brooks is not yet sure what her future holds.
“I want to do my own thing and I don’t know what it is yet,” Brooks said. “More than winning awards, which are dreams of mine, don’t get me wrong, but more than that I feel like the main goal is to inspire people to follow their own path and their dreams, and that’s really what I want to do.”
Brooks reflected on the relation between herself and her character, Taystee, as well as how the audience relates to the other characters on the show.
“Taystee, she’s really trying to find herself,” Brooks said. “To stay true to who I am is something I’m learning from her, and I think every character you play should give you a gift.”
The women on Orange is the New Black are criminals, but Brooks understands why audiences find their stories so compelling.
“We’re all flawed. We might not have all been to prison and done things like that but we are all capable of it,” Brooks said. “A lot of these women are operating out of a place of love that they did these things.”
When asked about how being a woman of color has impacted her career, Brooks spoke about the pressure she feels and the way she wants to inspire people.
“I feel like there is not too many people that look like me on television: dark skin, natural hair, that’s a size ‘mm,’” Brooks said. “I feel this pressure sometimes of being perfect, but I’m not. … All I can do is be the best I can be and hope that it influences someone to be the best that they can be and that people see me and they want to follow their dreams.”
Jerrod MacFarlane (SFS ’15) was impressed with Brooks’ honesty.
“I thought her perspective on a myriad of issues was really interesting just because she was so aware of her place in the world and how her body, being a black large woman, informs how people see her and how that informs the struggles she’s dealt with,” MacFarlane said. “I just loved her frankness; I love when people can be open and vulnerable to you.”
Michaela Lewis (COL ’18) was disturbed by Swisher’s questions that implied Brooks should compare herself to other women of color in the entertainment industry, specifically Kerry Washington and Viola Davis.
“[Danielle Brooks] talked very honestly and candidly about the experience of being a woman of color in an industry where there is a lot of privilege and where your race can get you places when you are of a majority” Lewis said. “I wondered why the interviewer had to liken Danielle Brooks to other black women in the entertainment industry. … Why we can’t have people who are of a certain demographic aspire to be like women of another demographic?”
