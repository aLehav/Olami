The 2010 midterm election rally held at the Democratic National Committee headquarters brought in hundreds of college students, including members of the Georgetown University College Democrats, on Sept. 16.
Over 20 GUCD members attended the event, where notable Democratic congressmen encouraged Democrats from all D.C. universities to support congressional campaigns.
The event was organized by the D.C. Federation of College Democrats, the DNC, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Speakers included DCCC Chairman Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), Vice Chairman of the DNC Rep. Mike Honda (Calif.), Rep. Tom Perriello (Va.), Rep. Frank Kratovil (Md.), Mitch Stewart, national director of Organizing for America, and Marlon Marshall, national field director of the DCCC.
The speakers, all senior members of the DCCC, encouraged the crowd to volunteer for Democratic candidates before the midterm elections, especially Van Hollen and Kratovil, who encouraged the college students to aid their campaigns in Maryland. The D.C. College Democrats also plan to motivate students to vote based on issues relevant to college students, such as health care and financial regulatory reform, according to a press release.
“The D.C. College Democrats are committed to ensuring that youth turnout is strong for this November’s election as we advocate for Democratic candidates who have and will continue to fight for the issues that matter most to college students,” Matt Fulton, president of D.C. College Democrats, said in his opening speech at the rally.
Despite the optimism at the meeting, Bryan Woll, president of GUCD, acknowledged that the Democrats will probably lose some seats this year.
“I think that the Democrats will certainly lose some seats in the House, as has been the trend each midterm election following a presidential election,” Woll said. “I think that we can hold on to control of the House. Democrats took control of the House, the Senate and the White House with commanding majorities and strong mandates for change.”
Despite the anti-incumbent atmosphere around the country, Woll said that believes voters will reward the Democrats for their legislative achievements.
“The Democrats have delivered on promises of health care reform, financial services reform and just social policies on issues like `don’t ask, don’t tell’ and the Arizona immigration law. Perhaps more importantly, the Democrats have the grassroots campaign structure to be victorious in November. The Democrats can and will turn out those citizens who need representation the most – new voters, young voters, low-income voters and minorities, among others.”

A Georgetown professor may be responsible for a major change in constitutional law.
Professor Randy Barnett, the Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory at the Law Center, and Virginia House Speaker Bill Howell (R) called for a “Repeal Amendment” to the Constitution in a co-written op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday.
The resolution would allow state legislatures to overturn congressional laws and regulations with a two-thirds majority vote from the states. If Congress wanted to re-enact a repealed law, it would be able to pass it again with a simple majority.
The amendment is an attempt to check federal power and return political authority to the states. Since the New Deal, Barnett said, federal courts have been increasingly lenient in their interpretations of constitutional congressional rights. As a result, Barnett said that the original balance of state and federal powers set forth in the Constitution has been compromised.
“A state repeal power provides a targeted way to reverse particular congressional acts and administrative regulations without relying on federal judges or permanently amending the text of the Constitution to correct a specific abuse,” Barnett and Howell wrote in the proposal.
If the resolution becomes an amendment, states would be able to repeal older federal laws and regulations. According to Barnett and Howell, however, a two-thirds majority would still be difficult to muster up, and only the most unpopular laws would fall prey to the measure.
“Other than potentially going after health care reform,” Barnett said, “I think this will primarily be used to deter future laws.”
This is not the first amendment put forward by Barnett. Last year, he penned “A Bill of Federalism,” a 10-amendment proposition published on Forbes.com that suggested, among other changes, amendments repealing the federal income tax and setting term limits for congressional representatives. The new Repeal Amendment is actually a revised version of Article Six of the “Bill of Federalism.” Barnett said that Virginia state legislators approached him on the amendment and have worked with him on drafting revisions.
According to Article Five of the Constitution, Congress is obligated to call an amendment convention upon application by two-thirds of the states. While the resolution could be enacted this way, Barnett said it is less likely than congressional approval.
“In 200 years of history, whenever we got close to an amendment convention, Congress acted first,” Barnett said.
According to Barnett, amendments conventions are disconcerting to federal leaders, who worry that they could become “runaway conventions,” or conventions that result in multiple amendments. Article Five has never been used to enact an amendment because officials often rush to pass the resolution before the states can convene.
The Repeal Amendment could be introduced to the Virginia legislation once representatives begin their new session in January. If so, leaders will then begin working on recruiting enough states to apply for a convention. A member of the House of Representatives has also volunteered to introduce the resolution in Congress, though Barnett said he does not think that the resolution will be passed easily.
“I expect that [the amendment] will be bounced around and die out in Congress until we have enough states for a convention,” Barnett said.
Though the Repeal Amendment reflects Tea Party ideologies in its attempt to check federal power, Barnett still expects the amendment to face its greatest opposition from leaders on the far right of the political spectrum. Conservative organizations like The John Birch Society and the Eagle Forum especially are adverse to state amendment conventions.
In a statement to THE HOYA, Eagle Forum leader Colleen Holmes outlined the group’s opposition to Barnett and Howell’s plan.
“Eagle Forum opposes the concept of the constitutional convention under any circumstances or for any reason. We think that the Constitution is good enough to be able to solve any problem we have without having to call a new convention,” Holmes said.
As for the amendment, Holmes said that the Eagle Forum would need to research more before making a statement on its content.
Either way, the Repeal Amendment still has a considerable distance to travel. Nevertheless, Barnett said he believes that it has the support to proceed. In a group blog by law professors, he alerted colleagues to the potential amendment.
“You may well be hearing about this in the future,” he wrote. “If you do, remember you heard it here first.”

Fifteen alumni and one recent Law Center graduate will venture to points around the globe in the next nine months after receiving the prestigious Fulbright award, according to a Sept. 15 university press release.
The Fulbright Program, which is sponsored by the U.S. government and run through the State Department, provides grants to teach or perform unique research abroad for one academic year.
The Office of University Fellowships at Georgetown, which helps to facilitate the application process for students, said interest in the competitive program is on the rise.
“We’ve had an increase in applications over the past few years, and I hope this continues to be a trend,” said Maryam Mohamed, associate director in the fellowship office.
Forty-eight candidates applied from the main campus and Medical Center for this year’s competition, up from 39 in 2009 and 42 in 2008. The 2011 application cycle is consistent with the trend, with an unofficial total of 57 applicants.
These figures have translated into Fulbright recipients, with 15 winners in 2009 and 18 in 2008. That’s up from nine in 2007 and just three the school produced in 2006.
ohamed believes students have been particularly successful at obtaining these grants because of the university’s strong programs in undergraduate research, extracurricular teaching opportunities that give students experience in a classroom setting, and the number of students who study abroad.
“One of the biggest misconceptions is that [the Fulbright program] is GPA-centric,” Mohamed said. She stressed that review committees are more concerned with whether or not students have cultivated the skills necessary to carry out their project proposals or teaching assignments.
Emily Langer (COL ’06), one of this year’s winners, successfully demonstrated her abilities and level of experience. An Italian and English double major, Langer will set off for Trieste, Italy, next month to conduct research on the sole Nazi concentration camp that operated in the country.
Before receiving the grant, Langer had conducted research in Trieste as a Lisa J. Raines fellow as an undergraduate. She plans to use her time as a Fulbright scholar to conduct the research necessary to write a book in English about the history of the concentration camp and the city’s reaction to it, both past and present.
“I always knew I was fascinated by this place,” said Langer, who is taking a leave of absence from her position at The Washington Post to pursue the project.
According to its website, the Fulbright program aims to “increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries.”
Langer’s intention is similar. For her first experience in Trieste, locals welcomed her and shared their memories of World War II and the concentration camp that operated right outside their doors.
Patrick Dowd (SFS ’09), another recipient this year, is conducting research on a project he titled “Out with the Old, in with the New: Exploring India’s Emerging E-waste Landscapes.” E-waste, or discarded electronic and electrical equipment, is a distinctly modern phenomenon that is ballooning into a serious environmental concern, according to Dowd.
In conjunction with the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, Dowd’s project includes conducting research on the contemporary approach to the issue. He will work on developing a business plan that addresses all aspects of e-waste, from legal issues to environmental standards.
Dowd, who served as president of Georgetown University Student Association during the 2008-2009 term said he believes everyone should be paying close attention to this area of the world.
“India is a country that ought to be on every single Georgetown student’s radar,” Dowd said in an email. “I believe that India, in spite of the many challenges it faces, is destined to become one of the 21st century’s most influential leading nations.”
Other Fulbright scholars hailing from the Hilltop will spearhead a diverse array of research projects this year, from studying artistic groups in Germany to climate change in Africa to religion and national identity issues in Oman.
All of the projects delve in academic research, but the human element of this exchange program is not lost on the grant recipients.
“My priority is talking to and learning from the people of Trieste,” Langer said. “I hope I give them a chance to tell me something really important about their lives.”
Langer and Dowd are joined by 13 other main campus winners: Abed Bhuyan (SFS ’08), Laura Cocas (GRD ’11), Angela Crandall (SFS ’10), John D’Angola (MSB ’10), Grace Erdmann (COL ’10), Jay Gonzalez (COL ’09), Maria Iliakova (GRD ’10), Courtney Ivins (SFS ’10), Aakib Khaled (COL ’10), Jess Kuntz (SCS ’10), Moises Mendoza (SFS ’07),

The District may see an overhaul of Mayor Fenty’s approach to education reform following Vincent Gray’s primary election victory on Sept. 14. Gray’s election also signals less far-reaching changes for the Georgetown neighborhood, which voted for Fenty.
The close election resulted in Gray carrying the city 53 to 47 percent. He won in the majority of wards, most notably Wards 7 and 8, across the Anacostia River. Mayor Adrian Fenty won Ward 2, which includes Georgetown, by over 70 percent, according to The Washington Post.
Fenty’s platform focused on the successes of his term, namely the reforms to the D.C. public school system that led to D.C.’s selection by the Obama administration as a winner of education grant money from the Race to the Top contest. Many vocal proponents of education reform in the city felt that Fenty, with his hand-picked chancellor of D.C. public schools, Michelle Rhee, had drastically increased the quality of performance and the student experience in the District.
“Improvement was actually significant in every area, test scores, classrooms – every piece of DCPS operated more effectively,” Nathanial Roloff, program director for the university’s DC Reads program, said.
Roloff argued that Rhee is responsible for much of the success. He said she attracted qualified employees and grants to the school system but said that Fenty also deserved credit for his willingness to invest money and effort in educational reform.
After the Sept. 14 primary, however, the fate of both Rhee as chancellor and the reforms may be in jeopardy. Also in question are the futures of DCPS and DC Reads.
“A lot of the programming [for DC Reads] has been done by working with the DCPS under Rhee, which gave them access to the system in ways they didn’t expect through Outside the Classroom and vetting programs,” Roloff said.
“A lot depends on who Vincent Gray chooses as schools chancellor; if Rhee leaves and a strong leader doesn’t replace her, there is a lot of opportunity for faltering,” he added. (To read a separate, full-length interview with Roloff, see page A4.)
Gray has pledged plans for improving high school graduates’ access to higher education and their ability to enter the work force. His campaign literature points to statistics that show only one in 10 graduates of D.C. high schools completes college. According to his campaign website, Gray promises to double the number of high school guidance counselors and create more financial aid programs.
As D.C. Council president, one of Gray’s main achievements was the passage of the Pre-K Enhancement and Expansion Act of 2008, which focused on providing universal pre-kindergarten to 3 and 4 year olds by 2014.
Gray’s election will also have consequences for the Georgetown neighborhood. The primary issue relating to Georgetown that the candidates had sparred over was parking. Fenty extended parking meter hours to 10 p.m. throughout the city, including within Georgetown’s historic district, to increase revenue for the city. Gray has told voters he will return parking meter hours to their original times, from 7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
According to The Georgetown Metropolitan, Gray did not commit to any clear solution to the dearth of on-street parking in the Georgetown neighborhood. Both the majority of the community and Fenty supported the idea of performance parking, which would have added more parking meters on the streets of Georgetown. Currently, many street-side parking spots do not levy charges on drivers.
At a debate in Georgetown on Sept. 10, Gray said he did not fully support the idea of performance parking. Instead, he cited the importance of mass public transportation in creating more free space on the streets, according to The Georgetown Metropolitan.
Local groups such as the Citizens Association of Georgetown expressed concerns with the amount of parking spaces available. Gray addressed this matter and other neighborhood concerns, including the 2010 Campus Plan, at the debate. While Gray was well-informed on the details of the proposal, he said the ultimate decision was up to the D.C. Zoning Commission and that Georgetown must be accommodating to residents.

In an increasingly Internet-reliant world, the National Mall has jumped on the bandwagon by offering free Wi-Fi access to visitors. On Sept. 8, through a collaboration of federal, state and private institutions, D.C. residents began to enjoy wireless access in the city’s most renowned green space.
The project began in 2004 when Open Park Project, a D.C.-based nonprofit, installed a free Wi-Fi hotspot in front of the Supreme Court and the Library of Congress, the first outdoor wireless site in the city. Open Park expected that this location would be the first of many throughout the city, according to their website.
Earlier this month, D.C. city officials, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution, made Open Park’s goal a reality. Cisco and Level 3, two companies specializing in communications technologies, donated the network hardware and the Internet services, respectively, according to The Washington Times.
In a press release on the U.S. Department of Agriculture website, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack addressed the importance of this wireless installment on the Mall.
“The Internet is now integral to our everyday lives, and this free resource will provide USDA employees, guests and the visiting public another means of staying connected,” Vilsack said.
The recent installment of wireless adds to the growing number of Wi-Fi hotspots around the city. Volta Park Recreation Center, Eastern Market and the Smithsonian museums are among the 220 or so wireless hubs around the District.
D.C. is not the only major city to become more wireless-friendly. According to the BBC, London Mayor Boris Johnson pledged in May that every corner in the city would offer wireless access to residents and visitors, even suggesting that lampposts and bus stops would house the Wi-Fi access.
Other cities in the United States have also seen wireless availability rise. In 2005, Philadelphia launched a campaign to become the first city to offer city-wide wireless coverage. The plan was halted due to disproportionate funding and interest, but the city still offers a large variety of wireless hotspots for web surfers to use. The hotspots approach, a medium between a dearth of wireless and universal access, is a common practice in many other major U.S. metropolitan areas, including D.C.
Student reaction to the prospect of Internet on the Mall is positive. Sarah Mac Dougall (SFS ’13) believes the new wireless hotspots on the Mall will increase the attractiveness of the area for both tourists and residents, as well as for students such as herself.
“I enjoy studying on the Mall because of the general environment it provides, particularly on beautiful sunny days, so having wireless will make my own studying that much easier,” Mac Dougall said. “It will increase the appeal of the Mall to other D.C.-ers since it will be easy to get work done or use the Internet recreationally.”

Starting this fall, some of the apparel sold at the university bookstore carries a story with it: The employees of the manufacturers are paid a living wage and afforded worker benefits as part of an ambitious multinational experiment.
Georgetown is one of more than 300 university bookstores this year to sell products certified by the Workers Rights Consortium, the leading labor rights watchdog organization in the United States. The merchandise is crafted at a factory in Villa Alta Gracia in the Dominican Republic, where 120 employees earn nearly 3.5 times the minimum wage. The factory was established by Knights Apparel, the leading college apparel supplier in the country, as a test of the viability of social responsibility.
Workers at the factory are paid a living wage, which is calculated to provide the worker and up to two dependents with food, clothing, shelter, transportation and education, and to allow employees to pay off any debt they may have. Under the agreement, Alta Gracia workers are allowed to unionize and the factory is outfitted with bright lights and ergonomic chairs to improve working conditions.
“This represents a fundamental departure from anything that has been done before. . What Alta Gracia is doing goes far beyond the concept of fair trade,” said Scott Nova, executive director of the WRC.
The factory’s presence has also brought dramatic change to the surrounding town.
“[Villa Alta Gracia] is a small town where the main trade zone closed down several years ago and they were barely making it,” said Georgetown professor of International Business Economy John Kline, who wrote a report on the project and its viability.
“This represents for them a real hope. Just the wage differential allows for them to send their kids to school with the right clothes, to be able to feed them in a decent way, not to borrow money from their relatives or live with their parents,” Kline added. “The impact of it is something that you really have to see and experience.”
any detractors doubt that the Alta Gracia experiment can be profitable in the highly competitive garment industry. Companies are seen as engaged in a race to the bottom, in an effort to churn out clothing at the lowest costs, regardless of worker conditions. Alta Gracia’s supporters believe the manufacturer represents a viable business model, however.
“What Knights Apparel has really done is create a model factory that represents how apparel should be made and how workers should be treated,” Nova said.
Although the higher wages paid to workers means Alta Gracia’s production costs are much higher than the norm in the apparel industry, Alta Gracia products are sold to retailers at the same wholesale prices as other companies. This means that retailers can afford to sell the products at prices competitive with other brands. It also demonstrates that Alta Gracia and Knights Apparel are willing to accept lower profits in order to establish fairer labor standards.
“From a business standpoint, we believe that we have an obligation to try [to] use our business to try [to] do more than just what’s required of us in terms of corporate responsibilities,” Knights Apparel CEO Joseph Bozich said during a press conference call on Aug. 31.
Ultimately, the project’s success depends on whether or not shoppers are inspired by the concept of worker-friendly apparel. The project’s proponents do not believe this hurdle will deter buyers.
“Student-activists, including the activists at Georgetown, have done a tremendous job over many years convincing universities around the country of the need for change. As a result of all that work, there was great openness on the part of stores all over the country to carry this product,” Nova said.
In February of 2009, the university refused to renew its contract with Russell Athletic after the company shut down a factory in Honduras that had attempted to unionize. The decision was made two days after a student group called the Georgetown Solidarity Committee, working with United Students Against Sweatshops, a national organization, protested the corporation in Red Square.
Follett Higher Education Group, which manages the university bookstore, has been collaborating with Knights Apparel since the beginning of the project two years ago. Although only eight items sold in the bookstore this year will be from the Alta Gracia factory, it is a large launch for a vendor that has as small a production capacity as Alta Gracia.
“We’re hoping for success, but we’ll need to see what shopping behaviors look like,” Jim Kuhlman, director of the university bookstore, said in an email. “Today, more than 95 percent of the clothing vendors in Follett’s network are very active in this mission and are all members of the Fair Labor Association. Whether that carries clout with the purchasers, we’ll wait and see.”
Georgetown students and alumni are enthusiastic about the new apparel.
“Increasing the standards at which apparel is made [.] definitely exemplifies the philosophy of the school,” Elaine Evangelista (MSB ’03) said. “I would definitely buy something knowing it had been produced according to those standards.”
Many students also said that the university community should be made more aware of the project.
“It’s great for the bookstore, but I would never have noticed had I not been told. I think it’s something that a lot of students would respond positively to, but I think they need to advertise it better or no one will ever know,”
