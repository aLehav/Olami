Following an extended campaign spearheaded by student-athletes and the recommendations of the university’s Licensing Oversight Committee over the past few months, University President John J. DeGioia submitted a letter to Nike last week emphasizing the importance of Georgetown’s code of conduct and calling on the apparel producer to cooperate with the Worker Rights Consortium, an independent labor rights monitoring body.
Nike is the only university contract that does not currently stipulate that the licensee abide by the university’s code of conduct, which in addition to ethical, environmental and workers’ rights clauses, stipulates that licensees must comply with the university-affiliated independent auditor Workers Rights Consortium. The Workers Rights Consortium works to enforce the university’s code of conduct.
The recommendations, submitted by members of the LOC to DeGioia in late March 2016, focus on Nike signing on to the university’s code of conduct, and that Nike open up its factories to the WRC.
“These recommendations included revising Nike’s license agreement to include the current Code of Conduct for Georgetown University Licensees, and writing a letter to Nike requesting that Nike facilitate the WRC’s access to Nike contract factories producing collegiate apparel,” Director of Business Policy and Planning and LOC member Cal Watson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Neither the recommendations nor DeGioia’s letter have been released to the public.
The recommendations also stipulate that the university not renew its licensing agreement with Nike in its current form, which expires in 2017, and for the university to make public a description of the actions it takes on these recommendations.
The LOC’s recommendations and DeGioia’s decision follow months of awareness campaigns by students organized under Athletes and Advocates for Workers’ Rights as well as the ongoing work of the LOC, a multi-stakeholder body of faculty, administrators and students, into Georgetown’s contract and licensing agreements with the apparel brand.
According to AAWR lead organizer and LOC member Jake Maxmin (COL ’17) the timing of the recommendations and DeGioia’s letter, just as Nike’s contract with the university is about to expire, is critical.
“The big thing for us is for Nike to oblige by our code of conduct. The upcoming end date [of the contract in early 2017] has given us some leverage with them,” Maxmin said.
According to professor of government and LOC member John Kline, the LOC first realized the discrepancy between Nike’s contract and that of other licensees when it began looking into writing a letter to the company in November 2015 following Nike’s decision, after a series of worker strikes at their factories in Hansae, Vietnam, to bar WRC auditors from investigating the factories.
“We had been informed of Nike’s position regarding the Hansae factory in Vietnam. This is something the LOC would normally write a letter to the licensee about. As we looked into doing that we found out that Nike was not contractually obligated to follow the Georgetown code of conduct,” Kline said.
Georgetown has been a member of the WRC since its founding in 2000, when the university left the Fair Labor Association following the recommendations of the LOC and the organizing efforts of members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee. Nike subsequently sent a letter to university contract holders to explain its position on barring the WRC from entry into its factories.
“Their position is that they only work with ‘certified auditors’— their own auditors, the FLA or the International Labor Organization,” Kline said. “Nike’s next communication with universities listed their arguments and restated their policy and asked universities to respond.”
At the same time that the LOC began researching the university’s contract with Nike, student-athletes and other advocates began organizing their own campaign against Nike, following a justice and peace studies class taught by professor Eli McCarthy, which included watching activist Jim Keady’s documentary on Nike sweatshop abuses. Students in the class, including AAWR leader Isabelle Teare (COL ’17), subsequently organized an on-campus presentation with Keady.
“After I gave my lecture, I was approached by a handful of athletes who wanted to learn more and know what they could practically do to impact the lives of workers and use their position as student-athletes to be a voice for factory workers, most of whom are women their own age,” Keady said.
Student-athletes and allies began organizing soon after in collaboration with United Students Against Sweatshops, a national, student-led grassroots organization fighting for the labor rights of workers. In November 2015, AAWR submitted a letter to DeGioia urging the university to cut its ties with Nike. This was followed by student-athletes and AAWR members also taping over the Nike swoosh logo on their uniforms in a widespread social media campaign, as well meetings between AAWR organizers and university administrators, and awareness campaigns, including bringing former Nike garment worker Noi Supelai to campus in March to discuss her experience in the factories in Northern Thailand.
“They learned a lot in a short amount of time and they did it with an absolute passion,” Keady said. “The situation with Nike’s refusal to allow WRC auditors into its factories was timely and the students jumped on it and have effectively used Georgetown’s institutional power to leverage pressure on one of the largest corporations in the world.”
The AAWR has also received support on campus from the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor, which works to develop strategy to support workers, and university faculty members, 30 of whom signed a letter written by McCarthy and submitted to DeGioia in support of the AAWR’s efforts.
“What’s special about Georgetown is that faculty have been really important, which shows that this is really embedded within the Georgetown community, this commitment to independent monitoring,” USAS national organizer Morgan Currier said.
While GSC members have been in talks with the AAWR, they have thus far refrained from partnering with them, focusing instead on their ongoing Work With Dignity campaign in solidarity with campus workers. GSC member Lily Ryan (COL ’18) who also serves on the LOC, said she sees the AAWR campaign as complimentary to GSC’s work on campus.
“The point of the campaign has been focused on campus workers but looking at Georgetown’s supply chain is just as important. We can’t pretend to be a university that prides itself on social justice and transparency if we’re not aware of how our brand is being produced and really not be afraid to put pressure on companies when we feel they’re not ethically producing merchandise,” Ryan said.
Georgetown, like many universities, has a long and complex relationship with the sports apparel giant, possessing extensive licensing and sponsorship contracts. Not only do Georgetown varsity athletes compete in Nike apparel, but Georgetown has the largest contract in the country with Air Jordan, a Nike affiliate. Furthermore, former basketball coach John Thompson Jr. currently sits on Nike’s board of directors.
“Georgetown cares a lot about Nike, but we can only hope that universities are putting social justice and workers rights before profit and making that a standard of these contracts. [Universities] spend months negotiating the nitty gritty over branding, funding, who gets what. Human rights and workers’ rights should be one of those important criteria that they’re negotiating over,” Currier said.
Georgetown is one of several universities that have begun to take action on this issue. Student organizers at Virginia Polytechnic and State University, Cornell University, University of Washington and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, respectively, have all pressured university administrators to remove Nike from campus.
“This isn’t just a Georgetown fight,” Teare said.
The uniqueness of Georgetown’s campaign, Currier holds, lies in the power that Georgetown has a founding member of the WRC with administrators sitting on its board as well as being a movement led by athletes.
“The athlete aspect is very specific to Georgetown – these are the folks that are wearing these products and they didn’t want to be a walking billboard for a brand that doesn’t allow independent monitoring,” Currier said.
For now, members of the LOC and AAWR must wait for Nike’s response before pursuing further action, which, according to Klein, may stretch well into the summer.
“Before the end of the year, Nike’s contract will expire. I doubt the negotiation will occur between now and graduation but committee members around during summer will try to follow up. What happens beyond that will depend on whether or not Nike chooses to accept these contract stipulations,” Klein said. “It’s hard to conceive of how Georgetown athletic teams would continue to wear Nike gear if they don’t have the logo on the gear.”
Ryan echoed these sentiments, emphasizing the need for the university to continue to pressure Nike.
“Nike’s a big corporation and I think they have a lot of power. I’m not sure how much of a priority this is for them — we really need to put the pressure on them,” Ryan said.
In the case that Nike does agree to the stipulations set forth, McCarthy holds that there is still more work to be done particularly by the student activists raising awareness about these issues.
“If they do say ‘okay,’ great,” McCarthy said. “But the WRC isn’t the only issue with Nike — the wages, the restricted union, the treatment of workers. It will largely be up to the students who’ve been working on it as to what makes the most sense, what they have the energy for.”

Georgetown students and other activists demonstrated outside the White House on Monday evening in an effort to pressure President Barack Obama to negotiate freedom for journalist Austin Tice (SFS ’02), who disappeared in Syria in 2012.
Tice, a former Georgetown law student and Marine Corps veteran, went missing in Syria on Aug. 12, 2012, while working as a freelance journalist covering the conflict there for McClatchy Newspapers, The Washington Post, CBS and other media outlets. It is believed that Tice is currently being held captive in the Middle East.
Georgetown Law Center students and Reporters Without Borders representatives joined 10 undergraduate protestors who wore black blindfolds with the phrase “#FREEAUSTINTICE” and carried posters reading “President Obama, we are counting on you,” “Finish strong; bring Austin safely home” and “Without journalists, we are all deprived of information, we are all blindfolded.” The protestors asked Obama’s administration to make Tice’s release a priority before the president’s term ends.
The protestors also had a list of 23 additional student supporters who were unable to attend the rally.
The Georgetown undergraduate journalism program organized the Georgetown delegation with the help of director of the journalism program Barbara Feinman Todd and Emily Kaye (COL ’18) after the United Nations began Intra-Syrian peace talks on April 13 at U.N. headquarters in Geneva to resolve the ongoing conflict.
The protest and rally came after an April 6 event titled “Press Freedom Arrested” was hosted on campus as part of the Salim El-Lozi Lecture series during which Tice’s parents, former editors and activists spoke about the importance of ensuring press freedom abroad.
Kaye, who is a member of The Hoya’s editorial board, said the protest is the beginning of a push on campus to raise awareness among students and alumni to continue pressuring the U. S. Department of State to work for Tice’s release.
“This isn’t just the campaign today but really just the beginning of it, trying to galvanize the alumni base and the current student base to show the State Department and to show the White House that we’re really serious about this and we really want this to be a priority,” Kaye said.
Feinman Todd said the issue of press freedom goes beyond ensuring the return of captured journalists.
“I spend my days encouraging students to become journalists, to go out and find compelling storiesthat need to be told. The world has become increasingly dangerous for journalists. They now have a target on their backs,” Feinman Todd said. “If I am going to continue to encourage my students to become journalists then I have an obligation to care about Austin Tice and all the other journalists who have gone missing.”
U.S. Director of Reporters Without Borders Delphine Halgand said her organization joined the Tice family in raising awareness of the journalist’s captivity after the Islamic State group beheaded freelance reporter James Foley in August 2014.
“After the death of James Foley, they asked Reporters Without Borders to help them to raise awareness about their son, with the idea that maybe Americans didn’t know that there was still an American missing and alive in Syria,” Halgrand said. “So we started a big campaign, Free Austin Tice, with hundreds of U.S. media.”
Halgrand said her organization has assisted in connecting the Tice family to various government and media organizations.
“We have helped them in any way that we could, which means putting them in touch with journalists released from Syria, putting them in touch with our speaking media, advising them on communication, ways to deal with different governments, ambassadors and so on,” Halgrand said.
Katherine Leopold (COL ’18), who also attended the rally, said the demonstration served as a powerful symbol of Tice’s experience.
“I think that standing all together with blindfolds on in front of the White House with the signs and not really knowing what was going on around us was kind of powerful because we were letting our bodies be part of the message,” Leopold said.
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) highlighted Tice’s connection to Georgetown in bringing the risks of journalism closer to home.
“Whenever I used to read about journalists in the news or journalists getting kidnapped or when I saw the videos of people getting beheaded by [the Islamic State group], it seemed super far off and distant,” Goldstein said. “When you’re sitting in a journalism class talking about somebody who was in your seat two years before and who is now captured in Syria, it just makes it much more real because you can envision yourself or your peers in a similar situation.”

Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan advocated for better treatment of Syrian refugees and emphasized the gravity of the migrant crisis in a film screening for the award-winning documentary “Salam Neighbor” in Gaston Hall on Thursday.
Former United Nations Ambassador for Global Women’s Issues and Director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security Melanne Verveer hosted the event, which over 700 people attended.
Queen Rania and the Jordanian royal family have strong ties to Georgetown University. King Abdullah II (GRD ’89)graduated from the School of Foreign Service with an MSFS degree, and their son and daughter, Crown Prince Hussein (SFS ’16) and Princess Iman (SFS ’18) currently attend Georgetown.
After an introduction by former Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom and current CEO of the International Rescue Committee David Miliband, Queen Rania gave a short address before the 75-minute documentary tracking directors Zach Ingrasci and Chris Temple’s time in a Jordanian refugee camp.
Queen Rania praised the strength and kindness of the Jordanian people for helping the Syrian refugees.
“1.3 million of these men, women and children are living in Jordan today,” Queen Rania said. “The people of Jordan have opened their homes and their hearts. And I couldn’t be more proud of their selflessness, sacrifice and kindness.”
Queen Rania said the film helped humanize the refugees beyond their portrayal in the media and revealed their strengths.
“What you’ll see, as [Temple] and [Ingrasci] saw when they moved into Za’atari camp, is beyond the headlines, beyond the labels, are people that everyone can relate to,” Queen Rania said. “What I love about this film is the resilience it shows. For all the refugees have suffered, they have not abandoned hope. We see people who have nothing finding ways to share everything.”
The film depicted the four weeks that filmmakers Ingrasci and Temple spent living alongside Syrian refugees in the Za’atari refugee camp in northwest Jordan. The U.N. registered them in the camp and gave them an identical tent to the rest of the refugees. They are the first filmmakers to ever do this in a refugee camp.
Ingrasci said the project first began three years ago, while the pair was working on another film.
“Salam [a refugee] told us about what it means to be forced from your home and forced to restart your life in a new country,” Ingrasci said. “That story didn’t align with what we’re hearing in the news. Eight months later we ended up in a refugee camp.”
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Rescue Committee and Jordanian authorities coordinate to run the camp. Za’atari camp is the second largest refugee camp in the world, with almost 80,000 refugees.
The film showed Ingrasci and Temple quickly befriending refugees in the camp, spending hours playing games with and interviewing Syrian men, women and children inside their tents.
Among the individuals featured in the film was 10-year-old Raouf, who suffered a mental trauma after the filmmakers attempted to convince Raouf to attend class in the schools provided by Za’atari, since the boy had not attended school since leaving Syria. Ingrasci and Temple later learned from Raouf’s father that his school had been bombed in Syria. The film depicted Temple crying in a tent later.
Ingrasci said the work was emotionally challenging both during and after filming.
“The most difficult part of this entire journey was leaving and knowing they might be there for another 17 years; it was so tough to walk away from,” Ingrasci said. “You sit here in an amazing space like Gaston and of course the emotion you’re going to feel is guilt. And the cure to guilt is action.”
After the screening, Ingrasci, Temple, Darwaza and Mohab Khattab, a co-producer at 1001 Media co-producer, which seeks to builds a gateway between Hollywood and the Arab world, held a panel where Verveer led discussion before a question-and-answer session with the audience.
Queen Rania outlined steps to help rehabilitate the refugees into society and urged everyone to play a part in resolving the crisis.
“We must ensure children receive the education that their future and their country’s future depends on,” Queen Rania said. “It means creating economic goals to provide skills and training and jobs in order to kick start growth and recovery. The needs are great, so let us be great. We all have a role we can play.”
Temple said he hoped the film would change the general public’s mentality concerning refugees from short to long-term thinking.
“I think a lot of people, as we did before, think about refugee issues in the short term. You think immediately of the humanitarian needs — food, shelter, blankets, and that is enough,” Temple said. “But at what point does somebody need that opportunity to work again and have the right to rebuild his life and provide for his children?”
Temple said the EU-Turkey deal in effect March 20, in which Turkey has agreed to accept refugees from Europe in return for funds, does not treat migrants humanely.
“There’s been a lot of discussion about the EU-Turkey deal and actually the UNHCR has publicly not supported the deal,” Temple said. “I think if you really look into it there are a lot of challenges facing it, is it really treating people with the dignity they deserve? Treating people as human beings, not pawns to be traded.”
Zoe Nelson (COL ’19) said the film changed her perspective on the situation.
“I thought the film was amazingly done. The personal accounts gave me a whole new perspective and gave the tragic situation a personable side. Seeing first hand the devastating toll the war has taken by disrupting so many people’s lives really stuck with me,” Nelson said.

A report from the Georgetown Law Center’s Human Rights Institute outlines the obstacles that bar newly arrived children from Central America from accessing public education in the United States due to their undocumented status.
Published April 11, the report, titled “Ensuring Every Undocumented Student Succeeds: A Report on Access to Public Education for Undocumented Children,” was authored by nine law center students as part of a yearlong project in collaboration with the Women’s Refugee Commission, a nonprofit that seeks to improve the lives of women and youth displaced by conflict.
According to the study, an estimated 770,000 of the 2.4 million school-aged immigrant children nationwide are undocumented. Since 2014, more than 100,000 unaccompanied minors have immigrated to the United States.
According to the report, undocumented students — who are obligated to attend school through at least eighth grade according to federal law — are obstructed from receiving education by residency rules and states’ strict documentation requirements, standardized test-based school evaluations, inadequate translation services and the enforcement practices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Caroline Kurtz (LAW ’17), one of the report authors, said they decided to research the paths of undocumented students after they were released from immigration facilities.
“We knew that undocumented children were being released, so we decided to focus on what happens to them after they are released into these communities,” Kurtz said. “Are they able to receive the services they need? Are they being exploited for work? We decided to focus on education because we knew there was such a clear legal standard.”
The report specifically examined communities in Texas with long-standing immigrant populations, as well as those in North Carolina with a more recent immigrant community. As part of the yearlong process, the authors of the report travelled to both states to see firsthand how school districts accommodate, and fail to accommodate, undocumented students.
As its legal basis, the report discusses civil rights frameworks, including the implications of Supreme Court decisions such as Lau v. Nichols, which in 1974 expanded the rights of students with limited English proficiency, and Plyler v. Doe, which in 1982 struck down state laws denying educational funding for unauthorized immigrant students.
The report also highlights the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Opportunities Act of 1974, asserting that discrimination against undocumented students constitutes prejudice based on national origin.
According to Alexander Kramarczuk (LAW ’17), another author of the report, many of the emerging problems are rooted in poor communication between the federal and local governments concerning legal rights of undocumented children.
“There’s this fundamental disconnect once you get to the state and, especially, once you get to the local level,” Kramarczuk said. “Communication of that guidance from the federal level just isn’t happening so people are just unaware.”
The report cites the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was most recently reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015 expanding the federal government’s role in funding public education, to demonstrate that federal law mandates that municipalities allocate funds to programs aiding English-language learners.
D.C. Schools Project tutor Benjamin Sánchez (MSB ’19) noted that many undocumented students cannot speak English, much less maneuver the complex educational system in the United States.
“Most of these undocumented students don’t know how to speak English, they just got here,” Sánchez said. “In order to engage in the American education system, they have to be able to communicate with their educators.”
The report also states that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, which in January 2016 began targeting newly arrived women and children fleeing violence in Central America, have had a detrimental effect on the education of undocumented children. During the first weekend of 2016, over 100 individuals, mostly families with children, were taken into custody to be processed for deportation, according to the report.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization specializing in civil rights and public interest litigation, alleged in an article published Jan. 7 that ICE not only apprehended these individuals without warrants, but also forced them to sign documents they could not read, denied them counsel and took them into custody when they had not exhausted all legitimate legal options.
ICE declined The Hoya’s requests for comment.
The report claims that by engaging in widespread enforcement action, the agency has created an environment of fear that has left students distressed and unable to focus on their education. Though ICE members are not allowed to take people from school campuses into custody, they are allowed to monitor schools’ learning environments by collecting data and conducting site visits.
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights Freshmen Representative Rocío Reyes (SFS ’19) emphasized the apprehension families with undocumented members feel, which can hurt performance in school for the children.
“Essentially, if you have someone that is undocumented in your family, you just fear the point that [ICE] will get to that person,” Reyes said. “It adds fear, whether you are an undocumented child or whether you have undocumented parents. Regardless, you are unable to focus in school.”
Kurtz added that this fear can prevent many undocumented immigrants from completing routine day-to-day tasks.
“What we noticed is that there was this incredible fear that was spreading,” Kurtz said. “Even if there were no raids in a certain locality, people were petrified to leave their homes, to speak to a police officer if they needed help or to go to school.”
The report outlines a series of recommendations for providing equitable educational opportunities for undocumented children. It particularly emphasizes the need for adequate translation services, dissemination of legal information, use of performance metrics other than standardized testing in public school evaluations and reduction of ICE enforcement action.
Kramarczuk stressed the importance of ensuring access to education for undocumented students by improving channels of information between all levels of government.
“The biggest thing, at a base level, is communication between the federal government and lower levels of government,” Kramarczuk said. “It’s less that the law isn’t there, it’s that the communication isn’t there.”

Professor of economics George Akerlof, the winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in economics, emphasized the dangers of free markets for consumers and the importance of deregulation in the 2008 financial crisis in a discussion of his new book, “Phishing for Phools,” at the Carroll Round’s second Professor Speaker Series in the McGhee Library on Thursday.
According to Akerlof, “Phishing for Phools” contradicts conventional economic theory, as it argues that no one benefits from making others suffer only in equilibrium, which is difficult to achieve in reality.
“With completely free markets, there’s not only freedom to choose, there’s also the freedom to ‘phish,’” Akerlof said. “It will still be true that the equilibrium is Pareto-optimal, but it will be an equilibrium that is optimal not in terms of what we really want, but optimal instead in terms of our tastes. Standard economics ignores this difference because most economists assume that people know what they want.”
According to Akerlof, while free markets fulfill material desires and consumer tastes, they can also harm consumers by exploiting their psychological weaknesses. Specifically, markets take advantage of offering products related to four things: personal financial insecurity, financial and macroeconomic instability, ill health and bad government.
Under Akerlof’s theory, free markets only truly benefit consumers when there are no external incentives for businesses.
“Free markets only provide us what we want if we, human machines, make the right choices. If we have some weakness, that weakness will be targeted if there’s a profit to be made,” Akerlof said. “As a result, we have a phishing equilibrium, in which every chance for a profit more than the ordinary will be taken.”
Akerlof said these ideas are often ignored by economists.
“I believe that ‘Phishing for Phools’ is one of those holes in economics. Because all economists know it, it cannot be published, and because it cannot be published, it gets ignored,” Akerlof said. “Because it was ignored, we have the financial crisis and that’s the central event in the economic history of our time.”
According to Akerlof, the financial crisis was shaped by weak national policy.
“A wrong-minded U.S. national story about economics, which is that everything will be alright if the government steps out of the picture and we just let people be free to choose, has resulted in systematic bad policy,” Akerlof said.
The market in which businesses profit off the psychological desires of consumers fuels the present-day capitalist model.
“Life in a capitalist economy is a continual temptation,” Akerlof said. “Just walk down a city street. Shop windows are literally there to make you come in and buy. The idea of tempting consumers to buy is at the heart of capitalism.”
Akerlof said this conception of capitalism contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.
“‘Phishing for Phools’ gives us an extremely succinct explanation for what happened,” Akerlof said. “If I have a reputation for selling perfect avocados, I have an opportunity. I can sell you rotten avocados at the price you would pay for the perfect ripe ones. I will have mined my reputation but I also will have phished you for a fool.”
According to Akerlof, the reputations of big ratings agencies, such as Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s, had been built up for almost a century. Even though bonds and securities became more complex, and more challenging to rate accurately, the public continued to rely on the agencies’ ratings because of their prior reputation.
Akerlof said these inaccurate ratings — supported by stable reputations — led banks to borrow too much money using unstable securities as collateral.
“The value of the securities reflected by the ratings, enabled commercial banks, investment banks and hedge funds to borrow huge amounts of money. That borrowing was made with the rotten securities as collateral,” Akerlof said. “When the truth was discovered, what we saw from Frankfurt to New York to Reykjavik was that financial institutions owed much more than they owned. Without bailout, they were bankrupt.”
Carroll Round Programming Chair Duy May (SFS ’18) said the Carroll Round was pleased to host Akerlof in a more informal setting.
“Dr. George Akerlof is a thought leader in the field of economics and the Carroll Round is honored to host Dr. Akerlof again — this time in a more informal and intimate setting with the Georgetown community. With the presence of an engaging audience, the event went well as expected,” May wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Kelsey Harrison (SFS ’18), who attended the event, found Akerlof’s economic diagnosis to be thought-provoking.
“I thought it was especially interesting to hear about the narrative part, about the stories people tell in economics,” Harrison said.

There is a $1 billion chasm between the collective annual earnings of working women and their male counterparts in Washington, D.C., according to a new report published by D.C.-based nonprofit National Partnership for Women & Families on Equal Pay Day April 12.
According to the report, women employed full-time and year-round in the District earn an average of 90 cents to each man’s dollar, totaling an annual wage gap of $7,214. This aggregates to a $938 million loss for D.C. women every year.
The National Partnership estimated that without this wage gap, a woman in D.C. would be able to afford an average of five extra months of rent, 59 more weeks of food for her family or three additional months of mortgage or utility payments. Women serve as the primary breadwinners for 42,000 family households in the District.
“These women, their families, businesses and the economy suffer as a result,” the report reads. “Lost wages mean families have less money to save for the future or to spend on basic goods and services — spending that helps drive the economy.”
The report further found that this disparity persists across the educational and occupational spectrum. Women with doctoral degrees are paid less than men with master’s degrees, while women with master’s degrees are paid less than men with bachelor’s degrees.
The National Partnership attributed these factors to discrimination and bias still dogging working women who possess comparable educations and experiences to men.
“Statistical analysis shows that 62 percent of the wage gap can be attributed to occupational and industry differences; differences in experience and education; and factors such as race, region and unionization,” the report reads. “That leaves 38 percent of the gap unaccounted for, leading researchers to conclude that factors such as discrimination and unconscious bias continue to affect women’s wages.”
Nevertheless, Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce chief economist Nicole Smith said these figures may not paint the whole picture, citing majors that tend to attract more women and fewer higher paying jobs.
Smith claimed that gender influences choices in college major and occupation, causing women to opt for careers that often pay lower wages.
“If you look at all the doctors who tend to be women, female doctors prefer to be pediatricians and obstetricians much more than surgeons, who are the top-earners,” Smith said. “It doesn’t necessarily have to do with social constructs and influences early on in life — women seem to always prefer care-giving, social occupations.”
Worker Justice in D.C. Alternative Break Program leader Laura Fairman (SFS ’18), who also serves as GUSA Student Advocacy chair, highlighted the importance of addressing the wage gap, pointing to women’s pragmatism in making financial choices.
“Investing in women increases development and the economy substantially more than investing in men does, because if you invest in women, they will spend much more in investing in nutritious meals for their children, investing in their children’s education, putting away for college,” Fairman said. “Women are really pragmatic decision-makers financially, and they generally invest [more] directly in their children or community initiatives than men.”
The National Partnership’s data also indicated that women of color earn even less than their white peers, with Latina and black women earning on average a respective 50 and 56 cents to every white, non-Latino man’s dollar.
Georgetown’s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor research fellow Shalina Chatlani (SFS ’17) stressed that structural racism hinders wage parity for minority women.
“There are so many causal links, and unless there’s an overhaul on attitude in the US that completely rejects bigotry and racism, there will continue to be ways to push blacks and minorities to the edges of society,” Chatlani wrote in an email to The Hoya. “A lot of single mothers tend to be minorities – this means you can’t work full time, which means you get a lower wage job, and you can’t work as much. If you’re a young single mother, you can’t finish school, which leads to a low-wage job.”
Fellow Kalmanovitz scholar Pamela Escalante Gonzalez (SFS ’17) said changing attitudes rather than policies can bridge the wage gap, drawing on her experiences surveying workers about minimum wage policy.
“It’s unconstitutional and illegal to do all of these things, but policy doesn’t get people to care. Policy doesn’t get people to change the way they look at the issue,” Escalante said. “Policy will only go so far as the people who are supposed to be enforcing it will let it go. It takes people to get change.”
Escalante said with her approaching graduation, confronting the wage gap seems more pressing than ever.
“This is a fear that I definitely face graduating from this institution, knowing that my white, male peers are going to be paid more than I am for doing the same amount of work simply because they are more marketable than I am as an immigrant, as a Latina and as a gay Latina,” Escalante said.

Students have begun a petition to protest the administration’s repurposing of the townhouse at 3616 N St. NW, popularly known as Brown House, from student housing for administrative needs.
The “Save Brown House” petition, which over 500 students have signed, was implemented on Sunday through a Facebook event created by D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17), argues the repurposing of Brown House will negatively affect undergraduates and reflects a broader tendency of the university to act deceptively in its reassignment of townhouses.
Brown House will be used for the Office of the Provost, according to the Office of Residential Living.
“The administration is removing an integral part of the community and center of social life for students, while continuing to mislead and exclude student leaders in determining the future of townhouses,” the petition states.
Assistant Dean for Residential Living Stephanie Lynch said Brown House’s repurposing is typical of the university’s housing plan. Eighteen Magis Row townhouses on 36th Street were converted from upperclassman housing to administrative offices and faculty and graduate housing in 2013.
“Each year we reassess the use of residential spaces and felt it was important to repurpose this space in support of the university’s mission. We look forward to potentially bringing an additional faculty presence into the residential community,” Lynch wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Georgetown University Student Association Deputy Chief of Staff Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) said the repurposing raises questions about the university’s motives.
“But who’s in Brown House, which is an integral part of the community, a house on the only block that is all students, which makes it a lot easier to live and party and do things that normal college kids do,” Goldstein said. “I think that this issue raises serious questions about the intention of the administration.”
Goldstein said GUSA, which has been working with the administration to avoid townhouse conversions, was not informed of the change until he read it about it on The Hoya’s blog, The Fourth Edition.
“I read in The Hoya last week that the Brown House was being converted, so the decision really blindsided a lot of us in GUSA because we had been talking about this specific issue of townhouse conversions with administrators for months, and they never once mentioned that this was in the works, and then I read it in The Hoya,” Goldstein said.
Goldstein, who supports the petition, said he hopes the petition spurs greater engagement with the administration.
“I think many students are concerned about it, which is why we see this ‘Save Brown House’ petition, which I am in full support of, if not actually for saving Brown House, then for forcing the administration to come to the table with more clear answers and with more transparency on this issue,” Goldstein said.
Goldstein said the administration’s decision reflects instability in the campus plan negotiations.
“I am also concerned because I think the lack of transparency and the sudden way that this decision was announced are indicative of a larger tone of the master planning conversation of the last few months, specifically as it relates to housing,” Goldstein said.
Mara Goldman (SFS ’19) said repurposing Brown House would hurt student life and remove one of the best housing options for upperclassmen.
“I think that repurposing Brown House would remove an important aspect of the social scene on campus,” Goldman said.
Daniel Lysak (COL ’18) said he understood the importance of Brown House to students, but that students have to try to understand the reasons behind the university’s decision.
“On the one hand, Brown House has served as a wonderful center of social life at Georgetown. That being said, if we as students want to challenge the university, we must also understand their perspective,” Lysak said.
Hoya Staff Writer Patricja Okuniewska contributed reporting.

Can someone explain what the Brown House is? I graduated in 2011 and don’t think it was around then.

Concerned Alum says 
April 21, 2016 at 2:36 pm
It’s one of the houses on N St. across from Village B. It was definitely around when I attended from ’06-’10.

Brown house was around in 2011 and well before that. Large off campus house in Georgetown lottery

But it’s just… a house? It’s not like the Black House, which stood for something? (Is the Black House still around? I assumed it was converted along with all the other Magis Row houses.) I guess I just never knew this house as “The Brown House.”

Former Brown House Resident says

It’s by far the biggest University-owned townhouse. It houses 8 people and has a very large living room and backyard. It’s famous/infamous for throwing rowdy parties that a lot of freshmen go to during the early months of the year. It added to the party culture here (which was in an utterly sad state even with Brown House) and gave students a space to enjoy big parties while not having to worry about pissing off neighborhood residents, who don’t live close to Brown House.

Current student says 
April 22, 2016 at 11:57 am
Brown House is not “just…a house,” it is the pinnacle of the freshmen experience. It is the closest Georgetown comes to a party scene. Weekends are won or lost there. People find their first loves. It has a history ripe with grandeur and its closing is a travesty of monumental proportions.

Joe says 
May 4, 2016 at 5:44 pm
I was ’08, and I don’t remember Brown House at all — the big freshman year party scene was the Village A rooftops, is that not a thing anymore?

Eighty teams with over 1,000 participants raised over $138,000 at Georgetown’s annual Relay for Life fundraiser to benefit the American Cancer Society Friday, breaking 2015’s total of $133,000.
The theme of this year’s Relay for Life was “Cirque du Relay,” where the Relay committee sought to create a carnival atmosphere with games, dance classes, soccer matches and music from Georgetown student groups. A silent memory walk late in the night — the “Luminaria Ceremony” — encouraged students to reflect on how they and others have been touched by cancer, and included a performance by the Georgetown Phantoms.
According to event co-chair Emily Horne (COL ’18), the group’s fundraising has declined each year for the past five years, following the first Relay for Life event in 2007. Last year marked the first time in five years that the event raised more than the prior year’s event.
The Relay for Life Executive Committee, Georgetown Sigma Phi Epsilon, the American Cancer Society’s Can Extreme team, Fred’s Fighters and Georgetown Kappa Kappa Gamma raised the most money at the 2016 event. The Executive Committee raised $31,015.55 as of press time, followed by SigEp and the Can Extreme team at $28,268 and $9,383, respectively.
“It’s definitely been my favorite Relay at Georgetown but I also just think it’s been such a successful night after a year of planning,” Horne said.
Event co-chair Stephen Laufer (SFS ’16) said the event is consistently strong because of its ability to bring Georgetown students together.
“I think everyone in some sort of way is touched by cancer, and Relay for Life is a really great opportunity for people at Georgetown who normally wouldn’t attend the same events to come together for a common cause,” Laufer said. “It’s something that really unites and bonds people and provides support for one another.”
This year’s event featured many changes as a result of turnover within the Relay for Life executive board, after many members graduated. Laufer praised the underclassmen for pulling off the event.
“All of these sophomores and juniors who had never experienced what it was like to be on the executive team really stepped up to the plate to make this event happen.” Laufer said.
According to Horne, the tents and booths at the event were also rearranged on Cooper Field to make the event feel more intimate, with luminaries forming a border around field.
Alexander Zigerelli (MSB ’17), a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said he believes participation is especially important for Greek organizations given the reputation of Greek life nationally and its status as unrecognized at Georgetown.
“There’s a lot of negative stigma about fraternities and sororities because people think we only party but there’s so much more to the culture,” Zigerelli said. “There’s so much more we do in trying to help out the community in every way we can.”
SigEp’s Vice President of Philanthropy Christian DeRosa (COL ’17) said his fraternity comes together every year for Relay due to his chapter’s longstanding connection with the effects of cancer. SigEp captured second place for funds raised this year, and raised more than the Relay Executive Committee last year at $34,690, the first in the event’s history.
“It’s something that we can all kind of bond over. I mean, one of our founding brothers actually had testicular cancer his senior year when he graduated, and then went on to become a doctor, and he definitely still keeps us motivated on that front,” DeRosa said. “I think every single person in the fraternity has either a direct or indirect tie to cancer, and in the same way that at Relay itself people share stories, we do that internally as well.”
Stephen Tranchina (COL ’18), who participated in Relay as a member of Club Swimming, also stressed the importance of volunteering for a good cause.
“It’s a tradition we have because we like to get involved with campus outreach, and we all either have known someone or been affected by cancer in some way whether it’s a relative or a friend,” Tranchina said. “So it’s our way to give back and do something more than just swim.”

The Georgetown University Student Association senate passed a new campus redistricting proposal, which consolidates the amount of GUSA senate districts from 11 to seven and increases the total number of senators from 28 to 29, by a 24-0 vote Sunday.
The new districts, which take into account the opening of the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall, will represent geographical locations on campus instead of individual residence halls.
Henle Village and Northeast Triangle will be consolidated into the North Campus District, Alumni Square/Nevils, LXR and townhouses will be consolidated into the East Campus District, and Copley Hall, the Former Jesuit Residence and Village C East will be consolidated into Central Campus.
Vice Speaker of the senate Richie Mullaney (COL ’18) said the redistricting plan helps balance student-to-senator ratios and will hopefully foster increased student awareness and involvement.
“The plan keeps the student to senator ratio consistent across all districts,” Mullaney said. “We also strongly believe that by consolidating these districts, we make the districts simpler, which makes it easier to understand and makes GUSA more accessible to all of the students.”
Freshman North GUSA Senator William Morris (COL ‘19) said the need for redistricting arose from the addition of the new Northeast Triangle Residence Hall and the removal of the Georgetown University Hotel as a housing location.
“I think it is great. I think it accomplishes a lot of things. First of all, we need redistricting because there is going to be new dorm,” Morris said. “As of right now, we are actually phasing out the hotel and introducing the Northeast Triangle.”
In addition to accounting for the new dormitories, the redistricting plan also aims to increase student participation in GUSA senate races. According to Mullaney, no candidates formally ran for senate positions in some campus housing locations in past years, including the townhouses and LXR districts.
“By consolidating, residences halls into larger geographic districts, we hope to solve the problem where a district does not have a senate candidate,” Mullaney said.
Mullaney said the GUSA senate is normally charged with redistricting the senate districts every three years, but due to the changes in housing locations, a special redistricting session was held.
“Every three years, the senate is tasked with redistricting the GUSA districts for the senate elections. We have to do it more frequently more recently because of all the new residence halls that are going up,” Mullaney said.
The 24-0 vote surpassed the 5/6 majority required of the senate to approve of a redistricting proposal.
Former GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) said the GUSA redistricting plan is a great way to increase student participation on campus.
“I think reducing the number of districts is a great idea. I think it will do a lot to make GUSA more accessible to the average student,” Luther said.

An audit revealed significant safety defects, including malfunctioning brakes, on 95 percent of the 70 buses in the Washington, D.C. Circulator fleet, which transports five million riders per year.
The audit, released April 7, was conducted last August by the TRC, an independent transit consulting firm. It found 924 defects in total, averaging 22 per bus. The deficiencies identified included issues with safety equipment, broken headlights, malfunctioning brakes and low tire pressure.
According to the TRC’s standards, 120 of the total defects constituted serious problems that should have resulted in the buses being taken out of circulation for immediate repair.
The report attributed the problems to negligence by the District Department of Transportation, which owns the fleet, as well as by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which oversees the private contractor First Transit in operating the buses.
“The exceptionally high number of defects is an indication that First Transit, although proven highly capable at other transit locations, has fallen short in providing the DDOT fleet with adequate maintenance,” the audit reads. “Likewise, WMATA has not fully carried out its responsibilities.”
The TRC also criticized First Transit for failing to conduct the inspections and complete critical maintenance sooner, reporting that inspectors overseeing fleet maintenance were negligent in failing to look under buses, where multiple major defects could have been discovered.
“Virtually every transit agency understands that these replacements/rebuilds are needed at least once during the life of a transit bus,” the audit reads. “As such, First Transit should have anticipated this work.”
First Transit declined to comment to The Hoya, but company spokesman Jay Brock wrote in a statement to The Washington Post that the firm has worked since the audit was conducted in August to update the buses in the Circulator fleet. Brock cited the results of a second study completed in January, which were released April 8 following criticism stemming from the first audit. The second report found that 77 percent of the defects had been fixed.
“At the time of the audit, we were disappointed with results and the level of service was not what we expect of ourselves,” Brock wrote. “First Transit took immediate action and brought in an entirely new team to manage the operation. We also took action to fix the defects.”
However, the January audit found that each inspected bus still had as many as nine defects and that there was as shortage of vehicles that met the minimum safety requirements for service.
“[Thirty percent] of the total fleet of 67 buses was down for repair, leaving 47 buses available to meet a peak demand of 48 buses, which highlights the need for continued maintenance improvements,” the January audit reads. “Having 30 percent of the fleet down for repairs is unacceptable by any standard.”
The DDOT declined The Hoya’s requests for comment, but Department Director Leif Dormsjo defended his organization in a statement released April 8 which said that the department has implemented changes such as hiring more repair technicians and increasing the number of maintenance centers for buses.
“DDOT works with WMATA to ensure that any vehicles with safety defects are immediately pulled from service for repair,” Dormsjo wrote. “DDOT has seen substantial progress since our initial audit last August.”
Dormsjo said another audit will be conducted in May, stressing the organization’s commitment to safety.
“DDOT and WMATA will continue to use these audits as a tool to assess the condition of the fleet and ensure that all defects are identified and corrected as soon as possible,” Dormsjo wrote. “We have always emphasized to WMATA that safety is our first priority.”
Concurrently, First Transit is negotiating with drivers of the D.C. Circulator buses, who are represented by the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1764. The union is attempting to raise its members’ salaries from $18 an hour, claiming that low wages are increasing turnover among bus drivers that could lead to more safety problems.
In an interview with the DCist, Union trustee Sesil Rubain criticized the lack of response to the audit from both Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and the DDOT.
“If Mayor Bowser and DDOT do not act on this information now, we’re going to have another preventable transit disaster in a city that’s rightfully sick of them,” Rubain said. “It’s outrageous that as they shake their fists about WMATA’s failures, Mayor Bowser’s administration ignores the dangerous situation that they know they have on their hands.”
The union conducted separate safety checks on 29 buses in March and claimed to find issues that would require 90 percent of buses to be pulled from service. The union found almost half the buses inspected had brake defects that could seriously injure passengers.
Aditya Pande (SFS ’18), a frequent user of the D.C. Circulator, said he was initially troubled by the audit results, but due to the Circulator’s low cost of $1 per trip, convenience factor and recent safety improvements, he is still willing to provide them business.
“They do need more oversight, but I don’t think it would stop me from taking them,” Pande said. “That’s because of the convenience factor. They’re highly, highly convenient. I’d still take them despite the findings.”
Jared Horne (COL ’19), who uses the Circulator to commute to work at a downtown D.C. restaurant, highlighted the need to address safety issues within the fleet.
“As a taxpayer that constantly uses public transportation this is very disheartening,” Horne said. “If I’m running late for work, I need the buses to run, so this is something that needs to get fixed.”
Kotryna Jukneviciute (COL ’18) echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the role public transportation plays in the lives of students.
“That’s absolutely absurd,” Jukneviciute said. “Students rely on the Circulator in general for transportation around D.C. for internships and everything. It’s critical. We pay a lot for our tuition and we’re residents of D.C. so we would expect that transportation in D.C. would be reliable for professional purposes as well as recreational reasons.”

Republic of Korea Ambassador to the United States Ahn Ho-Young (GRD ’83) emphasized the strong relationship between South Korea and the United States and Korea’s growing role in the world economy at the keynote address of the Fifth Annual Walsh Exchange Conference at the Mortara Center on Friday.
The Walsh Exchange, hosted by the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, is dedicated to undergraduate research around international affairs taking place in Washington, D.C., and allows undergraduate students to showcase their work.
Ahn was appointed ambassador to the United States in May 2013 after previously serving as Korea’s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Ahn graduated from Seoul National University in 1979 with a degree in political science, and moved to Washington in 1981 to attend Georgetown University for his master’s.
“Important decisions are more conviction than science,” Ahn said. “When I was 16 or 17 years old I began to think that I wanted to do something meaningful in my life. I asked what career I would do and thought well, foreign service.”
Ahn cited four moments in the following 10 years of his life as having had a significant impact on his career: the fall of the Berlin Wall, the invasion of Kuwait, the South Korea-North Korean declaration on denuclearization in 1991 and the 1992 American presidential election.
“It was these three experiences I had as a young diplomat that provided a good basis from which I could become an ambassador,” Ahn said.
Ahn said his work shifted in focus from pure diplomacy to economics after the 2008 global financial crisis , where he saw an opportunity to make a difference for both Korea and the field of international economics as a whole.
“President Sarkozy came to the UN and said, ‘this financial crisis is unique. Previously they have been limited and contained—this is global,’”Ahn said. “I was listening to the speech and I thought maybe G7 would be too small, maybe we need something larger —opportunity for Korea!”
Ahn worked to get South Korea invited into the G20, an international forum for 20 major governments and central bank governors, in 1999. Korea was subsequently the first Asian country to host the G20 for its fifth meeting in 2010.
Khan said he has a deep appreciation for America’s values.
“Of course I love my country, but I deeply admire this country for many reasons,” Ahn said. “This is a powerful country with a marvelous economy… I also deeply admire America for your moral standards. I don’t think there has ever been a country in which the citizens hold the government to such high moral standards.”
Ahn said he expects relations between the United States and South Korea to continue to improve in the next five years.
“There is much cynicism and frustration about the situation and how it has been dealt with over the past 25 years,” Ahn said. “However, overall relations between Korea and America have been progressing positively over the past 60 years and should continue to do so.”
Ahn said Koreans in America will be important for the future of relations between the two nations.
“There are over 70,000 Korean students studying in America. This is proof of the friendship that Korea has built with the US and the confidence Korea has in its relationship with the US,” Ahn said.
Heitz Mathilde (COL ’17) said she came to see the ambassador speak because of her general interest in foreign relations.
“This is a great opportunity we have at Georgetown,” Mathilde said. “When you are a student and you see and listen to previous students like the ambassador, you can see concretely where you can go with your education.”

The Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service celebrated the addition of their first new ambulance in five years and commemorated the death of a Maryland first responder at a dedication ceremony on Healy Lawn on Sunday.
GERMS Unit 10 is the newest addition to the student-run emergency medical service organization.
The new ambulance, which was purchased from Bestco Auto Sales in 2015, features a new safety system that provides airbags and three-point seatbelts in the patient compartment. The upgrade also includes a more advanced siren system, greater interior room and a shock-absorbing system.
Former GERMS President Justin Gregg (NHS ’16) welcomed the audience and observed a moment of silence for John Ulmschneider, a 13-year veteran of Prince George’s County Fire/EMS Department in Maryland, who was killed by gunfire while attending an emergency call Friday night.
Founded in 1979, GERMS first began its operations using a golf cart, donated by the medical school. In 1982, GERMS was formally established as an undergraduate activity. Thirty-four GERMS members passed the District of Columbia EMT test in December 1982, and today GERMS has over 80 EMTs.
Former captain and current crew chief Ryan Jeffery (SFS ‘16) said GERMS has made a significant impact on the Georgetown community.
“GERMS commits itself wholly to providing the absolute best basic life support,” Jeffery said. “This dedication to excellence has saved countless lives in the Georgetown community and beyond over the past 44 years.”
In 1993, GERMS co-founded the National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Organization, which hosts more than 250 member organizations from around the world. Last year, GERMS responded to 894 calls for service and provided EMT service over the summer. It also provided standby service for the past four presidential inaugurations.
Director of Health Education Services and GERMS Faculty Advisor Carol Day congratulated the organization on its student-run autonomy.
“It’s been my pleasure to work closely with leadership and help problem-solve the kinds of unique challenges that sometimes arise,” Day said. “The people that I’ve come to know in GERMS are some of the finest individuals I’ve ever met and have had the pleasure to work with.”
Gregg said GERMS leadership saw the need for a new ambulance after the arrival of Unit 9 in February 2011. As Unit 8 increasingly required additional maintenance, GERMS submitted a proposal for the university to purchase a new ambulance in the 2013-2014 school year.

Rev. Salvador Jordan, S.J., then blessed the ambulance before GERMS members uncorked champagne on the vehicle.
Gregg said his time in GERMS is filled with team memories.
“Looking back on my time in GERMS, it is clear that there could never be one memory to summarize the experience,” Gregg said. “It is the dinner trips to Surfside with fellow crew members that get interrupted by emergency calls back on campus, the conversations at 4 a.m. that turn strangers into best friends, the leadership meetings that last three hours even though no one wants to be there for more than 20 minutes and that feeling you get when your patient smiles and says thank you when you safely deliver them to the emergency room.”
Current GERMS President Alexandra O’Kane (COL ’17) said the ambulance shows GERMS’ potential.
“The accomplishment of obtaining this ambulance represents the ambitious goals that GERMS is possible of achieving, keeping the successes of the past as well as the continued aspirations for the future in mind,” O’Kane said.
GERMS Director of Public Relations Eleanor Fanto (COL ’17), said the new ambulance is a promising sign of GERMS’ continued service in the future.
“To get this new ambulance is an important sign for the future of GERMS,” Fanto said. “It’s the sign that we’ll continue serving successfully for the next few years.”

A group of black female students will host the inaugural BRAVE Summit, which seeks to uplift black women in the community through panels and breakout sessions April 23.
According to the event’s website, the BRAVE Summit – which stands for black, resilient, artistic, vigilant, enough – aims to bring forward the uniqueness, individuality and greatness of black women and to strengthen the leadership skills of its attendants. The summit will also serve to foster student driven discourse to advance the conversation on equality of race and gender at Georgetown.
“BRAVE was pioneered by several Black women of Georgetown University for the purpose of combating the pervasive, negative media coverage and replacing it with the truth, our truth,” the Facebook page read.
The summit is cosponsored by Georgetown University Women of Color, the Georgetown Scholarship Program, the Justice and Peace program, Georgetown University Women in Leadership, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other campus organizations.
The summit will focus on four main themes: the arts, public service, social justice and the founding of various institutions. The event is being held in an effort to redefine the conversation in light of the recent media portrayals of police brutality and various acts of racism. 
The event was inspired by the book “All the Women are White, All the Blacks are Men: But Some of Us are Brave” by Gloria Hull, Patricia Bell-Scott and Barbara Smith.
According to the event’s website, GUWOC hopes the summit will eventually inspire a nationwide equivalent in the future.
The day long event will take place from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m, beginning with a panel titled “My Blackness, and Yours Too,” followed by another titled “Black Women in Executive Positions.”
These two panels will be followed by a breakout session in which participants will discuss religion in communities of color. 
A second breakout session will discuss generational feminism, women in the media and Georgetown women in administration and health disparities. A third panel will discuss the role of black women in public policy and service.
Collen Tlamsa (NHS ’18) said she would like to attend the summit and supported more events of this type in the future.
“I definitely would be willing to attend it,” Tlamsa said. “I think it is really great to have those types of events on campus.”
Grace Alburger (COL ’18) said she liked how the event seeks to create an environment that will open up a dialogue on race issues.
“I think it definitely help creates an open forum. I definitely am in support of more open conversation about the topics and empowering,” Alburger said.

Refusing housing to Washington, D.C. residents with criminal records constitutes discrimination, according to guidelines released by the Department of Housing and Urban Development on April 4.
The guidelines are based on the 1968 Fair Housing Act passed, which prohibits barring any individual from buying or renting a residence based on their race, religion, gender or national origin. The HUD’s new guidance states that citizens with criminal records are protected from housing discrimination under this law.
Under the guidelines, landlords must prove that any policy taking criminal records into consideration legitimately serves to protect resident safety or property. This includes reducing discriminatory generalizations by evaluating potential tenants or buyers on a case-by-case basis, taking into account what the conviction was and when it occurred.
At the National Low Income Housing Coalition Policy Forum on April 4, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro said having fair access to housing helps released felons reintegrate into society.
“Our nation can’t fulfill any of our major goals unless we also focus on housing,” Castro said. “We’re partnering with the Justice Department to invest nearly $2 million to help young public housing residents clear their criminal records, find work and have a better shot at succeeding once they rejoin their communities.”
According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the probability of a black male born in 2001 to be incarcerated is 32 percent, while Latino and white males have a 17 and 6 percent chance, respectively.
Castro stressed that this disproportionality continues after felons are released from prison.
“When landlords summarily refuse to rent to anyone who has an arrest record, they may effectively and disproportionately bar the door to millions of folks of color for no good reason at all,” Castro said. “It is wrong — and it has to end.”
Georgetown University Law Center professor Marc Howard, who leads the Prison Reform Project, which brings students to Jessup Correctional Institute to help inmates fill out paperwork, said current housing regulations unjustly hinder previously incarcerated individuals.
“It’s very hard to find housing, whether it’s public housing or private housing, and the sort of strike that landlords hold against them, while perhaps understandable, in some contexts overall is just way too generalized where anyone with a record for any type of offense is just automatically ruled out by the landlords,” Howard said. “It’s unfair for people who are starting anew and who have paid their debt to society.”
Alison Forger (COL ’18), a student participating in the Prison Reform Project, discussed the housing challenges faced by parolees during the reintegration process.
“We found housing as a huge part in a chain of events that caused a lot of problems for people on parole,” Forger said. “Not only can these people not live in public housing, they also cannot live with any other relative who’s been incarcerated.”
Mattie Haag (COL ’18), who travelled to New York City for an “Ethics of Criminal Justice” Alternative Breaks Program in March, said the impacts of incarceration are long lasting and can follow released felons throughout their lives.
“The scary thing is that the government is preventing people from getting reformed by the system,” Haag said. “It’s supposed to be designed that you do your time and you become reformed in some way, but it ends up affecting every single part of your life afterwards. You’re always going to be defined by that crime.”
