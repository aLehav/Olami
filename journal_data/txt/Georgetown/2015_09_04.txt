As the mourners settled back into the pews of Holy Trinity Church after receiving communion, 94 unseen voices rose in song. Heads turned toward the balcony, with slow smiles crossing the faces of the congregation upon recognition — the Chimes, active and alumni, singing “I’ll Fly Away,” had assembled to honor their Celestial Chime.
Rev. James P.M. Walsh, S.J., died July 1 at age 77, following a battle with myelofibrosis. His legacy is that of lyricism, through his music, his writings, his passions and his teachings.
A professor in the theology department, he received his doctoral training in Hebrew biblical studies at Harvard University, arriving at Georgetown in 1973. His academic work focused on social justice in the Old Testament, which formed the theme of his seminal work, “The Mighty From Their Thrones.”
At a university where many prominent figures have left indelible legacies, Walsh’s own was multifaceted, reverberating across his four decades and many yet to come, yet couched in his trademark humility and selflessness.
“At some of my most challenging moments, Jim was a gift to me, of friendship and love. … He was attuned to what was going on, he sought ways, he found ways to be a gift,” University President John J. DeGioia said at the July 8 memorial service. “What bound our relationship together is the understanding that God is our friend. God accepts us, knows us, loves us, and one can say the same about Jim.”
Unfaltering Imagination
Walsh, a native of Wilkes-Barre, Penn., was drawn to the priesthood from an early age, entering the Society of Jesus upon graduation from his Scranton high school.
“He wasn’t in any way a pious man — he was a deeply religious man, a man of great faith, but I think piety for him was not something that he would emulate, and I mean that as a compliment,” David Murphy (CAS ’73), who befriended Walsh as a Chimes alumnus, said.
Endowed with his Harvard degree, Walsh was part of a transformative generation of scholars.
“He exemplifies a generation of Jesuits who were some of the first to get absolutely top academic degrees,” Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., said. “That generation helped us move from being regional colleges to being research universities.”
Although his own canon of published work was smaller than that of many of today’s academics, his intelligence and dedication to scholarship has yielded dozens of books in theology and philosophy edited, uncredited, by his hand.
“As a young scholar you’re kind of nervous how your work’s going to be received and how you’re going to be received at your first job. This was my first academic job. He just couldn’t have been more of a generous senior colleague,” Tod Linafelt, a theology professor who shared the same field, said of Walsh, who served as an informal mentor when Linafelt arrived in 1996. “Both personally, he was very encouraging in terms of teaching and scholarship, but also, he would read my work and even though it was very different from the sort of stuff he would do, he was very generous and welcoming and would have substantive responses to the work, which was not always the case with colleagues, and especially with that generational difference.”
DeGioia revealed that Walsh had just finished a draft of a book on the subject of imagination, a commitment to which he consistently stressed and epitomized.
“He devoted his life to being a sort of personal trainer of our imaginations,” Mark Ouweleen (CAS ’86), a Chimes alumnus, eulogized at the service. “His first lesson was humility — you may not be the center of the universe, an important lesson for Chimes.”
This emphasis on imagination was reflected in his teachings.
“For Jim, Georgetown was first a community of learning, at the heart of which was a deeper community of service and love. Like all communities, Jim insisted that its members owed something to each other,” David Fitzgerald (COL ’91), a Chimes alumnus who took classes with Walsh, wrote in an email. “Teachers had a responsibility to constantly invite students into a conversation about learning. It was OK for students to bring their biases and preconceived notions to the conversation. That’s what made the learning interesting. But, in the end, students had a responsibility to be humble, to listen, to seek for understanding and not validation and certainly not accreditation.”
His instruction continued outside the classroom, in subtle ways.
“Our road trips with Jim were a rolling symposia. Our car was a bubble where it was OK for adolescents to be excited about theology [and the other humanities],” Ouweleen, who described Walsh as “a sort of Willie Nelson muppet of a priest” said.
A Campus, Made Home
A tracing of any aspect of campus life would reveal the influence or participation of a man many knew simply as “Jim.”
In addition to Chimes paraphernalia, photographs and several flower arrangements sent from university offices and families, a Patrick Healy Award, an award for service to varsity athletics and a certificate of recognition from the Office of Admissions lay on display at Walsh’s Wolfington Hall wake.
For years, Walsh served as the announcer for women’s basketball games. Each year, he would grow out his beard, ready to play Santa Claus at the faculty Christmas party.
“He wasn’t your typical Claus. I remember him, in response to one child pulling on his beard, asking, ‘Are you real?’” DeGioia recounted. “Jim, channelling some existentialism, said, ‘What is real?’”
His effect on all students who have passed through the front gates since 1989 is cemented in his preamble to the university’s first free speech and expression policy, espousing a commitment to conversation.
“A university is many things but central to its being is discourse, discussion, debate: the untrammeled expression of ideas and information,” Walsh wrote.
In a Tropaia Ceremony speech three years before, upon winning the 1986 Bunn Award for Faculty Excellence, Walsh emphasized the confluence of education and conversation.
“It forms habits of mind that make you capable of being part of that conversation: reverence, a historical sense, a certain critical — and self-critical — awareness, an ability to enter generously, sympathetically and imaginatively into the lives and feelings of people of other times and cultures,” he said. “It forms in you the ability to listen; to go out of yourself; to be friends. And what do you need to take part in this conversation? Why, those same qualities: the ability to listen, to go out of yourself, to be friends.”
Walsh continued to champion these ideals in the 25 years following the policy’s publication.
“He became the symbolic sort of fountain of wisdom around us, so people would consult him to talk about what speech meant; it wasn’t like a regular review board,” Carnes, who currently serves on the speech and expression committee, said. “When he was consulted, it was mainly around: ‘You inspired us with this, how do you look at this situation?’ and he would give some ideas, and then the administrators had to implement them.”
Family First
Through both the Jesuit order and his own kin, Walsh was drawn to families.
“As a child, having an uncle who was a priest and could celebrate Mass at the house in 20 minutes or less meant we could play more,” Joseph Walsh, his nephew, said at the memorial service, detailing Walsh’s importance at different stages of his life. “He was often there to talk with or just listen to during hard times.”
Perhaps Walsh’s most high-profile familial affiliation was that with the Georgetown Chimes, the famed all-male a cappella group of nearly seven decades.
Walsh joined the Chimes in 1980 as a neophyte, setting up Cherry Tree Massacre stages and fetching beers alongside 18-year-olds — a process he insisted on going through.
“My first introduction to Jim Walsh and to the Jesuit tradition of Georgetown is that there was this professor, with a Ph.D., clearly an adult, one of the smartest human beings on the planet, and he was going through the same neophyte process that I was going through,” Mark Grannis (CAS ’85) said. “The humility that showed was really striking.”
Upon his full induction to the group, Walsh refused to wield power over younger members.
“Right when he got in the group, he was the adult in the room. He was the professor at Georgetown, and yet, he wanted to be treated as a student. When issues come up with the Chimes, and the active group is trying to decide something, everybody’s got a voice,” Tim Naughton (CAS ’77), who took Walsh’s freshman theology class in 1973, said. “Sometimes what the group did, he thought was nuts. But it was what the group, you know, voted to do. So Jim didn’t want to get in the way of that. It was only in the worst examples of that that Jim would offer this question: ‘Do you think that X might be upset by that?’”
“He was sort of the conscience, but he sort of understood that he should let the group take charge,” current Chimes Ephus Connor Joseph (COL ’16) said.
Walsh was a fixture at Chimes’ retreats and reunions, and presided over countless marriages and baptisms of alumni and their children.
“He saw Chimes and Chimes’ kids go through the group,” current Chime Duncan Peacock (COL ’16), whose father George (CAS ’84) was also a Chime, said. “He was the one constant for a group that was ever-changing.”
He cultivated multi-generational relationships with fellow faculty, students, friends’ spouses and children.
“Jim wanted to be wherever we were all the time. He wanted to immerse himself in all of his human relationships. And he was just incredibly selfless in the way he did that,” Grannis said.
Walsh effortlessly straddled the lines between teacher, friend and priest.
“I would say that religiously speaking he was so human and such a good friend and so much a contemporary of ours, but at the same time, still very much the Jesuit, very much trying to exemplify how our lives should be led, and it was important to him, and he was a real connection for me in my faith,” Kris Murphy, David’s wife, said.
Coming from a family of many Hoyas, Bridget Morton (MSB ’16) grew up hearing stories of “the incredible Father Walsh.”
“My mom and aunt had talked about him being the teacher of a lifetime. I didn’t really buy it until I took the class,” she said. “It was one of those things where he was a unique combination of an educator who cared incredibly deeply about his students on a really personal, authentic level, all at the same time expecting academic and intellectual excellence.”
Walsh was omnipresent and invaluable to all those he encountered, whether through personal relationships or implicitly through his scholarship and impact on the university.
“In the stories of all our lives, Jim shows up in an impossible number of important scenes. … And now, just like that, he’s out of the picture. In fact, I think this funeral is the first big event he’s missed,” Ouweleen said. “I wonder if our sadness itself may be a failure of our imagination. … What if there was a playful God who loved us so, he sent us Jim Walsh?”

Took Father Walsh’s Old Testament course maybe 1974.  He would have been a good mentor, had I had one during my four years at Georgetown.  He is one of the very few fond memories of the place.  Father Walsh later (1980s) said that the basis of faith is, “Fear not!” \__/

With new School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman’s assumption of office this summer comes a restructuring of the dean’s office, seeing the creation of three new administrative positions and a Centennial Vision Committee to guide discussions concerning the future of the school.
Hellman spliced the senior associate dean position into two, creating separate offices for undergraduate and graduate affairs. James Reardon-Anderson, who previously held the position under the leadership of the late Carol Lancaster (SFS ’64), will retain his teaching duties and serve as senior advisor on Qatar, in his capacity as former SFS-Q dean.
Daniel Byman, a former director of the Security Studies Program, assumes the senior associate deanship for undergraduate affairs. Mitch Kaneda retains his position as director of the bachelor’s of science in foreign service program. Anthony Arend, the director of the master’s of science in foreign service program, will add the senior associate deanship for graduate and faculty affairs to his slate.
Byman, who also serves as the director of research at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, said that he is excited to begin his duties and hopes to maintain the academic excellence of the SFS as well as provide students with the skills to excel in their careers.
“Dean Hellman has put together a great team, and I am eager to work with Associate Dean Mitch Kaneda and others in the SFS program to ensure that it remains the best undergraduate institution for the study of international affairs,” Byman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In addition to his deanship, Byman will continue to teach undergraduate and graduate courses in the SFS.
“Although I am excited about my administrative duties, I love teaching, and I would never give it up,” Byman wrote. “I’ll still teach both the graduate and undergraduate level in the semesters to come.”
SFS Associate Dean Emily Zenick will now serve as chief of staff to Hellman, a new position in the dean’s office. Zenick will both coordinate various initiatives of the dean’s office and serve as a liaison across the school’s departments. She retains her duties as advisor to the current cohorts of the regional and comparative studies major.
Zenick’s duties will also include the management of the strategic goals of the SFS and the communication of these initiatives to other offices and schools.
In an email to The Hoya, Zenick said that she looks forward to working on affairs related to the direction of the school at a greater capacity.
“In my 16 years as an advising dean to first [McDonough School of Business] and then SFS students, I have developed a strong understanding of deep affection for Georgetown students,” Zenick wrote. “I feel grateful for all my experiences in working closely with students and look forward to this new opportunity to continue working on issues of importance to our community.”
As the SFS reaches its centennial in 2019, Hellman also created a Centennial Vision Committee to shape the school’s direction for the future.
“We need to begin a dialogue about where the school is going in the next hundred years,” Hellman said. “The school was created in 1919, largely to create a specialized cluster of people to be the kind of representatives of the United States abroad, whether it’s in diplomacy or commerce or in any other field. A hundred years later, the school is very different. The kinds of people that we have are very different.”
The committee will consist of associate professors in a variety of academic fields within the SFS, including Joanna Lewis, Rochelle Davis and Lahra Smith.
“What I decided to do is to bring in some of our associate professors [who are] in their middle of their careers. They’ve been here long enough that they’re tenured and they know the place, but they’re still early enough in their careers … so they really have a stake in our future,” Hellman said.
According to Associate Professor David Edelstein, who will serve as a co-chair of the committee, the members will communicate with different stakeholders about crafting an updated vision for the school.
“We’ll be consulting with a variety of constituencies inside and outside of the school in an effort to do so,” Edelstein wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s exciting work as it provides an opportunity to think in grand terms about where the school might be going and how we might get there.”
One of Hellman’s own plans for the school is to increase the collaboration between departments to foster an interdisciplinary education for students.
“One of the things I want to do is think about how we build on all [our] existing strengths and create more of a one SFS that draws on all those strengths, both [in] the undergraduate program and the graduate program so as to lessen the gaps between the graduate program doing one thing and maybe the undergraduate doing another,” Hellman said.
Hellman said that he hopes the new structure of the dean’s office will help create more connection between different programs in the school.
“I think we want to start building in more flexibility into the program for [students] … and more connectivity in the program,” Hellman said. “I hope this structure will help us.”

The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and MedStar Georgetown University Hospital embarked on a nationwide clinical trial Sept. 1 that will compare two melanoma drugs.
ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, an organization that designs and conducts cancer research on adults who have or are at risk of developing cancer, is conducting the study and currently recruiting patients. Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in American men and the seventh most common cancer in American women.
Lombardi Center Deputy Director Michael Atkins will lead the trial to its completion in five years.
The study will determine the optimal sequence of two distinct treatment regimens. One directly targets the melanoma cells, while the other restores the activity of immune cells that can attack the cancer. 
“One regimen involves a combination of pills that block a pathway within tumor cells, which causes the tumor cells to self-destruct in the majority of patients,” Atkins said. “The second approach is a combination of specific antibodies that reactivates the patient’s immune system against the melanoma.”
Both regimens have been shown in previous clinical trials to be effective in treating patients with advanced melanoma.
Lombardi Center Director Louis Weiner said Atkins’ expertise in this area of clinical study and his intuition about the future of the cancer treatment field make him an excellent leader for the job.
“Dr. Atkins joined Georgetown Lombardi just a few years ago and brought with him innumerable talents,” Weiner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He is a well-respected leader in the field of immunotherapy and has particular interest in treating melanoma. His expertise is evident in the vision he had to design this national clinical trial — predicting how and when the field would progress.”
Atkins emphasized that this trial can provide more insight into which sequence of treatments should be used first on different types of patients.
“The question in this trial is, do you start with the highly effective pills, and use the highly effective immunotherapy only after the pills stop working?” Atkins said. “Or do you start with the immunotherapy and only use the pills for the patients whose disease is not eradicated by the immunotherapy?”
Approximately 300 people with advanced melanoma will be recruited from cancer centers nationwide— including the Lombardi Center —to take part in the clinical trial. Half the patients will be randomly assigned to receive treatment using the pills first. The other half will begin treatment with the immunotherapy drugs.
If the regimen stops working for patients in either group, indicating that their cancer has become resistant to the initial treatment, they will receive the other drug combination. After patients finish their treatment regimens — which can take up to two years — their physicians will continue to monitor side effects for up to five years.
Participating patients will be asked to report their experiences on the two regimens using standardized questionnaires. This will allow researchers to better understand the symptoms, side effects and toxicities of the treatments, according to an ECOG-ACRIN Group press release emailed to The Hoya.
“The trial gives patients the potential to cross over and receive the other treatment approach because researchers already know that for many patients, melanoma can be highly aggressive and existing treatments often stop working,” a spokesman from ECOG-ACRIN Group wrote. “As a result, advanced melanoma patients and their physicians find themselves with many treatment options but few answers to questions surrounding how and when to use these new approaches.”
Atkins also highlighted the potential contributions this trial could make to further melanoma treatment studies.
“We hope to identify the regimen that optimally produces long-term survival in patients with advanced melanoma,” Atkins said. “We also hope to uncover unique features of our patients who might respond better to one treatment sequence versus the other sequence, and also try to understand the properties related to resistance to a particular therapy that might help us develop better treatments in the future.”
The National Cancer Institute will sponsor the clinical trial. The ECOG-ACRIN Group will also receive funding support from Novartis, the company that commercializes the two oral drugs in the first regimen, and from Bristol-Myers Squibb, the manufacturer of the antibodies used in the immunotherapy regimen.

One hundred and forty students moved into the second and third floors of the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center, which has been converted into temporary student housing for the 2015-2016 academic year, last week.
Seventy-nine percent of the hotel’s residents are sophomores, while 15 percent are juniors and six percent are seniors.
The conversion of the hotel space into dormitories comes as a result of the 2010 Campus Plan, which aims to house 385 extra students on campus by the fall of 2015. The hotel will provide housing for these extra students while construction for the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall continues.
Georgetown University Vice President for Planning and Facilities Management Robin Morey said the hotel will be used to house students until the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall opens in the summer of 2016.
The hotel dorm rooms are larger than doubles in traditional upperclassman dorms and also contain personal bathrooms. Since there aren’t laundry machines in the hotel, students must use the laundry room in Henle Village.
The hotel also offers housekeeping services for the rooms, which are offered once, twice or five times a week, for $35, $50 or $75, respectively. Students will be able to use credit cards and GOCard debit or flex dollars to order from the full room service menu.
Each floor has its own community and study room to ensure that students do not disturb hotel guests staying on the fourth and fifth floors, which cannot be accessed by students. Additionally, students enter the dorm from the Leavey Esplanade, while guests continue to use the north side entrance.
Students use their GOCards to access the elevators and their rooms. In addition, the hotel front desk provides students with free temporary GOCards, which are valid for 24 hours, in case they are locked out of their rooms.
Min Joo Lee (SFS ’18), a resident assistant at the hotel, said that she often needs to remind students that there are hotel guests staying on other floors.
“Something that has been important so far is that I always have to be mindful and remind residents of the fact that we share our space with hotel guests, and therefore need to be extra considerate with our noise level, move-in route and so on,” Lee said. “Other than that, I think it’s similar to other RA positions in upperclassmen residence halls.”
Each floor of the hotel also contains its own trash room, the contents of which the hotel staff disposes daily.
The hotel also offers a variety of its services to students living on its residential floors, including dry cleaning service with a 20 percent off student discount.
Despite the amenities provided by the hotel, residents noted that there are some drawbacks to living in these rooms, such as the distance to laundry machines and lack of kitchen access.
“I love living in the hotel. The staff is really accommodating. You can order room service and the rooms are really large,” resident Gina Kim (SFS ’18) said. “But I am still dreading trekking to Henle to do my laundry.”
Resident Lydia Bubniak (SFS ’18) agreed that the hotel needs to make improvements to its amenities.
“They did a good job overall. It’s quiet and private but still has more of a community feel than I expected,” Bubniak said. “There are a few things that could be improved logistically though, like access to a small kitchen and laundry room, both of which we have to go to Henle for, and much more lighting in the room for studying.”
Lee said that living in the hotel is a unique experience for residents.
“I think it’s pretty awesome that we’ll be the first and last Hoyas to call the GU Hotel our home,” Lee said.

Chris Murphy (GRD ’98) will serve as Georgetown’s first vice president for government relations and community engagement, a new position created to coordinate the university’s engagement with community groups and the local, city and federal government.
Previously, the Office of Community Engagement was a part of the Office of Public Affairs, while the Office of Neighborhood Life was co-managed by the Office of Student Affairs. Now, the OCE and the Office of Federal Relations have been combined, with Murphy at the helm. The ONL will continue to work with the OCE and OSA.
The appointment was announced by University President John J. DeGioia in a university-wide email over the summer.
“Murphy will help to strengthen our relationships with governmental and community leaders, enhance our civic engagement throughout the Washington area and more actively support policy and partnerships that advance our university’s mission and vision,” DeGioia wrote.
Murphy, who graduated from Harvard University in 1990 and from Georgetown University Law Center in 1998, brings more than 25 years of experience in nonprofits and local and federal government sectors to the position. Having served as chief of staff to former Washington, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray from 2011 to 2015, Murphy began his position at Georgetown Aug. 10.
The position of associate vice president for community engagement and strategic initiatives was formerly held by Lauralyn Lee, who left the post in June after 13 years at the university. Lee continues to serve as a senior adviser to the OCE.
In an interview with The Hoya, Murphy said that this reorganization will allow for greater efficiency and focus.
“Given all the competing priorities, it was a real challenge to give [community engagement and government relations] the attention [they] deserve,” Murphy said. “Although the functions existed, this was an opportunity to restructure how they were being managed, and to elevate them to a higher level.”
Murphy said that he hopes to increase Georgetown’s role in community and government affairs.
“For years, Georgetown has done extraordinary work at all of those levels, especially our work in the community,” Murphy said. “By giving some lift to this office, it will give us an opportunity to better tell the story of what Georgetown is already doing and add value so we can do it on an even bigger scale and with better quality.”
Office of Neighborhood Life Director Cory Peterson said that the organizational changes will improve his response time to concerns raised by community members and students.
“Having an elevated vice president allows me to better serve … in a quicker fashion,” Peterson said. “Having that access to Chris and to [Vice President of Student Affairs] Todd Olson means I can raise an issue very quickly to both of them and be able to get access and answers quickly.”
The new position will engage with a number of different groups, including the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and other community organizations.
Murphy said that through his interactions with the community, he hopes to create opportunities for students in academic settings, community service and public service.
“There are no limits to what kinds of partnerships we can have that benefit our partners and students,” Murphy said.
Murphy said that productive neighborhood relations can bring about positive results. For instance, he cited the possibility of creating a coalition to question whether the Federal Aviation Administration is justified in flying planes directly over campus.
According to Murphy, the revamped structure of the OCE will lead to a more widespread understanding of the office and its role.
“I think there is a sense that not enough people know about all the good work that’s going on,” Murphy said. “I’ve started to have conversations about how we can better articulate and better tell the story about how Georgetown is already engaging in the community.”
Peterson echoed this sentiment and said that students and neighbors both hold misperceptions of one another.
In July, Georgetown University Student Association President Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Vice-President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) co-wrote an op-ed in The Hoya (“Engaing the Wrong Community,” thehoya.com, July 20, 2015) that questioned the creation of this new position.
The piece criticized the administration’s decision to put more money and resources toward community engagement while issues that many students have with resources, such as Counseling and Psychiatric Services and the Academic Resource Center, remain largely unaddressed.
“It is not that we feel the Office of Community Engagement lacks intrinsic value, but rather that we are committed to directing the university’s energy and resources toward issues that benefit the student body and the student experience,” Rohan wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Murphy said, conversely, that close relationships with the surrounding community are beneficial to the university. Murphy has already met with GUSA leadership and said that they have “a terrific working relationship.”
“First and foremost, it’s important to think about the strategic role that these functions play,” Murphy said. “If we, as a university, do not have a good relationship with our neighbors, that hurts everybody. By recognizing the importance of these functions, I think everybody wins.”

Former Senior Jewish Chaplain Rabbi Harold S. White, a member of the Georgetown community since 1968, died of complications from a stroke on Aug. 31. He was 83 years old.
As the first full-time rabbi appointed to a campus ministry position at a Catholic university in the United States, White worked to unite different faith groups and communities during his nearly 50 years at Georgetown.
In a university-wide email, University President John J. DeGioia described White’s goal of promoting interfaith dialogue as central to the university’s mission.
“Rabbi White’s devotion to our shared values and our mission as a community was unparalleled,” DeGioia wrote. “His leadership and vision in creating opportunities for dialogue … helped build the ethos of engagement that characterizes our campus ministry today.”
During his time as a chaplain, White constantly sought to establish connections with other religious groups, and he co-taught a course with Fr. Dennis McManus and Imam Yahya Hendi on the dialogue between Abrahamic faiths.
Over the past decades, White also officiated numerous weddings, including those of gay and lesbian couples.
In 2003, the School of Foreign Service launched the Program for Jewish Civilization under White’s leadership, linking the fields of ethics, government and history as they pertain to Judaism. When he retired from the chaplaincy in 2010, White continued to serve as a senior advisor for the program.
Prior to his career at Georgetown, White served Jewish communities in Dublin, Ireland and Ann Arbor, Mich. He also served as a chaplain for the United States Navy.
On a memorial webpage for White, former students and colleagues shared their memories of a kind mentor, leader and friend.
“His gentle, caring spirit and devotion to the Jewish community, and indeed the larger spiritual community at Georgetown, were deeply appreciated,” Sarah Goldstein (COL ’03) wrote.
A full obituary will be published next week.

Chair of the Department of Human Science in the School of Nursing and Health Studies Rosemary Sokas was appointed to a leadership position on the board of the Migrant Clinicians Network over the summer.
MCN is a global organization that aims to improve health care for migrants around the world by providing support, technical assistance and professional development to clinicians in Federally Qualified Health Centers and other health care delivery sites.
The group consists of over 10,000 constituents who perform research, advocate for migrants and engage external partners for support.
Sokas said that she became passionate about immigrant workers through the experiences of her own family.
“My one grandfather, who died before I was born, never learned English and worked as a dishwasher, which is a mostly immigrant job to this day,” Sokas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “My other grandfather, whose own father was an immigrant laborer, was my buddy growing up. He worked a drop-forge press and lost his hearing from the noise, which got me interested in occupational health.”
After developing an interest in occupational health, Sokas worked in a seasonal and migrant agricultural health center, where she interacted with agricultural and construction workers, many of whom were immigrants.
Sokas said that she hopes to help practicing clinicians through her work in MCN.
“As an academic, what I do is so much easier than primary care clinical medicine,” Sokas wrote. “I wanted to help make practice easier for the clinicians who are caring for patients directly, which is what MCN does.”
Sokas said that she was drawn to MCN by a number of its outreach programs, including one that monitors patients with active tuberculosis to ensure that they are treated, even if they face deportation.
“They provide technical support, and they try to help with really thorny issues … which the treating clinician simply doesn’t have the time to do,” Sokas wrote.
Sokas has previously integrated MCN into her courses, giving students the chance to learn about environmental issues in a real-life context.
In an environmental justice course she co-taught with Professor Laura Anderko, Sokas brought her students to the MCN office in Salisbury, Md. and a camp where the workers stayed.
In another course, Sokas gave students an opportunity to work on MCN’s projects. In her toxicology class, Sokas asked students to help review the Environmental Protection Agency’s updated Worker Protection Standard to evaluate how well it protects farmworkers from pesticide exposure.
“In the current WPS, there is no age limit for pesticide handling, so you could have a 14-year-old doing that. We’re trying to see a minimum age of 18 implemented,” Sokas wrote.
In her new position, Sokas will continue working on a number of different projects to solve the challenges that health centers face in trying to meet the occupational health needs of their patients.
In addition to her work outside of Georgetown, Sokas was praised by students and colleagues in the NHS as an inspirational and helpful professor.
NHS Dean Patricia Cloonan praised Sokas for her work, which she said aligned with the vision of the school.
“I congratulate Rosie on being selected for this new voluntary leadership role, a professional honor that highlights her steadfast commitment to the health and well-being of the migrant community,” Cloonan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Her work embodies this school’s mission, vision and values, which frame our collective organizational efforts to promote health equity and eliminate health disparities.”
Katherine Foley (SFS ’14) said that Sokas was a very helpful professor who accommodated her needs.
“She’s very knowledgable, but also very practical, and is very good at sizing up a situation and deciding what is ‘good science,’” Foley said.
“She was totally encouraging when I had a million questions, and she never made me feel stupid even though I was the only non-nursing student in the class. She’s a tough cookie, but also genuinely caring, respectful and just really encouraging.”
