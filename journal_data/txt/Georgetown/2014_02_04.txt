As graduate students at private institutions across the country have begun pushing for recognized unions, the Georgetown Graduate Student Organization, which primarily concerns itself with community-building, has chosen to forgo unionization.
In November, the Graduate Student Organizing Committee under the United Automobile Workers labor union at New York University became the first graduate union to earn formal recognition from a private university.
In spite of the National Labor Relations Boards’ 2004 Brown University ruling that defined graduates as students —not workers with the ability to legitimately unionize — NYU students pressured the administration into formal recognition of the union through massive organization and petitioning, backed by local politicians, including then-City Council Speaker Christine Quinn.
Matt Canfield, a fifth-year NYU anthropology graduate student and member of GSOC-UAW, cited cuts to healthcare benefits and collective organizing energy as the catalysts for the upsurge in union support.
“For a long time there was a lot of pushback from the administration. They thought that those issues could be dealt with between graduate workers and the faculty and that there was really no reason for graduate employees to be organized. And eventually, I think they reached out to the university when there was significant unrest on campus,” Canfield said. Graduate employees won the vote with a 620 to 10 margin, signifying support for the union and encouraging university recognition of collective rights.
Graduate workers who unionize are often galvanized by stagnant teaching wages, rising healthcare costs and scholastic work that often outlasts granted stipends, saddling the students with debt.
“A lot of us, first of all, take more than five years, and that’s not because we’re lazing around, but also because the expectations we have from our faculty in producing quality work do require us to be here longer,” Molly Cunningham, a fifth-year University of Chicago anthropology graduate student, who is a member of her university’s unrecognized graduate union, said.
She described the mounting burdens of the longer timeframe, including high healthcare costs and billed advances on tuition for those unable to teach.
“So this is kind of a double bind when you’re being told by your faculty advisors that you need to take longer, but the university is telling you if you take any longer you’re going to have to start taking out loans in order to finish,” Cunningham said.
The union has been successful in addressing more urgent concerns on a smaller scale, causing the students in the University of Chicago’s graduate student union to choose to not seek formal recognition from the university. For example, the graduate students’ childcare campaign, an issue the students have been discussing with the university for years, has seen recent success in the creation of a scholarship program for childcare assistance for doctoral candidates, and an ongoing discussion of teaching wages.
“Those wages, they actually look good when you’re sort of still on your stipend, but once you’ve contributed to this university for five, six, seven years, and become an increasingly skilled and experienced teacher, then it sort of stops cutting it,” Cunningham said. “So that’s one thing we’re sort of developing a campaign around that we think that we could be pretty effective advocates to the administration even without formal recognition.”
Georgetown GSO primarily concerns itself with advocacy, graduate student groups and student programming, and works with an increasingly supportive administration, especially Provost Robert Groves, to reform the image of Georgetown’s graduate program and organize GSO internally.
Samuel Osea (COL ’12, GRD ’14), GSO president, agreed that graduate students often face undue challenges due to workload and low wages, but are, by contrast, supported by the university administration. He said that problems develop when administrators fail to realistically assess their graduate students’ situations, an issue Osea said does not exist at Georgetown.
“The graduate school has a great staff who has, again, been very supportive. Student affairs has been very supportive from the engagement perspective, so I don’t see us unionizing,” Osea said.
Graduate students across the school, whether they are intent on unionizing or not, agree that their voices are indispensible to the university system at Georgetown.
“When you’re looking at schools, one thing you look for is research support. Is it the type of environment where you can succeed and turn out a dissertation or thesis in the amount of time required or in the amount of time they give you?” Osea said. “I think that by having a resource such as GSO for both academic and non-academic support, I think it’s vital.”

On Monday, Professor Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies in Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service, was appointed to a commission that will conduct a review of the policies implemented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation addressing the threat of terrorism to the United States.
As the current director of the security studies program and a tenured professor in the SFS, Hoffman comes to the job with over 30 years of expertise in terrorism and insurgency. He previously served as corporate chair in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency at RAND Corporation, vice president for external affairs at RAND and acting director of RAND’s Center for Middle East Public Policy.
Designed to assess the FBI’s progress over the past decade, the independent commission panel focuses on three main issues: assessing the progress made since 9/11 in transforming the FBI’s response to threats of terrorism, evaluating how the FBI has implemented policies since 2004 and finally, reviewing all new information received since 2004, including information received in the raid of Osama Bin Laden’s compound in 2011.
Professor Hoffman noted that terrorist attacks have evolved to become newer and more diverse, challenging the FBI to react more efficiently and comprehensively.
“Responding to terrorist attacks has less to do with resources now,” Hoffman said. “It’s really up to figuring out how to maximize efficiency and to address these attacks accordingly with the current available skills.”
Hoffman is the only academic commissioner out of the three appointees on the panel, which also includes former Attorney General Ed Meese and former Ambassador Tim Roemer. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA), chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee that funds the FBI, expressed his confidence in the individuals chosen for the panel in a Jan. 27. press release.
“I cannot think of three more qualified individuals to serve on the commission,” Wolf wrote. “They are all men of integrity and have significant credibility and expertise on counterterrorism policy.”
Hoffman expressed his intention to bring rigorous academic knowledge and public policy to the group. He explained that, having completed two books last year, he plans to use his newfound free time for the commission’s workload.
“I think that if you’re teaching in [the] SFS, you need to be actively involved in precisely what your students are sitting in classes to learn about. So this opportunity is such an honor and privilege,” Hoffman said. “Service on the commission is not a full-time job. In that sense, I’m grateful since it allows me to simultaneously keep up my responsibilities of teaching and also work with my patriotism.”
Genevieve Lester, a fellow professor in the Security Studies Program, applauded Hoffman for his professionalism and scholastic intelligence.
“Bruce is an inspired choice for this commission. Not only is he one of the foremost scholars of terrorism, but he has also served on government commissions before. He was the first executive director of the Gilmore Commission — a commission that assessed domestic response capabilities to terrorism using weapons of mass destruction — and has held high level advisory positions, including in the Central Intelligence Agency,” Lester said.
Lester also noted that Hoffman’s broad knowledge base would help the commission during a trying time in the world of intelligence.
“Beyond Bruce’s experience, I think the best thing about this choice is that the intelligence community is now in a state of flux — the Snowden leaks, potential changes in the way intelligence activities are conducted and how oversight is done and challenges to the role of intelligence and law enforcement mean we need someone with a long view. The U.S. must become more proactive in dealing with emergent threats. Bruce has studied how terrorism and counterterrorism have changed over the past four decades and understands how institutions must rise to meet this challenge,” Lester said.

Georgetown’s most famous advocate for reproductive rights might soon seek a larger national stage.
After longtime Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) announced his retirement Thursday, Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12) told Southern California radio station 89.3 KPCC that she is considering running for his seat in Congress.
Best known for her work supporting reproductive rights and women’s rights, Fluke entered the national spotlight in February 2012 when conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh called her a “slut” following her testimony on the importance of contraceptive coverage. Fluke went on to speak at the Democratic National Convention in 2012, where she pushed for increased access to contraception and equal pay for women.
“I’m flattered that I’m being discussed as a potential candidate, especially for Rep. Waxman’s seat, considering his incredible legacy. A number of folks I respect very deeply have reached out today and encouraged me to run. I am strongly considering running. I’ll be making my decision soon,” Fluke said in a statement released Thursday.
Judy Feder, former dean of what is now the McCourt School of Public Policy, moderated last year’s Georgetown University Lecture Fund series featuring Fluke. Having run for Congress twice, Federsaid that Fluke would make a promising candidate.
“I find her enormously impressive, articulate, principled and able to connect with an audience of diverse points of view, and based on my experience running for Congress, that’s a terrific set of credentials,” Feder said.
If Fluke chooses to formalize her bid for Congress, she will run as a representative of California’s 33rd congressional district, which includes affluent areas like Malibu and Santa Monica. Fluke’s competition would include Democrats former Los Angeles City Controller Wendy Greuel and State Senator Ted Lieu, both of whom declared their candidacy early last week.
Mathew Grubman, a junior at the University of Colorado-Boulder who grew up in District 33, said that he would definitely consider voting for Fluke should she choose to run.
“I like her stance on women’s rights, that’s always a major point for me in any sort of election, so her stance on that definitely is appealing to me,” Grubman said.
Kelsey Read (NHS ’17), also from Fluke’s potential district, said that she would most likely vote for Fluke. But, she did express concern that Fluke’s liberal contraceptive policy might encroach on institutions’ rights to religious freedom — something that has proved problematic for Georgetown in the past.
“I think on the one hand it’s important to have contraceptives or birth control available for girls everywhere, but I think also that there is a legitimate concern with religious institutions,” Read said.
Elissa Free, executive director of communications for the Georgetown University Law Center, confirmed the university’s support for Fluke should she choose to run for office.
“Georgetown Law has a long tradition of its graduates going into public service, with many serving in Congress on both sides of the aisle. We wish all of them well and follow their careers with interest,” Free wrote in a statement.
Chandini Jha (COL ’16), chair of the College Democrats, noted that while her organization does not officially endorse candidates, she herself was energized by Fluke’s potential candidacy.
“I think it’s really great to see an issue that she has really stood up for, which is reproductive justice and women’s rights, move to the forefront of congressional races. And especially the fact that she’s a young woman in Congress,” Jha said.

DANIEL SMITH/THE HOYAStudents are upset by an apparent lack of consistency in the newly opened pub’s acceptance of various forms of identification.While students have flocked to popular Irish pub Rí Rásince its opening in December, unclear policies regarding identification have drawn confusion and hostility from some of its younger patrons.
According to Rí Rá manager Andie Christie, the pub requires two forms of identification to be admitted at night.
“Our policy has always been to ask for two forms of ID: passport, license, state or military ID,” Christie said.
This includes accepting driver’s licenses that are both horizontal and vertical. Some states use a vertical orientation to distinguish licenses for those under 21 with a quick glance, but a person over 21 years old can still have a valid vertical license. At Georgetown, many students who have not made it to the Department of Motor Vehicles in their home states to receive a new license rely on a vertical license for months or years after reaching the legal drinking age.
Christie confirmed that Rí Rá, located at 3125 M St. NW, accepts both vertical and horizontal IDs despite the varying degrees of confusion both forms can cause.
“Vertical admittance? If that ID was valid than indeed, yes,” Christie said.
However, students who have visited the establishment in recent weeks have been surprised to find that, though they are over the legal drinking age, they were not admitted to the establishment because their licenses were vertically, rather than horizontally, oriented.
Jacob Eder (COL ’14) who visited the pub last Thursday, was surprised to find that, though he is 22 years old, he was unable to get a drink at the bar after the waitress noted his Virginia ID’s vertical orientation.
“I went with two friends who had been told they weren’t taking vertical IDs, so they brought their passports,” Eder said. “I was not informed, and even after bouncer let me into the bar, the waitress asked for my ID and she wouldn’t serve me because it was vertical.”
Eder disagrees with the policy, and believes it is actually encouraging the use of false identification.
“They’re not even looking at the birthdate — they’re only looking at whether it’s horizontal or vertical because neither the bouncer nor waitress commented that it was [my friend’s] 21st birthday,” Edersaid. “I’m 22 years old, and I’m not going back.”
Alexandra Douglas (COL ’15) had a similar experience when she went with two friends to the bar Friday.
“We walked down there at a pretty reasonable hour. Two of us had vertical IDs — we’ve all been 21 for a couple of months — but the bouncer turned us away,” Douglas said. “We spoke to the manager as well, and he wouldn’t even really explain what the policy was and told us it was up to us to order horizontal IDs if we ever wanted to come back.”
While Douglas understood why the bar would want to stem underage drinking, she did not appreciate the establishment’s lack of clarity concerning the policy.
“It’s understandable that they need to track down underage patrons, but it’s just disappointing we weren’t treated respectfully and couldn’t really understand the policy,” Douglas said.
Another area bar, Mr. Smith’s, located at 3104 M St. NW, is also under the impression that Rí Rádoes not accept vertical orientation, and noted that they would not be following Rí Rá’s apparent policy.
“Yeah, they won’t accept any vertical IDs. The problem with them is they think they’re going to misread the IDs. I’ve talked to some of the managers and that’s why they’ve gone with that,” Robert, a bar manager at Mr. Smith’s who would not give his last name, said. “The problem we run into with the vertical IDs is the picture looks a lot different. Usually they’re 15 or 16 when the pictures are taken.”
George Kennedy, a manager of Rhino Bar and Pumphouse at 3295 M St. said that his establishment takes both forms of identification.
“If your ID says you’re 21 it doesn’t matter if it’s vertical or not as long as you’re of age,” Kennedy said.

Regular decision applications declined by 2.62 percent this year from 20,025 for the current freshman class to 19,500 for the Class of 2018.
This slight decrease continues a trend from last year, in which applications plateaued, declining by 0.1 percent from the year before.
The Class of 2018 applicant pool, however, has an average critical reading SAT score of 674, up seven points from last year. The average math SAT score rose four points to 681.
“Even though the pool has gone down a little bit, it’s gotten stronger,” Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said. “From an admissions committee’s point of view, it will be every bit as competitive [as] or even more competitive than it was two years ago when we had that peak number.”
The applicant pool includes 1,875 self-identified African-American students, or 9.6 percent of applicants, and 2,200 self-identified Hispanics, or 11.3 percent of applicants. Fewer than half of this year’s applicants self-identified as white.
“Although the pool hasn’t grown, it’s become more diverse, both socioeconomically and in particular by ethnic background,” Deacon said.
While this year’s applicant pool saw higher levels of diversity, the number of international applicants declined. International students made up 12.8 percent of applicants to the Class of 2017 but just 10.5 percent of applicants for next year’s incoming class.
“We hadn’t counted on the rather significant drop-off in international applicants,” Deacon said. “We would have been even [with last year] if it hadn’t dropped off internationally.”
After receiving a record number of 3,370 applicants last year, the McDonough School of Business experienced decreases of 1.63 percent. The School of Nursing and Health Studies which had approximately 1,250 applicants last year, experienced decreases of 8.47 percent.
“We had been seeing a pattern where there was a big growth for the McDonough School of Business and the School of Nursing and Health Studies, which are job creators, but that has leveled off,” Deacon said.Applicants to the School of Foreign Service decreased by 5.28 percent. The College’s pool decreased by 1.83 percent, with fewer applicants indicating a major in hard sciences or entering as undecided, a change Deacon sees in line with an economy that has yet to settle since the 2008 recession.
Last year, Deacon attributed a 4.2 percent jump in applications to the NHS to an increased interest in the sciences.
“Students are more interested in job security. They are gravitating [toward] science and pre-med tracks,” he said in February 2013.
This year, Deacon analyzed pre-professional trends differently.
“If you’re in college today, you really want to say that you want to be adept at being flexible and making moves that make sense based on what the economy is going to be like when you graduate,” Deacon said. “It’s hard to know what it’s going to be because the world is changing so quickly.”
Deacon anticipates an acceptance rate of between 16 and 17 percent across the four schools for an incoming freshman class of around 1,580 students. Last year’s acceptance rate was 16.6 percent.
This year’s admissions process included the debut of an individualized online form for secondary school reports and teacher recommendations. The form requires teachers and counselors to answer Georgetown-specific questions, rather than sending identical information to each school to which a student is applying. Two-thirds of applicants, or those who chose to submit the form electronically, utilized the new form.
“For those who did use the system, we have much better information about the students. We know a lot more about them personally, and we have individual comments about how great this person would be, especially for Georgetown,” Deacon said.
The Office of Admissions will release regular application decisions in late March.

Three Domino’s Pizza employees were held at gunpoint in an armed robbery early Monday morning in which suspects stole $3,000 worth of money and goods from the restaurant in a manner that has led some employees to suspect it may have been an inside job.
The robbery took place at 1:43 a.m., as Domino’s staff were preparing to close the restaurant at 2 a.m. At the time of the robbery, there were two delivery men and one manager inside the establishment, located at 3255 Prospect St. NW. No patrons were present, and no one was seriously injured.
The Georgetown University Police Department sent a public safety alert at 10:50 a.m. Monday identifying the suspects as six black men between 6 feet and 6 feet 2 inches tall wearing all black clothing and masks.
This is the second armed robbery that has occurred in the Georgetown neighborhood in recent weeks, after a student was robbed while walking near 3500 O St. on Jan. 21.
Mohammed Farhan Tai, a Domino’s driver, was in the back of the store washing dishes when men entered the store.
“Last night I was doing the dishes, washing, and then one person, then two people came in the back, and they had guns. They said, ‘Come inside the room’ where the safe was. And another person came and they said, ‘Open the safe, open the safe’ and I said, ‘I don’t know how to open it, I’m just a driver,’” Tai said.
According to Domino’s employees, the main safe is on a timed lock and can only be opened by the general manager, who was not in the store at the time. When the burglars learned of this information, they began to steal personal items and delivery tips, as well as money left in a smaller safe and cash register, which totaled to the estimated $3,000.
“I had money in my pocket and tried to save it,” Tai said. “They saw me and kicked me and took all my money, then one more guy in the front dragged the guy from the front all the way to the back with his hair. They took his phone. … They walked around and they said ‘Give me all the money.’ I gave all of my pocket money, and in five to seven minutes they went away.”
Tai had left his phone in the car that night. After the men left, Tai called the police, who arrived in around five minutes.
According to a Domino’s employee who asked to remain anonymous, the burglars were very knowledgeable of the operations and layout of the store.
“I thought it was maybe somebody inside. The way that they knew the operations and what time they knew everything was going to be done. Maybe they weren’t the ones that actually robbed, but they had to be the brains of the operation. … It doesn’t sound right,” the source said.
Woody Tongrugs, manager of Mai Thai, located down the street from Domino’s at 3251 Prospect St. NW, said he was not concerned about his own store being robbed, and that crime like this is unusual in the area.
“Maybe somebody snatched a purse about a year ago, and then some drunk kid ran down a tree,” Tongrugs said of crime at Mai Thai. “We have a security guy here 24 hours, and we also have a security camera outside here. … Domino’s is a little bit farther away from the security, so that’s maybe why it happened.”
Conversely, Christian Liberman, who works at Booeymonger’s at 3265 Prospect St. NW by Domino’s, said that crime is common in the neighborhood.
“It’s a combination of factors. The economy is pretty rough right now for a lot of people. They’re out of work, and I think probably robbing or stealing is a quick and easy way to make ends meet,” Liberman said.
Liberman attributed the recent occurrence to the seemingly cyclical nature of crime in Georgetown.
“I’m not too personally concerned. I grew up in the area, and it goes through cycles. Georgetown isn’t insulated despite the properties’ values and the fact that the university is here,” Liberman said.
According to Georgetown University Police Department Chief of Police Jay Gruber, MPD will investigate this crime.
“It’s the MPD’s jurisdiction, so they’ll take the lead in the investigation. Our officers have descriptions of some of the individuals in the robbery, so we’ll definitely keep an eye out, but again it’s the MPD’s primary responsibility to investigate that crime.”
Gruber said that his officers will not change the way in which they patrol the neighborhood, since the robbery was not in close enough proximity to the university.
“Our officers who work in that beat that includes LXR, Walsh, Nevils and Alumni Square need to be diligent, and at our briefings we give out the descriptions of these people,” Gruber said.
Gruber urged students to remain vigilant of their surroundings when walking in the neighborhood.
“I think our students always need to be diligent when they’re outside of the gates of campus,” Gruber said.

As the puppy John B. Carroll, now known as Jack, captures the collective heart of campus, his predecessor is enjoying his twilight years in retirement — far from the madding crowd of Verizon Center.
John S. Carroll, who, like all of Georgetown’s mascots, enjoyed the appellation “Jack” in his heyday, arrived on campus in 2003 and was entrusted to Fr. Christopher Steck, S.J. After a decade of service, he retired last year and passed the mascot-mantle to J.J., whose reign was momentary. The senior bulldog spends his days in the lobby of the Jesuit residence Wolfington Hall, where he receives visitors before returning to the fourth floor of New South Hall in the evening. According to Steck, Jack still relishes socializing with the Georgetown community.
“There’s still a sense of liking to be with people,” Steck said. “He comes back after dinner, usually, and immediately goes to the student lounge. He likes hanging out with the students.”
Jack Sr. no longer attends official events and does not participate in performances at basketball games. While boxes no longer constitute a major part of his diet, he does still attend the occasional sporting event at the MultiSport Facility; however, most of his time in public consists of wandering around campus.
“I will take him around campus, and Red Square and things like that. And people take pictures of him all the time still,” Steck said.
Jack Sr. also grants evening audiences in the New South lobby, although Steck says he can exude a “diva personality.”
“We walk back inside and he immediately walks to one particular spot in the lobby where he sits there and waits for people to come pet him,” Steck said. “And when he’s had enough, about five or 10 minutes of being in the lobby, he just gets up and walks to the elevator, expecting me to follow him.”
Jack Sr. injured the canine equivalent of his anterior cruciate ligament in 2012. The injury can be aggravated by running on slippery floors, which precludes his public on-court performances. Steck feels that the legendary canine palpably misses going to the basketball games.
“Sometimes he’ll look out to the Jesuit circle and he’ll kind of want a car because when we went to the basketball games, there’d be a car there, and we’d park it, and he’d jump into the car and we’d go off to the basketball games,” Steck said. “So sometimes he’s like looking for that car and of course it’s not there.”
The familiar game environment would probably trigger Jack’s desire to perform, which Steck does not want to risk.
“So I could not just bring him to the game and just have him kind of wander around a little bit because he would just focus so much on the things he wanted to do. I think ideally if he weren’t going to get distracted by all of that what would be great would be to bring him to the concourse level,” Steck said.
Jack’s energy levels have decreased throughout his time in retirement.
“There might be a little bit of boredom, but like I said, his energy level is so low compared to what it used to be, that I think there is enough activity to keep him busy,” Steck said.
The retired mascot’s presence on campus does not detract from the limelight the new mascot receives.
“I don’t think it ends up being a big deal as far as Jack going around campus and visiting people. In fact, I suspect the university would want to have both kind of present,” Steck said.
Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) has had a lot of interaction with the dog because he is a member of the Jack Crew.
“From my understanding, he’s doing just fine with Fr. Steck,” Ramadan said. “I see him around campus and that video of the snow when he was rolling around in the snow was kind of really cute when he was out there. I mean he’s happy; he’s doing his thing.”
New South Four denizens like Abi Vega (MSB ’17) enjoy living in close proximity to the school’s former mascot. Jack, however, is not the most social floor-mate, which is partly due to his old age.
“Sometimes he doesn’t particularly pay attention to you if you are petting him or stuff. I just think that that’s because he’s old and kind of tired of other people’s crap,” Vega said.

IAN TICE/THE HOYARegular decision applications declined by 2.62 percent this year from 20,025 for the current freshman class to 19,500 for the Class of 2018.

Deacon anticipates an acceptance rate of between 16 and 17 percent across the four schools for an incoming freshman class of around 1,580 students. Last year’s acceptance rate was 16.6 percent.
This year’s admissions process included the debut of an individualized online form for secondary school reports and teacher recommendations. The form requires teachers and counselors to answer Georgetown-specific questions, rather than sending identical information to each school to which a student is applying. Two-thirds of applicants, or those who chose to submit the form electronically, utilized the new form.
“For those who did use the system, we have much better information about the students. We know a lot more about them personally, and we have individual comments about how great this person would be, especially for Georgetown,” Deacon said.
The Office of Admissions will release regular application decisions in late March.

LEONEL DE VELEZ/THE HOYAIn April 2012, Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12) shares her story with Judith Feder in Gaston Hall. The reproductive rights advocate is mulling a run for office.Georgetown’s most famous advocate for reproductive rights might soon seek a larger national stage.
After longtime Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) announced his retirement Thursday, Sandra Fluke (LAW ’12) told Southern California radio station 89.3 KPCC that she is considering running for his seat in Congress.
Best known for her work supporting reproductive rights and women’s rights, Fluke entered the national spotlight in February 2012 when conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh called her a “slut” following her testimony on the importance of contraceptive coverage. Fluke went on to speak at the Democratic National Convention in 2012, where she pushed for increased access to contraception and equal pay for women.
“I’m flattered that I’m being discussed as a potential candidate, especially for Rep. Waxman’s seat, considering his incredible legacy. A number of folks I respect very deeply have reached out today and encouraged me to run. I am strongly considering running. I’ll be making my decision soon,” Fluke said in a statement released Thursday.
Judy Feder, former dean of what is now the McCourt School of Public Policy, moderated last year’s Georgetown University Lecture Fund series featuring Fluke. Having run for Congress twice, Feder said that Fluke would make a promising candidate.
“I find her enormously impressive, articulate, principled and able to connect with an audience of diverse points of view, and based on my experience running for Congress, that’s a terrific set of credentials,” Feder said.
If Fluke chooses to formalize her bid for Congress, she will run as a representative of California’s 33rd congressional district, which includes affluent areas like Malibu and Santa Monica. Fluke’s competition would include Democrats former Los Angeles City Controller Wendy Greuel and State Senator Ted Lieu, both of whom declared their candidacy early last week.
Mathew Grubman, a junior at the University of Colorado-Boulder who grew up in District 33, said that he would definitely consider voting for Fluke should she choose to run.
“I like her stance on women’s rights, that’s always a major point for me in any sort of election, so her stance on that definitely is appealing to me,” Grubman said.
Kelsey Read (NHS ’17), also from Fluke’s potential district, said that she would most likely vote for Fluke. But, she did express concern that Fluke’s liberal contraceptive policy might encroach on institutions’ rights to religious freedom — something that has proved problematic for Georgetown in the past.
“I think on the one hand it’s important to have contraceptives or birth control available for girls everywhere, but I think also that there is a legitimate concern with religious institutions,” Read said.
Elissa Free, executive director of communications for the Georgetown University Law Center, confirmed the university’s support for Fluke should she choose to run for office.
“Georgetown Law has a long tradition of its graduates going into public service, with many serving in Congress on both sides of the aisle. We wish all of them well and follow their careers with interest,” Free wrote in a statement.
Chandini Jha (COL ’16), chair of the College Democrats, noted that while her organization does not officially endorse candidates, she herself was energized by Fluke’s potential candidacy.
“I think it’s really great to see an issue that she has really stood up for, which is reproductive justice and women’s rights, move to the forefront of congressional races. And especially the fact that she’s a young woman in Congress,” Jha said.

NATASHA THOMSON/THE HOYABruce Hoffman addresses students in his Healy classroom.On Monday, Professor Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies in Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service, was appointed to a commission that will conduct a review of the policies implemented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation addressing the threat of terrorism to the United States.
As the current director of the security studies program and a tenured professor in the SFS, Hoffman comes to the job with over 30 years of expertise in terrorism and insurgency. He previously served as corporate chair in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency at RAND Corporation, vice president for external affairs at RAND and acting director of RAND’s Center for Middle East Public Policy.
Designed to assess the FBI’s progress over the past decade, the independent commission panel focuses on three main issues: assessing the progress made since 9/11 in transforming the FBI’s response to threats of terrorism, evaluating how the FBI has implemented policies since 2004 and finally, reviewing all new information received since 2004, including information received in the raid of Osama Bin Laden’s compound in 2011.
Professor Hoffman noted that terrorist attacks have evolved to become newer and more diverse, challenging the FBI to react more efficiently and comprehensively.
“Responding to terrorist attacks has less to do with resources now,” Hoffman said. “It’s really up to figuring out how to maximize efficiency and to address these attacks accordingly with the current available skills.”
Hoffman is the only academic commissioner out of the three appointees on the panel, which also includes former Attorney General Ed Meese and former Ambassador Tim Roemer. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA), chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee that funds the FBI, expressed his confidence in the individuals chosen for the panel in a Jan. 27. press release.
“I cannot think of three more qualified individuals to serve on the commission,” Wolf wrote. “They are all men of integrity and have significant credibility and expertise on counterterrorism policy.”
Hoffman expressed his intention to bring rigorous academic knowledge and public policy to the group. He explained that, having completed two books last year, he plans to use his newfound free time for the commission’s workload.
“I think that if you’re teaching in [the] SFS, you need to be actively involved in precisely what your students are sitting in classes to learn about. So this opportunity is such an honor and privilege,” Hoffman said. “Service on the commission is not a full-time job. In that sense, I’m grateful since it allows me to simultaneously keep up my responsibilities of teaching and also work with my patriotism.”
Genevieve Lester, a fellow professor in the Security Studies Program, applauded Hoffman for his professionalism and scholastic intelligence.
“Bruce is an inspired choice for this commission. Not only is he one of the foremost scholars of terrorism, but he has also served on government commissions before. He was the first executive director of the Gilmore Commission — a commission that assessed domestic response capabilities to terrorism using weapons of mass destruction — and has held high level advisory positions, including in the Central Intelligence Agency,” Lester said.
Lester also noted that Hoffman’s broad knowledge base would help the commission during a trying time in the world of intelligence.
“Beyond Bruce’s experience, I think the best thing about this choice is that the intelligence community is now in a state of flux — the Snowden leaks, potential changes in the way intelligence activities are conducted and how oversight is done and challenges to the role of intelligence and law enforcement mean we need someone with a long view. The U.S. must become more proactive in dealing with emergent threats. Bruce has studied how terrorism and counterterrorism have changed over the past four decades and understands how institutions must rise to meet this challenge,” Lester said.

The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority has proposed modifying its current $2.6 billion D.C. Clean Rivers Project to incorporate green infrastructure into the later stages of its expansive three-tunnel anti-pollution initiative in Rock Creek and the Anacostia and Potomac rivers.
“The D.C. Clean Rivers Project is currently being implemented under a federally mandated consent decree among the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Justice, D.C. Water and the District of Columbia,” Green Infrastructure Planning Coordinator Bethany Bezak said.
The original plan, which was initiated in 2003, sought to construct three tunnels that would prevent water pollution in the Anacostia and Potomac rivers and Rock Creek due to sewer overflow caused by rainfall.
The overflows, which currently dilute approximately 1.5 billion gallons of combined sewage into the Anacostia each year, will be curbed by 98 percent when the D.C .Clean Rivers Project is tentatively completed in 2022
Since 2010, however, D.C. Water has been exploring a new modification to the original plan: green infrastructure.
“In contrast to gray infrastructure, which is the traditional method of building tunnels underneath the ground, green infrastructure engages in construction above the surface,” Bezak said.
Green infrastructure imitates the natural processes of storm water before entering the D.C. Water’s combined sewer system. Green infrastructure technologies include rain gardens, green roofs, infiltration basins and bio retention facilities.
“[Green infrastructure] will create new green jobs that are beneficial in the long-term scope,” Bezak said. “There is a long-term maintenance component to these green jobs that traditional temporary jobs during construction of gray infrastructure do not have, and this will raise employment.”
The proposal to implement green infrastructure would not affect the initial stages of the project, which include tunneling under the Anacostia River and are already underway.
“The initial phase of the project is currently being implemented, in which a large underground tunnel is being built,” Bezak said. “But the later phases that involve the Potomac River and Rock Creek is where we are proposing the changes.”
Under the new arrangement, a $90 million combined investment in green infrastructure in Rock Creek and the Potomac would replace the proposed Rock Creek section of the tunnel and significantly reduce the size of the Potomac tunnel, which would be completed in 2030.
“The construction of green infrastructure, if implemented according to the new proposal, will allow the District to see improvements in water quality as early as 2015, whereas the original plan would allow us to see the enhancements starting 2025,” Bezak said.
While enhancements to District water quality would only occur after the original plan, which calls for the construction of gray infrastructure, is completed in 2025, the new proposal allows for gradual improvements in water quality.
“The new proposal is like a step-by-step approach, where small construction will continue one by one,” Bezak said. “The original plan shows water quality enhancements in one significant blow at its completion, whereas for this new proposal we will see clear improvements in the quality of water each time one small part is completed.”
GUSA Secretary of Sustainability Gabe Pincus (SFS ’14) pointed out that the very presence of the tunnels is demonstrative of the District’s failure to support the environment.
“I think it’s unfortunate that we can’t accommodate the natural rainfall of the city, that we would even need to consider building a gigantic cistern tunnel under the river to hold all of our storm water runoff,” Pincus said.
Pincus explained that the tunnels would do little more than act as a Band-Aid for an ongoing problem.
“If we don’t adjust green space and permeable surfaces in the city, and the city continues to develop, and it inevitably will, if we don’t have standards for where we put green space in the city and how much there needs to be. And if it continues to develop, we’re going to continue to have increased storm water runoff, so building one storage container or two…that’s a patch. It’s not really addressing the root of the problem.”
D.C. Water is reaching out to local communities to collaborate on ideas as well as gain financial support for the project.
“Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E is planning to work closely with D.C. Water and communities regarding D.C. Water’s green infrastructure proposals and/or any CSO tunnel proposals,” ANC2E Commissioner Jeffrey Jones said.
In turn, local communities also hope to hear more about the proposal and the potential direction toward which the D.C. Clean Rivers Project might move in the future.
“I am hoping D.C. Water will be able to present some of these plans at an ANC2e public hearing in the near future,” Jones said. “I am supportive of plans that promote a healthier environment for all of our residents while preserving and protecting the historic character, beauty and economic vitality of Georgetown.”

As graduate students at private institutions across the country have begun pushing for recognized unions, the Georgetown Graduate Student Organization, which primarily concerns itself with community-building, has chosen to forgo unionization.
In November, the Graduate Student Organizing Committee under the United Automobile Workers labor union at New York University became the first graduate union to earn formal recognition from a private university.
In spite of the National Labor Relations Boards’ 2004 Brown University ruling that defined graduates as students —not workers with the ability to legitimately unionize — NYU students pressured the administration into formal recognition of the union through massive organization and petitioning, backed by local politicians, including then-City Council Speaker Christine Quinn.
Matt Canfield, a fifth-year NYU anthropology graduate student and member of GSOC-UAW, cited cuts to healthcare benefits and collective organizing energy as the catalysts for the upsurge in union support.
“For a long time there was a lot of pushback from the administration. They thought that those issues could be dealt with between graduate workers and the faculty and that there was really no reason for graduate employees to be organized. And eventually, I think they reached out to the university when there was significant unrest on campus,” Canfield said. Graduate employees won the vote with a 620 to 10 margin, signifying support for the union and encouraging university recognition of collective rights.
Graduate workers who unionize are often galvanized by stagnant teaching wages, rising healthcare costs and scholastic work that often outlasts granted stipends, saddling the students with debt.
“A lot of us, first of all, take more than five years, and that’s not because we’re lazing around, but also because the expectations we have from our faculty in producing quality work do require us to be here longer,” Molly Cunningham, a fifth-year University of Chicago anthropology graduate student, who is a member of her university’s unrecognized graduate union, said.
She described the mounting burdens of the longer timeframe, including high healthcare costs and billed advances on tuition for those unable to teach.
“So this is kind of a double bind when you’re being told by your faculty advisors that you need to take longer, but the university is telling you if you take any longer you’re going to have to start taking out loans in order to finish,” Cunningham said.
The union has been successful in addressing more urgent concerns on a smaller scale, causing the students in the University of Chicago’s graduate student union to choose to not seek formal recognition from the university. For example, the graduate students’ childcare campaign, an issue the students have been discussing with the university for years, has seen recent success in the creation of a scholarship program for childcare assistance for doctoral candidates, and an ongoing discussion of teaching wages.
“Those wages, they actually look good when you’re sort of still on your stipend, but once you’ve contributed to this university for five, six, seven years, and become an increasingly skilled and experienced teacher, then it sort of stops cutting it,” Cunningham said. “So that’s one thing we’re sort of developing a campaign around that we think that we could be pretty effective advocates to the administration even without formal recognition.”
Georgetown GSO primarily concerns itself with advocacy, graduate student groups and student programming, and works with an increasingly supportive administration, especially Provost Robert Groves, to reform the image of Georgetown’s graduate program and organize GSO internally.
Samuel Osea (COL ’12, GRD ’14), GSO president, agreed that graduate students often face undue challenges due to workload and low wages, but are, by contrast, supported by the university administration. He said that problems develop when administrators fail to realistically assess their graduate students’ situations, an issue Osea said does not exist at Georgetown.
“The graduate school has a great staff who has, again, been very supportive. Student affairs has been very supportive from the engagement perspective, so I don’t see us unionizing,” Osea said.
Graduate students across the school, whether they are intent on unionizing or not, agree that their voices are indispensible to the university system at Georgetown.
“When you’re looking at schools, one thing you look for is research support. Is it the type of environment where you can succeed and turn out a dissertation or thesis in the amount of time required or in the amount of time they give you?” Osea said. “I think that by having a resource such as GSO for both academic and non-academic support, I think it’s vital.”
