Two weeks after Kat DeMaret (SFS ’24) moved into her Village A apartment, she noticed water steadily leaking from the ceiling. She called facilities and immediately set up buckets to collect the water.
On Aug. 22, a few days after her first call, facilities workers came and removed parts of the ceiling to allow the piping and insulation to dry out, saying they would come back to replace the missing chunks of the ceiling. Maintenance did not return to fix the ceiling until Sept. 21, almost a month later.
From leaks like the one in DeMaret’s apartment to broken air conditioning units, The Hoya has spoken to three students who have reported submitting work orders for problems in their residences and having to wait weeks for them to be resolved.
DeMaret told The Hoya that she suspects the exposure may have caused health issues for anyone who spent time in her apartment.
“My roommates and I have all been experiencing allergy-like symptoms (coughing, sneezing, dry itchy eyes, sore throats) and any visitors in our apartment have started experiencing them after a few hours there as well,” DeMaret wrote to The Hoya prior to maintenance workers returning Sept. 21.
The situation worsened when the air conditioning in DeMaret’s apartment went out Aug. 22. DeMaret and her roommates were forced to leave the apartment for four days when it became too hot to live there. DeMaret stayed in a hotel room provided by the Office of Residential Living, while her roommates slept on friends’ couches.
Despite showing symptoms of sickness, sending multiple emails, making several calls and paying an in-person visit to the Department of Planning & Facilities Management, DeMaret received no response for weeks on when her ceiling would be fixed.
It took DeMaret’s roommate, Robin Brinkmann (SFS ’24), speaking about the issue to her colleagues at the SFS dean’s office in September to get maintenance back in the apartment to fix the ceiling.
“I work at the dean’s office so I just happened to have mentioned the issues I was having when I was on shift a couple times and then a few employees at the office directed me to communicate with Jim Duffy to move our apartment to a higher priority,” Brinkmann wrote to The Hoya. “I was in direct contact with him and I’m pretty sure he expedited our repairs.”
DeMaret is not the only one dealing with issues like broken air conditioning and delayed maintenance response times.
Air conditioning for all apartments in Nevils and LXR, which collectively house over 450 students, stopped working for five days due to a chilled water system failure spanning from Sept. 10-15. Residential Living addressed the issue in an email to affected students Sept. 12, writing that emergency maintenance had started working with contractors to fix the chiller that day.
Nevils resident Alene Hanson (COL ’23) said that it got too hot for her and her roommate to stay in the apartment at one point.
“It was pretty uncomfortable for that whole week,” Hanson wrote to The Hoya. “We had to stay at a friend’s house one night because it was difficult sleeping in our apartment.”
A university spokesperson said the university responds to facility work requests and other student reports in a timely manner.
“The safety, health and well-being of our students is our highest priority. We work through every request as diligently and expeditiously as possible,” the university spokesperson wrote to The Hoya.
DeMaret said she believes university officials have failed to protect the health and safety of their students by neglecting dire facilities and maintenance issues.
“I do not feel that my health and safety or the health and safety of my roommates are being prioritized by the university at all right now,” DeMaret wrote. “We have had to make constant effort for facilities to do something about the situation in our apartment that is actively making us sick, and they have failed to respond.”
The Hoya has independently verified all claims made in this piece by reviewing cited correspondence with facilities staff.

The Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy hosted a hybrid conference about the benefits of early childhood education later in adolescence and early adulthood.
At the conference Sept. 20, Co-directors of McCourt’s Center for Research on Children in the United States (CROCUS) Dr. Bill Gormley and Dr. Deborah Phillips shared findings from their 20-year longitudinal study on Tulsa, Oklahoma’s government-funded universal pre-K (UPK) program. The conference featured Governor Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and Distinguished University Professor and Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne as keynote speakers, among others.
Tulsa’s program, which made pre-K available to all four-year-olds on a voluntary basis, demonstrated immediate positive effects on the mental development in math performance, early literacy and attention skills of the 71% of children who enrolled, according to Gormley.
“When a student enters kindergarten in Tulsa, the single best predictor of that student’s cognitive skills at kindergarten entry is not race or gender or the mother’s education or the presence of the biological father in the child’s home, but rather it’s whether the child attended pre-K the previous year,” Gormley said in an interview with The Hoya.
The researchers initially planned to study the intersection between childhood development and public policy more generally, but were compelled to shift their focus specifically to Tulsa’s program after learning about it, according to Gormley.
“In 2001, I decided to investigate Oklahoma’s universal pre-K program, which was the second oldest in the United States, and during that investigation, I learned that no one else was looking at it,” Gormley said. “And that there was a treasure trove of data sitting around in some basement in the Tulsa public schools that was just waiting to be analyzed. So we pounced on that opportunity, and we’ve never looked back.”
Phillips said they studied children who were part of the program from childhood to college, working both inside and outside of the classroom to examine the effects that pre-K had on their development and success.
“You can really shape children’s lives in pretty powerful ways with nine months of a high-quality program,” Phillips said. “The fact that we found such strong impacts on math and early literacy in and of itself was pretty groundbreaking.”
Not only were there clear positive outcomes related to math and early literacy skills, but they also noted that childrens’ attention and self-regulation skills seemed to be better among students who had attended pre-K.
Aside from academics, attending pre-K is associated with increased civic engagement and likelihood to pursue higher forms of education, according to Gormley.
“Students who were in the Tulsa pre-K program many years ago are today more likely to be registered to vote and are more likely to vote,” Gormley said. “We have also been delighted to see that students who were in the Tulsa public school’s pre-K program years ago are much more likely to attend college today than a comparable set of students.”
A parallel study called the Tulsa School Experiences and Early Development (SEED), led by Dr. Anna Johnson, who attended the conference, follows a second generation of students in the Tulsa UPK program.
According to Johnson, her research, which explores the ways pre-K improves long-term learning trajectories for low-income students, was only possible because of Gormley and Phillips’ work.
“I’m standing on the shoulders of giants,” Johnson said. “I have been invited into this research group and to continue this next generation of research building on that earlier work.”
Johnson hopes the findings from these studies will encourage policymakers to push for UPK to be rolled out in other states.
“Rather than expect one year of preschool to, you know, put kids in the top 10 percent of test scorers, I think a realistic expectation is that these kids are better prepared for school,” Johnson said. “They’re more persistent at hard things, and they do better in life, and I think we can hope that the states that are rolling out universal pre-K will see the same effects.”
Phillips said the best part of the day was being able to publicly express her gratitude for the group at Tulsa for facilitating their research.
Moving forward in her research, Phillips said she hopes to explore the reasons why pre-K helps set students up for future success.
“My main interest really is not only in documenting impacts on children, but trying to understand the mechanisms behind those impacts: what is it that happens inside these classrooms?” Phillips said. “What’s going on between the teachers and the children and among the children that produces the outcomes that we were seeing, which were astonishingly strong.”

The McCourt School of Public Policy hosted a seminar to discuss an Oxford University professor’s book on modern international development theory.
The Sept. 19 seminar featured Director of the Oxford Centre for the Study of African Economies Stefan Dercon’s book entitled “Gambling on Development: Why Some Countries Win and Others Lose.”
This latest work from Dercon, which was published Aug. 1 by Hurst Publishers, an independent non-fiction publisher, explores contemporary factors that contribute to the varying levels of prosperity attained by developing countries. The study is approached from a number of angles, primarily using case studies from African nations including Sierra Leone, Mozambique, South Sudan and Malawi.
Dercon said witnessing the wide disparities that have grown between nations, and in particular those in Africa in the past 30 years, inspired his interest in international development.
“There are places in the last few decades that have transformed, and others haven’t,” Dercon told The Hoya. “Just trying to think about ‘What does it matter why some of these countries are successful or not?’ was just a very compelling reason for me.”
The book features conversations Dercon has had over his three decades of travel through 40 different countries researching global economies.
Specifically, Dercon’s fieldwork in China demonstrates the phenomena that is the focus of his book — where elites within an economy must risk prioritizing broad economic growth and development over other economical concerns on a gamble that doing so will lead to greater long-term benefits.
“The change in China came because the regime suddenly got really committed in the mid-1970’s and early 80’s to growth and development, not ideology,” Dercon said.
Andrew Zeitlin, an assistant professor at the McCourt School and research assistant at the Center, said the key takeaway from the book is that those with political power must take risks to prioritize long-term success in their countries.
“The emergence of a bargain in which the elites of an economy agree that although there are other ways to make your life nice, the way that they want to pursue is a route that operates through the growth of an economy as a whole,” Zeitlin told The Hoya. “That central thesis locates his answer to why some economies grow faster than others in a political bargain, rather than a set of economic policy prescriptions.”
James Habyarimana, professor at the McCourt School and former co-director of Georgetown’s Initiative on Innovation, Development and Evaluation, an initiative working to incubate and evaluate effective development solutions, said this choice is not an easy one to make.
“Where development is going to be much, much harder, the gamble is even less attractive,” Habyarimana said in an interview with The Hoya. “And so the choices these politicians have is, do you want to solve a really, really hard problem, with a high chance of failing, or do you, essentially, want to play the game as usual?”
Habyarimana said this decision relates to his work in international development on a more local scale.
“I work at the level of schools and health facilities, so in some ways this bigger-picture idea of producing economic growth is not immediately salient in my work,” Habyarimana said. “I am very familiar with the choices and decisions made by different governments, where in my work, in some ways, makes me think about a very similar kind of bargain happening at the level of education or health.”
According to Dercon, existing literature on international development can often patronize the people living in the countries being studied, which was something he actively tried to avoid.
“What I was really pleased with is the reaction I’ve had in the countries about which I wrote, from Nigeria, from Bangladesh,” Dercon said. “I don’t feel like people feel patronized.”
Dercon also said the book is not just for academics, but anyone curious about the field of international development.
“If you work as a practitioner or are an interested party, could you read it? That was definitely my goal,” Dercon said. “This is not a popular book, but it’s a book that is aimed at those people who are interested in it and want to learn more.”

Washington, D.C. bars, restaurants and breweries will be permitted to stay open for 24 hours during the 2022 FIFA World Cup after the D.C. Council passed an emergency act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The 2022 World Cup Emergency Amendment Act of 2022, introduced by Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie, will permit bars and restaurants with the appropriate licensure to sell and serve alcohol until 4:00 a.m., and operate 24 hours of the day during the World Cup later this year. In order to operate 24/7 starting on Nov. 20 until Dec. 18, when the World Cup concludes, licensed alcohol suppliers are required to enroll with the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board, which entails a $100 fee, by Nov. 17.
Jared Powell, chief of staff of the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration (ABRA), said he believes that the emergency legislation will benefit bars and soccer fans alike.
“The Act will allow establishments to host patrons who wish to watch the month-long sporting event live since there is a seven-hour time difference between Qatar and DC,” Powell wrote to The Hoya.
According to Powell, the emergency act is subject to approval from Mayor Muriel Bowser, who is expected to approve the act after agreeing to similar legislation for the 2018 World Cup, after which the act will become law in advance of the World Cup.
Roneeka Bhagotra-Gordon, co-founder of D.C.-based British bar The Queen Vic, said World Cups are always a highlight for the establishment.
“Past World Cups have been incredibly fun and great for business — our regulars and staff always look forward to them,” Bhagotra-Gordon wrote to The Hoya. “We expect the same this year, just with earlier mornings and colder weather.”
The 2022 World Cup will be the first World Cup tournament held during the winter because of the extreme summer heat in Qatar.
The District passed similar legislation for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the 2018 MLB All-Star Game, both of which took place in D.C. Both events saw the approval of extended alcohol hours identical to that of the 2022 Emergency Act, according to Powell. However, limitations on the sale of alcoholic beverages will remain in place, barring service from 4:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.
“The 4:00 a.m. end time aligns with the service end time for the Extended Holiday Hours Program,” Powell wrote. “Current DC law allows for alcohol sales and service to start at 6:00 a.m. If approved, licensees will be issued an extended hours license for the series that they must post next to their alcohol license.”
Bhagotra-Gordon said that while she was not surprised by the D.C. Council’s decision to pass this legislation, she is grateful that the legislation allows her to benefit while showing the World Cup.
As a bar founded by immigrants from the United Kingdom, The Queen Vic will open early for group stage games involving England, Wales and the United States. Once the knockout rounds begin, however, kickoffs will occur after 10 a.m., thus removing the need for the bar to be open in the early morning.
Despite the extended hours, Bhagotra-Gordon believes most District bars, including The Queen Vic, will not be open 24 hours during the World Cup. This is largely a result of the ongoing staffing shortages and a more convenient schedule in the latter stages of the tournament.
“I don’t believe many bars will stay open 24/7,” Bhagotra-Gordon wrote. “Bars are still struggling to find staff so doubling opening hours will be a huge challenge.”
Bhagotra-Gordon said the move to expand hours during the World Cup will provide soccer fans with an opportunity to congregate and watch the World Cup with friends, despite the hours at which matches will be held.
“We do believe that it will be beneficial for fans; having the opportunity to come together for these types of international events is always positive for the community,” Bhagotra-Gordon wrote.

Longtime friend of Pope Francis and leading contemporary facilitator of Catholic-Jewish interreligious dialogue Rabbi Abraham Skorka joined Georgetown’s Center for Jewish Civilization (CJC) this fall as a senior research fellow.
In his new role at Georgetown, Skorka will serve as the senior research fellow for Jewish Studies and Jewish-Christian Relations. He brings five decades of ministerial experience to the role, which will help guide his research on changing world views towards antisemitism, strengthen Jewish life on campus and teach a CJC course in the Spring 2023 semester. Skorka will also continue work on a book that looks at the historical Jewish understanding of antisemitism. Skorka has previously taught courses at Georgetown, but now transitioned to a permanent role.
Skorka previously served as the rector of Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Alongside former Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio, now known as Pope Francis, Skorka spearheaded a series of 31 Catholic-Jewish interfaith conversations on topics ranging from fundamentalism to LGBTQ+ rights. He also co-authored “Sobre el cielo y la tierra,” which translates in English to “On Heaven and Earth,” with the pope, a literary guide to embodying religious faith in the 21st century. 
Skorka said his primary focus will be to model methodologies for effective interreligious exchange, and that he hopes students will be able to gather valuable insights from his first-hand experiences connecting Catholic and Jewish faith communities.
According to Skorka, he hopes his course in the second semester will teach students to understand how the Jewish tradition recognizes human existence. 
“The subject that I have chosen to teach in the second semester is that of the Jewish conception of the human being,” Skorka wrote to The Hoya. “What am I as a person? What does the human being mean? These are the questions that overwhelm us during our existence. The idea of ​​the course is to analyze how Jewish sources answer these questions.”
Skorka previously taught Jewish studies at St. Joseph’s University and Gratz College. According to Skorka, his teaching philosophy, which he developed through direct interactions with students at these institutions and in Buenos Aires, approaches scholastic inquiry with the same empathy he practices in his everyday life.
“A community spiritual leader cannot become an administrator of his community,” Skorka wrote. “You must recreate your spirituality day after day, and for this you must study in the sacred texts, in the writings of the wise men of the past, meditate on them and recreate the message. 
President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) said he is confident Skorka will make a significant impact on and off campus, informed by his extensive expertise.
“We have cherished our past experiences with Rabbi Skorka, and we are truly honored to welcome him into this new role in our community and for the continued opportunity we have to engage his insights as a scholar of Jewish Studies and his perspectives as an international leader in interfaith engagement,” DeGioia wrote to The Hoya.
CJC Director and Professor Bruce Hoffman, who has collaborated with Skorka on Georgetown Jewish Life programming initiatives in the past, said he is excited about the direct engagement Skorka will have with students.
“Rabbi Skorka is blessed to live very close to campus and to have offices both off-campus and in the CJC’s ICC space,” Hoffman wrote to The Hoya. “He is always eager to interact with students, and has deep knowledge of the Talmud. We knew how much richness of knowledge he has to offer our students and the CJC had been working actively with the President’s Office to finally bring him to campus on a full-time basis.”
According to Adjunct Professor Fr. Dennis McManus, S.J., who previously taught a course with Skorka during the 2021 spring semester, Skorka’s kindness and sincerity, rather than his extensive accomplishments, define him as an educator. 
“The most obvious and first thing that you take from him is what a warm human being he is,” McManus said to The Hoya. “You may or may not be aware that he is a rabbi, ethicist, or a Talmudist, but from the first contact you have, he immediately treats you with such respect, such dignity.”
Rabbi Skorka said he hopes members of the Georgetown community from different walks of life will congregate to spark conversations.
“Without the presence of sincere, profound dialogue between individuals and with God, life becomes unbearable,” Skorka wrote. “Dialogue must be the tool for all human relationships, because in its absence only violence prevails.”

Georgetown University students have raised over $4,000 for Pakistanis who were displaced by severe flooding that has left one-third of the country underwater.
The Muslim Students Association (MSA) and the South Asian Society (SAS) co-sponsored an open-mic event in the Healey Family Student Center (HFSC) Social Room on Sept. 22 to raise money to provide aid for those affected by the floods. All the funds raised from the event were donated to Helping Hand for Relief and Development (HHRD), a humanitarian organization working on-site in Pakistan to provide food, clean water, temporary shelter and more to those displaced by the flooding.
MSA President Manahal Fazal (SFS ’24) said this catastrophe is only the beginning of the disastrous effects of climate change playing out in Pakistan.
“Pakistan has experienced floods in the past; however, these floods have been far more severe than anything the county has seen,” Fazal wrote to The Hoya. “Another critical point to keep in mind is that Pakistan has the most glaciers outside of the north and south poles. We are already seeing the results of climate change, and at the scale it is going right now, it will only get worse.”
According to a Sept. 21 report by UNICEF, approximately 33 million people, including 16 million children, have been impacted by the floods since they began in June 2022, with as many as 7 million being temporarily displaced. 
SAS Multicultural Chair Sanchi Rohira (SFS ’24) said the fundraiser, which is still accepting donations, greatly exceeded the expectations HHRD had for the event.
Full disclosure: Sanchi Rohira is a news staffer at The Hoya.
The fundraiser featured eight individual and pair performances and four performing arts groups, including both of Georgetown’s South Asian dance teams Guzaarish and Jawani, as well as Latin dance group Ritmo y Sabor and co-ed a cappella group the Saxatones. The fundraiser also had a silent auction featuring artwork donated by members of the campus community. 
Nile Adhami (COL ’25), the director of programming of MSA and the social chair of SAS, said the event served as an opportunity to celebrate students’ artistic abilities while raising funds for an important cause.
“We decided to make this event an open-mic night to highlight the diverse performing arts talents within the South Asian community, as well as the broader Georgetown community,” Adhami wrote to The Hoya.
Fazal said they chose to donate to HHRD because someone from the organization reached out to MSA asking if the club was going to do anything about the flooding, and they knew it was a trustworthy organization that would have a positive impact on Pakistan. Saad Abbasi, a representative from HHRD, gave a short presentation on the work the organization does and thanked the Georgetown community, SAS and MSA for putting on the event.
Adhami said when Fazal introduced the idea for the fundraiser in late August, event planners immediately began looking for other student organizations to collaborate with.
“The need to act in solidarity and work to help the people of Pakistan struggling under this immense climate-change driven disaster was obvious, and we quickly got to work in reaching out to the South Asian Society (of which I am the social chair) to have their help as a co-sponsor,” Adhami wrote. 
Rohira said nearly 200 people showed up to the fundraiser, double what the organizers were expecting.
“So many people in our community made me proud through their engagement with this event,” Rohira wrote to The Hoya. “Our performers and silent auction artists stepped up by bringing their outstanding talent to raise money for a cause as important as this.”
Rohira said she is glad student attendees recognized the significance of this catastrophe and showed up to provide their support.
“Ultimately, the event was only successful because enough members of the Georgetown community understood the importance of spending their Thursday night in recognition of one of the most devastating natural disasters in South Asia’s history, and in solidarity with the people of Pakistan,” Rohira wrote.

The famed Komodo dragon, the Amur tiger and the European glass lizard are just a few of the 19 new animals at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo.
These species were gradually introduced to Washington, D.C.’s largest zoo over the past two and a half years, adding to the zoo’s already large and diverse collection of more than 360 species. The new animals will provide an exciting new experience for visitors returning to the zoo after pandemic-related closures and restrictions, but will also enrich the research on animal behavior and conservation that the Smithsonian is doing. 
Alexandra DeCandia, a Georgetown University biology professor and research fellow at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, said the increased exhibition size offers something for everyone.
“For reptile enthusiasts, the European glass lizard presents something truly unique: it looks like a snake, but it’s actually a legless lizard,” DeCandia wrote to The Hoya.“For people interested in fuzzier creatures, the lineup of new carnivores offers exciting opportunities to see the famously-expressive facial expressions of Pallas’ cats and smell the decidedly-popcorn-esque aroma of binturongs.”
Other new species at the zoo include the rock hyrax, black tree monitor, prehensile-tailed porcupine, siamang, lemur leaf frog, binturong, cave salamander, collared brown lemur, Vietnamese mossy frog, Australian snake-necked turtle, golden-headed lion tamarin, Panamanian golden frog, sand cat, Henkel’s leaf-tailed gecko and Pallas’ cat.
DeCandia said the more obscure animals will expose visitors to animals they may not have previously heard of.
“Higher-profile species like the Amur tiger or Komodo dragon often attract visitors to the zoo, but the lesser known species like the Vietnamese mossy frog, prehensile-tailed porcupine, Australian snake-necked turtle, and southern tamandua introduce visitors to something new,” DeCandia wrote. “They can pique interest in the stories behind these species and the habitats they come from.”
The vast majority of new animals can be found at the zoo can be found at the Small Mammal House and the Reptile Discovery Center. 
While the new species provide a source of entertainment for tourists and D.C. residents, they also present an opportunity for researchers at the zoo to engage with species they have never worked with first-hand and learn more. 
A Komodo dragon named Onyx was introduced to the zoo in December 2020 and joins Murphy, another Komodo dragon that has been at the zoo for two decades. 
Studying Onyx will enrich the zoo’s researchers’ understanding of his species, according to a press release about Onyx’s introduction.
“Caring for Murphy has contributed to Reptile Discovery Center’s wealth of knowledge about these lizards. Keepers have not had a young dragon in their care for nearly two decades, so they look forward to getting to know Onyx and continuing to learn about these incredible reptiles,” the press release reads.
Edward Barrows, Georgetown biology professor and director of the Georgetown Center for the Environment, a forum for the discussion, dissemination and awareness of environmental issues, said the new species also provide valuable educational opportunities.
“The Smithsonian National Zoological Park is a fine place for all to enhance their life-time learning,” Barrows wrote to The Hoya. “There is so much to know about each native and exotic species there, even many plants which have entered the Zoo on their own. The new species are wonderful and add to our education.” 
Aside from its educational benefits, as a conservation zoo, the National Zoo plays an important role protecting species. 
“Human actions have pushed innumerable species into threatened or endangered statuses in the wild,” DeCandia wrote. “Organizations like the National Zoo actively pursue wildlife conservation and education to inspire people to join the fight.”
The wide breadth of exhibitions at the National Zoo provides a unique avenue for people to interact with other species. 
“The National Zoo is one of my favorite places in D.C.,” DeCandia wrote. “It offers everyone – from school children to educators to policy makers to senior citizens – the opportunity to stand face-to-face with the other inhabitants of our planet and learn about their stories.”

The Georgetown Venture Lab, a workspace which provides resources and mentorship to early-stage startups run by Georgetown alumni, welcomed its newest Georgetown Startup Accelerator cohort. 
The Georgetown Startup Accelerator (GSA), founded in 2020, provides mentorship for entrepreneurs to take the next steps with their businesses. The nine-week virtual program features opportunities to connect with fellow entrepreneurs in the program, as well as connecting members of the Georgetown community who may be interested in investing in the startups. GSA recruits mentors to match the needs of each startup by assessing who would be the best fit for the particular company, drawing from both people who have been involved in GSA programs before, and those who have not.
This year’s cohort featured 10 companies and 18 entrepreneurs and founders, including Carlos Bello (GRD ’22), co-founder of Budeli, a food delivery app seeking to make food delivery more sustainable by making multiple deliveries at one time to apartment complexes.
Bello said the partnering of mentors was important in nurturing the growth of his startup.
“The real value is having someone with deep subject matter expertise, being able to critically look and examine and make your case bulletproof, which is what he’s trying to do,” Bello said in an interview with The Hoya. “And that’s what we need.” 
Jeff Reid, founding director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative, said GSA is an opportunity for startups to be matched with mentors that will best serve their particular interests and support them as they continue to grow.
“We recruit mentors, after we know which companies are in the program,” Reid said in an interview with The Hoya. “So we recruited mentors specifically to match the needs of the companies. And some of the mentors are people who have been involved in our programs before and we know they’re going to be a good fit. Others are people that we may not have worked with before, but we also believe they will be a good fit for our particular company.”
Max Gottlieb (COL ’14) said collaborating with other entrepreneurs in the cohort and their support is an invaluable part of the support that the Georgetown Startup Accelerator provides. 
“It’s a wonderful group,” Gottlieb said in an interview with The Hoya. “You get to learn from others who are going through the startup process with the cohort. And I don’t care what anybody tells you; it has its ups, its downs, it’s scary, it’s exciting, it’s stressful. It’s all the emotions and all the feelings, but it’s wonderful.” 
The culmination of the program is a Nov. 8 Demo Day, where the startups showcase their companies to the campus community. Attendees will range from entrepreneurs, to mentors and to investors.
Cesar Correa Parker (GRD ‘13) said Demo Day allows for investors to gain a full understanding of the startups’ products. 
“The way that Demo Day works is that we are going to have to prepare a video, and this video is going to be presented to the investors,” Parker said to The Hoya. “So you know by that point, we are hoping to meet all the expectations of our types of investors in terms of having a product, and with the scalability and with the business plan, that it’s appealing to investors.”
Tonya Sloans (GRD ‘08) said she is grateful for the program that has helped her even after she graduated.
“I’m grateful that Georgetown didn’t just leave me at graduation back in 2008,” Sloans said to The Hoya. “But there’s now more programming that is widely available to me. And that’s made a big difference in my business world today.”
Reid said he expects the program to grow in the future. 
“I expect the accelerator to continue to attract amazing entrepreneurs from all over the world to help them grow their businesses and connect with the Georgetown community.” Reid said to The Hoya. “So I think the program will grow in terms of interest, and maybe we’ll be able to add multiple cohorts in a given year.”

CW: This article references/discusses gun violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Hundreds of protesters rallied at Capitol Hill in favor of HR.1808, a bill that would enact a federal ban on semi-automatic weapons. 
The protest, which occurred Sept. 22, was organized by March Fourth, a nonprofit advocacy group working to federally ban assault weapons. Many protesters were survivors or related to victims of major mass shootings throughout American history. Both survivors from the 1999 Columbine High School shooting and the more recent May 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, attended.
According to their website, March Fourth aims to activate as many voices as possible to share stories and emotion with those who make the legislative decisions.
Geena Panzitta (COL ’23), the former co-chair of March For Our Lives’ Georgetown chapter, attended Thursday’s rally and said the personal anecdotes shared by survivors made the protest even more impactful. 
“Survivors spoke about the PTSD and survivor’s guilt they continue to experience. Parents spoke about their children that were gunned down at school,” Panzitta wrote to The Hoya. “It was powerful seeing these communities come together to fight for a safer America, but it was heartbreaking that they had to be there in the first place, that they were part of the ever-growing group of people affected by mass shootings.”
In 1994, an assault weapons ban was deemed constitutional by the Supreme Court and was put into effect until it expired in 2004. Following the expiration of the assault weapons ban, yearly deaths attributed to mass shootings rose. During the period in which the assault weapons ban was active, the risk of a person in the United States dying in a mass shooting was 70% lower, and nine fewer mass-shooting related fatalities per 10,000 shooting deaths were reported.
Panzitta said the event emphasized the effectiveness of an assault weapons ban given trends noted during the 10 years in which the assault weapon ban was in place.
“When the ban expired, the use of assault weapons in mass shootings spiked, particularly in public mass shootings,” Panzitta wrote. “ Federal assault weapon bans work. They save lives.”
HR.1808, which was introduced by U.S. Representative David Cicilline (D-RI, LAW ’86), passed the House of Representatives in July. The law would criminalize the importation, sale, manufacturing, transfer or possession of semiautomatic assault weapons of large capacity ammunition feeding devices.   
Gun reform activists across the country have stressed the importance of passing HR.1808, and criticized inaction from pro-gun rights Republicans in Congress. Many Republican senators continue to receive funding from the National Rifle Association, which poses a problem for their ability to govern, according to Panzitta.
“These senators are cowards, putting their own political careers before the lives of the people they’re meant to represent,” Panzitta wrote. “The leading cause of death in children and teens is gun violence, yet these senators continue to do nothing about it.”
March for Our Lives Washington, D.C., Press Associate Mikah Rector-Brooks said they believe partisan politics will only perpetuate otherwise preventable deaths from gun violence. 
“Given the composition of the Senate and the continuous inaction of elected officials, it is an uphill battle to get the Assault Weapons Ban passed,” Rector-Brooks wrote to The Hoya. “When the livelihood of Americans is at risk, though, it is essential for politicians to prioritize the safety of their constituents over party politics.”
The bill specifically targets semi-automatic weapons, which have been the most common weapon used in mass shootings over the past few decades, according to Rector-Brooks. 
“Semi-automatic weapons have contributed significantly to the mass deaths caused by firearms in the United States,” Rector-Brooks wrote. “From Parkland, Buffalo and Uvalde to communities across the country, we have seen these weapons of war kill and devastate communities.”
Panzitta said the event highlighted the failure of state laws to combat the prominence of gun violence and mass shootings and the importance of a broader, more effective solution.
“State laws are clearly not enough,” Panzitta wrote. “We need federal legislation, and we need it now.”

D.C. Public Library (DCPL) participated in Banned Books Week from Sept. 19 to Sept. 24, hosting a series of special programs and activities celebrating the freedom to read.
Banned Books Week celebrates literary freedom and acknowledges current and historical attempts to censor books in libraries and schools. Events throughout the week included an author talk with George M. Johnson, the honorary chair of Banned Books Week 2022 and the author of “All Boys Aren’t Blue,” which was one of the most challenged books during 2021. DCPL also held a discussion on banned books and cancel culture with award-winning author Panama Jackson, HuffPost Opinion Editor Stephen A. Crockett Jr. and other panelists.
Launched in 1982 by free speech Judith Krug, the initiative was created in response to an unexpected surge in the number of book challenges in public schools and libraries. Today, the event is sponsored by several organizations dedicated to fighting censorship including the American Library Association (ALA).
Richard Reyes-Gavilan, executive director of DCPL, said the week draws attention to the harms of censorship by focusing on efforts nationwide to remove or restrict access to books. 
“Book banning is a direct assault on libraries in their role as first amendment institutions,” Reyes-Gavilan wrote in a press release. “Free and open access to information is foundational to our existence and it is therefore critical that we expose attempts at censorship whenever we encounter them.”
The most common reasons books have been challenged or censored include if the book is considered to contain sexually explicit content, offensive language or is “unsuited to any age group.” Book banning rose in 2021, as the ALA recorded 729 book challenges targeting 1,597 titles, a figure more than double the numbers seen in 2020 and the highest figures since the ALA began recording data in 2000.
A report from nonprofit organization PEN America found that 41% of books banned during the past year were targeted due to content related to the LGBTQ+ community. In a list of the top 10 challenged books of 2021, compiled by the ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom, “Gender Queer” by Maia Kobabe sits at the top of the list. Kobabe’s book, which is a memoir centered around the exploration of gender identity, is followed by several other titles involving LGBTQ+ content, such as “Lawn Boy” by Jonathan Evison and “All Boys Aren’t Blue” by George M. Johnson. 
George Williams, media relations manager for DCPL, said recent censorship attempts across the country have been to books with content that relates to the LGBTQ+ community. 
“The American Library Association has been tracking the number of books that have been challenged and many of those books have been written by authors of color or deal with LGBTQ+ related affairs, particularly LGBTQ+-related items from the perspective of people of color,” Williams told The Hoya.
According to Meg Meiman, Associate Librarian at Lauinger Library, it is important to raise awareness about book banning for those who may not be aware of its prevalence today.
“Sometimes students are surprised that there is such a long history of banning books and that this practice still continues in all types of libraries across the country and around the world,” Meiman told the Hoya. 
According to Meiman, Lau makes sure to include access to books that have been challenged or censored across the country. 
“There are no criteria or processes for banning books in the Georgetown University Library, because we value intellectual freedom, and have a commitment to promoting open research and scholarly dialogue,” Meiman wrote. “The shelves of the University Library hold hundreds of books that have been banned or challenged over the years.”
While challenges to books are much more common in public and school libraries than at university libraries, Lau supports the ALA’s stance that communication is essential to the preservation of a free society and remains committed to promoting this message.
“Providing uncensored, free access to books offers readers the opportunity to engage with thoughts and ideas that may differ from their own,” Meiman wrote. “This allows people to expand their understanding of the world as well as their ability to contribute to society.” 
Wiliams said that beyond supporting initiatives like Banned Books week, it is important to ensure equality of access to all kinds of books and subjects.
“It is fundamental to make sure that libraries across the country are funded adequately,” Williams said, “Because even if a book isn’t banned, if a library does not have adequate funding to buy and maintain its collection, it won’t be able to offer books of a variety of viewpoints.”

The Georgetown University Black Alumni Council held a conversation to discuss scholarship and activism as Black woman scholars and leaders in academia during a time of heightened calls for racial justice.
The event, titled “The Intersection of Academy and Activism: A Critical Conversation with Black Leaders and Scholars,” was held Sept. 20 as a part of the Critical Conversation Series, a series of talks that has been hosted over the past few months by the Black Alumni Council. Speakers discussed their personal experiences, offering anecdotes and advice to students about being a Black woman leader in higher education. 
The event featured Dr. Nadia Brown, professor of government, chair of the women’s and gender studies program and affiliate in the African American studies program, Dr. Adanna Johnson, associate vice president for Student Equity and Inclusion and leader of the Office of Student Equity and Inclusion, and was moderated by McDonough School of Business Professor Melissa Bradley (MSB ’89).
Brown said she developed a new mission statement while working in political science that no longer attempts to validate Black women’s political experiences, but rather focuses on their sense of belonging. 
“My mission statement in this work lately has been I belong here, and stepping into that fully, I want other people to see that themselves: that they belong here too,” Brown said during the event. “While there are systems that try to push people out, or make you feel other, or unwelcome or marginalized, I think we need to take space, and make space for other people, because I would not be here, if it weren’t others, and I want others to be here once I am no longer here.”
At the event, Bradley said Black employees make up fewer than 10% of higher education professionals and just 8% of all administrators. Black women make up only 2.1% of tenured associate or full professors at U.S. universities, and at Georgetown, 2.8% of tenured professors are Black women.
Johnson spoke about the isolating effects of these statistics and said women, and more specifically, Black women, have to navigate racist and sexist academic spaces in order to get tenure and full professorship, despite their qualifications and research expertise. 
“I will say that as an administrator, when you speak to those statistics, which I see the presence of every day, it feels even more isolating in a position of leadership,” Johnson said at the event. “It’s really hard because you don’t always have folks that you can talk to, because you’re sort of at the top of of your department and people are looking to you to navigate challenges, to problem solve for some of the things that they face related to bias discrimination barriers.”
Brown says that it is important to prioritize mental health amid the burnout that activism and work as a Black woman leader and scholar in higher education can cause.
“I find it really important to take meticulous care of myself, as a Black woman. Often we are expected to save ourselves for last, if at all, and prioritizing the work for some of us has meant not prioritizing ourselves at all,” Johnson said. “I prioritize taking care of myself every single day, consistently, unapologetically, and I know that prioritizing my spiritual, mental and physical well being allows me to show up better for my family, my community and my work here at Georgetown.”
Brown said that as a Black feminist, it is necessary to prioritize intersectional advocacy on both gender-based and racial issues.
“As a methodology, my work is about liberation, right?” Brown said. “You can’t be an Africana scholar and not care about your people and writing work that is not libratory, and so it comes and looks at different forms. There’s always work to be done, and that sets your research agenda.”
Johnson said her experiences in the past four years working at Georgetown highlighted the important work of students, in addition to faculty and leaders, in promoting diversity on campus.
“I’ve seen our students work in ways, like with the Black Survivors Coalition, to change the landscape of what our colleagues look like in the counseling center, it’s a much more diverse place than when I started,” Johnson said.
Brown said she recognizes the importance of showing Black women their potential to be leaders in higher education. 
“I think my biggest flex as a professor is that I am teaching the next generation of students,” Brown said. “There are just so few Black professors, there are such few Black women professors, that my job isn’t to create little mes, my job is to show them the possibilities so that they can create themselves.”

Visiting Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) professor Mark Gaston Pearce testified before Congress regarding a pro-workers’ and union rights bill.
Pearce, the former chairman of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and executive director of the Workers’ Rights Institute (WRI), testified on Capitol Hill on Sept. 14 about the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). The PRO Act, which the House of Representatives passed in 2021, seeks to protect workers’ rights to join a union.
Pearce answered questions about the bill and recent unionizing efforts across the nation at the hearing, entitled “In Solidarity: Removing Barriers to Organizing.”
“Unions protected workers during the pandemic,” Pearce said in his testimony. “I commend the PRO Act for attempting to create greater parity and predictability by making injunctive relief in the event of employer unfair labor practices mandatory in a greater number of cases.”
According to a House Committee on Education and Labor fact sheet, the PRO Act introduces monetary penalties for companies violating workers’ rights, expands collective bargaining powers and prevents employer interference in union elections.
WRI Program Director Olivia Vita coordinated the process of researching, planning and editing Pearce’s testimony while Pearce’s two research assistants, Daphne Assimakopoulos (GRD ’23) and Shiva Sethi (GRD ’24), helped to compile research and also accompanied him at the hearing.
According to Assimakopoulos, the PRO Act expands upon the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (NLRA), which protected early labor unions but has become largely ineffective as it has not been amended since 1947.
House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) said speakers like Pearce helped illuminate the need for legislation that gives workers their power back following the erosion of NLRA provisions.
“As our hearing witnesses made clear, decades of Republican and corporate attacks have rendered the National Labor Relations Act toothless, allowing unscrupulous employers to intimidate and retaliate against their workers,” Scott wrote to The Hoya. “If we are serious about giving workers the tools they need to succeed in the modern economy, the Senate must pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act and ensure workers can collectively bargain for higher wages, better benefits, and safer workplaces.”
With over 40 years of experience in labor law, Pearce said his familiarity with the flaws of current union legislation guided his Sept. 14 testimony.
“I saw the problems that exist, the challenges that we have in litigation, the challenges that we have with respecting workers seeking to organize, the way the administrative proceedings are set up, the complexities and the built in delays that have affected some workers’ abilities to freely choose to organize,” Pearce told The Hoya. “It has been the case that there’s a 14% increase in unfair labor practices.”
Pearce and both research assistants said a highlight of the trial was the testimony of Starbucks barista Michelle Eisen about her struggle to unionize in response to the company’s mistreatment of workers during the pandemic.
“So many corporations were making profits hand over fist, and they were not reciprocating by providing better working conditions for their workers,” Pearce said. “Workers learned a hard lesson that employers are not concerned about their welfare and they have to protect themselves.”
Edwin Egee, vice president of government relations and workforce development at the National Retail Foundation, said the PRO Act limits employer rights.
“This deeply flawed legislation would infringe on employers’ due process rights, interfere with small businesses’ ability to secure legal advice on complex labor matters, expand joint employer liability, and strip away critical ‘secondary boycott’ protections that prevent a union from boycotting a neutral employer,” Egee wrote to The Hoya.
Pearce said that in the meantime, WRI will continue to coordinate events and initiatives that support workers.
“Our goal is to educate the low wage workers with respect to their rights, to advocate for labor reform and to engage in research where we can analyze factors that create the disparity of wealth and what we can do to improve it,” Pearce said. “It’s not just about workers being able to unionize. It’s about workers also being able to realize economic equity through means of self determination, which includes going into business for themselves.”

D.C. Theatre Week, an annual event celebrating the kickoff of the 2022-23 theater season, returned to Washington, D.C.  for the first time since 2019. 
The event will be held from Sept. 22 to Oct. 9 and tickets give attendees access to a wide variety of events. From six-time Tony Award-winning musical “Dear Evan Hansen” to 11-time Tony Award-nominated “The Color Purple,” attendees will receive discounted tickets to several plays and musicals in the D.C. area.
Theatre Week co-producer Christopher Michael Richardson said the event will feature free social events for theater lovers in the District. 
“This year, we’ve got exciting new partnerships including a DC Theatre Night at The Nats, Theatre Week Happy Hours peppered throughout (Studio Theatre, Synetic Theatre, Creative Cauldron, Round House Theatre, & Signature Theatre), and a free outdoor concert at The Wharf on the 24th,” Richardson wrote to The Hoya. “We’re so excited to have these new connections and share the wonderful work of DMV area theatres with the broader DC community.”
The event’s Kickoff Fest will have performances, workshops, interactive game shows, prize drawings and popup stalls from over 40 local theaters. Anyone can attend the free Sept. 24 event at Arena Stage at the D.C. Wharf.
Richardson said the event will be particularly enriching for college students, whether they are trying to become more involved in community theater or simply looking for leisure activities and free food.
“The Kick Off Fest is a great place to connect with representatives from area theatres and learn more about their student programs, discounts, and offerings THROUGHOUT the year, not just during Theatre Week,” Richardson wrote. “Theatre Week allows students to discover all the DMV has to offer in terms of theatre with a lower cost and more perks.”
Richardson said Theatre Week is also a great opportunity to explore the richness of arts and culture in the DMV area. 
“Theatre Week’s primary goal is to highlight and uplift the work that all of these fantastic theatres are doing,” Richardson wrote. “Programs like Theatre Week remind us of our collective community and the Broadway caliber theatre that happens right here in the DMV.”
Richardson also said he hopes the event will reach audiences throughout the District, not just those who are already part of the D.C. theater scene.
“Theatre Week is a great opportunity to welcome new audiences and make new theatre lovers with discounts that lower the cost barrier and encourage the DC community to try something new, ” Richardson wrote. “As we head into a new season of theatre in the DMV, Theatre Week encourages all of us to try new things and broaden our horizons.”  
President and CEO of Theatre Washington Amy Austin said this year’s Theatre Week aims to celebrate how theater in the District has persevered through the pandemic and will be bigger and better than previous iterations.
“We are taking over all three floors of Arena Stage, a beautiful and spacious venue. And it’s our first partnership with DCWharf and the Mayor’s Office (#202Creates) to host the concert on the Wharf,” Austin wrote to the Hoya.
COVID is still impacting theatres across the D.C, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV) area. DC Theatre announced in early September that over 50 theatres across the DMV would be continuing their indoor masking requirement to keep employees and patrons safe. 
As the first Theatre Week to be held since 2019, the events will celebrate how DC Theatre has persevered despite pandemic-related shutdowns and mandates. 
Austin said she hopes Theatre Week will revitalize residents’ appreciation for arts and culture in the District. 
“Theatre Week gives them access to many places at exceptional prices,” Austin wrote. “They will find our art scene exciting in its diversity and extensive collaboration. That is what sets us apart from other places.”
