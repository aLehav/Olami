A student was robbed at gunpoint Wednesday evening at 36th and O Streets, according to a public safety alert sent out by the Department of Public Safety Thursday morning.
While the student was walking north on 36th Street toward O Street at about 10:20 p.m., a black male in his mid-twenties began following her, according to the PSA. He then grabbed her purse, and when she fled into a courtyard on 36th Street, he followed her and threatened her with a handgun. He then took her purse and iPhone, according to the PSA.
The suspect, who is further described in the PSA as having shoulder-length dreadlock hair and wearing a black T-shirt and possibly jeans, then fled in an unknown direction.
MPD responded to the scene, but could not find anyone matching the description. An investigation is ongoing.
