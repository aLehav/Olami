As Georgetown University Student Association executive candidates seek to make their platforms relevant to students, trust in student government remains low, raising fears of low voter turnout.
Of the respondents, 2 percent rated their current trust in GUSA as strong, while 38.9 percent listed their trust in GUSA as weak, according to a door-to-door poll of 615 students conducted by The Hoya on Wednesday evening. 35 percent of respondents said they were uncertain.
Outgoing GUSA President Juan Martinez (SFS ’20) also expressed concerns about how many students will go to the polls. 58 percent of respondents said they planned to vote in today’s election, while 42 percent said they are not planning to vote.
“I’m kind of worried for this vote count, just seeing the enthusiasm or the attention given to these elections,” Martinez said at The Hoya’s post-debate analysis Tuesday. “I’m wondering how many people are going to turn out at the polls, how many people are actually going to vote and how is that going to impact the person who gets elected, or how is that going to give more credence to this movement about abolishing GUSA or maybe just fundamentally restructuring GUSA.”
Overall voter turnout was 39 percent last year and 38 percent in 2017, according to the GUSA Election commission.
In a campaign season dominated by outsider tickets and unprecedented circumstances, candidates are striving to engage students with relevant platforms.
The four tickets vying for the GUSA executive in today’s election are Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Aleida Olvera (COL ’20); Nicki Gray (NHS ’20); Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) and Roya Wolfe (SFS ’21); Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) and John Dolan (MSB ’20).

Throughout the campaign season for this year’s Georgetown University Student Association executive election, the four tickets have focused not only on their policies, but also the rules and processes of the race.
In today’s election, the ballots will offer voters the opportunity to rank candidates by order of preference. Unlike the United States’ electoral college voting process, the single transferable voting used by GUSA allows for a form of an instantaneous runoff election.
If no ticket initially wins an absolute majority of first-choice votes, the ticket with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated and has its votes redistributed according to the second-choices indicated on those ballots. Through this process, the instant runoff election continues until one ticket has the support of 50 percent of all voters. In general, few tickets earn a majority in the first round and most GUSA elections last until the second or third round.
Voters will rank their choices between the tickets of Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Aleida Olvera (COL ’20); Nicki Gray (NHS ’20); Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) and Roya Wolfe (SFS ’21); and Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) and John Dolan (MSB ’20).

Nicki Gray (NHS ’20) leads by a 6.6 point margin for Georgetown University Student Association president, according to a door-to-door poll of 615 students conducted by The Hoya on Wednesday evening. The election is set for Friday, Feb. 8.
Gray was the first preference of 34.7 percent of the 357 self-identified likely voters. Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) were close behind at 28.1 percent. Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) and Roya Wolfe (SFS ’21) came in third with 20 percent of the vote, while Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) and John Dolan (MSB ’20) came in fourth with 9.7 percent. Respondents who were undecided or wrote in candidates made up 7.5 percent of the total.
The poll’s narrow margin suggests no candidate will receive a majority of votes in the first round of voting. If no ticket receives an outright majority in the first round, an instant runoff is conducted between the top performing tickets, per GUSA’s single transferable vote system. In this ranked choice system, the ticket with the lowest vote total is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the remaining candidates based on voters’ indicated second preferences until one ticket receives a majority.
2 percent of respondents rated their current trust in GUSA as strong. 23.9 percent of students listed their trust in GUSA as medium, and 38.9 percent of respondents listed their trust in GUSA as weak.  35 percent said they were indifferent/unsure.
GUSA is somewhat relevant, according to 54 percent of respondents. 40.3 percent said GUSA is not at all relevant, and 5.7 responded it was very relevant.

Four presidential candidates for the Georgetown University Student Association executive shared their varying policy approaches at Tuesday night’s presidential debate, expanding on issues ranging from the GU272 referendum and student advocacy recognition to the flaws of GUSA.
Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20), Nicki Gray (NHS ’20), Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) and Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) detailed their policies on Title IX regulations and tuition during the event. The executive election is set for Friday, Feb. 8.

Two Georgetown University Student Association vice presidential candidates expressed views on topics ranging from free speech and tuition reform to the representation of marginalized students at a debate Thursday evening.
Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) and Roya Wolfe (SFS ’21) opened with their campaigns’ policy priorities and answered questions from campus media outlets including The Hoya, The Georgetown Voice, and The Georgetown Review. Audience members and Twitter users also supplied questions for the candidates. The debate was hosted by the GU Election Commission in the Intercultural Center.
Vice presidential candidate John Dolan (MSB ’20) was not present at the debate. Dolan and his running mate Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) instead posted a video on their campaign’s Facebook page answering questions submitted by Georgetown students. In addition, Nicki Gray (NHS ’20) is running a solo presidential campaign.

Long before launching their bid for the Georgetown University Student Association executive, Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) and Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) bonded in the first few weeks of their freshman year, after Olvera witnessed Francis attempt to climb a doorway in Village C West.
Since freshman year, the two have remained close friends, making the decision to expand their personal relationship into a political one last week. Francis and Olvera’s campaign is centered on the themes of transparency, reform, accessibility and progress — or “T.R.A.P.,” as the pair have labelled it.
Though they had chosen to run the day before the final executive election info session, Francis said his ability to work well under deadlines serves as previous experience working under a tight timeline.
“I decided to run last week,” Francis said Sunday in an interview with The Hoya. “I’m a Georgetown student, I like living life under pressure. On one Friday, I finished three finals — I wrote 22 pages from three different finals — so I like working under pressure.”

As a solo candidate, Georgetown University Student Association presidential candidate Nicki Gray (NHS ’20) promises to collaborate with student leaders and support survivors of interpersonal violence.
Gray is running for the GUSA executive without a vice presidential candidate after her former running mate, Sam Appel (COL ’20), removed his name from the executive ballot Monday night.
Despite losing her vice presidential candidate, Gray highlighted the ongoing support from her campaign staff.
“I’m running alone in the sense that my name is the only one on the ballot, but I’m by no means running alone,” Gray said Wednesday in an interview with The Hoya. “I have an amazing team to support me, an amazing group of people that I’ve been learning from throughout this entire process, from the time I decided to run.”

Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) and Roya Wolfe (SFS ’21) met at Georgetown’s International Relations Summer Program in 2015, two years before enrolling at Georgetown and long before entering the 2019 Georgetown University Student Association executive race. Now, the pair believe their different experiences working with campus leaders will serve as assets in their campaign for greater representation of student voices.
Nemazi and Wolfe’s campaign slogan, “Run For All,” has an additional reading of “Run With All” because of their emphasis on working alongside leaders of student groups in their advocacy, according to Wolfe.
“We want to be able to be a group where people go to for help, to tell stories. We want to be able to be the group that listens, not the group that only speaks,” Wolfe said Sunday in an interview with The Hoya.

After training alongside each other for three years on the Georgetown men’s lightweight crew team, Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) and John Dolan (MSB ’20) are running for the Georgetown University Student Association executive to combat perceived inefficiencies of student government.
Friends and acquaintances told the pair they sought a productive GUSA executive, inspiring Zuccala and Dolan to announce their candidacy on a platform centered around actionable goals, according to Zuccala.
“The emails started to come out about GUSA and we started to ask some people what they think,” Zuccala said Monday interview with The Hoya. “People didn’t really know what GUSA did so they felt like GUSA never really represented them or got anything done that they wanted. We thought about it, and one day we were hanging out and the idea started to form.”

Sam Appel (COL ’20) resigned from the Georgetown University Student Association senate and stepped down from his bid for GUSA vice president on a ticket with Nicki Gray (NHS ’20) Monday evening. Gray has since continued her campaign without a running mate.
Gray is permitted to continue her campaign for president alone, according to GUSA Election Commissioner Minji Doh (SFS ’19). If elected, Gray would appoint a vice president once in office.
A solo candidate has never run in a student government presidential race in GUSA’s electoral records, which span the last 20 years of GUSA’s 35-year history, according to GUSA Historian Henry Westerman (SFS ’21).
After meeting on Monday evening, Gray and Appel reached the conclusion that Appel would remove his name from the ballot and resign from the GUSA senate immediately. At this time, Gray has agreed to keep the reasoning for Appel’s departure private because of a third-party request, according to campaign manager Marc Pitrois (SFS ’20).

Two Georgetown University Student Association vice presidential candidates expressed views on topics ranging from free speech and tuition reform to the representation of marginalized students at a debate Thursday evening.
Aleida Olvera (COL ’20) and Roya Wolfe (SFS ’21) opened with their campaigns’ policy priorities and answered questions from campus media outlets including The Hoya, The Georgetown Voice, and The Georgetown Review. Audience members and Twitter users also supplied questions for the candidates. The debate was hosted by the GU Election Commission in the Intercultural Center. 
Vice presidential candidate John Dolan (MSB ’20) was not present at the debate. Dolan and his running mate Ryan Zuccala (MSB ’20) instead posted a video on their campaign’s Facebook page answering questions submitted by Georgetown students. In addition, Nicki Gray (NHS ’20) is running a solo presidential campaign.
The candidates stressed the importance of including the voices of underrepresented students in their campaigns and policy choices.
Olvera and Francis plan to apply their own experiences as members of marginalized communities to their platforms to address issues relating to these groups.
“Our identities kind of coincide with a lot of marginalized groups on campus; we know what is feels like to be underrepresented and unheard,” Olvera said. “We want to make sure through our tenure here that students understand that we have been through that experience.”
Wolfe said her ticket seeks to connect university administrators with student leaders already speaking up about the status of marginalized groups on campus.
“A lot of the hard work that is done to represent unheard voices or underrepresented voices is done by student advocacy groups on campus, and a lot of the time that work goes unrecognized,” Wolfe said. “It is GUSA’s job to be the link between student advocacy groups and the administration.”
Olvera and Norman Francis Jr. (COL ’20) are running on a four-part program of transparency, reform, accessibility and progress, or “T.R.A.P.” The candidates’ main initiative is the distribution of a pamphlet detailing academic resources for students to learn about their options for taking pass/fail courses or auditing classes. 
Wolfe and Sina Nemazi (COL ’21) plan to focus on four initiatives. These include mandatory training about Title IX for students in the Student Advocacy Office, the creation of a “Zen Den” meditation room in Lauinger Library, distribution of free menstrual products across campus and a reward program for students who use reusable water bottles at dining locations.
Affordability was another theme featured in the debate, with both candidates differing in their response to dealing with tuition hikes. 
Along with her running mate, Olvera plans to explore the possibility of freezing tuition for students across their four years at Georgetown, a policy previously implemented at Columbia University and Harvard University.
“We’re not sure how exactly we’re going to tackle that, but that’s an idea that we’re really pushing toward,” Olvera said. “But we do know it is a very difficult situation for students that have raised money and do have specific funds allocated for their time here.”
Wolfe acknowledged that the GUSA executive may not be able to force administrators to make changes in tuition policy and focused on other issues where change can be more feasible.
“We do want to maintain that conversation, to hold that conversation,” said Wolfe. “But I personally think based on what I’ve seen through GUSA, it would be hard to control what the university is doing with tuition.”
The candidates both spoke to their tickets’ views on the proposed referendum that would allow Georgetown students to vote on whether to establish a reconciliation contribution, a fee to collect money for a charitable fund to benefit descendants of the 272 slaves who were sold by the Maryland Society of Jesus in 1838, commonly known as the GU272.
Pushing the GU272 referendum forward would be the team’s first priority should they be elected, according to Olvera. 
“That will be the first thing that we are going to promote, and the first thing that we are excited to be apart of once we are in office, should that referendum not have passed yet,” Olvera said.
Wolfe said that she fully supports the referendum and that the university is long overdue to acknowledge its past wrongdoing.
The candidates also addressed questions about how their tickets view the topic of free speech in their platforms. Olvera stressed that student safety should be the first priority in considerations of who should be able to come to speak on campus.
Wolfe emphasized the distinction between speakers coming to campus who cause students to question their beliefs and those who harm marginalized groups with their rhetoric.
“I think having speakers come that challenge students is different than having speakers come who are rude and oppress with their words,” Wolfe said. “Finding that line can be a little bit of a gray area, but it’s important to know the difference.”
The GUSA presidential debate will take place on Tuesday, Feb. 5, in the Healey Family Student Center Great Room at 7 p.m.

Student-run Asian cultural groups launched a photo campaign called to raise awareness to a lack of academic programming on Asian-Americans studies at Georgetown University on Monday.
The week-long campaign, entitled “Georgetown Doesn’t Teach Me,” is based in the Leavey Center and features students taking photographs of signs completing the sentence “Georgetown doesn’t teach me…” to call for greater curricular options in Asian-American experiences.
Georgetown Asian and Pacific Islander Leadership Forum and the Georgetown Asian-American Student Association’s Political Awareness Committee, two affinity groups for Georgetown students of Asian descent, collaborated to organize the campaign to take photographs of students, which are set to hang in Midnight Mug following the campaign’s conclusion in February.
The university’s commitment to inclusivity is undermined by a lack of curricular representation for Asian-Americans, according to Jennifer Sugijanto (COL ’20), a member of APILF.
“Our goal is tangibly more classes but I guess in a more abstract way, our stories represented in classrooms,” Sugijanto said. “If you’re going to say that you’re inclusive, you’re going to bring in these POC students, how are you going to represent them in the curriculum?”
The focus of the campaign is broad and seeks to represent Asian-American diversity through curriculum, APILF member Nataliyah Tahir (SFS ’20) wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“Not only do we want classes on and faculty specializing in Asian America, we want them to reflect the diversity of the diaspora — particularly members of our community who have traditionally been marginalized and erased from mainstream Asian American narratives,” Tahir wrote. 
While planning this campaign, APILF and AASA collaborated with students at universities and colleges such as Yale University, Duke University and Amherst College. These universities each had or plan to have their own iteration of this campaign as part of a larger student movement for ethnic studies programs, according to Sugijanto.
In 2010, the Diversity and Inclusiveness Initiative, a collective effort from
faculty, students and staff to examine ways to strengthen Georgetown’s commitment to diversity on campus, made recommendations to the university. Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia affirmed these recommendations, which included exploring the possibility of creating an Asian-American Studies program.
“Nine years ago, President DeGioia claimed the university would “explore creating new programs” in African American, Asian American and Hispanic/Latinx Studies. Now, we are calling for Georgetown to live up to its promises,” APILF wrote in its campaign description on Facebook. 
Professor Christine So, an associate professor in the English department, is the only tenure-line faculty member at the university with a specialization in Asian America. So has taught a course in Asian-American literature since spring 2014, and for the first time this semester is teaching “Intro to Asian-American Studies.”
The class has led to greater intellectual engagement with Asian-American issues, So wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“Their intellectual energy and focus have really highlighted the need for more classes like this at Georgetown,” So wrote. “It has filled a gap for those who are trying to make sense of how Asian Americans have historically been and continue to be marginalized within the United States.”
Aside from these two course, Georgetown does not offer any other classes on Asian-American studies.
Following the Diversity and Inclusiveness Initiative, the university established an African-American Studies department in 2016. Students in the previous year have pushed to develop the Women and Gender Studies program into a full department, but the university does not yet possess majors or minors for Asian-American studies or Latinx studies.
Jenny Xu (COL ’21), a participant in the photo campaign, said that she hoped the campaign would increase visibility on campus for Asian-American issues.  (Full disclosure: Xu is a member of The Hoya’s editorial board.)
“It’s about drawing attention to a need that the Asian community and the Georgetown community as a whole have — for this campaign is not just for the Asian community,” Xu wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The Georgetown community as a whole will be better off by being engaged in the rich cultural history shared by their Asian peers.”
Asian-American studies programs can provide a different perspective that may not come from other academic or even social experiences, So said. 
“It’s important for students to see how all of these events are connected to and resonate with each other in courses that focus wholly on the theories and material realities of Asian-American racial formation,” So said. 
The burden on Asian-American students to inform their peers was another reason for her support of the campaign, Xu wrote. 
“Because anti-Asian racism is not taboo enough, it’s often up to me to explain to them why it’s wrong when that is not my purpose in existing on this campus,” Xu wrote. “It’s dehumanizing, it’s exhausting, and it’s my hope that with increased Asian-American studies courses, professors, and issues integrated into relevant courses in other fields, this dynamic can change.”

As Georgetown University Student Association executive elections approach, posters circulated across campus Sunday with a bolded message: “Abolish GUSA!”
Abolish GUSA, a movement seeking to replace GUSA with a more efficient and inclusive system of student government, began distributing the posters Jan. 27. The posters include a website URL directing students to sign up to join the movement.
Abolish GUSA is acting in the interest of students and will articulate its vision for a new student government soon, according to the group.
“We are passionate Hoyas who want to see a better future for our fellow students. We are Georgetown,” Abolish GUSA wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “We are currently drafting a framework for a better system that will put the power of student government back into the hands of the student body where it belongs.”
GUSA senator and former GUSA presidential candidate Logan Arkema (COL ’20) signed up as a member of Abolish GUSA. Arkema said he hopes GUSA will be abolished and replaced with a more effective form of student government. Arkema ran a satirical campaign during last year’s GUSA executive election as Batman with the aim of encouraging students to not take GUSA so seriously.
GUSA is an ineffectual institution that benefits its current members more than the student body, according to the statement.
“We believe that GUSA’s institutional structure inherently facilitates corrupt resume-building and stagnant inaction,” Abolish GUSA wrote on its Facebook. “GUSA has proven itself time and time again to be an ineffective advocate for student voices. Students have rightfully lost faith in GUSA and its claim to be a force for good on campus.”
The group claims to have broad support across campus, reflecting student agreement that GUSA is not working properly for students.
“Our support grows by the hour and undoubtedly will continue to grow in the coming weeks. We have supporters of all class years, all political ideologies, all personal backgrounds, and even GUSA senators themselves,” Abolish GUSA wrote.
Abolish GUSA declined to comment their membership numbers, but wrote in a statement to The Hoya that it will release statistics at a later, unspecified date.
Abolish GUSA formed out of many complaints from students about GUSA. GUSA is a frustrating place to work, and many students are not adequately represented or included in GUSA, according to Arkema. There are no female senators representing the class of 2022 this year, and one female senator was elected this fall out of 14 races.
“Most of the people inside of GUSA don’t like GUSA,” Arkema said in an interview with The Hoya. “Women are underrepresented in the GUSA senate. All of GUSA, both the executive and the senate, has, at least in my conversation with folks and what I have seen and heard, been toxic, especially to individuals with underrepresented and historically marginalized identities.”
Arkema said he hopes to establish a new student government based on incorporating a diversity and abundance of student voices currently unaffiliated with GUSA.
“I want the conversations to really include and be centered around those who generally stay away from GUSA,” Arkema said.
GUSA should not brush off concerns raised by Abolish GUSA and should instead seek to understand their origin, according to GUSA President Juan Martinez (SFS ’20).
“While I don’t believe that simply abolishing GUSA is the right path forward, I do think these concerns should be taken seriously. If students are advocating for the dissolution of an institution, we need to seriously reflect on why that institution is perceived as valueless,” Martinez wrote in a statement to The Hoya.  
This year’s Abolish GUSA movement comes after multiple referenda to reform the GUSA senate in the past three years. Last spring’s referendum, the only one to pass of the three, replaced the previous distribution of senators by geographic location with a new system based on class year. 
Abolish GUSA hopes that the abolition would be passed as an amendment to the current GUSA constitution. Students can prompt an amendment upon the specific petition of one-fifth of the total undergraduate student body, according to the GUSA constitution. If deemed valid by the GUSA constitutional council, a body of three presidentially appointed GUSA justices, the amendment could then be ratified after an affirmative referendum in which at least one-fourth of the undergraduate students cast a ballot. 
The current structure of GUSA encourages officials to pursue re-election instead of the interests of the student body, according to Ajayan Williamson (COL ’21), another student who has publicly expressed support for the movement. Williamson posted a meme satirizing the upcoming GUSA election on Facebook on Monday afternoon with the caption, “Abolish GUSA.”
“The goal of student government should be to enhance the on-campus life of the students that go to our school, and I don’t think that the current structure of GUSA is one that incentivizes people to come into it with that mind,” Williamson said in an interview with The Hoya. “It incentivizes people to come into it with a more self-serving mind because they are there to get elected or to get elected again.”
