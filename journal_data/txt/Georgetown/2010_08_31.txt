An unknown suspect sexually assaulted a Burleith resident on the 3800 block of S Street on Sunday morning, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.
A white male allegedly broke into the Burleith house between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m. and began sexually assaulting the sleeping female victim, who is not a Georgetown student. When the victim woke and screamed, the suspect fled the scene, according to MPD Lt. John Hedgecock.
The victim described the suspect as being in his mid-20s, of average build, with brown hair and wearing a blue shirt, Hedgecock said.
PD and the Georgetown Department of Public Safety are taking additional security measures in light of the incident.
PD is responding by changing and intensifying patrols in the area.
“Detectives will alter some things, and there will be an increased police presence in that area,” Hedgecock said at an Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E meeting on Monday night.
Hedgecock said MPD’s efforts have been aided by DPS, which is increasing patrols to help prevent further incidents.
“[DPS] has anticipated that there would be an uptick in criminality with the advent of the new academic year and has prepared for it with an increase in patrol coverage as well as crime prevention efforts,” DPS Associate Director Joseph Smith said in an e-mail. “Such incidents as these are a stark reminder to our students, faculty and staff that we all must follow the best practices in personal safety and to report suspicious activity to DPS.”
While the victim was not a student, students in the area are at similar risk if they do not take safety precautions, according to Hedgecock.
“This was a preventable crime. Students have to lock their doors and protect themselves by staying in groups,” Hedgecock said. “Lots of these folks are brand-new at living on their own. Georgetown is a wonderful place, but it is in a big city and is prone to the dangers of a big city.”
DPS made similar recommendations.
“It has become something of a mantra at safety lectures, but it bears repeating: Lock your doors and windows; walk to and from campus in groups, particularly late at night; walk in lighted areas and avoid alleyways; report suspicious persons to the police; call for SafeRides or security escorts,” Smith said. “Practice good situational awareness, and be quick to exit a perceived danger zone and get help.”
A string of incidents similar to Sunday’s sexual assault, in which male suspects entered residences on and near campus and attempted to sexually assault sleeping females, were reported in the spring and summer of 2009. An analysis by THE HOYA in April 2009 traced a pattern of similar break-ins as far back as 2005.
Some students living in Burleith said reports of the assault did not make them feel less secure.
“I don’t really feel any less safe than before,” Doria Killian (COL ’11) said. “Worrying about it would be pointless and just serve to drive me crazy rather than doing anything proactive.”
“[I] haven’t really thought about it much, to be honest. It has happened too many times over my three years here for it to get much of a reaction,” said James Blaney (COL ’11), who also lives in Burleith. “I already lock the doors, so there’s not much more to be done.”

Georgetown students will have a new way to leave the Hilltop and explore D.C. this fall, thanks to a regional bike-sharing program introduced by the District Department of Transportation and Arlington County in June.
Four bike-sharing stations will open in Georgetown and Glover Park in September, according to The Georgetown Dish. They will be located at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and 37th Street, 2422 37th St., 3520 Prospect St. and near the C & O Canal on Wisconsin Avenue.
ayor Adrian Fenty, Arlington County Board Chairman Jay Fisette and DDOT Director Gabe Klein first announced the launch of the program May 21.
“[This is] a wonderful example of regional cooperation,” Fisette said in a press release.
A survey was held by the District and Arlington County to name the bike-sharing program; on June 8, they announced that “Capital Bikeshare” was the name chosen by the majority of 1,164 voters. Capital Bikeshare will distribute about 1,100 bikes at 100 stations throughout the eight wards of the District and 14 stations in Arlington County.
The program is an expansion of SmartBike DC, which started in 2008, and it will be the largest regional bike-sharing program in the country. There are also plans to add more stations further into Virginia, according to DDOT’s website.
To rent a bike from Capital Bikeshare, people in D.C. and Arlington County can buy a one-day membership at any of the stations, or a one-day, 30-day or annual membership online.
“[It is] designed for quick trips. . If you need a bike for a full day, a bike rental shop in the District or Arlington may be a better option,” according to Capital Bikeshare’s website.
A one-day membership costs $5, and the first 30 minutes of each trip are free, but the cost of each subsequent 30-minute interval increases exponentially.
Some Georgetown students, including Dave Barton (NHS ’13), do not anticipate using Capital Bikeshare over existing bike rental services.
“I think it is an interesting idea that has some utility with transportation and `green living’ practices, [but] I think most students in the area, including myself, use bikes more for recreation and exercise [than for transportation],” Barton said. “I do not see any benefit to using Capital Bikeshare over any other bike rental service because I would not use it any differently.”
Other students said that they understand the appeal of the program.
“I actually have my bike down here, but the only reason it made the trip from New York is because of how handy it [is]. If I didn’t have one, though, I would absolutely use a bike-share program because before having one I really didn’t do much exploring outside of Georgetown itself,” Kaitlin Donohue (COL ’10) said.
Despite these views, Fisette expressed his hope that Capital Bikeshare would help connect the District and Arlington, making it easier for residents and visitors to travel between them.
“This new system will connect with our existing transit network, and provide even more options for people to get around,” Fisette said in a DDOT press release.
Klein also highlighted the health benefits of Capital Bikeshare.
“The District continues to move forward with our initiatives to provide a more balanced approach to transportation,” Klein said in a DDOT press release. “Biking provides a healthy and efficient way to get around town and with the installation of this new system almost anyone who can ride a bike will enjoy the benefits.”

Michael Ragussis, a professor in the English department, died at home on Thursday after a long illness, according to an e-mail from University Provost James O’Donnell to the campus community on Friday night.
“As a teacher, Michael was known for his rigor and careful attentiveness to the intellectual growth of his students,” Ragussis’ friends and colleagues from the English department said in a statement.
Ragussis was the author of four books and taught classes dealing with novels and Romantic poetry. For a number of years in the 1980s and 1990s, he was the graduate English programs’ director of graduate studies.
Ragussis was the recipient of various fellowships and retired from teaching after the spring 2010 semester. He specialized in 18th- and 19th-century topics and was a professor emeritus at the time of his death.
“We will remember him as an extraordinary and productive scholar, a generous colleague, an attentive and careful teacher, a department and campus leader, and a dear friend,” the English department wrote in the statement. “Michael meant so much to so many of us at Georgetown.”
Ragussis was 65 years old.

In the course of current research into the history of Anglo-Jewry, I just came across Michael Ragussis’s outstanding Figures  of Conversion and was looking for his e-mail address on the Georgetown U. website, so that I could drop him a line expressing my admiration. Alas, too late. I am truly distressed that I did not have the opportunity I so desired of communicating with him.

He loved corresponding with readers and former students. I’m sorry you could not experience that

He basically taught me how to read in an introductory undergrad class in the late 1970s.  Opened up literature to me in a very real way.  Will not be forgotten!

That’s exactly what I said about him as well. He taught me to read critically, imaginatively, but above all closely.

Heartbreaking. A summer directed readings course with him in DH Lawrence is a lot of why I became a professor. Such a gifted professor and a wonderful man.

Agreed. He had the most profound and lasting impact on my intellectual development. And oh, what a friend to have. I cherish the memories of so many conversations

He was a young professor when I was a freshman in 1983.

The Corp’s plan to open a café in the Davis Performing Arts center has been cancelled after setbacks. Another Corp location, however, is getting a makeover for the coming academic year.
While the Davis Center location had been set to open in early 2010, the project faced planning difficulties that affected the original timeline. Officers of The Corp have terminated the project, which Chief Executive Officer Brad Glasser described in an interview in January as a “totally new” venture.
At that time, Glasser said that the café’s progress was not at the point in its development that it needed to be for the original 2010 opening date.
idnight MUG, on the other hand, is getting a facelift.
According to Jon-Michael LaGray (COL ’11), the store director of Midnight Mug, no heavy construction is involved in the redecoration. The location will receive new furniture and decor.
LaGray said Midnight MUG’s upgrade is not related to the cancellation of the Davis Performing Arts Center location.
“These are two very separate instances that could have gone forward independently,” he said.
Glasser was unable to be reached for further comment.

Georgetown welcomed over 1,500 freshmen to campus this week and one of them is already standing out – by documenting his life on the Hilltop via YouTube.
Joey Pearson (SFS ’14), an aspiring singer and actor from Hinesville, Ga., has been recording video blogs for the past three years. But for Pearson, life in front of the camera is nothing new: Pearson spent his childhood performing.
Pearson appeared on CBS’ “Star Search” when he was 12 years old, and has toured the country. He has recorded five albums.
“In order to maintain my passion for music and also the relationship with those who supported me, I decided to create a video blog where I could sing, talk [and] perform, and then it just turned into a more personal blog,” he said.
Pearson released one stream of videos this summer as he drove from San Diego to Georgia.
“I uploaded a video every night for a week. People really had fun with that because it really brought them in with me,” he said.
Pearson uploads at least one video every two weeks chronicling life at home. He never rehearses before recording, he said.
“It’s not perfect or flawless, but it’s real and people appreciate that.”
Pearson has about a thousand subscribers to his YouTube page, and he gets feedback from friends and family.
“I have mixed reviews because I am a very opinionated person and when I express some of the opinions on YouTube, some of my family feels that I am giving too much away. Others are very happy that I am expressing myself.”
Pearson said he draws upon his Christian background and Southern roots when performing.
“I often use traditional hymns to talk about how we treat each other and how we perceive that God loves us,” he said. “I see a relationship with God as a loving God.”
Pearson said he loves all types of music, however, particularly R&B, modern pop, Latin, classical and country.
Pearson said he plans to continue documenting his life on the Hilltop. Pearson is optimistic that more people will subscribe to his blog, especially Georgetown students. He also encourages others to start their own.
“I would love seeing more people at Georgetown doing more blogs,” he said. “As an incoming freshman, I looked for videos and blogs to see dorm rooms, what teachers are like, et cetera, and there were none. . My goal is to do that for other students.”
Georgetown students now have the opportunity to meet the man behind the camera on his website or in the halls of Darnall.

Georgetown’s Office of University Safety will offer four three-day training sessions to students, faculty and staff during the academic year as part of the D.C. Community Emergency Response Team program.
The course, taught by local firefighters, paramedics and police officers, will include disaster preparedness, fire safety, medical operations, light search and rescue operations, terrorism and campus preparedness.
According to an e-mail sent out on August 18, Georgetown is hoping to attract over 100 students, faculty and staff for the CERT training.
“The most prepared communities are those that embrace the connected nature of all its members. We believe that preparedness begins at the individual level and that by increasing personal preparedness within our community, we will inherently have a more prepared community and institution,” said Whit Chaiyabhat, the director of emergency management and operational continuity at Georgetown.
Georgetown is starting the CERT program with the hope of creating a more secure campus while promoting involvement from all members of Georgetown’s community.
“A significant benefit will be that students and the larger community will be able to make a real contribution to improving personal emergency preparedness,” Chaiyabhat said. “The C-CERT [Campus CERT] program has raised awareness on college campuses nationwide on the topic of disaster preparedness and promotes an interest in emergency management among students, faculty and staff.”
The CERT program on campus is funded by an Emergency Management for Higher Education Grant from the U.S. Department of Education along with a District of Columbia CERT program. Georgetown hopes to continue to offer the training every few years in the future.
Georgetown’s CERT program will function as a pilot program in Washington, D.C., with the possibility of leading to a city-wide CERT program that would be offered at area colleges on a rotating basis. Georgetown joins over 3,500 CERT teams nationwide.
For students on campus, CERT serves as a reassurance of their safety. “I think it’s very necessary to have CERT on campus because it insures that we’ll be able to respond more efficiently to a disaster if we need to,” said Emma Furino (NHS ’11), a former GERM staffer.
“The C-CERT program best meets our needs at this time as it provides curriculum spanning a wide range of emergency response topics, but can be completed in a relatively short period of time,” Chaiyabhat said.
