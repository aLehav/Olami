While most students spend their days hopping from Zoom to Zoom, Colton Scrudder (MSB ’22) and Maddox Angerhofer (SFS ’22) are learning a new routine: a 6 a.m. wake-up call to a kennel full of 60 dogs, a morning of running puppies through the woods, then an afternoon of maintenance work and scooping a whole lot of poop, all while living 157 miles from the nearest grocery store. 
When Georgetown University announced its transition to a remote fall semester, Scrudder and Angerhofer, who first met their freshman year during GOPOP, a week-long pre-orientation hiking trip with Outdoor Education, began sending out job applications to dog sledding kennels. Five weeks ago, they found work at Wild and Free Mushing, a dog sledding team homestead in Eureka, Alaska.
Hired as handlers, Scrudder and Angerhofer care for nine yearlings, dogs in their first season of pulling sleds, according to Angerhofer. To prepare them for long and exhausting races, Scrudder and Angerhofer run the young dogs on hikes, teaching them recall. The process can be challenging, but they bring along older, retired dogs to help wrangle in the puppies. 
“The best part of this semester has been daily hikes with the dogs and puppies,” Angerhofer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Hiking here in Alaska is a bit different from what I’m used to, since there’s much more open, navigable country with spongy lichen that the puppies love to roll around in. The views are amazing and it’s all right in our backyard!”
Brent Sass, owner and operator of Wild and Free Mushing, is a three-time Yukon Quest champion and won fourth place in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race last year, an annual 938-mile race across Alaska. In March, when the next race is planned, Sass is aiming for the Iditarod champion title, according to Scrudder. 
Scrudder has learned a lot training a whole team of dogs bound for the Iditarod.
“I have two dogs at home, but it’s completely different when there’s 60 that are all trying to figure out their position and how they’re relating to other dogs,” Scrudder said in an interview with The Hoya.
Temperatures in Alaska are dropping, but until snow falls, Scrudder and Angerhofer drive the dogs from an ATV instead of a sled. It can be difficult to spot which puppies will one day make good sled dogs, but a solid team comprises dogs with focus, high energy and good attitudes, Scrudder said. 
“We’ll walk until they basically are exhausted and then they get a little rest or nap and then back to running, since that’s how it’ll be when they’re adults racing in 1,000 mile races,” Scrudder said.
Living so far away from people they know, Scrudder and Angerhofer started an Instagram account, “Going Rogue Alaska,” and a blog to update their friends and family about their lives. Their most recent post from Sept. 19 catalogues Eureka’s changing seasons.
“When the freeze really sets in, daily operations will change drastically as we reign in our consumption of all sorts – water, fuel, electricity,” they wrote. “We’ll have a few weeks without snow, but even that will be shortlived (hopefully, since sledding requires snow!). Until then, dog runs look like heists – happening in the wee hours on four wheelers, in the limbo of a quick and fickle fall.”
Unlike Angerhofer, who worked with sled dogs in Minnesota during high school, Scrudder had no experience prior to arriving in Eureka. He first learned about the sport in third grade, when he was assigned to follow four-time Iditarod champion Jeff King’s progress across Alaska. 
“Ever since that, I just thought it was the coolest job out there,” Scrudder said. 
Despite having worked at a dogsledding lodge before, Angerhofer found Alaska full of surprises, and mud, too.
“Before coming to Alaska, I did not expect to spend literally every day in rain boots, but it’s been a wet season and we are always working in the mud and cold flowing creeks, so they have come to be my go-to shoes, even for hiking,” she wrote. 
Scrudder and Angerhofer still do not know how long they will be in Alaska — their decision will be contingent upon Georgetown’s own spring plans, according to Scrudder. 
Even in Eureka, they remember the Hilltop fondly. 
“I miss the Potomac River a lot,” Angerhofer wrote. “I’m on the women’s lightweight rowing team at Georgetown, and while we have some beautiful creeks here in Alaska, there’s nothing like rowing down the Potomac past the monuments at sunrise.”

Phishing attempts promising job opportunities are circulating through Georgetown University’s email system, according to the university’s Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson in a systemwide message Sept. 22.
In many of the phishing emails, scammers posing as administrators offer students fraudulent university employment. In his message, Nicholson urged students to ignore the emails and not interact with them in any way.
“This email is not a legitimate job opportunity, as official university student employment opportunities are not advertised in this manner,” Nicholson wrote in the systemwide email. “The scammer will try to induce you into spending thousands of dollars on equipment claiming that Georgetown will reimburse you.”
Phishing emails pose the greatest cybersecurity threat to any organization, so the university has added more training and controls to minimize student risk, according to Nicholson.
“To mitigate this increase in exposure, we have implemented additional technical controls,” Nicholson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have stepped up our training in this area and it will be a focal point for our Cyber Awareness Month campaign in October.”
Nicholson also noted that students should take care with their personal use of Zoom, Teams, Google Meet and other call services. Sharing passwords or Zoom IDs can undermine the security of these services.
The recent phishing scams are not the first to target Georgetown students seeking employment, according to Eric Bazail-Eimil (SFS ’23), who nearly fell victim to a similar scam last fall.
“I almost got duped by the one that came out at the beginning of last year,” Bazail-Eimil said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It was saying, ‘You know there’s this job offer with Nestlé, and it’s gonna pay you $15 an hour.’”
A few days after responding to the email, Bazail-Eimil received a check for $2,600. He then brought the check to the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union, who verified that the check was fraudulent.
After noticing an uptick in fake check schemes earlier this year, GUASFCU shared an email with its customers explaining what to look for in email scams.
“The pitch will be believable, and will often relate to an advance on a sweepstakes, or payments for the first installment of future amounts received for agreeing to have money in a foreign country transferred to your bank account for safekeeping,” the email read. “The checks are fake, but they look real. Some are phony cashier’s checks, others look like they’re from legitimate businesses.”
Students should be vigilant, but if they do fall victim to phishing, they should immediately reach out to their bank, according to GUASFCU’s Chief Operating Officer Erika Kissel (MSB ’21).
“If you have given away personal banking information to a phishing scam, contacting your bank is the best course of action,” Kissel wrote in an email to The Hoya. “At GUASFCU, we have had members report a potential fraudulent check to us proactively and thus did not charge a fee when the check eventually bounced. If you have given out banking information, closing your original account and opening a new one is oftentimes the best way to avoid fraudulent activity.”
Despite the support GUASFCU offers, the university should be doing more to raise awareness about the potential for phishing and scams for students, according to Bazail-Eimil.
“Every year, these always happen. And they literally did nothing to warn us. This is the first time I’ve ever received an email saying, ‘warning.’ Georgetown needs to do a much better job protecting its students from these things.”

Postsecondary education can have a crucial role in suppressing authoritarian tendencies, particularly in the United States, according to a report published by a nonprofit research and policy institute at Georgetown University. 
The report, published by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce warned that the current global crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, mirrors similar historical contexts that gave rise to authoritarian regimes. In particular, the report noted growing political polarization in the United States has already intensified authoritarian attitudes and practices, including the use of mine-resistant vehicles and armored cars by police departments.
“Across the country, military and police vehicles patrolled the streets, sometimes using force against peaceful protesters calling for long-denied racial justice,” the report read. “With the presidential primaries complicated by the presence of COVID-19, concerns about potential voter suppression circulated. Shuttered educational institutions and businesses heightened the sense of uncertainty. Propaganda and traditional media competed fiercely to win credibility with a skeptical public.” 
The report, titled “The Role of Education in Taming Authoritarian Attitudes,” was published Sept. 22 and combined data from the World Values Survey, General Social Survey and American National Election Studies to analyze 51 countries. The report used the World Values Survey to rank them according to their authoritarian tendencies. 
The McCourt School of Public Policy professors at CEW Anthony P. Carnevale, Nicole Smith, Artem Gulish and Kathryn Peltier Campbell, as well as Lenka Dražanová of the European University Institute’s Migration Policy Centre, authored the report. CEW, a research policy center formed by Carnevale in 2008, studies the interaction between education and the workforce. 
Smith, chief economist at the CEW, said the use of authoritarianism in everyday language misses the full scope of what really constitutes an authoritarian state of affairs. 
“Most people go back to Nazi Germany, thinking of Adolf Hitler as an authoritarian and think that’s what an authoritarian is,” Smith said in an interview with The Hoya. “But the understanding of what authoritarianism really is is much more deep than just the political understanding.” 
The researchers operated under a definition of authoritarianism used by political scientist Karen Stenner, an influential definition in contemporary authoritarian research. Stenner considers authoritarianism to be a worldview wherein people prefer “authority and uniformity” before “autonomy and diversity,” according to the report. 
People who seek order in response to perceived threats to their way of life tend to favor authoritarianism, even in a democratic society like the United States, according to Smith.
“Authoritarianism is not the antithesis of a democratic understanding,” Smith said. “In fact, you can have an authoritarian outcome from a democratic regime.” 
Out of 51 countries studied, the report found that the U.S. population is the 16th-least authoritarian, indicating “moderate” authoritarian inclinations, roughly on par with Chile and Uruguay. The highest authoritarian tendencies were exhibited in India, Kyrgyzstan and South Africa, while the lowest levels were found in Germany, New Zealand and Sweden.
Against a volatile global context, the report identified education as a potential inhibitor for growing authoritarianism. It found that people with a bachelor’s degree or higher are seven times less likely to exhibit authoritarian preferences than people with a high school diploma. 
Education weakens authoritarian tendencies in part because it offers income and class benefits, which can decrease perceptions of threat, according to Smith.
“More education also affords you the ability to have a higher standard of living and to be upper income and upper class, and all these things are interrelated or commingled with education to lead to weaker authoritarian attitudes,” Smith said. 
Mark Lance, professor of philosophy and co-director of the Program on Justice and Peace at Georgetown, agreed education has an extremely important influence on authoritarian attitudes. However, he noted that the report’s overall finding on education can be misleading because he believes education’s impact can pull in both directions, based on his experiences as a peace educator. 
“Education, if it’s successful, breeds precisely the kinds of habits and skills that make a populace resist authoritarianism,” Lance said in an interview with The Hoya. “On the other hand, if education is structured around following a bunch of arbitrary rules, and believing what the person in the front of the room tells you, and writing it down and repeating it back on the test, then education reinforces authoritarianism.” 
Lance said these two kinds of education are in perpetual conflict with one another. He said  liberatory education, which is centered on raising consciousness and engagement, runs through the justice and peace studies department, as its mission is to train students to work for social justice and, consequently, against authoritarianism. However, he believes authoritarian forms of education also exist at Georgetown. 
“It’s variable here, like anywhere,” he said. “I teach at probably the extreme end, but I think there’s also a fair bit of training at Georgetown that is trying to make people into competent upper managers of what is essentially an authoritarian system.” 
The report determined that the United States had the strongest positive relationship between college education and lower authoritarian tendencies. But because the surveys administered in the study did not incorporate details about the U.S. education system in particular, one can only speculate as to the cause, according to Smith.
One hypothesis the report suggested is the prevalence of the U.S. liberal arts system, which requires students to develop a more open-minded worldview by thinking critically across multiple disciplines. 
“Liberal arts majors (excluding the sciences) are less inclined toward authoritarianism than those who major in either business-related fields or STEM disciplines,” the report found. “The prevalence of at least some exposure to the liberal arts among US students may help explain why an American higher education in particular is associated with a weak preference for authoritarianism.”
Although the report identified a strong positive relationship between higher education and a disinclination to authoritarianism, it still urged colleges to work even harder against authoritarian attitudes. 
“In the United States, college can and should instill the skills and abilities people need to participate in and protect American democracy,” the report concluded, “including the capacity to resist the trappings of authoritarianism in its many forms.”

Very interesting and thought provoking article. It reflects what is happening not only in America,but all around the globe, especially during this covid time and definitely goes beyond the political scenario. This topic is an encouragement to institutions for better and affordable education, as education is the only path towards stability and peace.

Thank you for this very clear article! These findings are crucial and relevant not only for the U.S. but for many countries, especially during the current crisis.

excellent synthesis! i do feel that even as a person educated in liberal arts and law, the STEM fields are unfairly maligned by the professor interviewed. STEM learning promotes curiosity, trial and error, and creative design, all of which can propel one to resist authoritarianism and embrace chaotic creativity that leads to solutions from the bottom up rather than the top down

The Georgetown Student Tenant Association plans to enhance its operations to aid students experiencing housing uncertainty and grappling with untenable leases because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
After Georgetown University decided to hold the fall semester online, upending many students’ fall plans, students living in the Georgetown neighborhood reported financial and housing difficulties. Some were unable to break leases or receive discounts on rent. In the past, students experiencing financially precarious housing situations off campus housing turned to GSTA. Founded in 2013, GSTA is a student-run group that provides advice and resources for leasing off-campus accommodations. The group last posted on social media in January 2018.
GSTA plans to become more active on Facebook to help students living in the Georgetown neighborhood as well as assist students facing housing uncertainty during the pandemic across Washington, D.C., according to GSTA Networking Manager Vanessa Ramirez (SFS ’24).
“We recognize that as we get bigger and as we become more active that there’s a lot of students, especially now in the pandemic, that are gonna need our services because a lot of students chose to be off campus this semester,” Ramirez said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.
Among other services, the GSTA offers fire safety equipment to off-campus tenants through a partnership with the Friends of Rigby Foundation, a nonprofit fire safety advocacy group created in 2006 after Georgetown student Daniel Rigby died in a townhouse fire.
GSTA also uses its Basic Business License Initiative to help student tenants ensure their landlords are complying with the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs safety regulations. The regulations include checking that all landlords renting to Georgetown students have Basic Business Licenses and that their buildings undergo inspection, according to GSTA Director Gracie Patrick (COL ’22).
GSTA might have eased the process of finding off-campus housing and negotiating leases with landlords for students such as Justin Ma (COL ’21), who was unaware of the services provided by GSTA while negotiating his lease in Burleith. 
“It was such a stressful process last year finding a house in the first place completely on our own, we didn’t know where to start or who to reach out to,” Ma wrote in a message to the Hoya. “We only talked to our landlord.”
Working with the Office of Neighborhood Life and the Office of the Tenant Advocate, GSTA members help conduct Basic Business License inspections to ensure tenants’ living situations are in accordance with D.C. housing regulations.
The Office of Neighborhood Life, designed to support all residents in the areas surrounding Georgetown, acknowledges the struggles the pandemic has caused in signing leases, according to ONL Director Cory Peterson. ONL has recommended students utilize GSTA in the past.
“We recognize the uncertainty and evolving factors around the COVID-19 pandemic make planning very difficult for future leases and subleases,” Peterson wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
Starting Oct. 6, the GSTA will also co-sponsor meetings with lawyers from the OTA through virtual office hours hosted by the Office of Neighborhood Life, according to Patrick. The OTA is a D.C. city agency that advocates for district tenants, helping them find emergency housing or obtain legal representation.
Although GSTA may not have had a strong social media presence since 2018, in part because many of its members graduated, their services have always been readily available for student tenants, according to Patrick. 
“The club has been definitely active last year, just not as much on social media,” Patrick said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “A lot of people graduated who maybe knew about GSTA and used their services and then graduated, and having the whole of GSTA graduate as well — I think that had to do with a lot of people not knowing about us, and that’s partly why we’re trying to get the word out now.”
