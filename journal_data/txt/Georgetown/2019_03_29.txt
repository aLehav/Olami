Comedian and political commentator Hasan Minhaj reflected on the role of identity in his comedy and called for the inclusion of diverse perspectives in the media industry March 28.
Both of Minhaj’s parents immigrated to the United States from India and raised Minhaj in the Muslim tradition. In his first stand-up comedy special, “Homecoming King,” which was released in 2017, Minhaj focused on his immigrant family upbringing and experience with racism around his Indian Muslim identity.
Minhaj said his identities as a Muslim and a first-generation American encourage him to define himself on inclusive terms.
“I’ve never defined myself being Indian and being like that means, ‘I’m not Pakistani, I’m not Sri Lankan,’ I’ve never defined it that way,” Minhaj said at the event. “India has dozens of languages and hundreds of different ethnic groups and identities. I’ve tried to define it by inclusive principles, not exclusive principles.”
Held in Gaston Hall, the event was hosted by the South Asian Society and co-sponsored by 14 other campus groups and offices, including Lecture Fund and the Muslim Student Association. The event featured a discussion between Minhaj, SAS President Vishal Menon (MSB ’19) and former SAS Presidents Vinoda Basnayake (MSB ’03) and Bhavya Jha (SFS ’17) and was followed by questions from the audience.
Minhaj hosts a weekly news-comedy show, “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,” which premiered on Netflix last October, making Minhaj the first Indian-American host of a weekly comedy show. The show has covered topics including the 2019 Indian general election and political censorship in China. He has also commented on the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in fall 2018, in an episode the Saudi Arabian government demanded Netflix remove.
Minhaj also previously served as a senior correspondent for “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” and was the featured comedian at the 2017 White House Correspondents’ Dinner.
Leading roles held by members of minority communities increased 13.6 percent from the 2011-2012 to the 2015-2016 seasons, according to the 2018 Hollywood Diversity Report from the University of California, Los Angeles. The increase in diversity has been significant not only on the screen, but also during the production process, according to Minhaj.
“Over the last five or six years there has been a big push for inclusion and diversity in the writers’ rooms and in casting in shows, which I think has been a big win for everybody. I’ve seen that shift, and that has been really great,” Minhaj said. “A lot of time people think that inclusion and diversity is just in front of the camera, but there has been a lot of behind-the-camera stuff, in terms of the creation of the ideas producing the projects and all that stuff; that is a big deal.”
Universities and other communities should uplift diverse performers and empower new voices to share their perspective and humor, according to Minhaj.
“I think the good thing, and I think the thing that Georgetown and a lot of schools can tap into, is just give that stage to a diversity of voices,” Minhaj said. “Whether it’s South Asian female voices, whether it’s queer voices, let those performers perform.”
The “Patriot Act” news team and writers seek to amplify underreported stories that shed a light on little-known but nonetheless important issues, according to Minhaj. 
“The two biggest things that I try to look for on story are number one: hooking a story that makes people go, ‘Oh my God. How did I not know that? How was I just kind of walking around in my day to day life not knowing that?’ Or two: it’s a story that makes people go, ‘Oh my God. thank you for saying that,’” Minhaj said. 
Minhaj has been outspoken about college admissions practices on his Netflix show, criticizing a lawsuit by Asian-Americans suing Harvard University over the university’s admissions policy. In the show’s premiere episode, Minhaj accused the plaintiffs of potentially jeopardizing affirmative action with their suit, which alleges the university discriminates against Asian-Americans in its admission process.
In an interview with The Hoya before his event, Minaj commented on his views on the recent admissions scandal affecting Georgetown.
A March 12 Department of Justice indictment alleged that former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst accepted bribes from parents in an admissions scheme involving seven other universities. Ernst falsely designated at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, according to the indictment.
The admissions cases should start a dialogue around the value universities place on legacy admission, according to Minhaj. 
“I think it has opened up a conversation around legacy admissions and I think that that is a big topic, especially because we are talking about meritocracy and everyone having an even playing field when they are applying to go to school,” Minhaj said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Minhaj said the DOJ allegations of admissions fraud at Georgetown and other elite universities did not shock him.
“I wasn’t surprised at all,” Minhaj said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think we saw a lot of these stories coming out from the sports world before, and now that something so public is happening in academia I think, you know, I was disappointed to hear about it but I wasn’t surprised.”

Members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee called for fairer working conditions for workers at Epicurean and Company in a petition delivered to the Epicurean manager Monday.
Around 15 members of GSC, a student group dedicated to promoting workers’ rights, led a march beginning in Red Square toward Epicurean on Monday morning. Participating students held flyers and chanted in support of Epicurean’s workers. At the restaurant, students read out the petition’s demands, which included respecting breaks during shift and providing three to five sick days for workers per year, before handing the signed petition over to Michael Chon, the manager of Epicurean.
The petition alleged Epicurean had a long history of mistreating of its workers that included reported instances of wage theft and threats to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement on an immigrant employee. 
The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 prohibits employers from discriminating or retaliating against workers on the basis of citizenship status. Washington, D.C.’s Wage Theft Prevention Amendment Act of 2014 also provides fines, penalties and possible suspension of the business licenses of employers who fail to pay their employees wages and provide written notice of their terms of employment. 
All members of the Georgetown community should recognize this petition and support the workers of Epicurean because of the university’s core Jesuit values, according to GSC member Mariel Mendez (COL ’21).
“If we are truly committed to Ignatian values of social justice, we should support the working-class people on this campus who are resisting abuse from managers, owners, and the University,” Mendez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Workers on this campus make the University run, and it is shameful that they are not granted the respect and dignity they deserve.”
The petition also calls for the firing of seven managers who have all allegedly violated labor laws. 
Complaints from four employees against Epicurean proprietor Chang Wook Chon led him to plead guilty to the charge of criminal contempt in March 2013. Chon was charged for attempting to settle a civil suit over allegedly failing to pay Epicurean employees for overtime outside of court without any lawyers present. 
In light of the petition, Epicurean aims to adjust its policies to better support its employees, according to Michael Chon.
“We’re looking at this petition and some of the concerns that were raised as an opportunity to kind of do better,” Michael Chon said in an interview with The Hoya. “I’ve been meeting with some of the employees to kind of figure out what we’ve done well in the past, what we haven’t as much and what we can do better in the future.”
The petition also calls on the university to hold its contractors accountable and ensure they are abiding by both D.C. labor laws and the university’s Just Employment Policy, which dictates fair wage standards for university employees, according to Mendez.
“We need to remind everyone that years ago students went on a hunger strike to force Georgetown into adopting the Just Employment Policy which among many things sets a living wage for campus workers and protects their right to organize freely,” Mendez wrote. “The university needs to honor this policy and ensure that all of its contractors (and the university itself) are not only following the JEP but also federal and D.C. labor law.”
Members of the Georgetown community, including workers, have the right to a safe and harassment-free environment and are entitled to a competitive compensation package, according to the Just Employment Policy for Georgetown University.
Twenty-six students went on a hunger strike in 2005, demanding the university raise the total compensation for all contracted workers, which previously ranged from $11.33 to $13.42, up to $14.93 per hour. The strike lasted eight days before the university compromised and agreed to raise wages to $14 for contracted workers by 2007.
In response to the petition, Georgetown remains committed to ensuring fair treatment of its employees, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
“Over the past several months the University has engaged directly with Epicurean to make sure owners, managers and employees understand and comply with the Just Employment Policy,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The University has taken a number of steps, including providing training sessions on the Just Employment Policy to managers and employees, recommending additional training for managers and ensuring grievance procedures are posted and available to employees.”
Eliciting a universitywide response and commitment to changing the toxic work culture at Epicurean is the goal of the petition, according to Mendez.
“As students, we realize the limits of going through formal channels,” Mendez wrote. “The goal is for transformative and long-term change to be made, and the whole campus community needs to be engaged for that. The petition served as the first step towards that goal.”

Halim Flowers, a Washington, D.C. local who took Georgetown University courses through the Georgetown Prison Scholars Program while incarcerated, was released from D.C. Jail on March 21 after serving 22 years.
Flowers began serving his 40-years-to-life sentence at 17 years old after being convicted as an accessory to murder. He was released early because of the D.C. Council’s Incarceration Reduction Amendment Act, which allows a judge to commute the sentences of individuals convicted as juveniles depending on their demonstration of personal growth while incarcerated.
Flowers started taking courses offered by Georgetown faculty through the Prison Scholars Program, which launched in January 2018, last fall. He enrolled in government and philosophy classes and attended a weekly lecture series with guest speakers from across the humanities and social sciences.
The Georgetown program allowed Flowers to form mutually beneficial relationships with the students, professors and guest lecturers.
“Those relationships with the students and the professors, they are beneficial because they exposed me to resources I am not aware of, and I exposed them to resources they were not aware of, so it’s a cross-cultural exchange that benefits both parties,” Flowers said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The Prison Scholars Program is a partnership between Georgetown’s Prisons and Justice Initiative, which studies and seeks to combat the issue of mass incarceration, and the D.C. Department of Corrections. Each semester in the program includes two credit-bearing courses, in addition to seven non-credit courses and a weekly lecture series for 50 men and women currently residing at the jail, according to the program’s website.
Marc Howard, a Georgetown professor and the founding director of Georgetown’s Prisons and Justice Initiative, knows Flowers personally from the time he spent as a student in Howard’s class on the process of democratization. Howard posted on his Facebook wall welcoming Flowers home and documenting his release from jail March 21.
Flowers’ diligence and dedication towards his studies in the Scholars Program influenced the judiciary’s decision to release him from prison, according to Howard.
“My understanding is that his participation in the Scholars Program played an important role in persuading Halim’s judge that he had embarked on a rehabilitation and transformation process that made him ready to re-enter society safely and productively,” Howard wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Programs like The Prison Scholars Program have had demonstrable success at reducing re-incarceration rates, according to research conducted by nonprofits. Incarcerated individuals who participated in correctional education were 43 percent less likely to return to prison within three years than those who did not, according to a 2013 study from the RAND Corporation, a policy analysis think tank.
Howard commended Flowers for his ongoing dedication to his education.
“I would say that he is one of the best students I’ve ever had in the classroom in my 16 years of teaching at Georgetown,” Howard wrote. “Over the time we’ve spent together in the D.C. Jail, and now outside, I can say that I have tremendous respect for Halim. He is a person of tremendous intelligence, dedication and integrity.”
Howard also taught a spring 2018 seminar titled “Prison Reform Project,” which led to the Sept. 19 exoneration of Valentino Dixon, who spent 26 years in prison after being found guilty of murder. 
Through Howard’s classes, Georgetown undergraduates and inmates have the opportunity to meet and interact with one another. Incarcerated students participating in the program gain both an education and a chance for reflection through their interactions with other students, according to Hashwinder Singh (COL ’20), a Georgetown student who met Flowers through Howard’s classes at the D.C. Jail.
“The empowerment each of these men and women get from their Georgetown education cannot be overstated. Halim is simply the most visible benefactor of that,” Singh wrote. “Halim will be the first to testify how valuable his educational experience was in opening up his mind and worldview and one needs to look no further than the literature that he has written and constantly engages with.”
While incarcerated, Flowers wrote and published 11 books, including memoirs from his time in prison, self-help books and poetry. His most recent book, #Unchainable, was published in June 2018 and is his fourth collection of poetry. Work from #Unchainable was featured in a multimedia installation that exhibited the experience of life in a prison cell at the inaugural By the People arts and dialogue festival in D.C. last June.
Flowers said writing while in jail was a way for him to spread his story and connect with individuals outside the prison.
“You are going to need people to help you get out and to help you when you get out, so if all of my conversations are just confined to the people that I’m inside of the institution with, then my effectiveness to be able to build a chain to get me out of prison, and to assist me when I get out is confined and limited,” Flowers said. “So by me writing books, and putting the books online and promoting them on social media, I’m connecting with a global audience.”
At the time of his release last week, Flowers is concurrently enrolled in two additional credit-bearing courses, English Literature and the History of African American Political Thought, as part of the Scholars Program, according to Howard. Flowers will be completing these courses outside of the jail, Howard said.

This is a wonderful story, very inspiring and a great example of the true value of education. Great credit to G’town and Professor Howard.
Credit too and best wishes to Mr. Flowers. I wish you success in all your endeavours – personal and academic.

Happened to google his name while watching the HBO show DC Street Life. A then 16 year old Halim Flowers was interview for the show. To my surprised he’s recently released and seemingly doing well. Having lived in DC for many years it’s safe to say his incarceration probably saved his life.

I met this young man today when I picked him up as a passenger for Lyft! I was extremely impressed with his calm demeanor and spirt and knew something was different about him in a very positive way!
I had know way of knowing about his personal life and past but I can tell you that he has a very bright future and can be a role model for all the other young people who are incarcerated and still dealing with the penal system! 
I pray that God continues to lead him, guide him and catapults him to the level that will empower others… captivates the hearts and minds of those who are seeking and in need of deliverance from the perils of our nations penal systems!

Georgetown University administrators are exploring private partnerships to handle the university’s energy management, a process leading to concerns from workers in the utilities and energy program about their job stability and employment benefits.
“While there are no new partnerships to speak of at this time, the University is beginning to explore the feasibility of pursuing an energy partnership,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Ben Kuo, Vice President for Planning and Facilities, and Chief Operating Officer Geoffrey Chatas held a March 19 meeting with employees of Georgetown’s central heating and cooling plant as part of a series of introductory meetings, according to a university spokesperson. 
Some utilities workers expressed disappointment by the lack of information regarding the partnership, according to a central plant employee referred to by the pseudonym John, who asked to remain anonymous for concerns about his employment. John and one other worker notified The Hoya of the March 19 meeting. A reporter from The Hoya was asked to leave the meeting.
“They didn’t really give us any detail in the meeting as far as them wanting to contract out the operations of facilities, and of course, the Georgetown employees, that’s what they were worried about,” John said in an interview with The Hoya. “That was supposed to be what they were going to talk about; they avoided that direct conversation as much as possible.”
Under any partnership agreement, the university would ensure all utilities employees maintain an opportunity to work at Georgetown and does not plan to alter the collective bargaining agreement with the 1199SEIU labor union, according to a university spokesperson.
“We would also respect any collective bargaining obligations that the University may have with respect to such a potential decision and its effects on employees represented by 1199SEIU,” the spokesperson wrote.
Previous changes in campus service providers have negatively affected employment for some university workers. At least three Georgetown University Bookstore employees lost their jobs when the university switched vendors from Follett to Barnes and Noble in May 2016.
The bookstore employees were covered by the university’s Just Employment Policy, which is designed to ensure fair treatment of employees. Georgetown attempts to avoid job losses for current university employees when services change contractors, according to the JEP. 
Utilities workers remain concerned with potential changes to employment benefits, according to John.
“They told us they’re not going to get rid of any Georgetown employees,” John said. “That may well be true, but most of the questions were about how the benefits would work — what about the retirement and tuition assistance?”
Many workers rely on university benefits to keep their children in school, according to a facilities worker who also requested anonymity for employment concerns, referred to by the pseudonym James.
“Many of us have our children in colleges and many of us work at [Georgetown] for the benefits [the university] offers,” James said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Several utilities workers have already started to look for other employment options, according to John.
“At least four have told me they’re looking,” John said.
The university’s consideration of partnerships with private companies, designed to reduce operating costs, is similar to its existing relationships with food-service companies. 
“As a tuition-dependent institution, Georgetown is committed to reducing operating expenses and focusing our resources on our academic mission,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This includes exploring partnerships similar to ones the University has for our hotel and food service management.”
The university currently partners with Aramark and Epicurean and Company for food-service management. Workers have faced problems with mistreatment or contract renegotiations within these partnerships. 
The Georgetown Solidarity Committee, a workers’ rights student activist group, and La Casa Latina, a space for the Georgetown Latinx community, co-hosted an event designed to advocate for workers among Aramark’s contract renegotiations.
Last September, Epicurean assumed control of Bulldog Tavern from its previous vendor, Aramark. Since then, former Bulldog Tavern employees have filed lawsuits against Epicurean and Company in response to violations of the 1994 Displaced Workers Protection Act.
GSC members delivered a petition to improve working conditions for Epicurean and Company workers March 25.
Although the university has not decided on a contract, workers are looking to previous examples of privatization at other universities for clarity, according to John.
“At Ohio State, which a lot of people are using as an example, they let people pick whether they let people pick whether they wanted to stay with [Ohio State] or go with the new company,” John said. “Every contract is negotiated differently, and we don’t know the details of the negotiations. Unfortunately, I don’t have a lot of specific details.”
Chatas guided a similar decision to privatize energy production at Ohio State University, where he was previously employed as vice president for business and finance and chief financial officer.
OSU partnered with energy company and investment firm ENGIE-Axium, now known as Ohio State Energy Partners, in a $1.165 billion deal, according to an article by The Lantern, Ohio State’s newspaper of record. The deal was the largest investment in university history.
Chatas also entered a public-private partnership with CampusParc in 2012, privatizing Ohio State’s parking in a $483 million deal.
University administrators plan to seek input from community members throughout the process of establishing a partnership, according to a university spokesperson.
“We would explore this partnership through a transparent, consultative process with significant input from faculty, staff, students, and other stakeholders,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Students and faculty met with Georgetown College Dean Chris Celenza to discuss considerations associated with expanding the women’s and gender studies program into a department March 21.
The meeting came after students delivered a letter to Celenza’s office March 1 urging Georgetown to respond to a 2017 proposal advocating for the WGST program to gain departmental status. The university has yet to publicly comment on the status of the proposal.
The opportunity to communicate directly with the deans is a huge step in the long campaign for a WGST department, according to Kory Stuer (COL ’19), a WGST major who attended the March 21 meeting.
“After over 17 months of no response from administrators, it is exciting to see that the Dean’s Office has now made addressing the disparities that WGST students face a priority,” Stuer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m hopeful that the Dean’s Office is willing to make the necessary changes.”
Katarina Watson (COL ’21), a WGST major who is spearheading the current push for a WGST department, and WGST program director You-Me Park also attended the March 21 meeting with Celenza, Dean David Edelstein and Vice Dean Sue Lorensen. At the meeting, Celenza gave the students a letter, thanking them for the letter drop and laying out some ideas for next steps.
Celenza proposed that the university could hire a new WGST director who is already tenured and has experience working with a WGST department at another school. Celenza offered that this director could provide insight on the possible transition from program to department at Georgetown.
However, students are concerned about the implications of this action on current director Park, according to Watson.
“Then that also leaves the question open of what about You-Me Park, because she’s our current director,” Watson said. “But she is not tenured.”
Because Georgetown only has a WGST program, none of the WGST professors are tenured or on the tenure track, and only two of its 12 faculty members work full time. If WGST becomes a department, its faculty will be able to pursue tenure and receive pay comparable to professors in other departments. A WGST department would also open up opportunities for undergraduate research and expand class offerings.
Celenza also proposed forming an advisory board of students and faculty to continue planning a potential transition from a program to a department. He also offered students a timeline explaining what the university has been doing since the proposal was originally submitted in 2017.
In the months following the proposal’s submission, Celenza’s office created a committee of women’s and gender studies-adjacent faculty to review the proposal. The committee conducted interviews of faculty, students and alumni over the course of the 2018 spring semester to gauge opinions of what the administration should do going forward. The committee then submitted its recommendation to Celenza’s office in the summer of 2018.
The advisory board would be able to provide students opportunities to advocate for departmental status within institutional channels, according to Stuer.
“At this point, the emphasis for us is on working together with the deans’ office as much as possible and showing them that a department is the best way forward for WGST,” Stuer said.
Though the meeting was a welcome development, students will continue to garner support and engage in activism, Watson said.
“At this point I’m happy with any communication, but I did leave the meeting feeling kind of lackluster,” Watson said. “I don’t know the intricacies of how we form a department, but I know that we need more professors. We need more office space. We need more mentorship. We need more research, and these are things we tell them time and time again and they seem to just kind of disregard it in a way.”
The initial proposal for a WGST department, submitted October 2017, asked for two full-time tenure-track positions, two to three additional full-time, nontenure-track faculty positions and a four to five-year dual enrollment Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts program.
The College deans plan to open up communication with the student body in the near future, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
“The College’s leadership is continuing to meet with faculty and students to discuss the proposal and remains committed to Women and Gender Studies prospering at Georgetown,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We look forward to providing more information in the coming months.”
Although no further meetings between the students and deans have been set yet, Watson said she hopes the dean’s office will be more transparent and responsive moving forward.
“It still doesn’t justify the complete lack of communication,” Watson said. “And that is something they addressed and something I think that’ll be a complete 180 from before because I’ve emailed Celenza, Edelstein and Lorensen now and they’ve all responded extremely promptly and have answered all my questions.”
Students pushing for a full WGST department held an interest meeting March 24. The group is currently collecting student statements about how WGST professors have helped them grow personally or academically via a Google form.
Students are focusing on spreading awareness of the campaign and engaging in continuous activism, according to Watson.
“We don’t need this to be drawn out, because we know what we need and want,” Watson said. “With this sort of thing, activism should never stop, because complacency is very dangerous in these types of situations.”

GU Fossil Free released a memo detailing its five-year plan for the university to divest from fossil fuel companies March 28 following a meeting with the university’s investment committee last week.
The memo resulted from a meeting between GUFF and the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, a group of university representatives charged with amending Georgetown’s investment practices. It provides a detailed plan for how CISR can achieve GUFF’s goal of complete divestment from fossil fuel companies by 2024. 
“We have taken a hard look at the specifics of our proposed strategy and methodology as a result of this conversation, and, in addition to answering your questions, would like to elaborate on the potential for divestment from fossil fuels over a five-year timeline with engagement,” the memo reads.
The group’s original proposal, which was submitted to CISR on Jan. 16, recommended that the university divest from all fossil fuel companies by 2024. However, GUFF announced in its memo it now recommends the university only divest from companies that do not meet a set of energy standards that would be outlined by a proposed working group composed of students and CISR representatives. 
CISR oversees the implementation of the Socially Responsible Investment Policy, which requires the university to refrain from investing in companies engaged in activities having a deleterious effect on the environment. 
By only divesting from companies that do not meet these standards, the university will maintain relationships with companies that are more sustainability friendly and encourage companies that do not meet such standards to change their ways, according to GUFF’s memo.
The memo demonstrates to the university that GUFF has a smart approach to divestment, according to Samantha Panchèvre (SFS ’19), GUFF member and Georgetown University Student Association sustainability chair.
“We were glad to hear some CISR members encourage us to think more creatively about how divestment along a five-year timeline would look like,” Panchèvre wrote in a message to The Hoya.
If Georgetown were to unilaterally divest from companies that fail to meet energy standards, the effects would be symbolic, GUFF wrote in its memo. The importance of the move comes from the potential for other universities to join in divestment to create a much more influential movement, according to the memo.
“If these efforts were to be undersigned by multiple universities, however, it would be possible to carve out a unique space for educational institutions to meaningfully engage with fossil fuels companies,” the memo reads.
The meeting followed a Feb. 4 meeting that was adjourned early to allow the Georgetown University Student Investment Fund and the Graduate Investment Fund, student groups that manage investments for the university’s endowment and the Alumni Association, to prepare presentations on the topic.
The meeting was effective in advancing divestment with CISR, according to GUFF member Celia Buckman (SFS ’21).
“While there were no official agreements or policy developments finalized during the meeting, we welcomed the insight of CISR members regarding the proposal,” Buckman wrote. “This meeting was an example of the productive dialogues that can result from the protocols established by GUFF in conjunction with CISR in 2017.” 
GUFF expects CISR to make a decision on the group’s divestment proposal in April, according to Panchèvre.
Georgetown is dedicated to sustainability and intends to continue facilitating discussions on the divestment, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
“Georgetown University takes seriously matters related to social responsibility and its investments,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “CISR plans to meet again this semester to continue its review of GU Fossil Free’s proposal.”
GUSIF and GIF were not available for comment at the time of press.
GUFF, which has long been a strong proponent of the university’s adoption of more socially responsible investment practices, has been successful in its previous petitions to the university. 
In 2017, Georgetown’s board of directors enacted a Socially Responsible Investing 
Policy aimed at aligning the endowment’s investment practices with the university’s ethical responsibilities. Later that year, the university removed all investments from tar sands after GUFF pushed for the university to divest from all carbon-based energies. 
GUFF’s success in these previous petitions laid the foundation for the most recent proposal to completely divest from all fossil fuel companies, according to Buckman.
“We definitely feel that there’s much more groundwork for our proposal this year, given that it’s the first full divestment proposal since the passage of the SRI Policy; divestments from thermal coal, tar sands, and private prisons; and the divestments of peer institutions, such as Seattle University and Middlebury College,” Buckman wrote.
The issue of divestment is an ongoing process that will take input from both students outside GUFF and the university, according to Buckman.
 “We’re looking forward to strategizing with the administration and the larger Georgetown community to divest from a place of genuine environmental and social concern and financial prudence,” Buckman wrote.

Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) urged indigenous women to advocate for the issues affecting their communities in political dialogue Tuesday.
The experiences of indigenous women give them a greater capacity to respect cultural pluralism and multilingualism, according to Haaland, one of the first two Native American women to serve in the U.S. Congress.
“I feel that what I bring to the table is my perspective as an indigenous woman. I know how to respect cultures. I know how to respect traditions. I know how to be respectful when somebody is speaking their indigenous language,” Haaland said. “I know the United States has a trust responsibility to Indian tribes, and that goes for all Indian tribes.”
Haaland, who took office earlier in 2019, became the first Native American woman to ever preside over the U.S. House of Representatives this month.
Addressing her role as a female legislator, Haaland said that although women have to work harder to gain recognition in the U.S. government, they should use that platform to boost issues that their constituents care about. 
“We just have to be ourselves and push forward and say we’re here because we care about the people we are representing,” Haaland said. “We’re here because we want our ideas and our issues to be at the forefront, and that’s really why anyone should want to serve the public, because they care deeply about the constituency.”
Haaland participated in an event titled “Intersectional Feminism in Congress,” hosted by the women’s and gender studies program in the Reiss Science Building. The event was moderated by You-Me Park, director of the WGST program, and featured a conversation between Haaland and Donna Brazile, a WGST adjunct assistant professor and former chair of the Democratic National Committee.
Minority representatives should not be intimidated about advocating for issues that directly affect their communities, Haaland said.
“It’s all about getting involved, it’s all about making sure that you are advocating for the right things,” Haaland said. “Because quite frankly, there are a lot of folks in Congress who don’t know or understand even what tribes are, or what that relationship is, or what they should be doing.”
The barriers faced by minority representatives such as Haaland can only be dismantled once young American voters show the willingness to take political initiative, according to Brazile.
“We can make it possible that one day we wake up and we’re not counting two Native American women. And we’re not counting a handful of African-Americans, and a handful of Hispanics and a handful of openly gay candidates,” Brazile said. “Your generation, the largest generation of voters, you can make that happen. And why you? I tell it to my students, you know, because there’s no one better. And why now? Because tomorrow is not soon enough.”
Haaland is particularly concerned about addressing some of the issues faced by Native American communities, such as the high occurrence of disappearances and murders of indigenous women. Native women on tribal lands face a murder rate 10 times higher than the national average, according to a 2016 Department of Justice report.
Improvements must be made to law enforcement structures in native communities, according to Haaland.
“So much needs to be done,” Haaland said. “If tribal police are the only ones on the scene for miles and miles and miles, they need to know how to handle evidence. The FBI needs to have a unit in their organization that deals more with this issue, because it’s in epidemic proportions.”

Annie Rao (GRD ’04) was appointed the inaugural director of the Graduate Career Center made specifically for students of Georgetown’s Graduate School of Arts & Sciences.
The new career center is expected to open in the fall of 2019 and is set to be located in Car Barn Suite 312, the graduate school announced in an email to Georgetown community members March 21.
Over the coming months, the new graduate career center will phase in new programs in advance of its official opening, according to university spokesperson Matt Hill.
By providing individually tailored career services to graduate students, the center will work to fulfill Georgetown’s mission of preparing students for professional careers, according to Hill.
“After an intensive review process that solicited feedback from faculty, students, and staff from across the university, Georgetown decided to create the Graduate Career Center and provide a more tailored career services approach to serving graduate students,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The university announced its intention to establish a career center for students of the graduate school September 2017, declaring plans to open the center in the fall of 2018. The opening has since been delayed, and the center is now expected to open next fall.
Rao previously worked at The George Washington University, where she served as director of Graduate Career Management in the GWU Business School. Rao also worked at National Geographic in digital marketing as well as at American Express as a business analyst. 
Rao’s experiences working the private sector have contributed to her success as a career counselor, she wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“It is my 15 years of professional experience in the corporate world that really allows me to connect the dots for students who are unsure of their career options or how to go about achieving their goals,” Rao wrote.
The Graduate School of Arts & Sciences Career Center will work independently, but collaboratively, with the undergraduate Cawley Career Education Center, according to Susan Campbell, director of Cawley.
“Dedicated resources for graduate students provided by this new center as well as other existing graduate career centers will allow us to sharpen our focus on undergraduates while continuing to partner with other centers in ways that benefit all students,” Campbell wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Cawley Career Center, Georgetown’s current career center for both graduate and undergraduate students, has drawn criticism from students for a lack of available appointments, low support for international students and turning students away during drop-in hours.
The graduate career center will join Georgetown’s six established career centers: Cawley for undergraduates, one for each of the four graduate schools and Alumni Career Services.
“To create a campus-wide ecosystem that supports holistic career development, Georgetown is working to build a career services model that breaks down traditional silos and integrates career services with academic programs and co-curricular activities in all undergraduate and graduate schools,” Campbell wrote.
The new center will take a holistic approach to career services, according to Rao.
“It goes far beyond resumes, cover letters and interviewing – but those things are the foundational components, and there are proven practices to make them effective,” Rao wrote. “That’s the science part and it is non-negotiable. The art is figuring out how to make yourself stand out from all the others whose skills also meet the needs of the organization.”
The new graduate career center will emphasize sensitivity to the specific needs of graduate students, including balancing coursework with family and jobs, according to Rao
“We will consider the unique factors of being a graduate student while developing our suite of career services, resources, and programs,” Rao wrote.
Preparations for the services the center will provide are ongoing and supported by other career resources on campus, according to Rao.
“I am meeting with and listening to students, faculty, staff, alumni, and employers to understand the specific needs of graduate students and those who hire them,” Rao wrote.

Peter Nouhan (GRD ’19) started a new program that trains high school students for free to file taxes on behalf of low-income individuals in Washington, D.C., primarily within Ward 7.
Nouhan founded SEED Tax Prep Ambassadors after receiving the 2018 Baker Innovation Grant, a $20,000 grant to fund social and political programs founded by graduate students from the Baker Center for Leadership and Governance, within the McCourt School of Public Policy.
The program trains students at the SEED Public Charter School of Washington, D.C., a local public charter boarding school in Fort Dupont, to help their community members earn tax refunds.
So far, high school volunteers from the program have assisted over 70 people in filing their taxes, nearing their goal of helping 100 clients this season.
Low-income earners often miss opportunities for saving when they file their taxes, according to Nouhan.
“The earned income tax credit is one of the biggest social welfare programs that’s hidden in the tax code,” Nouhan said in an interview with The Hoya. “So many people in D.C. alone aren’t taking advantage of this program because they don’t have access to affordable, quality tax preparation.”
The federal earned income tax credit, created to benefit workers with low to moderate income, provides tax refunds and may lower the amount of tax owed for those who qualify and file a tax return.
The median household income for Fort Dupont, the neighborhood surrounding the SEED Charter School, is $34,487, and the national poverty line for a household of three is $21,330.
The program was developed with the help of Hoya Taxa, a Georgetown student-run tax assistance program founded in 2013 that offers free tax assistance to low-income communities throughout the District, according to Daphne Chiang (MSB ’19), a member of the Hoya Taxa mentorship team.
“Peter wanted Hoya Taxa to help out as much as possible, and since this program was so new, he was very open to ideas,” Chiang wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Peter did not have experience filing taxes or with Community Tax Aid, and looked to Hoya Taxa members’ experiences to get a better idea of the filing process.”
Since traditional tax filing can take up to three hours, volunteers use a “Drop-Off” model currently used in Detroit and New York, which allows a client to spend only 20 minutes filing taxes, according to Nouhan.
High school volunteers are trained and certified to handle the tax documents, which includes intaking the client’s information including tax documents, photo ID and social security card, and uploading them to a secure Google Drive. A certified public accountant then prepares the taxes remotely. The client returns a week later to go over their return, then everything is submitted to the IRS, according to Nouhan.
The training got easier over time, but some volunteers questioned their participation in the program after the work increased in complexity, according to Kendriss Johnson, a member of the SEED team.
“The training was challenging in the very beginning,” Johnson said in an interview with The Hoya. “I was like, ‘Do I really want to do this? Will I understand how to do this?’”
Hoya Taxa will provide a foundation for the Tax Prep Ambassador program’s future, according to Luisa Boyarski, the Assistant Director of the Center for Public and Nonprofit Leadership at the Baker Center.
“While Peter will be graduating this year, Hoya Taxa will be stepping to to lead the work with the high school students, creating meaningful mentorship opportunities that can have important impacts beyond tax preparation,” Boyarski wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The Tax Prep Ambassadors program can serve as a model for similar programs across the country, according to Boyarski.
“By engaging both high school and college students in this work, Peter’s model is helping educate the next generation before they have to file their taxes for the first time,” Boyarski wrote. 
Volunteering for SEED has been a rewarding experience because of its contributions to the Seed Charter School community, Johnson said.
“The most meaningful part is knowing that I’m helping people in the community,” Johnson said. “There aren’t a lot of people that can say they helped someone do something that’s so stressful, so I’m just happy to help anyone who needs it.”

Incorporating diverse voices, especially those of women, into Church hierarchy is essential to healing and progressing beyond the clerical abuse crisis, panelists said Sunday.
Members of the church, especially women, are willing to challenge church tradition, according to Fr. Hans Zollner, S.J., founder and president of the Centre for Child Protection at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.
“You have, now, a new generation of the religious who take ownership of their church and are not submitted and submissive to the bishops anymore,” Zollner said. “There is a new understanding and a new self-assurance on the side of the female religious.”
Zollner is also a member of the organizing committee for the meeting on the protection of minors in the church, which recommends policies to address the sexual abuse scandal to the Vatican.
Kim Daniels, the associate director of Georgetown’s Initiative for Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, moderated the event in Copley Formal Lounge, which began with a one-on-one discussion between Zollner and Daniels.
Following Daniels and Zollner’s conversation, Kathleen Coogan, a member of the Parish Pastoral Council, a consultative body for Holy Trinity Catholic Church in the Georgetown neighborhood, and Michael Nugent, a member of the Washington, D.C. Archdiocese’s Child Protection Advisory Board and a survivor of clerical sexual abuse, joined in a panel discussion of clerical abuse.
Lay members have the potential to enact real change in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, Nugent said. Concrete guidelines, like those Nugent developed into a handbook and child policy waiver, are the key to safeguarding minors, Nugent said.
“You can go to this, and it’ll direct you to exactly what you need to do,” Nugent said. “This is really invaluable, and we’re very glad because if someone doesn’t do it, they wind up goofing things up — that’s happened once.”
The Archdiocese of Washington has a 32-page “Child Protection Policy” booklet outlining the Archdiocese’s policies for screening clergy before service, reporting abuse of minors and enforcing accountability. The guidelines in the booklet require any adult seeking employment or volunteer work with an Archdiocesan school, parish or agency interacting closely with children to undergo a criminal background check and complete for a child protection workshop.
While women are excluded from many leadership roles within the Catholic Church, their continued participation is critical, according to Coogan. Coogan said she hoped women did not leave the church in the face of the abuse crisis.
“That many of us own this in our hearts, as Father Zollner stressed, is important if we’re going to make progress,” Coogan said. “I hope that by staying, I can also make a difference with my colleagues to make the church better.”
The Catholic Church does not allow women to hold any clerical positions, though more than half of Catholic women who attend church believe women should be allowed to be ordained as deacons, according to a 2018 study by Georgetown’s Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate.
The key to the church’s sustainability lies in incorporating more voices into the church, particularly those of women, according to Zollner.
“I don’t think it is a generational problem in the sense that it will grow out,” Zollner said. “It has to do with how much, for example, women are present in seminary formation, how much human formation is really taken into account as much as it is necessary for religious and Christian formation.”
The Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life has hosted multiple events this year addressing clerical abuse, including a Sept. 25 panel on the connection between Catholic social teachings and the sexual abuse crisis, an Oct. 24 panel on the need for change in Church culture and a Dec. 4 event on political and social turmoil.
This panel was also the first hosted by the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life since The Hoya reported that Georgetown had failed to acknowledge 10 members of clergy with records of abuse and ties to the university.
Despite the important role laypeople can take on within the Catholic Church, addressing the problem requires conviction from priests, Zollner said.
“The point is how can we learn to understand that you also need to own the issue with your heart,” Zollner said. “And you are not only obliged because the law or the norm tells you to do so, but because you are fully convinced that needs your full attention.”
Much of the anger in the American Catholic laity toward leadership is related to the Church’s inability to resolve the issue since a 2002 Boston Globe report uncovered decades of clerical abuse and the subsequent coverup, according to Zollner.
“The great disillusionment and the huge disappointment and the fervent anger about your leadership partly comes from the fact that you believed in 2002 that it was over — we have done it, we found the system and solution to this,” Zollner said. “And then you find out that bishops still covered up and did not do what was even in the guidelines, even in the norms, even in the charter, and so on.”
The ultimate consequences of the Vatican’s inability to resolve the sexual abuse crisis not only fall on survivors of abuse but also on the sustainability of the church as a whole, according to Nugent, who is skeptical of whether substantive reforms have been implemented.
“I’d need evidence,” Nugent said, referring to progress on sexual abuse prevention in the Church. “But I do know, on my own account, that the nine o’clock mass is not as well attended as they used to be.”
