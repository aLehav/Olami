Evening thunderstorms left Yates Field House flooded with about six inches of water, though the facilities remain open and cleanup efforts are underway.
The entrance, main lobby and second floor — which overlooks the workout area — began to flood at about 8:30 p.m.
According to Erik Williams, a summer student visiting from Winston-Salem State University who works at the front desk of Yates, a drain outside the building became clogged and water entered Yates through the front doors.
“It’s flooded before, but not like this,” he said.
Two DPS officers arrived by 8:40 p.m. and members of the football team, administrators and Yates employees used buckets to scoops water up and dump it outside of Yates. Water vacuums are also being used to clear the water.
Yates remains open to those who want to use the facilities during the cleanup process.
