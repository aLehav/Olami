The D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute published a report on Washington, D.C.’s public housing Jan. 27, citing a lack of federal funding as the leading cause of delay in affordable housing redevelopment.
Using data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the report finds that 78 percent of public housing units in the District, which correlates to approximately 6,500 units, need extreme capital improvements. Last year, the D.C. Housing Authority received $14 million in federal funding to make these improvements, while the estimated cost of the projects totaled $1.3 billion.
According to the report, 55 percent of D.C.’s public housing units, which correlates to approximately 4,000 units, have seniors or adults with disabilities as the heads of the households. On average, the occupants of public housing units earn 15 percent of the median income for the D.C. metropolitan area.
Mayor Muriel Bowser allocated upwards of $82 million of the city’s Housing Production Trust Fund to assist in affordable housing projects in the District on Jan. 29. Bowser stressed the importance of affordable housing in the District in a press conference Jan. 29.
“We all know that housing affordability is one if not the top issue in the District of Columbia,” Bowser said. “And everything that we do is going to help make more people be able to afford to live in Washington, D.C.”
Of the 800 units that will receive funding from the city’s housing trust fund, 216 will go to residents in the lowest income bracket, which is specified as a family of four living on $32,880 or less a year. Eighty-three other units will be used as permanent housing for the homeless.
Fiscal Policy Institute Housing Policy Associate Claire Zippel, the author of the report, highlighted the need to redevelop public housing in urban areas to better serve residents.
“Public housing is very unique because it serves probably the lowest income level of any other housing program,” Zippel said. “Around the country, there has been a growing sense since the 1990s that public housing is in bad shape. It has been underfunded especially in big cities – New York, Chicago, D.C. – and the instinct is to redevelop it.”
The main attempt at redevelopment by the District is the New Communities Initiative, which began in 2005 in response to federal budget cuts to D.C. public housing. The initiative cites guiding principles such as one for one replacement, which aims to ensure no net loss of existing housing; mixed-income housing, which works to end the concentration of poverty and low-income housing; the opportunity for residents to return or stay in their communities; and prioritization of building, which calls for the development of new housing to begin prior to the demolition of existing housing units.
The initiative is only in effect in four neighborhoods of the District: Barry Farm in Ward 8, Northwest One in Ward 6, Lincoln Heights-Richardson Dwelling in Ward 7 and Park Morton in Ward 1.
D.C. Councilmember LaRuby May (D-Ward 8), who represents an area that includes Barry Farm, highlighted the importance of the initiative in monitoring housing and reducing resident displacement.
“New Communities is the vehicle that the District has to be able to look at our local commitment to the preservation of low-income housing,” May said. “No one wants to uproot and displace any family. If possible you want to keep people in their neighborhood, in their community, with a level of familiarity of where they are.”
The report also includes recommendations to improve redevelopment, including ensuring that residents have access to reliable, affordable housing throughout the process, increased communication between the redevelopers and unit occupants and a confirmation that occupants have a right to return to redeveloped units.
Zippel said that though redevelopment is beneficial to the community, it must be done according to the guidelines set by both her report and the New Communities Initiative.
“I think that the main point of the report is that if redevelopment is possible, if you have the funding to do it, it is really important to do it right,” Zippel said. “Any kind of housing development or redevelopment is really, really tricky. You have to make all the numbers work, you have to have all the land, you have to have all of your development partners lined up, so there is a lot that can go wrong. It is a very delicate operation that requires a lot of vigilance.”
Research associate at the Urban Institute and sociology professor Mark Treskon said the issues D.C. public housing faces are not unique to the region.
“D.C. is facing the same issue that I think that a lot of the big cities are facing,” Treskon said.
“Across the board, those kinds of developments ran into problems. There was money put forth for building them in the first place, but there wasn’t really money put forth for upkeep to the same extent.”
Katherine Cole (MSB ’18), coordinator of Threads of Hope, an organization focused on assisting low-income communities, said that increased access to housing for low-income individuals could improve many lives. Cole said she believes that many Georgetown students are unaware of the city’s public housing crisis.
“We are kind of in our Georgetown bubble, and we don’t see the things that are going on, and they are there and they are big problems,” Cole said.

The Office of the District of Columbia Auditor and the Bromwich Consulting Group released a report on the Metropolitan Police Department practices Jan. 28, finding that the MPD is largely compliant with best practices but has several inadequacies.
The report is based upon monitoring of the department from 2008 to 2015 to see if it is still compliant with the stated reforms of a 2001 agreement between the MPD, the District and the United States Department of Justice.
The MPD has worked to improve since serious allegations of excessive force and police shootings arose in the 1990s. The Washington Post published a series in 1998 reporting that MPD officers fired their weapons at more than double the rate of other major police departments.
In 2001, the MPD announced the Memorandum of Agreement in which it agreed to an independent review by a monitoring team jointly appointed by the Department and the DOJ.
The Bromwich Group offers crisis management, consulting and public affairs services. Managing Principal Michael Bromwich, who formerly served as the DOJ Inspector General, said that the report revealed that the reforms implemented at the behest of the DOJ in 2001 continue to be in effect at a press conference Jan. 28.
“There’s no evidence that the MPD has an excessive use of force problem,” Bromwich said. “The bottom line is the reforms are still in place and they continue to be managed by people that care about them.”
The report found that notable improvements have been made to the MPD since 2001. The intentional use of firearms has declined significantly, and the serious use of force by officers, which includes chokeholds and the use of canines, has also decreased. Allegations against MPD officers for excessive force declined from 23 in 2005 to 6 in 2015.
D.C. Auditor Kathy Patterson, the report author, said that the improvements made since 2001 have been sustained in the department.
However, the report also found several discrepancies in MPD practices and made 38 recommendations for improvement. Of the recommendations, the Department agreed in whole or in part to 28 of them, including changing a law where resisting arrest results in an Assaulting an Officer Misdemeanor charge and requiring the MPD to teach proper chokehold techniques to officers.
One discrepancy is in the legal process in place for investigations and reviews of officer conduct. Usually, when an officer is suspected of abusing his powers or excessively using force, the Internal Affairs Department is the first to investigate the incident, before sending its findings to the United States’ Attorney’s Office.
According to the report, the main inadequacy with this process is the time it takes to review an officer’s conduct. Currently, the USAO can take up to 19 months to review a case involving excessive force. The Bromwich Group recommended this process to take no longer than six months.
“MPD and USAO should establish a goal of completing the USAO review of serious use of force cases within six months, with that period to be extended only by explicit agreement between the US Attorney and the Chief of Police, and with specific reasons provided that justify the need for additional time,” the report reads.
In an official response to the report, the MPD stated that it agreed with the Bromwich Group’s recommendation for reducing delays in reviewing excessive use of force cases.
MPD Chief of Police Cathy Lanier wrote in her response to the report that U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips is working closely with the MPD and that she believes they can decrease delays by working together.
“USAO Phillips and his staff are important partners, and we are confident based on the commitment he has shown that some of the delays in USAO reviews can be reduced,” Patterson wrote.
Despite the MPD’s improvements, there are still instances of excessive police violence. An MPD officer shot and killed a man holding a BB gun near 53rd Street Southeast on Feb. 1.
Patterson attributed the shooting to an individual case of misjudgment rather than department-wide deficiency. However, she mentioned that changes to the entire department, including force training, could potentially help prevent the MPD from repeating the same mistakes.
“I think that some of the situations we hear about from time to time, including in MPD are the individual officers making mistakes,” Patterson said. “And that’s where the use of force reporting and the use of force training and the use of force investigations can be very, very helpful in making it clear when mistakes are made and how people can learn from them.”
Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) praised the D.C. Auditor’s office and the MPD for reviewing the department’s practices in a press conference Jan. 28.
“So often analysis or review of police incidents are done on a reactive basis. There’s a report of police abuse or corruption and there’s an investigation… That’s not the case here,” Mendelson said. “At a time when cities across the country are confronting this issue, the D.C. Auditor’s report is proactive and is a function of checking and rechecking ourselves on how we are doing.”
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber emphasized the need to understand the complexities involved in implementing policy changes in the MPD.
“I believe the recommendations come from one viewpoint and they have to be looked at from several other viewpoints. People can make recommendations for changes but those recommendations now have to be worked through the legal process, they have to be worked through the MPD process,” Gruber said. “There are just a lot of pieces of that puzzle. It’s not that cut and dry.”

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser announced the appointment of Odie Donald II as executive director of the D.C. Workforce Investment Council on Jan. 20, where he will oversee the District’s effort to comply with federal regulations under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.
The WIOA, which was signed by President Barack Obama in July 2014 and enjoyed bipartisan Congressional support, is designed to aid employment seekers through increased access to education, training and support services.
The move comes as part of a larger push from the Bowser administration to improve economic opportunity for the District’s residents. Deputy Mayor for Greater Economic Opportunity Courtney R. Snowden acknowledged the District’s poor track record in this regard.
“For too long our government has failed to effectively serve residents in overlooked and underserved communities,” Snowden wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Donald is Bowser’s second major addition in recent months to the WIC, following the appointment of local restaurant chain Busboys and Poets owner Andy Shallal to chair of the Council in December.
Snowden spoke positively of Donald’s past work experience in Atlanta, Ga., which most recently includes a position as the WIOA services director in the Georgia Department of Economic Development.
“In Atlanta, he was responsible for creating positive change quickly in the city’s workforce system, and I fully expect he will do the same for the District of Columbia,” Snowden wrote.
Donald stressed that the WIC’s purpose is to centralize all workforce development resources available in the District to ensure its compliance with WIOA and other laws.
“What I hope to accomplish is ensuring that there is a workforce system in place that allows businesses and job-seekers to connect with each other as easily as possible, help to improve the growing economy here in the District and ensure that there are more jobs available for more of the District residents and that it’s easy for them to obtain those jobs,” Donald said.
Donald added that he saw potential challenges as opportunities for an expansion of services and programs in the workforce.
“The contribution of WIOA, it kind of requires added accountability and oversight for local systems and state boards like the WIC,” Donald said. “But at the same time, it kind of allows for a lot more flexibility in the delivery of services, and gives us some real opportunities to create some impactful state-level programs and increase accessibility to the workforce system.”
However, Director of the Center on Education and the Workforce at the McCourt School of Public Policy Anthony Carnevale said he is not optimistic about the future of workforce development in the District.
“What you have here is a very rich community and a rich metro area and so politicians are more about chasing businesses,” Carnevale said. “The development opportunities are what get talked about among D.C. leaders, not jobs for the kids who were raised here.”
Snowden disputed this characterization, arguing the Bowser administration has not forgotten about D.C. residents, as was evidenced in the creation of the office of the deputy mayor for greater economic opportunity.
“In creating the DMGEO office, Mayor Bowser made it clear that supporting the needs of our workforce is a top priority of her administration,” Snowden wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I disagree with Dr. Carnevale’s premise. Major business or development projects and workforce improvements are not mutually exclusive.”
Carnevale also criticized the lack of information about job opportunities available to those entering the workforce in D.C., noting that in Virginia and Maryland it is possible to look up any job-training or education program and see where it led its graduates, but is not possible in D.C.
“The trouble with D.C. is they have the information necessary to help people looking for work and to guide people through school and college who want to understand the career pathways that are implicit in their college majors and the like, but D.C. has never made that information available,” Carnevale said. “And essentially, what you have in D.C. is, there are a set of data warlords who are halfway down the hierarchy in the D.C. government, who won’t let go of the data, and you have no leadership at the top that is interested in modernizing the information system itself.”
Carnevale said he is not confident Donald will be able to change this because of the political factors influencing the availability of job information to District residents.
“I think there are political reasons why people don’t want to know what happens to kids who grow up in D.C., because, at the present, not much good does happen to a lot of them,” Carnevale said. “That would put additional pressure on elected officials to be more effective, and elected officials never want that.”

Regular decision applications rose by 2.46 percent this year, increasing from 19,478 for the Class of 2019 to 19,958 for the Class of 2020.
The slight increase marks a departure from the stable number of applicants over the past few years. This is the second-largest pool of regular applications the university has received since the 20,100 collected in 2012.
However, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon emphasized the relatively predictable overall trends in the total application pool.
“Generally there aren’t many changes you can see from year to year,” Deacon said. “Our applicant pool has been in the 19,000s all along. For a lot of places, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. You have to look beneath that to see all the changes that are going on.”
Georgetown College received 11,657 applications, compared to 11,461 for the Class of 2019; the School of Foreign Service collected 3,771, up from 3,597; the McDonough School of Business saw 3,294 applications, a decrease from 3,373; and the School of Nursing and Health Studies received 1,236 applications, a rise from last year’s 1,047 applications.
Black applicants increased from 1,886 to 1,975, Latino and Hispanic applicants rose from 2,364 to 2,469, Asian applicants increased slightly from 3,263 to 3,298 and white applicants rose from 11,073 to 11,568. Applications from international students remained relatively stable from 2,258 to 2,276.
In comparison to five years ago, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of regular applicants who are minorities. In 2011, 1,773 applicants were black, 2,058 were Latino and Hispanic and 2,786 were Asian. This year’s applicant pool marked an 11 percent increase in black applicants, a 20 percent rise in Latino applicants and an 18 percent growth in Asian applicants.
Continuing with the trend of past years, the largest number of applicants came from, in descending order, California, New York and New Jersey. Deacon highlighted the change in demographic patterns in terms of geography, particularly noting the rise in applications from states outside the Northeast region and the West Coast.
“While our largest historical markets, New York and New Jersey, are lower, we’re higher in other places to offset that,” Deacon said. “We certainly see Florida and Texas rising as mega-states.”
Deacon emphasized the need for the university to focus on meeting the financial requirements of students who are neither in the top socio-economic share of the population that can cover the full cost of tuition nor in the portion that receives full scholarship. Deacon pointed to the impact this challenge has on the university’s yield rate.
“There’s a part of the mix where we really do not do as well, what I call middle-income. While we meet their need for financial aid, there’s still a good amount that they still have to pay,” Deacon said. “Georgetown’s challenge going forward — and it hurts us, our yield is lower — in admissions is to figure out a way to build a financial resource that more adequately meets the needs of those students.”
Deacon also pointed to the university’s consistent recruitment strategies, even in the face of increased competition from peer institutions.
“We are kind of unusual, in the sense that we are not in a marketing frenzy, like some schools are. We are pretty much following the national trends,” Deacon said. “We’re competing, for better or worse, for a very narrow part of the high school graduate pool, the very top four or five percent, these students who get good scores and get good grades and have high aspirations.”
The overall acceptance rate for the Class of 2020 is expected to stabilize at a similar level to last year’s 16.4 percent. Deacon said the university does not employ strategies to reduce its admissions rate in order to increase its appearance of selectivity.
“In the admissions world, the Holy Grail of numbers are your admit rate and your yield,” Deacon said. “We’re in a fairly steady state, we would like to see the yield go higher, above 50 percent. But we don’t do anything to artificially create that, like early decision. We don’t try to admit people because we think they’ll come. We admit the best people and hope they’ll come.”
Regular application decisions will be released at the end of March.

This year’s Georgetown University Student Association executive race — comprised only of the Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Chris Fisk (COL ’17) ticket after Tony Pezzullo (MSB ’17) and A.J. Serlemitsos (COL ’17) dropped out of the race yesterday — marks a significant departure from past GUSA elections as potentially the first race with a single ticket in GUSA history.
Six presidential and vice presidential pairings ran in the 2015 executive election, three pairs ran in 2014 and five pairs ran in 2013.
According to past and present GUSA presidents and vice presidents, this year’s single-ticket election cannot be attributed to any one cause.
Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), former GUSA president in 2013-14, said election seasons seem to be cyclical.
“Things get very, very intense for a while and then for a variety of reasons, it ends up being a situation like you have this year, with maybe one large team that has a lot of different people working with them, and eventually they will all run against each other in future years,” Tisa said.
Tisa also noted the difficult nature of campaigning as a potential factor for this year’s single-ticket election.
“I think campaigning is very, very difficult. You are students, and grades are still important. People want to go to grad school, to law school, do things in the future and everyone knows that because it has been so competitive grades are going to suffer and that you might get into fights with friends, that the campus media will write mean things about you,” Tisa said.
Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), GUSA president in 2014-15, said he anticipates that the campaign this year will be vastly different from last year’s as a result of the student body’s choice of a satirical ticket.
“What I think happened last year was that that model [of election] suddenly showed some kind of structural problems in terms of students viewing it as an inappropriate way for student government to be interacting with students through the election process,” Tezel said. “I think they said ‘let’s go back to the drawing board’ in terms of how GUSA is reaching out to the students, and I think they chose the Luther-Rohan ticket in part because they wanted to change the way that GUSA communicated with the student body.”
Current GUSA Vice President Connor Rohan (COL ’16) said a series of factors led to other campaigns choosing not to run.
“I know of a ticket that fell apart. I know of a ticket that decided to run and then decided it wouldn’t be good for his social relationships. I know somebody who decided that it would be too much work to put in,” Rohan said.
Current GUSA President Joe Luther (COL ’16) said this year’s single-ticket election could not be confirmed as a consequence of one particular factor.
“I think it’s just an anomaly. I’ve heard some people say that the satirical victory last year made people disinterested in putting in all the work to run a campaign for the executive and others say that it made those already in GUSA put aside their differences and join together,” Luther said. “That’s all purely speculative though and I’m inclined to think it boils down to chance.”
According to Rohan, the single-ticket race was likely the result of the Khan-Fisk ticket managing to develop and consolidate a strong following early on.
“I think Chris and Enushe got in the door so early that they consolidated. Their campaign staff is over 200 — that’s huge. Last year, the biggest ticket was in the 70s and that was even really big. The people that would have been spread across the various campaigns have already been centralized,” Rohan said.
Khan said the smaller amount of tickets seen in the 2016 election is a reflection of past GUSA contests.
“I think that in terms of low turnout, and or having seen a decrease in tickets this year, it’s not surprising after seeing what happened last year,” Khan said. “I think it reflects in some ways a lot of the things we want to address with what we’re not liking about GUSA.”
Tezel said strong organization has also been an important factor in making this year’s election a single ticket, a quality that could translate well into the future GUSA administration.
“There is always a possibility, and I think a very real one, that they started at the right time to consolidate support among many of the student organizations and student interest groups in order to create a really effective candidacy and ticket that wasn’t going to be challenged,” Tezel said. “If that is the case, I think we as students should be really looking forward to them taking that organizational prowess and translating it into a GUSA administration and to administrative advocacy.”
Tezel said the preparation for his campaign began early. He found his running mate Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) by November and started to put together a core team at the end of the fall semester.
“Really, that was out of necessity and around the same time that all the other tickets started to form. It was important to do that because there is a lot that needs to be done beforehand like getting input from student groups in order to craft a policy,” Tezel said. “It’s not something that you can really do in just a couple of weeks time.”
According to Tezel, the single-ticket election has both positive and negative consequences, citing unity in the student body as well as a decrease in dialogue.
“I think it’s positive that there won’t be some of the division among students around a particular issue that you see during campaigns, because I think it’s really important to have a united front when pushing ideas toward the administration and sometimes the scars of a campaign can make that less effective,” Tezel said. “Will it mean that there’s fewer ideas being exchanged? Yes, I think that is where students probably lose the most.”
Tisa said the impact on students depends on how Khan and Fisk run their campaign.
“They are clearly in a leading position so that means they can really decide on how they want to proceed. They can be as detailed as they want, and they can give voters things to think about,” Tisa said. “Choice is always important.”

After years of serving the student body in both the Georgetown University Student Association senate and executive respectively, Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Chris Fisk (COL ’17) have made restructuring GUSA a key plank of their campaign platform.
Under the proposed restructuring, the executive and senate would have combined responsibilities under new “executive-senate policy teams,” which would assume the roles of current senate committees and subcommittees that work on specific issue areas. Secretaries and undersecretaries would be phased out and replaced by “policy team chairs” appointed by the president and vice president, who would lead the policy teams in conjunction with co-chairs chosen from the senate.
The finance and appropriations committee would be the only committee kept from the original model, but it would be required to have liaisons that keep policy teams updated on committee decisions.
A minimum of four policy teams would be commissioned, with team members reviewed by the GUSA president, vice president, speaker of the senate and vice speaker. Members of these policy teams would be chosen through a rolling application process and would be required to include at least one freshman each year.
The Khan-Fisk campaign is currently proposing 22 policy teams, but anticipates the number will drop as GUSA is restructured.
The president and vice president would lead the executive and keep the chief of staff and deputy chiefs of staff to oversee the work of policy team chairs. The executive would also continue to manage groups like the Student Advocacy Office, “What’s a Hoya?,” Office of the Student Worker Advocate and the GU Farmers Market.
The GUSA Fund, Constitutional Council and Election Commission would not be affected.
Khan, who is the current speaker of the senate and has served in the senate for three years, said the proposed structure for GUSA is meant to minimize redundancies in GUSA advocacy, eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy and break down the air of exclusivity that surrounds GUSA members.
“When we decided we wanted to run for GUSA, a big thing that we agreed on was that we needed to change what GUSA is,” Khan said. “We realized as an organization we were ineffective, because GUSA within itself is exclusive. Not only do we exclude those who are outside in the student body, but also inside GUSA. It’s a total mess.”
Khan said the current structure of GUSA has caused redundancies in advocacy due to the division between executive secretaries and senate subcommittees.
“My three years in the senate have shown me how ineffective as an advocacy body we are with division of the two bodies,” Khan said. “You have the executive with a secretary-cabinet structure working on policy issues, and then a senate, with people running on policy issues, but because they are elected later, they don’t really have much of a stake in driving policy initiatives.”
Fisk, a deputy chief of staff in the executive, also believes the division between executive and senate has contributed to a degree of tension between both branches, and an air of exclusivity which has contributed to the student body viewing GUSA as a club instead of an advocacy group.
“When we first met, we talked about how we didn’t want to do this in the constraints of a framework that is inefficient, not collaborative and exclusive,” Fisk said. “We want to reverse the three of those words.”
The size of subcommittees is also a concern for Khan and Fisk, as they believe the bloated size of the senate contributes to inefficiency and lack of involvement by underclassmen.
“The subcommittees are really big, larger than in my previous years in the senate, but I saw that largely freshmen wanted to get involved in subcommittees,” Khan said. “So we want freshmen working on policy areas that they care about, who are people who aren’t necessarily elected.”
To preserve freshman participation, Khan hopes that combining the executive and the senate will alleviate the tensions between what subcommittees want to accomplish and what secretaries are already working on.
“We realized that the subcommittees work, but rather [than] having a secretary here and a subcommittee there, why don’t we just bring them together in policy teams, working together, and have exec and senate representatives? That way policy is shared and you still have the primary administrative contact in the traditional executive form,” Khan said.
According to Khan, the idea to restructure GUSA preceded her campaign with Fisk, developing from her involvement in the senate redistricting process led by the Vice Speaker of the Senate Theo Montgomery (SFS ’18) and Off-Campus Senator Eric Henshall (COL ’16).
The senate is required by the GUSA constitution to geographically redistrict senate seats every three years. This year, the construction of the Northeast Triangle Residence Hall, the remodeling of the Former Jesuit Residence and the decision to house students in the Georgetown University Hotel raised questions as to whether geographic redistricting was still a feasible requirement.
“Last semester, under the charge to redistrict, I decided to have a parallel process to see how GUSA functions,” Montgomery said. “Student government at Georgetown is primarily an advocacy body, and in light of that, we have separate branches of an advocacy body. That doesn’t make a lot of sense, to be splitting your advocacy body in half and have it be working on the same issues.”
Following discussion in the senate, Montgomery and Henshall determined that any major changes to how senators are elected geographically would require ratification by the entire student body.
“What we are trying to do is rewrite the rules that we govern ourselves by to become more efficient, to work better for the student body, to be more effective in negotiating with administrators and putting the needs of the students first,” Montgomery said.
Those restructuring changes would not require a school-wide vote, and would only require changes to the bylaws of the constitution, which are voted on by the senate.
“We have been discussing this with Enushe. We were discussing this long before she suggested to us she was going to run,” Henshall said. “We intend to pursue this no matter who is elected, although she is campaigning on the same plan.”
Still, Montgomery and Henshall endorse Khan and Fisk’s plan.
Fisk said he believes opening up GUSA to the entire student body through policy teams will bring the students who care most about certain issues together.
“There are a huge number of students on this campus who care about issues, and having [GUSA] opened up for a team framework, for students to collaborate and for people who are experts to be in the same room, driving policy, is what we are looking for,” Fisk said.
Khan and Fisk plan on pursuing these changes as a top priority during the ongoing executive elections.
“If anything, we both are super excited. We’ve dealt with this bureaucracy for too long. Sometimes, it’s disillusioning,” Khan said. “It’s frustrating to see there aren’t a lot of ways to engage. And just thinking that this can be done structurally gives a lot of hope in terms of a brand new GUSA and having the ability to change what GUSA means on this campus is what we care about most.”

Georgetown University Law Center Dean William Treanor received an open letter from the Foundation of Individual Rights in Education Feb. 1 urging the university to revise its student organization policy after the center banned students from campaigning for presidential candidates.
The GULC cites its tax-exempt status as grounds to prohibit political campaign-related activities on campus.
FIRE, a nonprofit that seeks to promote individual rights at American colleges and universities, wrote its letter on behalf of Alexander Atkins (LAW ’17) and other law students who comprised an informal grass-roots group supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
The Office of Student Life rejected the student group’s request for a table outside of Georgetown Law’s McDonough Hall in September. The group then opted for cafeteria tables but was asked to leave on the day of the first Democratic debate on October 13 by university officials who cited the center’s policy governing partisan political speech.
According to the GULC’s Student Organization Policy on Partisan Political Activities, under the 501(c)(3) category of the Internal Revenue Code that grants tax exemption to nonprofit organizations, the university cannot engage in political campaign activity.
“Georgetown University and the Law Center must generally avoid engaging in partisan political campaign activity and must restrict the use of University resources in support of such activity,” the policy reads.
In FIRE’s letter, Senior Program Officer Marieke Tuthill Beck-Coon asked the GULC to review its broad interpretation of the policy, emphasizing the nonprofit’s disagreement with the university’s decision to extend the restrictions to student groups who campaign for a candidate. “We are asking Georgetown Law to re-evaluate its policies and be more permissive of students’ political speech and campaigning on campus, because it’s not necessary under 501(c)(3) for them to interpret such a broad ban,” Beck-Coon said to The Hoya. “They’re taking an over-cautious and over-broad approach that they clearly need to reevaluate in light of what is clearly important to their students and the values that the school claims to hold.”
Atkins said his student group discovered FIRE as it was further investigating 501(c)(3). FIRE offered to write a letter to Treanor on the students’ behalf, and though they were initially reluctant, they eventually agreed after communication with GULC administrators began to falter.
“I would say the initial reactions where I was seeking out what the policy was and the rationale behind it was, I would characterize the responses as prompt and concise and respectful, just kind of in very concrete terms explaining what the policy was,” Atkins said. “As I tried to seek greater clarity as to what the exact rationale, or justification behind the policy was, it was a little bit harder to get real answers. If we had it our way, we wouldn’t have had FIRE intervene on our behalf at all. We reached a point where we felt we weren’t being responded to.”
In an email to The Hoya, the GULC stated that, after receiving FIRE’s letter, it is exploring new ways to reconcile student political expression and the parameters established by the university’s tax-exempt status.
“Georgetown Law values political expression, and is committed to encouraging it while remaining true to our obligation as a nonprofit to remain politically neutral. As such we place limits on the use of university resources to distribute campaign materials,” the statement reads. “The Law Center is currently working on new ways to protect our students’ right to advocate for the political candidates of their choice, while still remaining within the bounds that our 501(c)(3) status imposes.”
Beck-Coon stressed that the situation at Georgetown is not unprecedented, pointing to the letters FIRE has sent to universities in previous election cycles, including Michigan State University in 2012, Montclair State University in 2014 and American University in 2015.
Beck-Coon said that, in general, private universities are more susceptible to a broader application of 501(c)(3), because private institutions do not operate under the state and therefore are not accountable to the First Amendment as public institutions are.
“Most likely because public institutions know that they have to respect the First Amendment rights of their students, which absolutely protect political speech and partisan political speech, I think they are more aware of the tension between free speech and an overbroad interpretation of 501(c)(3),” Beck-Coon said to The Hoya. “Private institutions are technically not required under the law to respect the rights of these students, because they’re not state actors.”
Beck-Coon also stressed that the restriction of students’ partisan speech is not conducive to fostering a rich academic community.
“Political and civic engagement are a huge part of education and a huge part of the academic community that is meant to promote discussion, learning, engagement,” Beck-Coon said. “This is when students should be discussing their issues, should be discussing their candidates, and an institution of higher education has an obligation to promote that kind of dialogue rather than suppress it.”
Atkins expressed the belief that the issue is indicative of a broader cultural shortcoming in the United States.
“Frankly, I think this is a tiny example of a much larger problem that the larger country faces where for whatever reason, we’ve gotten into this national cliche where the one thing you don’t talk about in public is politics, when in reality it is one of the most important things to our society,” Atkins said. “I do think it’s ironic that in the best law school in the nation’s capital, the political center of the country, students are being prevented from advocating on behalf of specific candidates for office.”

University President John J. DeGioia announced four new commitments to address Georgetown’s engagement with race, including the expansion of African American studies to include a major, during his “Racial Injustice in America: A Framework for Georgetown’s Future Engagement” address in Lohrfink Auditorium last Thursday.
DeGioia enumerated four explicit commitments, beginning with an expansion of the AAS program to a full department and major as well as the establishment of a research center dedicated to studying racial injustice. He also noted that a substantial recruitment effort will be made to hire the faculty needed for the department and center along with the appointment of a new senior officer to support the aforementioned initiatives.
DeGioia said the formation of the AAS department will revolve around interactions between a variety of different fields and departments. He asserted that the committees involved with the initiatives will ensure that the new department will flourish through such interdisciplinary efforts.
“We recognize that to draw from the full resources of our community it will be important to determine how best to capture the ‘interdisciplinary’ character of this work.” DeGioia said in his speech. “Our working group will need to explore whether the structure of a traditional department will support interdisciplinary work that crosses the full range of schools and disciplines that can contribute to this effort.”
For students planning to major in African American studies, and for others who want to take classes within the program, the addition of a new department comes after a lobbying effort begun last year with a petition and meeting with Dean of the College Chester Gillis.
The African American studies program also conducted a survey of students regarding the potential feasibility of an AAS department, major and students’ interest in specific classes in 2015. The AAS program was initially formed in 2004 for students hoping to minor in AAS and is now being transitioned to a full academic department.
According to Olivia Holmes (COL ’16), the effort has been years in the making, with the demand of students to take classes within the program measured by waitlist counts of 30 or more.
“With the creation of [an AAS] program, students have had the opportunity to take classes with professor of English and African American Studies Angelyn Mitchell, who helped found it, and it geared a lot of interest in creating a major,” Holmes said. “Since I’ve been here, the advocacy started with the Last Campaign for Academic Reform, which created the diversity [requirement], and from that push there’s also been a movement behind creating an African American studies department here, since the program is such an interesting thing and has so much depth.”
In order to continue to facilitate the development and progress of the commitments, DeGioia also authorized the recruitment of four professors for the upcoming school year and another four for the following year. Holmes noted how such an effort to increase faculty should also increase interdisciplinary study and the overall success of the initiatives.
“That’s the real push that I think a lot of students wanted across the country when it comes to African American studies, and just diversity of faculty,” Holmes said. “More faculty would be the best thing that the major’s doing, and it also gives us more options for interdisciplinary study and … we don’t have the opportunity to do so currently.”
While DeGioia did not provide a timeline for the commitments’ implementation, Bria Wade (COL ’19), a student interested in the program and excited for the new initiatives, hopes to be able to officially declare her major some time next year.
“From what I am aware of, hearing last semester and more recently, I expect the major to be solidified by next year, and that’s what I’m banking on,” Wade said.
Wade said she appreciated the commitment to make sure the programs are interdisciplinary, arguing that an AAS program needs to encompass a wide variety of different academic fields in order to be a program with depth.
“I can definitely see something that requires a deeper exploration of the African diaspora, so maybe an African studies course, an anthropology [class],” Wade said. “A little bit of everything. African American studies isn’t just African history in the U.S. or the Caribbean; it’s much more expansive.”
DeGioia stressed that the formation of the department and major, along with the planning of the other initiatives, will be careful, but it will not slow the process of innovation.
“I commit Georgetown to making these important new investments,” DeGioia said. “These will happen. But we will do so as we do all important, successful work —together, listening to one another, letting all who can contribute to participate in the new endeavors and working together to achieve our goals. These discussions will not be about whether we do these things, but how best to do them in the urgency of the moment.”

Candidates Tony Pezzullo (MSB ’17) and A.J. Serlemitsos (COL ’17) announced the withdrawal of their campaign from the race for executive office of the Georgetown University Student Association in [“Why We Are Ending Our GUSA Campaign” (The Hoya, A3, Feb.9, 2016)].
With only two campaigns officially declared, the remaining presidential-vice presidential pairing of Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) and Chris Fisk (COL ’17) will run in a de facto single ticket race.
Pezzullo and Serlemitsos were running a self-identified joke campaign, but wanted to draw attention to campaign issues and the low participation in the race itself.
“We got into this race because we knew otherwise Enushe and Chris were going to be running uncontested, and we wanted to raise the campus-wide interest level in the campaign,” Pezzullo wrote in the viewpoint. “There are important issues to be discussed here, and we wanted all Hoyas to be aware of them — we hope we got at least a few more people interested and invested in the big decisions to be made under this next administration.”
Pezzullo cited issues the next GUSA executives will have to address, including the Aramark contract renewal and actions to take with results from the Sexual Assault and Misconduct Climate Survey, and commended Khan and Fisk for tackling them.
“They have the skills, ideas and passion necessary to make a great positive impact on this campus, and we look forward to seeing what they will get done this year. We encourage all students to come out to the debates and ask the important questions — keep these two on their toes,” Pezzullo wrote. “We know that we are leaving the Hilltop in competent hands, we know that Enushe and Chris will do everything they can … to make Georgetown great again.”
The dynamics of the election will change, as will the format of the vice presidential debate scheduled for tomorrow, Feb. 10, and the presidential debate scheduled for next Monday, Feb. 15.
GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said the debates will take on more of a town hall style and will likely be combined on Feb. 15.
“Should a candidate drop out, it is likely that we would hold some form of a town hall wherein the election commission, campus media and students would be able to ask candidates questions,” Willard said. “In a one candidate scenario, a one-team scenario, we would combine the presidential and vice presidential debates into one.”
Khan said a single-ticket race would have no impact on her and Fisk’s campaign.
“Over the course of the next week and a half, our goal is to engage people and really sit down with them and to hear from them on their perspectives in terms of what GUSA can do better to serve them as a resource,” Khan said.

Georgetown’s Interim Chief Public Health Officer Ranit Mishori recommended precautionary measures for students traveling in Latin America and the Caribbean as a result of the outbreak of the mosquito-born Zika virus, in a campus-wide email sent February 2, as well as for students studying abroad in affected countries.
“I am writing to share information and current guidance about an emerging health threat called the Zika virus,” Mishori wrote. “This information is particularly important for those who are currently visiting one of the countries where Zika virus transmission has been documented, or are planning a trip to one of the regions or countries affected.”
The Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention has issued a Level 2 travel alert, cautioning visitors to countries across the region, including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Puerto Rico. The World Health Organization has also designated the virus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, a distinction reserved for cases that require immediate international action and pose threats beyond national boundaries.
The disease, which is transmitted through infected mosquitoes, has reportedly infected three people in Washington, D.C., including one pregnant woman. Aside from symptoms such as fevers, rashes and joint pains, the Zika virus has been linked to causing babies to be born with head and brain anomalies, a condition known as microcephaly. The virus has no known cure and a vaccine is yet to be developed.
The CDC is still investigating the possibility of the virus’ transmission through sexual contact and blood transfusions, as well as its possible connection to a paralysis-inducing disease known as Guillain-Barré syndrome.
The Office of Global Education, which is responsible for the university’s study abroad program, is monitoring and alerting the seven students preparing to or currently studying in the CDC Travel Alert Level 2 areas about the situation. Students were contacted by the OGE and by their local programs with information about risks, symptoms and prevention techniques.
Director of Global Education Craig Rinker stressed the importance of keeping students who are abroad safe.
“The health and safety of study abroad participants is of the highest importance, not just to the Office of Global Education but to the entire Georgetown community,” Rinker wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are monitoring the progression of the Zika Virus through CDC and WHO for all regions and locations.”
Rinker said that the OGE has taken the necessary precautions in communicating with students and ensuring their safety.
“We have been in direct communication with students who may be impacted by the Zika Virus,” Rinker wrote. “Not much information about the virus is known at this time. Therefore, we are strongly encouraging students to stay informed through the information at the CDC and WHO as well as their local program contacts.”
Barbara Anne Kozee (SFS ’17), who is studying abroad in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, said that aside from the presence of new public health posters, business goes on as usual for most city residents. Kozee said that she is not too concerned about becoming infected, expressing more worry about the Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, which can also be carried by the same mosquitoes that carry Zika.
“It is definitely a possibility, but I am not worrying too much about it,” Kozee wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As someone who doesn’t plan on becoming pregnant, the virus is just like any other, with vomiting, fevers, and diarrhea. I’m actually more concerned about Dengue, because this virus poses the threat of hemorrhagic fever and death.”
Despite the adverse impact on health in the region, Kozee credits the Zika virus with sparking conversations that could potentially positively affect the region. Controversy has surrounded the policies of countries such as El Salvador, which has advised women to avoid getting pregnant in the next two years because of the risk of birth defects in babies afflicted with the virus.
“The Zika virus has helped illuminate the burden put on women when public health officials release formal statements essentially saying, ‘Just don’t get pregnant’ while denying access to these resources. In the Dominican Republic, as in many countries in Central America, abortion is illegal and contraception is not readily available,” Kozee wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think this has sparked important conversations in Latin America about women’s reproductive rights and machista culture.”
Carolyn Vilter (COL ’17), who is taking a leave of absence this semester to intern at the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana, Mexico, said she is taking precautions against the virus.
“I’m planning to wear insect repellent whenever I leave the city, and I’ve treated some of my clothing with insect repellent so I’ll be better-protected when travelling and hiking,” Vilter wrote in an email to The Hoya. “My dad put ‘Don’t get bitten’ on my trip to-do list, and that’s pretty much the goal.”
However, Vilter said she believes the issue is not confined to Latin America and stressed the need to treat the spread of the virus as an international concern.
“Pretty early in the crisis, airlines began refunding tickets and many people, including my parents, on my behalf, began doubting the wisdom of travelling to Zika-affected countries,” Vilter wrote. “The problem isn’t Latin America’s alone. Areas as far North as D.C. and beyond seasonally harbor the mosquitoes that carry Zika. In the long term, this is a global issue.”

The university is considering consolidating all mail services to one central location in the Leavey Center beginning in fall 2016 as part of Georgetown’s 2017 campus plan, a proposal that has come under scrutiny from on-campus student workers.
Under the proposal, packages for students would be held and distributed from a single office that may also provide printing services and a new mailbox system.
According to Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh, the university has assembled a committee composed of students and administrators to evaluate the pros and cons of such a system, which has been discussed since 2014. “Benefits of this model include efficiency, streamlined services, better use of the limited space on campus, improved customer service and more utilization of technology, all of which are the best practices that we’ve seen utilized at peer institutions,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. Another possible benefit of the proposed system includes the reduction of mail trucks and vehicles driving through campus to drop off packages at each RHO, decreasing overall traffic and congestion.
Associate Vice President of Auxiliary Services Joelle Wiese, who has led the conversation over mail consolidation since 2014, said she is unable to comment on the topic until March.
As the university continues the planning process for this system, the administration has faced criticism for its lack of communication with students regarding the future plan.
Georgetown University Student Association Secretary of Campus Planning Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) argued students who work within the current RHO offices need to be better informed on the plans. Without proper communication from the administration, students are left not knowing their future as workers in the current mail system. “There’s been a real lack of transparency from the administration throughout this conversation, which has been frustrating for students who have a significant stake in the issue,” Goldstein said. “The conversation has shifted from ‘this is a possibility’ to ‘this is a plan’ without any real details or deadlines having been provided.”
Goldstein also claimed the drawbacks of centralized mail outweigh the benefits. These drawbacks include longer lines and poorer service, especially during textbook season, lack of accessibility for physically disabled students and job losses for several student employees, many of whom are employed through federal work-study programs.
“The proposal has merit, but until we hear really specific answers to the concerns that I mentioned, I can’t lend support to it,” Goldstein said. “The student worker, accessibility and service issues present much larger concerns than centralized mail presents excitement.”
GUSA Secretary for Residential Living Connor Maytnier (COL ’17), who is also a member of the mail committee, said the conversation on a centralized system is still ongoing, but has yet to produce any finalized goals.
“As far as my involvement with it and where we left it, it was clear that they were very interested in exploring it and in moving us to that system, but at every step of the way there were real concerns related to the loss of student jobs, the overall customer satisfaction and what it means for mailing packages on campus,” Maytnier said.
Maytnier also acknowledged that communication from the administration to students is lacking, adding that there needs to be a future commitment to making sure all relevant parties are informed.
“I would say it’s just overall something that’s got serious questions that have got to be answered. If they can’t be answered, or if they can’t be answered satisfactorily, then we’ve got a serious problem with this,” Maytnier continued. “If we can come to a solution, there’s hope for it, but I don’t know.”
Co-chair of the GUSA Office for the Student Worker Advocate Esmeralda Huerta (SFS ’17) said that RHO workers concerned about losing their jobs should take the annual “The State of the GU Student Worker” survey in order to present an accurate depiction of their concerns. A total of 89 responses have been recorded as of press time.
“These decisions are going to be made regardless of whether they are informed or not, and it’s best for RHO workers to stand together now and fight back before any decisions get made,” Huerta said. “I ask RHO workers to take our survey so we have more information and are able to push back against this decision.”
New South RHO employee Taylor Oster (SFS ’17), who has worked at an RHO since the beginning of the fall semester of her sophomore year, said that RHO employees have not been made formally aware of the proposal, and she only became aware of the proposal because of her friends in GUSA.
“The problem that I personally have is that it doesn’t necessarily allow for input on the student level and, more importantly, on the student worker level,” Oster said. “People who have actually worked at an RHO should be in there. It boggles my mind that some of these people are administrators who may have never worked as a student in college or who may have forgotten what it’s like to work as a student or who have never been under the same socio-economic pressure that a lot of my friends and I are under.”
Oster’s RHO position is part of her federal work-study package, and she relies on it to help cover the cost of her tuition. If a centralized mail system eliminated her position, Oster said she would not know what to do next.
“I started at the RHO with the understanding that I would work at the RHO until I graduated,” Oster said. “I really love working here. I can’t imagine not working here. I literally would be in shock.”

Where will the RHO employees get paid to sit on their laptops now???

Despite financial concerns and a lack of support from Mayor Muriel Bowser, the Council of the District of Columbia unanimously approved a first reading of the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results Act of 2016 in a legislative meeting February 2, which seeks to approach crime in the District as a public health issue.
The NEAR Act proposes the creation of several offices that focus on identifying at-risk or potentially dangerous individuals. Any bill introduced in the District must be read by the Council twice, or brought up in two different legislative sessions and approved both times, before it goes to mayoral consideration and is implemented.
Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5), who sponsored the act, cited these offices as methods of crime prevention at the grassroots level in a press release published Feb. 2.
“This critical legislation is a step in the right direction and will address the root causes of violent crime in an effective and sustainable way,” McDuffie said. “One homicide in the District is too many. We know that we cannot simply arrest our way out of crime, we have to take bold and innovative steps like those in the NEAR Act to help prevent crime. I thank the residents, advocates and experts for their active engagement throughout this entire process. We are all in this together.”
The bill seeks to create an Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement that would identify at-risk individuals in all eight wards of the city and involve them in a paid program teaching life planning, trauma informed therapy and mentorship skills.
The ONSE is based on a similar program in Richmond, Calif., which saw a 76 percent decrease in firearm-related homicides after implementing its version of the program. At the legislative meeting, Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) expressed his support for the bill and the proposed ONSE.
“This is focused on gun violence prevention. This connects in novel and strong ways behavioral and mental health to our Metropolitan Police Department. It focuses on neighborhood engagement and interventions,” Allen said. “So for me, in short, this bill helps ensure accountability when a crime occurs, but more importantly it focuses on proven strategies that prevent the crime from occurring in the first place. And that’s ultimately what we’re trying to get at.”
The bill would also establish an Office of Violence Prevention and Health Equity within the District of Columbia Department of Health that would collaborate with local police and hospitals to provide greater mental health support within these institutions. The Act plans to create a Community Crime Prevention Team in order to connect mental health professionals with housing specialists and police officers to identify at-risk and homeless individuals with greater services.
Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) expressed admiration for the bill and McDuffie’s efforts to install innovative preventative measures at the legislative meeting.
“I wanted to commend Councilman McDuffie on the work he’s done with this legislation. It’s been a long haul to get to a place that I think the District of Columbia should have been years ago,” Grosso said. “I’m proud to be on a council, as we move the legislation forward, that commits to a health care approach to crime prevention and moves our city in a new direction where we have greater community policing and a commitment to people every day trying to do the right thing.”
Although the first reading of the bill was unanimously approved, some councilmembers expressed a desire to incorporate more components from Bowser’s 2015 “Safer, Stronger D.C.” crime proposal, which highlights increased police presence on the streets as a primary goal.
Bowser’s spokesman Michael Czin criticized the bill for failing to address crime directly.
“Councilmember McDuffie’s package failed to include any provisions to combat crime,” Czin wrote in a statement to The Washington Post.
Bowser’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
Tom Lipinsky, director of communications for Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), also highlighted the councilmember’s focus on the need for increased security on the Metro.
“Our biggest concern was how the Council is acting to address crime on Metro,” Evans said. “There was a provision in the Mayor’s proposal to enhance penalties for any attacks on Metro with the understanding that our public transit facilities are some of the highest priority areas for residents to feel safe, especially now that we are putting schoolchildren on Metro rail and on Metro buses as a means to get them to school safely, that everything that can be done to make those areas safe should be done.”
Several councilmembers also expressed concern about the finances of the bill, which would cost $3.9 million in the 2016 fiscal year and $25.6 million over the next four years. In the bill’s committee report, D.C. Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey DeWitt stated that Washington would not have sufficient funds for the bill in this financial year, meaning that its programs would need to wait until 2017 to be sufficiently appropriated in a new budget.
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber praised the bill and its approach to city crime while also encouraging the Council to incorporate some of Bowser’s crime prevention initiatives.
“I think you need both things in order to successfully police a city or community. You need a strong law enforcement presence,” Gruber said to The Hoya. “At the same time, you need to look at your community makeup. ”

Georgetown University Women in Leadership founders Alana Snyder (COL ’16) and Ava Arroyo (SFS ’16) are stepping down as GUWIL president and vice president following the end of the current semester after forming the organization in 2013. A new executive board will replace their roles, led by Lauren Casale (COL ’17) as president and Lauren Stricker (SFS ’18) as vice president.
Founded in 2013, GUWIL serves as a network devoted to female professional development. With a group email list of 1500 students and a core membership of 200, GUWIL encourages growth and learning experiences through programs designed to bridge undergraduate and post-graduate life for female students. Such initiatives include a mentorship program for its members along with resume workshops, networking events and lectures from guest speakers.
The inception of GUWIL began in Dec. 2012 when Snyder and Arroyo, freshmen at the time, met for coffee to discuss what they viewed as a problem on Georgetown’s campus: the absence of an organization devoted to female professional development.
“My freshman year, I started going to GW Women in Business events and other organizations’ events that have a women’s leadership focus,” Arroyo said. “A lot of peer institutions have [women’s leadership organizations] and I was wondering: why doesn’t Georgetown have anything like this?”
After further discussion and planning, Snyder and Arroyo created GUWIL and utilized personal funds to facilitate the organization’s first events. Despite having initial trouble attracting corporate sponsorship, GUWIL quickly grew in popularity among the student body. During the fall of 2013, Snyder and Arroyo submitted to become part of the new club development process.
Associate Director of Student Engagement Amanda Carlton said that the founding and arrival of GUWIL as a formal club provided a significant space for the female student body to engage with and be inspired by one another.
“GUWIL came in at a pertinent time where across campus there’s been a larger conversation about women within the Georgetown community,” Carlton said. “So what they’ve really been able to do is provide an overarching space for conversation and a space for exploration to empower women in a lot of different realms.”
One program that GUWIL leaders regard as the key to bridging relationships between all classes of the student body is the mentorship program. The program pairs together older students with experience and younger students seeking ways to further their professional development. Mentors help mentees with important processes such as resume-writing, internship searches and other professional tasks.
Former GUWIL Vice President Nishaat Shaik (SFS ’16) noted that the relationships established through the mentorship programs have created a sense of inclusiveness within GUWIL.
“[The mentorship program] has been incredibly important,” Shaik said. “Since it was brought into GUWIL, it has pushed a community feel.”
As the current GUWIL executive board transitions out of its founding leadership, Casale and Stricker are looking to continue improving all aspects of GUWIL. Specific efforts include diversifying corporate sponsorship along with encouraging involvement from men on campus.
Currently, GUWIL maintains sponsorships from companies including Goldman Sachs and Loft, but the group hopes to further diversify its corporate sponsorship outside of companies in the financial service industry. As part of this effort, GUWIL has made forays into the retail industry and partnered up with local Georgetown businesses such as Mai Thai.
One of GUWIL’s most popular events has been its Bring Your Own Boy event, the most recent of which took place Feb. 2. The goal of BYOB is for women in GUWIL to bring a male friend to a discussion on women’s issues in order to expand the impact of GUWIL’s mission and events.
“One thing that we’re really working on is trying to involve men into our program,” Stricker said. “The idea is to engage men and women in this discussion about female empowerment and gender inequality so that men know they can help support women in their search for equality.”
Aside from its BYOB event, GUWIL continues to promote male involvement in the organization through other means. In the past, the organization promoted the idea of “manbassadors,” a name for male allies of female empowerment efforts, through the distribution of laptop stickers.
Though the transition in leadership means GUWIL will be without a pair of leaders who have guided the organization since its inception, the old executive board members remain optimistic about GUWIL’s future.
“It’s sad to be leaving just because I’ve been involved in GUWIL for so long, and I’ve seen it grow,” Shaik said. “But each new board member seems really, really passionate about their new position, and they all have identified amazing goals that we’ve been trying to achieve for so long.”

The Walsh School of Foreign Service’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy hosted its tenth annual International Negotiation Simulation involving over 20 SFS students and U.S. Ambassador Richard Norland in the Intercultural Center on Saturday. 
According to SFS Assistant Dean Anna Steinhelper, the simulation was set in 2017 at a crisis point in the long-running territorial dispute near the border of Armenia and Azerbaijan that is becoming increasingly unstable. Specifically focusing on the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, the simulation also involved the regional powers of Turkey and Iran, as well as Russia and the United States.
The event was coordinated by Steinhelper and ISD Director of Studies and Training Jim Seveers, with assistance from U.S. Army War College Fellow Colonel Michael Pratt. 
The simulation saw students organized into seven separate delegations, each representing a different country at a UN Security Council meeting in The Hague.
The part of the UN Special Representative was played by Norland, who was Ambassador to Uzbekistan from 2007 to 2010 and to Georgia from 2012 to 2015. His role was to preside over the final negotiations at the end of the event before a deal could be made.
Andrew Boling (SFS ’18), a member of the Nagorno-Karabakh delegation, said in an interview with The Hoya thatthe area has historical and deep rooted divisions. 
“This is a region that is pretty old with regional tensions. Armenia is Orthodox Christian, as is Russia. Azerbaijan is majority Muslim just like Turkey and Iran,” Boling said.
The region of Nagorno-Karabakh once was part of Azerbaijan, but a bloody war in the late 1980s resulted in Azerbaijan losing de facto control over Nagorno-Karabakh, with more than 20,000 killed and over 100,000 people displaced. 
Alec Pharris (SFS ’18), an Azerbaijan delegation member, said in the simulation Azerbaijan wanted to reclaim its internationally recognized land. 
“We want to retrieve de facto control of it. Almost every nation in the world recognizes that this is our land, we are trying to negotiate a peaceful settlement to this issue,” Pharris said.
The simulation, developed by the U.S. Army War College, was designed to be as realistic as possible, incorporating many elements of a real world scenario, which included sending emails to other delegations to schedule meetings. 
According to Pratt, the simulations change each year to reflect current events. 
“The War College has been very good in keeping the scenario current, so every year they add in the historical context to it,” Pratt said.
Each team must adhere to a set of secret conditions and goals set by their respective country when negotiating the deal. 
“Each team gets a very well developed negotiating position — what we call confidential instructions — which would be similar to what diplomatic delegations would get at a peace talk, which outline all of its interests and positions of that country or political entity,” Seevers said. 
Anthony Bernard-Sasges (SFS ’18), a U.S. delegation member, said his goal while negotiating was to promote peace and stability in the region and to resolve conflicts. 
“Our goals are to help the refugees, stop the war, return the peace to the region,” Bernard-Sasges said. 
Lauren Allen (SFS ’17), a member of the Russian delegation, said she had similar goals as the U.S. in the simulation but saw the U.S. as an ideological opponent. 
“We want a similar solution, as we want peace and security but, as far as who brings about that, there is some differences in strategy,” Allen said. 
The delegates scheduled meetings throughout the day, often multiple within an hour. Deals were made and details were slowly ironed out between multiple delegations. The final negotiations took place at 3 p.m. between all parties and were presided over by Norland. 
Norland said he was very satisfied with the outcome of the simulation. 
“I was really impressed that the students go into the nitty gritty of a very complicated real-world conflict situation, namely the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh,” Norland said.
Norland was also glad students were able to work to resolve a hypothetical conflict. 
“It is so great to see young people looking at how they can apply their intellect to resolving situations that could easily get out of control and led to bloodshed and instability in a really important part of the world,” Norland said.
Boling said he enjoyed the intensity and realism of the simulation. 
“I thought it was a lot of fun. I have done simulations before, none quite as intense or really thorough as this one, but I thought it went really well,” Boling said.
Allen said she found the event intriguing and liked seeing different countries attempt to resolve their differences in the negotiation. 
“I thought it was a really really positive experience. People got really into their roles and it was exciting to see people so invested in their country’s goals and their country’s ambitions,” Allen said.
