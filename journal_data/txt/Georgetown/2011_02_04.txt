With a celebration for the picture book’s launch, Georgetown highlighted the release of “Georgetown Icons” yesterday.
According to University President John J. DeGioia, the book is a museum-quality publication that honors Georgetown legacy as a unique, top-tier university.
“This book, its quotations, its imagery, its journey into the hallmarks of Hoya history, has captured Georgetown’s character,” DeGioia said at the event in Gaston Hall on Tuesday. “It will always be a reminder — and an inspiration — of that spirit.”
Leslie J. Little (CAS ‘86) gave a presentation after DeGioia’s remarks regarding the work and editing that went into making the book. “Georgetown Icons” — the first of Little’s “University Icons” series — is her second of three “Icons” books. Her first, “Paris Icons,” won the 2009 Gold Medal for Most Outstanding Book Design of 2009 from the Independent Publishers Association.
The project was initiated by College Dean Chester Gillis, who contacted Little after she sent him “Paris Icons.” Little then teamed up with Georgetown University photographer Phil Humnicky to begin the nine-month long project of research and editing.
“After looking at her ‘Paris’ book, I realized it is all about the little details instead of big buildings,” Humnicky said. “I don’t know how many times I’ve been in and out of Gaston [Hall] photographing different events, and I never noticed the little details that make Georgetown as beautiful as it is.”
Little attributes her initial inspiration for the book to her Georgetown history degree and to the unequalled spirit she discovered throughout the campus.
“I wanted to produce a museum-quality book that captured the soul of Georgetown, and that meant getting the history, artistry, quotes and architecture right,” said Little. “What the book really strives to do is capture the intangible of Georgetown; you know it when you see it.”
Associate Professor Fr. William McFadden S.J., who helped with the book’s production, was pleased with how well Little achieved her goal.
“There are some things — I’ve been here long enough to know — you just don’t notice. I think she has a wonderful taste for getting just the right angle and the artistic eye for this type of project,” McFadden said.
In order to make the book accessible to the Georgetown community, six copies were raffled off to attendees at Tuesday’s ceremony. The price of the book was kept down to $150, half the price of “Paris Icons.”
Ethan Chess (COL ’14) hopes to acquire a copy for his birthday.
“There’s so much of Georgetown to see, so many people, places and different groups, that I really think this book will bring to the fore,” Chess said.
Members of the College Academic Council also attended the event.
“It came across as so meaningful for [Little],” said CAC Vice President Jed Feiman (COL ’12). “It doesn’t feel like a book; it feels like a valuable. It made me nostalgic and so much more present at Georgetown.”
According to Little, that sentiment is exactly what she was aiming for in crafting the book, which pairs the university’s art with quotes from its greatest students and educators.
“In the purity and detail, it ties us to the larger context and immediately transports us to an emotional place,” she said. “We just feel a comfort level when we see them because we know we are home.”

Coming a long way from its golf cart origins, Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service welcomed a new ambulance yesterday after a year of searching.
Unit 9 will replace one of the two ambulances GERMS currently uses to provide student volunteer EMT services to the university and the surrounding community.
According to Colin Brody (COL ’11), president and four-year member of the organization, the timing of the new ride’s arrival is on schedule with the cycle the ambulance service has maintained over the past few years.
For the past 15 years, GERMS has consistently had two ambulances at a time, with one serving as the main ambulance for primary use and the other serving as backup. Under this system, if one ambulance needs to go out of service for repairs, there is always one available to take calls. Unit 7 has been at Georgetown since 2000; Unit 8 was purchased in 2005.
GERMS’ student leadership began planning the purchase of a new ambulance in the fall of 2009. Brody and his coworkers focused on contacting vendors and selecting a company throughout the academic year, and over the summer they finalized the design.
Although most students won’t notice a difference between the older and newer models, Brody said that several key features have been updated.
“To us, it looks very different,” Brody said. “The interior, though, has changed significantly because in the last five years there have been a lot of technological [advances].”
Among the changes: more room for rider seating and supplies to be stored, as well as power-saving LED lighting, which will improve visibility inside and out of the vehicle. The new vehicle will also be powered by gasoline, not by the diesel that fuels the other two GERMS ambulances. Unlike GERMS’ existing wheels, it also contains an interior door connecting the back — where the patient lies — to the front of the ambulance.
With its state-of-the-art features and improvements, Unit 9 is a far cry from its 1982 founding vehicle.
When the emergency medical response team was founded by Robert W. Arnold of the Emergency Medical Education Program, Robert Doherty (COL ’83) and a handful of undergraduate students in 1982, the only EMS vehicle at their service was a converted E-Z-Go electric golf cart. In the spring of 1983, GERMS obtained a secondhand ambulance, a vehicle that had formerly served as a hearse before its conversion to EMS use.
Georgetown University and GERMS contributed equally to the purchase of the ambulance. Additional funding came from donations given to GERMS by alumni and parent donors, as well as portions of past graduating seniors’ monetary gifts over the past five years designated for GERMS.
According to Brody, the organization hopes to start service with the new vehicle by Unit 9’s official dedication on Feb. 20, when it will be parked in Healy Circle for a formal ceremony featuring University President John J. DeGioia, campus dignitaries, alumni, guests and current students. Afterward, a reception is set to include ambulance tour opportunities for guests.
“It’s our day to shine and show off the new product before it goes into service,” Brody said.

The Georgetown Hotel and Conference Center was invaded by bed bugs this week, but only through photographs and speeches.
Experts from government agencies and universities gathered on the Hilltop on Feb. 1-2 to discuss research on bed bugs and steps that should be taken to tackle the mounting problem at the second National Bed Bug Summit.
Recent years have marked a major rise in incidents of bedbugs in the United States, and the amount of research has risen correspondingly, according to panelist Coby Schal, who has a doctorate in entomology, of North Carolina State University. Over several previous decades, bed bugs were generally believed to have been eliminated in Western countries, though they remained prevalent in Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe, Schal said.
“This work is not just of academic interest,” panelist Mark Feldlaufer, Ph.D., of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said. “[Questions about bed bugs] are not simply questions spurred by curiosity, but by a need to address an applied problem.”
The problem is a very real one in D.C., as universities in the area saw a number of bed bug infestations this academic year.
Georgetown had one reported case of bed bugs in a university townhouse in September. The George Washington University had six cases of the small, blood-sucking insects in five student dormitories during the fall 2010 semester.
Due to the earlier period of low bed bug incidence in the U.S. and Europe, research on bed bugs continues to lag behind research on other common pests, according to Schal. The scientific community has about 50 times the amount of knowledge on mosquitoes than it has on bedbugs, Schal said.
About 150 people attended the summit, including officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
During his presentation, Schal discussed research areas including types of disease transmission, interactions with asthma and allergies and new pesticides. He said that current studies that focus on the bed bug genome and the use of genetic diversity patterns can track the sources of infestations. Schal concluded his speech with a call for increased investment in research from the public and private sectors.
Additional panel topics presented included the roles of local, state and federal governments in bed bug control and prevention, consumer education, improvements in prevention and control techniques and the current state of bed bug knowledge and research needs. The summit concluded with breakout sessions on education, research, and control strategies and ended with the formulation of recommendations for a national strategy for bed bug control.
 
The first Bed Bug Summit was held in April 2009 in Washington, D.C. Since then, the EPA has helped coordinate the activities of the Federal Bed Bug Workgroup, and made recommendations about the role of the government in fighting bed bugs, consumer education and communication and the roles of property owners and managers.

Georgetown’s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center announced the launch of a study that examines the effect of chemotherapy on the thoughts and memory of patients on Jan. 31.
Researchers will interview and run neurological exams and DNA tests on female breast cancer patients who have been treated with chemotherapy and hormonal therapy.
Results collected during the study will be observed for behavioral and genetic indicators of cognitive decay, a decrease in one’s processing abilities sometimes known as “chemo-brain.”
Jeanne Mandelblatt, the associate director for population sciences at the Lombardi Center and leader of the clinical study, said that the signs of cognitive decline can vary.
Those with “chemo-brain” may experience loss of memory, often forgetting to complete assignments or failing to remember others’ names.  This is accompanied by an impaired ability to organize or to focus on a particular subject.  Cognitive decay makes ordinary tasks, such as balancing a checkbook or cooking a meal, more difficult for the patient.
No prior study in the field has targeted the demographic of older, female breast cancer patients.  This new research aims to increase awareness of therapy’s effects on those over age 60, a group that has a high possibility of developing cancer according to the National Breast Cancer Coalition.
“We hypothesize that the effects [of cognitive decline] in younger people are going to be less than in older people,” Mandelblatt said. “Many older women no longer have the reserve or balance to compensate for these difficulties.”
While research may not reveal the direct cause of loss of brain function, the indication of a link between cognitive decline and systemic therapy, which is based on group interaction, would increase the variety of cancer treatments considered by doctors.
Mandelblatt said the discovery of such a connection would emphasize newer and more efficient treatments for aging female patients. For those with increased susceptibility to dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, programs like intensive cognitive training courses would fend off symptoms and improve patients’ ability to function normally.
Systemic therapies will most likely remain popular amongst oncologists and cancer specialists, regardless of the study’s conclusions.
Women might choose an alternative to chemotherapy if systemic treatment is optional. This decision would depend upon many factors, such as a woman’s risk of developing cognitive problems.
Testing will be done at the Lombardi Center and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.  Several private doctors in the D.C. area will also be authorized to issue examinations.
The 325 participants must be above the age of 60 and recently diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time.  Each individual participant will receive testing three separate times over a span of two years.
Administrators are additionally recruiting women from the same age bracket who do not have cancer to volunteer for the study.  Data gathered from this control group will prove as a point of reference for researchers.

In early October, my landlord, an ever-helpful albeit eccentric middle-aged man, came to my house on Prospect Street. Contrary to his normally laid-back nature, he seemed frustrated and had a worried look on his face. He wasted no time getting to his point, asking my roommates and I if we had been having trouble with the university, and topping it off with, to quote, “who’s this Anne lady?”
Like many people living off-campus at Georgetown, my roommates and I had held our fair share of discussions with patrolling Student Neighborhood Assistance Program officers regarding noise and foot traffic outside our residence. But we live on one of the busiest streets in Georgetown, and every official I ever spoke with acknowledged that these issues were not related to our house specifically but were rather endemic to the neighborhood. We had only received our first citation the week before, ostensibly for “adding to street noise” on Homecoming night, a night when every Hoya was likely guilty of the same charge. As such, it came as some surprise that mere days after this seemingly trivial event, our landlord received a letter from the university regarding our “repetitive” behavioral problems. Sadly this pales in comparison to the ninety-day stint that one could now spend behind bars for a similar offense, but that’s a story for another day.
The letter to our landlord was the product of a policy established by the university in June 2010 aimed at targeting properties that pose a “repetitive concern” to the well being of the neighborhood. Off-Campus Life, run by Director Anne Koester, copied the policy almost verbatim from George Washington University, which adopted their slightly more lax version of the policy in 2009. According to the official Georgetown policy, a property can be classified as a residence of repetitive concern following three “verified complaints” against the property. Once this occurs, the university places the house on an official list of “problem houses.” This is a tenant’s version of being on Santa’s naughty list and it’s just as mature in its functionality; instead of coal, you’re supposed to receive a verbal spanking from your landlord.
The repercussions actually outlined in the policy are relatively light: placement on the list for a year, letters to any new tenants at the residence warning them of this status (which apparently endures despite the arrival of new tenants) and inability for a landlord to register the house on Georgetown’s OCH101, a website that links landlords and students. Of these repercussions, the first is unseen, the second wrongly affects innocent students and the third blocks landlords from a website that I and most other students have never even heard of, let alone used.
Perhaps because the policy is so ineffectual, problems have arisen from it being abused or deceivingly implemented, as occurred in the case of my roommates and I.
The letter, signed by Ms. Koester, had evidently implied to our landlord that if the property continued to be a concern to the school, the university would not allow our landlord to rent to any Georgetown students. This not only steps beyond the bounds of the policy, but is entirely beyond the scope of the legal system. Such threats may be empty, but many landlords do not realize this and are at risk of acting on such misinformation, to the detriment of their student tenants. Just last semester, I heard complaints from two different houses whose landlords had threatened them with eviction if they received more such news from the school; both landlords cited concerns that they would lose the ability to rent to future students. Based on the actions of these landlords and the conversation I had with my own, it seems fair to assume that the limits of the policy are being stretched and distorted by these letters. As of press time, Ms. Koester had not replied to emails requesting the official letter.
We were lucky that our landlord shrugged off the letter once we clarified the actual consequences of the new rule. Another friend whose parents own his townhouse was able to enjoy hearing his “landlord,” his own mother, tell Off-Campus Life where they could mail their future threats. Yet most students will not be so fortunate. Obviously students should avoid creating disturbances in the neighborhood. Yet when such events occur, the correct forum for addressing such concerns is through Georgetown’s disciplinary channels, not through threatening confused property owners. No student should ever face eviction simply because Ms. Koester has added their landlord to her ever-growing list of pen pals.

While the Georgetown community welcomed the president of largest pro-gay rights organization in the country to campus Tuesday, various Catholic groups nationwide were vocally opposed to his visit.
Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, spoke on the future of gay rights following the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” and the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, focusing on the work that’s left to achieve true equality.
“[They] were great victories and long overdue,” Solmonese said. “But here we are in this moment, having passed two significant and landmark pieces of legislation, and it still isn’t lost on me that we are still without the basic civil rights to equality and workplace.”
According to Solmonese, the HRC’s next goal is to further the legalization of gay marriage.
“If gay and lesbian Americans can fight and die for this country, there is no way that over time we should be denied our full rights as citizens,” he said. “Marriage is at the forefront of our efforts.”
HRC is also working with states and with individual companies to establish better standards for equality in the workplace, including instituting non-discrimination policies and guaranteeing equal benefits for same-sex couples.
Students at the talk said that they were pleased with the discussion.
“It was nice that he talked about marriage and the big issues but also the ones that tend to get overlooked. It was really exciting to hear about the progress we’ve made and the victories that are near,” lecture attendee Maxwell Wallace (SFS ’13) said.
The event, entitled “Beyond DADT Repeal: The Future of the LGBTQ Rights Movement” and sponsored by the Georgetown Lecture Fund, the LGBTQ Resource Center and GU Pride, was denounced by several Catholic organizations including the Cardinal Newman Society and Catholic Campus Watch.
“This event spells out the sad reality that on many Catholic campuses, especially at Georgetown, perennial Catholic morality is often rejected, and the immoral agenda of the homosexual movement is welcomed,” Catholic Campus Watch wrote on its blog.
Solmonese emphasized Georgetown’s openness despite being a Catholic university.
“It is a real honor to be here,” Solmonese said at the beginning of his speech, “Georgetown has played a pivotal role in educating extraordinary everyday people who want to contribute to their society and confront problems of inequity and leave as their legacy a better and more enlightened world.”
Lecture Fund member and event organizer Sean Keady (SFS ’13) said he was happy with the decision to bring Solmonese to campus.
“I’m not surprised by most of the criticism, because of where it’s coming from,” Keady said. “I think Solmonese had an important message for students, that it’s important not to be complacent, that there are many objectives that still need to be won and are being fought right now.”

A former employee of the credit union that serves university faculty and staff was convicted of bank fraud and theft of about $200,000 from the company on Monday, according to a Department of Justice press release.
Reginald Clark was fired from Hoya Federal Credit Union in 2003 after an internal investigation conducted by the financial institution showed that his work as an accountant produced financial irregularities, said Hazel Logan, manager and Chief Executive Officer of HFCU. The company then notified federal authorities and the National Credit Union Administration.
Clark was taken into custody directly after the hearing, according to his lawyer, Kevin McCants. He will be sentenced on April 28 and faces 51 to 63 months in prison.
McCants said that he will file a request for a new trial within the next month due to potential bias in the jury. One of the jurors for the trial was a law fellow at the Georgetown University Law Center, according to McCants. He will also file for Clark’s release from custody within the next five days.
According to Logan, the credit union’s money was recovered.
“Hoya Federal Credit Union was reimbursed by its insurance and incurred no losses as a result of this incident,” she said. “At no time were individual members’ accounts in jeopardy due to the actions of this individual.”
The credit union has taken steps to ensure that a similar incident will not occur again.
“The board developed a plan to reallocate financial and human resources to create a better segregation of fiscal responsibility among the credit union’s staff in order to prevent this kind of incident from taking place in the future,” Logan said.
The Hoya Federal Credit Union operates independently of the university.

Funding for federal grants, student loans and work- study is again at risk of being cut by congressional Republicans intent on trimming overall spending to 2008 levels. Unlike in December, however, students are not standing idly by.
Though the GOP has not outlined to what extent student aid will be affected, a percentage cut across the board will create a $3.1 billion loss in funds. If the Pell Grant program is specifically targeted, an $18.6 billion gap in the amount of money reserved for students will result.
Pell Grants are designed for low- and middle-income students who qualify based on expected family contribution, the cost of enrollment in the institution, enrollment status and length of attendance.
The predicted shortfall could become a serious problem for Georgetown students as the expiration date of December’s continuing resolution, which has kept aid level until now, approaches. The university has committed to supporting the 830 Georgetown students who received Pell Grants awards, totaling $3,478,197 for the 2009-2010 academic year, University President John J. DeGioia wrote in a letter to Jacob Lew, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. But the university cannot assure that it will permanently be able to fill the gap.
“We want to fight the good fight in order to keep the federal government involved in a way I think they should be,” said Patricia McWade, dean of the office of student financial services.
Scott Fleming, associate vice president for Federal Relations, and McWade stressed that Georgetown will remain committed to meeting the demonstrated financial aid of its students, regardless of the measures that the federal government takes. The gap in aid would put a great strain on the university, however. Georgetown gives $81 million in undergraduate scholarships each year, 20 percent of which is derived from its endowment and gifts.
“Quite frankly, the federal government is the small player here … but at the end of the day, we don’t want the bottom cut out from under us,” Fleming said.
To ensure that the GOP’s plans do not come to pass, Fleming is spearheading a campaign to encourage students to voice their support for the continuation of federal financial aid funding at current levels. Fleming is pushing student volunteers and their families to contact their local Congressional representatives, emphasizing the importance of the issue to the university.
“My dream is to find a story from every state,” he said.
Several students have already expressed interest in participating in the campaign.
Cody Ling (MSB ’11) says that he is passionate about sharing his unique perspective with representatives and possibly the House Appropriations Committee.
“If you put me in front of people, I will do my best to tell a convincing story,” Ling said.
The federal budget and the next House of Representatives’ continuing resolution for funding will be released Feb. 14. Fleming predicts that the measure will only be a short-term solution, however. Deliberations may extend into the summer, he said. Funding approval must extend through Sept. 30 in order for the Department of Education’s promise of continuing current grant levels through the fall semester to stand.
Fleming said that he is hopeful that while extensive federal funding cuts are on the horizon, financial aid will escape largely unscathed.
“I would love nothing better [than] to find out that I was totally wrong [about potential cuts to student aid],” he said.

When Aaron Fouladian (MSB ’11) attended a business school event at the Princeton Club of New York early last summer, he was met by a soon-to-be mentor — a recent Georgetown alum.
“She was someone I could reach out to with any questions I had and was always helpful in giving me advice to succeed in my internship,” Fouladian said.
The annual Alumni Mentor Program — set up by the McDonough School of Business Undergraduate Dean’s Office — pairs students with recent alumni as they complete their internships. With less than 20 percent of 2009 college graduates having secured jobs at the time of graduation, nationally, the Alumni Mentor Program is only one of a growing number of alumni-student groups on a campus that prides itself on its graduates’ employment rate.
Over the years, Georgetown’s alumni connection networks have moved past the broad Alumni Association and its various career services to a growing group of specialized and increasingly student-centered organizations and networks.
“Students understand the alumni network at Georgetown is one of [its] greatest assets,” David Nicol (SFS ’12) said.
Besides the MSB’s Alumni Mentor Program, programs like the Wall Street Alliance, Friends of the SFS, Women Advancing Gender Equity, the relatively new Hoya Diplomatic Network and many others work to bring students and alums together.
Student clubs also have their own alumni career networks. Groups like the College Democrats and The Corp maintain connections with alumni, who assist current members in obtaining internships and jobs.
The Alumni Career Network, an alumni database of over 18,000, holds events throughout the year in an effort to connect students and alumni. Events include industry-specific lunches, the Winter Break Tour held in major cities across the country, and last week’s speed-networking event, “Ready Set Connect,” among others.
 
“The hope is that through connections made at these activities, students can tap into the web of alumni connections that go well beyond that event,” Emily White, Assistant Director of Alumni Career Services, said. “Alumni are excited to share their expertise with students and likewise, hear about life at Georgetown today.”
Not all networking opportunities are created equal, however, and not all students feel that they have equal access to alums.
Networks for School of Nursing and Health Studies-related industries tend to be geared towards graduate or medical school students, according to students familiar with the job networks. And with so many business-oriented recruiting events at the Career Education Center and the variety of School of Foreign Service-oriented networks, College students sometimes feel left out of the loop.
“I don’t think there are enough ways to interact with alums,” Preston Mui (COL ’13) said. “I wouldn’t know how to reach an alum if I wanted to. I’m aware of various events where there are alums present, but not so aware of a systematic way that I can search for alumni and proactively reach them.”
The difference, however, may be due more to the types of jobs available than lack of resources.
“I don’t know if that’s necessarily the fault of the school or the nature of the industry,” Nicol said. “[Business-related recruiters are interested in] getting the best talent first whereas nonprofit, for example, is more interested in getting students who share its values.”
Nicol is one of several student coordinators in the Friends of the SFS group on campus, which brings together students and alums each semester to discuss topics related to the foreign service sector. Many undergraduates, like Nicol, meet alums during the process who become resources. He made contacts that led to his current job during a similar networking opportunity.
But student-alumni interactions don’t provide just job opportunities, Nicol said. For the stereotypically ambitious Georgetown student, meeting alumni injects a bit of reality into students’ pre-conceived notions.
“I think at the very least students hear what it’s like in the professional world, and they hear what it’s like to work in a lot of careers where [students] think they already know what’s going on,” Nicol said.
Other specialized career opportunities highlight various jobs from the female perspectives.
The WAGE Fellowship program, operating out of the Women’s Center, brings together a small number of junior and senior female student leaders to discuss issues, engage in campus and community activities and interact with administrators, faculty and alumnae.
For students like Claire Austin (SFS ’12), the group provides — among other things — an alumna who functions as a mentor.
“[My mentor has] helped me with my resume and alerted [me] to job and professional development opportunities, but also really connected with me on a deeper level, even though we haven’t known each other for long,” Austin said.
The group, which was created in 2008, fills a specialized need on campus.
“We need more [groups promoting women leadership] around campus,” said Laura Kovach, director of the Women’s Center. “There hasn’t been enough happening to support these women.”
Together, the Women’s Center and the Alumni Association — led by President Julia Farr Connolly — are working more toward a partnership in recognition of that need. Kovach said other groups on campus, such as Georgetown University Women’s Leadership Initiative, are also working toward a similar goal.
“Now that we see women have more power, especially in politics, our students need to see that and to see Hoya women [in those positions],” Kovach said.
With so many specialized groups, however, many say there is the danger of over-saturating the campus calendar. And connections, while helpful, do not always result in jobs. With the recent economic recession, students must sometimes be open to other options.
“Maybe this is the cynic in me, but at the end of the day, most of us recent grads took the job that was offered to us and not necessarily one that we thought would be our long-term careers — the economy sort of dictated that for us,” Henri Minion (SFS ’10) said.
Still though, contacts can be useful, and the alums who put their time and effort into returning to campus hope that they are doing some good. Their work in networks is not only a way for them to reconnect with previous classmates, but also a way to give back to their Georgetown community.
Denise Welch, a Georgetown graduate of 1988 currently working for the State Department, joined the relatively new Hoya Diplomatic Network as a way to reconnect with the university while supporting the State Department’s efforts in recruiting prospective talents. She also hoped to meet other Georgetown alums working for the department.
Welch, like other alums, aims to help students now and in the long run.
“My hope is that, at the very minimum, students will benefit from having a reliable source of information regarding foreign service work and life and the opportunity to engage with mentors who share a common experience,” Welch said.
Some of the students who have benefited from alumni efforts may find themselves in similar positions in the future, as they give back to their classmates and followers.
Fouladian, who is still in touch with his summer mentor, says he wants to pass on the help he received.
“I would like to be a mentor in the MSB mentorship program and be involved in the Georgetown Wall Street Alliance so I can continue to network with other Georgetown alumni as I progress in my career,” Fouladian said.

The class scheduling policy for the main campus recently underwent a major revision to comply with more strictly enforced state and federal requirements for credit approval, a shift that not only impacts course schedules beginning next fall but exacerbates university space concerns.
With the new policy, which was proposed by the Main Campus Executive Faculty on Jan. 28 and subsequently approved by Provost James O’Donnell, all main campus classes will begin on the hour and half-hour. Additionally, the policy more clearly outlines that each credit hour requires 50 minutes of course time per week. Three credit seminars that currently meet for 100 minutes per week — which was allowed under the previous policy — will now be required to meet for 150 minutes per week beginning next fall.
“Our academic programs are rigorous and our courses have always required significant class and out-of-class work that leads to desired learning outcomes,” John Pierce, university registrar and assistant provost, said in an email announcement on Monday. “All of these efforts are part of our ongoing work to constantly enhance our academic programs.”.
Professor Terrence Reynolds, chair of MCEF and of the theology department, said the approval of the new policy and schedule resulted from numerous meetings with the registrar, office of the provost, deans, faculty, representatives of the office of federal relations, university legal representatives and faculty.
“It was a careful and substantive consultative process,” Reynolds said.
The university policy was changed as a result of more stringent enforcement of federal and state laws regarding credit hours and scheduling. According to Robert Cumby, former chair and member of MCEF and professor in the economics department, the issue was introduced because the School of Continuing Studies campus in Va. was confronted with stricter enforcement practices by the state authorities.
In an effort to maintain consistency across campuses and to better comply with federal laws, the main campus also adjusted its existing policy. Penalties for non-compliance include loss of eligibility for federal student loans.
The new policy includes more specific language about whether or not credits can be awarded for outside work. Exceptions to the credit policy may only be granted by the corresponding dean with the recommendation of the department or the program and must exhibit significantly additional work expectations that are stated in the syllabus, according to Reynolds. There was no mention of scheduling exceptions in the old policy.
“The new policy creates a real threshold for being an exception where previously there was no systematic close scrutiny,” Cumby said.
More problematic for students and the university, however, is the classroom space required to accommodate the expanded course time for seminars. As a result of the potential overlap, the course schedule was altered to allow for an additional 50 minute and an additional 75 minute block each day, according to Pierce.
However, even with schedule adjustments, the university is still short on space.
“They need to find a number of additional classrooms that are available five days a week to fit existing classes into the new structure,” said Jeffrey Anderson, director of the BMW Center for German and European Studies. “Deans are asking programs to see if they have space that could be used as classrooms, such as libraries or conference rooms that aren’t officially classrooms.”
One concern regarding the implementation of the new policy revolves around how it will impact adjunct professors.
According to Anderson, the changes in the course schedule will make it more difficult for adjunct professors to accept appointments.
“This will require an increase in the pay rate for the adjuncts. We are going to have to raise our rates to keep those same good people coming back,” Anderson said.
Graduate programs also face unique challenges in implementing the new structure.
“If we extend the length of the typical course, we have to use more of the week to fit all of those courses. We have been concerned that Friday will have to be used for graduate seminars and it will be more difficult for students to take on internships,” Anderson said. “We have been working with the administration [to ensure] that the scheduling accommodates those concerns and needs.”
Anderson stated that CGES will implement the policy as written.
“Our students and faculty will adjust the classes to use the additional 40 minutes well,” he said.
Some faculty members see many upsides to the lengthened seminar course time.
“Personally, I am very happy about it because I often run out of time,” said Diana Owen, associate professor of political science and director of American Studies. “With a 100 minute class, I teach straight through with no break. 150 minutes will allow for a break and a more relaxed atmosphere. This is probably a better situation.”
With the lengthened seminar courses, students will also be able to extract more value from each class.
“This is positive for the students because it will create more contact time with professors and students,” Cumby said.

A student was assaulted and robbed near campus while walking alone on Tuesday night.
Two men, approximately 17 years old, confronted the victim at 33rd and O Streets at about 11 p.m. A third suspect then struck the student in the back of the head with an unknown object. The student was rendered unconscious, and the suspects took his wallet and left in an unknown direction, according to a Department of Public Safety Alert sent to the university community on Thursday night.
The victim sustained a head injury, was treated by Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service and released.
Associate Director of DPS Joseph Smith said that students should be on alert when walking around the area at night.
“We can’t blame victims. We have a right to be able to walk down the street,” he said. “I would recommend that, when possible, students should walk in pairs or groups. Usually, when somebody’s been victimized, they’ve been walking by themselves.”
This is the third violent incident to occur on the streets of West Georgetown since October, following an attempted abduction at 34th and Prospect Streets on Nov. 27 and a strong arm robbery on 36th Street on Oct. 31.
The Metropolitan Police Department’s investigation is ongoing.
