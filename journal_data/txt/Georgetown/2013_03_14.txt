The Wisconsin Avenue Streetscape Project was hotly debated at the March monthly meeting of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E last Monday.
The District of Columbia Department of Transportation began construction on the project April 2012 in an effort to make the portion of Wisconsin Avenue that runs through the Glover Park neighborhood more attractive and safe for pedestrians. The stretch now features improved lighting, wider sidewalks and fewer lanes of traffic.
However, some residents complained that the changes have increased traffic volume.
“I think the improvements on Wisconsin are absolutely terrible — they defy common sense,” EricLangenbacher, a member of the Burleith Citizens Association and professor in Georgetown’s government department, said. “We should revert back to the way things were before.”
Others have also grown frustrated with traffic increases.
“As soon as the project was completed, we just started getting a whole host of emails [with complaints about the traffic],” D.C. Councilman Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) said.
Evans said that he has experienced the gridlock firsthand. He drives along the reconfigured portion of Wisconsin Avenue multiple times a day as he takes his children to and from school. “Going north has become very, very difficult,” Evans said. “Going south is much easier.”
Area businesses are also concerned about the new levels of congestion. Joe Sternlieb, CEO of the Georgetown Business Improvement District, said that some retailers have received complaints from customers about the increased traffic. Because many visitors to Georgetown who come from northwest D.C. travel via Wisconsin, he said that the lane reconfiguration might discourage consumers from coming to the area.
“What we are fearful of is some people saying, ‘Let’s just not go to Georgetown,’” Sternlieb said.
Some people said that the increased traffic has discouraged them from shopping in Glover Park.
John Gill, a broker at local real estate firm H.A. Gill & Son, said that the traffic has made him less likely to shop the Whole Foods in Glover Park, and ANC 2E Commissioner Bill Starrels added that while he and his family used to shop at the Glover Park Whole Foods, they now go to the Foggy Bottom location.
Other residents noted that traffic on Wisconsin has encouraged drivers to cut through residential areas to circumvent the traffic.
Some residents, however, say that a rise in congestion is a small price to pay for greater pedestransafety. Ken Archer said he moved to Georgetown 12 years ago because he knew it was a walkablecommunity. Before the recent changes to Wisconsin, however, Archer feared for his children’s safety every time they walked to the park.
“It was terrifying walking to Glover Park before these changes were made,” he said. “It’s just terrifying when you have small children.”
Despite the number of doubts expressed about increased gridlock, many praised the project for improving the appearance of the area.
“We all love the new streetscape,” Starrels said. “The sidewalks are great. The lighting is great.”
Opponents to the current project offered alternatives that they believed would improve traffic flow without detracting from pedestrian safety.
Evans suggested switching one of the southbound lanes to northbound. Resident J.P. Montalvanproposed extending the rush hour parking restrictions to open up more lanes for traffic that would otherwise be reserved for parallel parking.
According to D.C. Councilwoman Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), DDOT plans on expanding its analysis of traffic patterns in the area as it looks for ways to reduce congestion. Cheh has organized a public roundtable with DDOT to discuss the project that will take place May 1.

Members of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E officially voiced their support for the addition of two new Capital Bikeshare stations in Georgetown at their monthly meeting last Monday.
One of the stations will be installed outside CVS Pharmacy at 1403 Wisconsin Ave., and the second will be situated by the waterfront at the intersection of 34th and Water Streets.
ANC 2E Chairman Ron Lewis also inquired about adding a station within the gates of the university.
According to Chris Holben, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation project manager for Capital Bikeshare, placing a station on campus would be complicated because the university is private property and would require liability waivers, among other measures. A Capital Bikeshare station currently stands outside the front gates.
Despite potential difficulties, Lewis asked Holben to begin discussion with the university and said that the ANC would help facilitate the process.
ANC 2E Commissioner Jeff Jones also asked Holben about installing a bike rack outside the Walsh Building, noting that students must tie their bikes to young trees along the sidewalk.
Holben said that the university would have to supply such a rack.
Cyclists in the District could also benefit from a bill proposed on Feb. 19 by D.C. Councilmembers MaryCheh (D-Ward 3) and Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) that would provide new protection for bikers.
The bill, drafted by Cheh with the help of the Washington Area Bicyclist Association, would penalize drivers for failing to yield to or colliding with bikers with points on their driving records and a fine.
The legislation offers additional provisions to reduce biking injuries: New drivers would be required to answer questions about biker safety on the driver’s license exam and construction companies whose work blocks bike lanes would be mandated to provide safe detours.
“Getting bicyclists and drivers to respect each other is never easy, and I’m glad D.C. is working
on it,” Lewis said.
Jake Sorrells (COL ’16), who bikes three to four times a week to get to his internship, stressed the need for improvement to the District’s biking infrastructure.
“I think this is one of the most dangerous cities to be riding in, maybe save NY,” Sorrells said.
“It’s just a really hostile road environment. It’s tense. People are uptight, and they want to get
where they want to go.”

The anonymous winner of the West Heating Plant auction was revealed in an exclusive interview with the Washington Business Journal on Tuesday.
The property was purchased for $19.5 million by a team that includes local developer the Levy Group, New York-based real estate firm The Georgetown Company and Four Seasons Residences.
The group plans to spend more than $100 million to convert the heating plant into condominiums.
Winning the auction “was shocking because it was a pretty intense competition, and we weren’t sure we were going to come out on top,” Richard Levy, a managing principal for the Levy Group, said in an interview with WBJ. The auction closed March 6 after escalating into a bidding war between five anonymous buyers.
As they develop the area, the team will be under the watchful eyes of neighborhood and historic preservations groups.
