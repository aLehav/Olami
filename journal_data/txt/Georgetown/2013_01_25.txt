Denis McDonough (MSFS ’96) was selected today as President Obama’s new chief of staff, according to a university press release.
McDonough joined the Obama team when the president was still a senator in 2007, and following Obama’s election, McDonough was head of strategic communication and chief of staff for the National Security Council before becoming deputy national security adviser in 2010.
In today’s announcement, Obama called McDonough one of his “closest and most trusted advisors.”
“Given his humility, I don’t think people always appreciate the breadth of his experience and the range of his talents,” Obama said. “And it’s precisely because of that intellect, that experience, his dedication, his determination, that I wanted Denis in this job.”
School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster also expressed enthusiasm for McDonough’s appointment.
“I am certain that Hoyas around the world join me in congratulating Denis McDonough. He has been and will continue to be an outstanding public servant,” Lancaster said in the university’s press release. “Pursuing such work is a Georgetown and SFS tradition of which we are extremely proud.”
Professor Ronald Klain (COL ’83), chief of staff for Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, was also rumored to be a leading candidate for the position, according to ABC News and the Washington Post.
McDonough replaces Jack Lew (L ’83), who is nominated for treasury secretary. A date has not yet been set for Lew’s Senate confirmation hearing.

GU Fossil Free, a student lobby group allied with several other campus organizations, submitted a proposal Wednesday outlining a plan for the university to abandon its suspected investments in fossil fuel companies.
“We propose that Georgetown University immediately freeze all new investments in all fossil fuel companies and divest completely from such companies within five years,” stated the proposal, which was addressed to University President John J. DeGioia. “We urge the administration and trustees of Georgetown to sever ties with these corporations to show that Georgetown does not support the devastation of our planet.”
GU Fossil Free was established last November and comprises about 15 core members. The organization has support from more than 20 campus student groups, including the Georgetown University College Republicans, the Georgetown University College Democrats, Georgetown Solidarity Committee, Interfaith Council and The Corp Green Initiative.
After DeGioia’s office received the proposal, university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr expressed the administration’s serious consideration of the group’s requests.
“The president’s office received the letter from GU Fossil Fuel today. We will give careful consideration to the issues raised. We take these concerns seriously,” Kerr wrote in an email. “In fact, that is precisely why last year we enhanced the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility … with the ability to make recommendations about our investment practices. We are asking the [Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility] to give the proposal careful consideration at its upcoming meetings.”
CISR evaluates written proposals, such as that of GU Fossil Fuel, of socially responsible investment issues and makes further recommendations to the finance committee of the board of directors. In evaluating proposals, the committee considers the significance of the allegations in the proposal, any social injuries or human rights violations the proposal outlines, inconsistencies with Georgetown’s Jesuit values and the portion of university investments implicated by the claims in the proposal.
GU Fossil Free drew inspiration from the 350 Campaign, a global campaign that encourages and assists universities in starting divestment initiatives. The 350 Campaign provided support to GU Fossil Free in the form of proposal and letter templates, press contacts, a 350 representative and partnerships with divestment projects at other universities.
“I think of GU Fossil Free as an extension of the 350 movement because if we were just to act on our own to divest from the fossil fuel industry, we probably wouldn’t make much of a difference,” GU Fossil Free member Michelle Stearn (SFS ’15) said. “When you compound all of the efforts of all of the universities across the U.S., I think it could have potential to actually disrupt the fossil fuel industries.”
Although Georgetown’s Board of Trustees does not publicly disclose where it invests the university’s endowment, Stearn said that GU Fossil Free suspects some of the money is invested in coal and fossil fuel companies. Her group urged board members to choose more sustainable options.
“We’re proposing that there are alternative companies to fossil fuel companies that Georgetown could invest in that would be just as lucrative and in fact less risky,” Stearn said.
Member Sydney Browning (COL ’15) said that Georgetown’s divestment initiative could potentially act as a catalyst for similar projects at other universities.
“Georgetown has a specific opportunity because we are a Catholic school and a Jesuit school, so we are devoted to this type of issue,” Browning said. “This is an opportunity for Georgetown to be a leader [among] all of these different schools and to take this opportunity and to divest. We’re hoping that the administration and Board of Trustees sees that as well.”
Member Mark Waterman (SFS ’13) acknowledged the challenge in urging Georgetown’s Board of Trustees to divest from such profitable companies.
“There are certain concerns about certain investments that the university has made that we won’t be able to take the money out of right away,” Waterman said. “I think our campaign is … conscious of that fact that we’re looking at a long-term fight if we ever want to see all of this money taken out of fossil fuel companies.”
Nonetheless, Browning expressed her belief that widespread and continuous pressure would lead to eventual divestment.
“I think that [divestment] is a goal that we can attain if we make it clear to the university that we’re not just a few students and we have larger student group support,” Browning said. “We plan to gain more support each year, so it’s not a campaign that the university can wait out. It’s something that we are going to keep building and make stronger over the years.”
As GU Fossil Free awaits a response from CISR, it will develop strategies to further advance its cause. Waterman said that such tactics could potentially include referendums, petitions and protests.
“Ideally, [CISR] will respond and say ‘Yes we’re going to divest right away, thank you very much,’ but considering that won’t happen, we’ll have to look into taking more targeted action and taking things to the next level,” Waterman said. “We will put more direct pressure on the university.”
GU Fossil Free  called upon the Board of Trustees in their letter to choose sustainable endowment investments to support the environment and inspire others to make ecologically sound decisions.
“Everyone knows that global warming exists, but it’s the rate at which it’s happening that is frightening and is very scary,” Browning said. “Georgetown has this opportunity to speak out against climate change and the fossil fuel companies, which not only are violating human rights but also are violating human health and are continuing to lead to the destruction of the environment. … Speaking up against this is a very powerful message to these companies, to the world and to students.”

Many Georgetown students past and present have political aspirations. But Rashawn Davis (COL ’14) stands out from the pack, for he has already begun his campaign. Davis has his sights set on May 2014, when the people of Newark’s West Ward will vote for their city councilman.
Davis spent the first 12 years of his life in Georgia King Village, a Newark housing project, where he witnessed drug deals and violence on a daily basis. He saw fights, muggings and often heard gunfire at night.
“All of these things were saturated into the neighborhood, and you almost just become numb to it,” Davis said.
Davis’ mother, who dropped out of college and took on multiple jobs to support him, was determined to keep her son out of trouble. She kept Davis busy, signing him up for sports teams and Boy Scouts and sending him to academic camps in the summer.
In addition to shielding him from drugs and violence, Davis’ mother instilled a sense of strength and resiliency in her son.
“A huge part of who I am today is because of her,” Davis said.
By the time Davis turned 12, he and his mother moved out of the projects and into a residential neighborhood, where drugs and violence were less pervasive. In addition to the safer environment, Davis came to appreciate the sense of community.
“I got to see how [members of] a real community values each other, how they work for each other.”
Davis’ mother and aunt encouraged him to serve the community by volunteering at hospitals and psychiatric wards, pursuits that spurred, at least in part, Davis’ political aspirations.
“I just started thinking to myself that there had to be another way to have this kind of effect, but in a more structural way,” Davis said. “That’s when I really started to look toward politics.”
With Davis officially beginning his campaign for Newark West Ward council earlier this month, he hopes to follow in Mayor Cory Booker’s footsteps. “I’ve always known I wanted to run for city council and I’ve always known I wanted to do it young.”
Davishopes to bring change to his Newark ward and engage the community to improve the quality of life for all residents of the city, particularly its youth.
“If we’re ever going to fix the problems that face our city we have to start at a micro level,” explained Davis. “A lot of people see this whole big-picture aspect — that if we bring in all these ideas, all this big money, that will solve all of our issues. But I think all the issues that Newarkers face are very micro issues that we can solve on a grassroots level.”
Davis’ campaign platform focuses on three areas of improvement — civility, economic development, and public safety — which he would address mainly through increased government programming. For example, to address public safety, Davis advocates expanding after-school programs for youth instead of beefing up the police force or imposing harsher prison sentences.
As part of his grassroots approach to politics, Davis hopes to establish more neighborhood associations in his ward, believing they would foster local pride and offer a forum for residents to voice their concerns and suggestions. While proposals such as these are likely to be met with little resistance by current councilmen, Davis’ plans to reform the council itself, on the other hand, are likely to spark controversy among councilmen.
 
Davisfinds the many benefits afforded to city councilmen, such as vouchers for dinner, rental cars and gasoline, to be irresponsible given the city’s $10 million deficit, and argues that they should be cut. Although he recognizes that some councilmen might resist such concessions, Davis believes that if he is elected and rejects the benefits then constituents will notice and pressure the other councilmen to follow suit.
“Our plan is to lead by example,” Davis said.
It is because of ambitious plans such as this that Davis has begun calling himself a maverick.
The label seems particularly fitting given Davis’ large ambitions despite his young age. No one on Newark’s council is under the age of 40; the incumbent to his seat, Ronald Rice, is 67 and previously served as deputy mayor of Newark. Davis, however, does not consider his youth a hindrance, believing that it allows him to better represent the young people of Newark.
Although the election is more than a year away, Davis has already assembled a campaign staff, comprised both of peers at Georgetown and other members based permanently in Newark, in addition to launching fundraising efforts.
While continuing to study at Georgetown, Davis plans to visit residents in Newark with his campaign team on one or two weekends every month until the election.
Although other campaigns will have more money to spend, Davis is not worried.
“The great thing about Newark is that money doesn’t win elections. Voters want to see passion, they want to see that you are invested in Newark,” Davis said. “A lot of these guys are going to be doing commercials and photo-ops, they aren’t really going to be in the streets talking to people, and I think that’s where we win and other people lose.”

The District of Columbia Taxicab Commission delayed Jan. 24 the adoption of rules that would require all taxicabs to accept non-cash payments by March 30.
According to Public Information Officer Neville Waters (G ’91), the commission did not have quorum at today’s meeting and was therefore unable to pass the credit card proposal.
Instead, DCTC will hold a special commission meeting Jan. 30 to vote on the regulation.
Last year, the city had granted a contract to VeriFone Systems to install credit card smart meters in all District cabs, but the Contract Appeals Board halted the process in November 2012 after determining that the contracting officer did not follow proper procedure.
The commission then announced last week that it would no longer mandate all taxicabs to obtain a universal meter for their cabs. Instead, the current proposal would allow drivers to choose from several different companies, including myTaxi, Taxi Magic and Hitch.
Should the credit card requirement go into effect, however, the commission has said that it does not plan to pay for the installation of meters in all area taxis, noting that several companies now offer these meters free of charge and make a profit through transaction fees with individual cab drivers.
“It made sense at this point to drop that plan issuing a [Request for Proposal] to identify a single vendor and allow the market place to compete,” Waters said.
Waters said that he believes the environment has changed since the universal smart meter idea was first introduced by the commission a year ago.
“During that interim while the contract protest was being waged, many drivers went out and got credit card readers or swipe[d] cards because it was something the market place was demanding,” he said.
If the regulation for all taxicabs to be required to accept credit cards passes next week, it could impact Georgetown students who frequently use cabs for getting around on nights as well as for travel to and from area airports.
“Being able to use a credit card in taxis would definitely be a lot more convenient [than the current system],” Allison Heymann (SFS ’16) said. “I know my friends and I don’t always have cash on hand, and really, it would just simplify the whole process.”
Local area taxi drivers concur.
“It doesn’t make any difference to me,” local cab driver Sunni Kingsley said. “All the major cities require cabs to take credit cards, and since D.C. is a major city, it just makes sense.”

Eric Mooring (COL ’13) has been awarded a Churchill Scholarship and will study infectious disease at Cambridge University next year.
The Churchill Scholarship, named after British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, has given U.S. citizens between the ages of 19 and 26 the opportunity to pursue graduate research programs in engineering, mathematics and biological and physical sciences since its inception in 1963.
Mooring is one of only 14 Americans this year to be chosen by the Winston Churchill Foundation of the United States.
“I am excited and humbled to receive a Churchill Scholarship,” he wrote in an email. “While Iknew I was a serious candidate for the scholarship, I also knew there were far more highly qualified candidates than there were available scholarships; I don’t think anyone ever expects to be one of just fourteen winners in a national competition, so in that sense I was surprised to win.”
Mooring, who is an environmental biology and government double major with a minor in mathematics, hopes to help control infectious disease in animals and humans, according to a university press release. He intends to pursue a master of philosophy degree in veterinary science while at Cambridge.
“I’m looking forward to attending CambridgeUniversity and having the opportunity to take what I have learned at Georgetown about ecology and about infectious diseases and apply that knowledge to solving new problems,” Mooring wrote.
Mooring is Georgetown’s third Churchill Scholar. Past recipients were Iga Wegorzewska (COL ’04) and Cara Marie Malandro (COL ’06).
Wegorzewska, since receiving her degree from Cambridge, has gone on to work for the Uniformed services University of Health Sciences. She has published and co-authored numerous articles in neuroscience, cell biology and biochemistry.
Malandrio currently is a third-year graduate student in the Chemistry-Biology Interface Program at The Johns Hopkins University. After majoring at Georgetown in biology and mathematics, she studied multidrug resistance at Cambridge’s Department of Pharmacology.

A new bike lane on M Street designed to run westbound from 15th to 29th Streets NW will not open for several more months, according to the District of Columbia Department of Transportation.
The M Street corridor was originally intended to open in conjunction with another lane on L Street, which officially opened last month.
“It took long enough from the announcement of these two bike lanes to get the L Street lane installed, so it is frustrating to see more delay on M Street,” said Tom Birch, an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner for District 2E, which represents the Georgetown area.
According to Birch, DDOT wants more time to study the operating bike lanes on 15th Street, Pennsylvania Avenue and L Street before determining the final configuration of the M Street lane.
“I live on 29th Street, just two blocks off M [Street], and my commute by bike to work has always taken me downtown to 15th Street, so no one could be more anxious than I to have the L and M Street lanes completed, linking 15th and 29th,” Birch said.
Although the portion of M Street located in Georgetown is one of the most crash-prone areas for bikers in the city, the proposed M Street bike lane ends soon after entering the neighborhood.
“As for continuing the M Street lane all the way to Key Bridge, I haven’t heard any plans for that. On that stretch, we bike riders are on our own,” Birch said.
According to data compiled by DDOT, 21 crashes and 14 injuries were reported at the intersections of M Street from 29th Street to Bank Alley between 2008 and 2010.
While the M Street lane ends before reaching the heart of Georgetown, cyclists will have some consolation after plans to place two new Capital Bikeshare stations at 34th and Water Streets NW and Wisconsin Avenue and O Street NW were announced in December.
Student bikers, however, are disappointed by the absence of a bike lane in Georgetown, especially those on the crew team who must ride down M Street nearly every day to get to their boathouse on the Potomac River.
“[A bike lane down to the Key Bride] would be very much appreciated because right now we just dodge traffic and it’s very dangerous,” John Harrison (COL ’16), a rower on the men’s lightweight crew team, said. “We need a bike lane because it’s too congested, and I personally have almost been hit a few times.”

Jennifer Wistrand, a Woodrow Wilson Institute research scholar, spoke about economic migrants and displaced people in Azerbaijan during a presentation sponsored by the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies Tuesday.
“Within a generation of the Soviet Union collapsing, when the Soviet system attempted to give everyone a house and a job, you now have places like Azerbaijan,” Wistrand said. “You’ve got a very large, either voluntarily or involuntarily, dislocated population and a number of people whose economic or educational opportunities are greatly reduced from what they would have been a generation ago.”
Wistrand lived in Azerbaijan for 22 months while researching for her anthropology dissertation for the Washington University in St. Louis. She focused on how citizens of the former USSR make annual journeys to Russia for work, with some trips lasting as long as six to eight months.
“As many as 2 million citizens — 25 percent of the population … [and] as many 25 percent of the men under the age of 25 — live and work in Russia,” Wistrand said.
Most of these laborers are unskilled, male and do not have postsecondary education, Wistrand added. The men often travel to Russia and work in agricultural positions for many months while their families remain in Azerbaijan.
Wistrand’s research also focused on Azerbaijanis who were displaced due to the nation’s war with Karabakh from 1988 to 1994. Living in dormitories with other internally displaced persons, the migrants struggled to find work in Baku, the capital, and outside their former rural homes. Even after the government built schools for the displaced persons’ children, the students and their families remained in the “insulated and isolated communities” of the dormitories.
“You would assume that the numbers would have gone down as that [group] of students went through school,” Wistrand said. “Instead … the numbers have increased because people are still staying in the community.”
As subsequent generations have children, the living arrangements only become more cramped. This effect, along with strained economic times in Baku for IDPs, has created an institutionalized group of people in need.
“For a lot of the kids born into this IDP status, they can look around and see, in contrast to a lot of the rural kids, the parents or grandparents who had university degrees, were teachers, were economists in their area but since moving to Baku, were unable to find work and were unemployed with these degrees,” Wistrand said. “What many of the IDP kids do is join the rural and service markets, finding money through unskilled jobs.”

The story of Alexis Garau (COL ’15) is like that of many undergraduates at Georgetown: Without the aid she receives from the university’s endowment and the federal government, she would not have been able to afford a Georgetown education.
But Garau, an international student from Italy who was born in New York City and has dual citizenship, lucked out in her birthplace; with only a foreign passport, she would not have access to a single cent of the financial aid that she receives as an American citizen.
While American students have a wide range of options to fund their educations, international students must search for aid within tight legal restrictions.
One important source, federal grants and funding — which account for just under 10 percent of Georgetown’s financial aid  — are not available to international students at all.
“The federal government does not provide any funding for non-U.S. residents,” said Scott Fleming, Georgetown’s vice president for federal relations. “You can imagine that it would be very hard to get a measure passed in Congress for funding for international students when there are still arguments over funding for United States residents. That measure just wouldn’t pass.”
Fleming added that, in addition to traditional forms of federal funding, such as Pell grants and the Federal Work-Study program, the government also finances scholarships for international studies, all of which are also allocated specifically to U.S. students.
Stipulations on student visas can also prohibit international students from holding off-campus jobs except in certain cases of economic difficulties.
According to Katherine Bellows, executive director of the Office of International Programs, this is because hiring international students involves higher costs than employing American citizens.
“International students can get on-campus jobs, but they are not eligible for the Federal Work-Study program, so it costs each department much more to hire an international than a domestic student,” Bellows said.
Minjung Kang (SFS ’15), an international student from Korea, said the lack of on-campus jobs for international students is problematic.
“I know a few international students who have on-campus jobs with no problem but I definitely think that work-study students are given an advantage in some jobs and that causes a problem,” Kang said.
While international undergraduate students studying at Georgetown can receive some scholarship money from the university, such resources are “very limited,” according to the Office of Student Financial Services’ website.
The website lists a sole scholarship for foreign applicants, the Georgetown Pedro Arrupe, S.J., Scholarship for Peace, which is targeted at “international students from war-torn areas of the world with demonstrated financial need.”
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh noted that foreign applicants often seek funds from scholarship programs unaffiliated with the university.
“Some international students are able to get financial support for their educational expenses from resources other than the university, such as grants from their home country,” Pugh wrote in an email.
Pugh added that the university provides the Bou Family Foundation Grant, which gives two $2500 awards to second year graduate students hailing from abroad who are interested in community service.
However, other university offers for foreign students are few and far between.
Private foundations that support international undergraduates are usually allotted to specific geographic locations or nationalities. AMIDEAST supports students from the Middle East and North Africa while LASPAU, Academic and Professional Programs for the Americas, supports students from the Caribbean and Latin America.
“You have to be from a certain country or a certain nationality to be eligible for those scholarships,” Kang said. “The point is to have diversity, so having scholarships that are so specific doesn’t help.”
Although he regretted this phenomenon of regional selectivity, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said that such scholarships make sense.
“Of course we would prefer a general fund, but some donations are made with the stipulation that they are used to support students from specific countries,” Deacon said. “You also have to realize the issue from their point of view — they want to ensure that students from their country are recruited.”
Despite the university’s limited ability to offer financial aid to international students, Deacon stressed that Georgetown’s need-blind admissions policy still applies to all students, regardless of nationality.
“Some institutions might ask why they should admit students on a need-blind policy if they cannot afford to support them fully,” Deacon said. “We admit international students regardless of financial need and try to help them figure out their finances after they are admitted.”
Nonetheless, Bellows said that the lack of funding for international students compromises the diversity of the intellectual and socioeconomic makeup of the student body.
“There are many brilliant international students who apply and are accepted to Georgetown from poor families in developing countries but unfortunately cannot afford to come to Georgetown,” Bellows said.
“It would be enlightening not only for those students but for domestic students to sit side-by-side in classes with people from completely different cultural and economically different backgrounds and it could go a long way toward greater global understanding,” she said. “The economic stressors faced by all higher education institutions have not allowed for [Georgetown] to use more money toward private scholarships for internationals.”
Foreign students agree that more aid would diversify exposure to different people.
“It would be great if even international students had this opportunity [to attend Georgetown]. Most international students that come here have money because of their families,” Garau said. “I don’t think it’s common for people like me to come here but it would open the scope for students.”
Deacon also pointed out that, unlike some universities, Georgetown does not have quotas for international students who can afford an expensive overseas education.
“Those students [who pay full tuition] can be very appealing, and there are some institutions that have space allotted for international recruitment. That is not our policy,” Deacon said. “We want to diversify that international recruitment.”
Deacon indicated that recruiting a diverse range of international students with the help of increased financial aid was a long-term goal of the university.
“Going forward with the fundraising, adding to the general fund will be a priority.”

Forty students organized by Georgetown University Right to Life will be among the pro-life advocates across the country to descend on Washington, D.C., again this year for the annual March for Life, but other pro-life groups plan to employ more radical methods of protest.
For Right to Life President Eileen Marino (NHS ’15), the March for Life has historically been an important way to spread awareness about the issue of abortion.
“It was basically a group of people who were just concerned that the ruling wasn’t representative of what the American people wanted or even if it was, it wasn’t fair. … We’re trying to call attention to the issue and raise solidarity,” Marino said.
Tuesday marked the 40th year since the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, the event that sparked the first March for Life in 1974, increasing the meaning of the march for many participants this year.
Marino described what she sees as the paradox of a country based on the belief that everyone has the right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness allowing abortion.
“There’s nothing I love more about being American than the fact that I’m party of a history of the protection of human dignity, so when I see good people who stand for good things, and a country as free and committed to life as America, letting something like abortion — which is so obviously a violation of innocent human life — [continue], I’m ashamed that we’re forgetting the basis of our country,” Marino said. “I don’t want to be ashamed of something I’m so proud of.”
While Right to Life dedicates its efforts to peaceful advocacy, other pro-life student groups in Washington, D.C., have participated in more extreme activities this week.
On Thursday, a prayer vigil held at the local Planned Parenthood was organized by Priests for Life. On their website, the event was described as “sponsoring a large youth presence at Planned Parenthood abortion mill.”
During the vigil, National Director of Priests for Life Fr. Frank Pavone spoke about the frustration that is felt by the pro-life community, referring to the young people as the “abortion holocaust survivors.”
“If we’re not angry with this, then something is wrong with us,” Pavone said.
Youth Outreach Director for Priests for Life Bryan Kemper shared a similar message.
“These are the people who are tired of their generation getting killed. … This is the evil of our age,”Kemper said. “This is the generation that survived Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade will not survive us.”
Right to Life Board member Louis Cona (COL ’15) commented on some of the more radical means of promoting pro-life policies.
“Personally, I think prayer is very powerful, but I also think you can’t fight fire with fire, he said.” “Overall, the pro-life issue is very peaceful. We have to change the minds and hearts of people. …You can’t do that by yelling and screaming, but by discussion.”
For Cona, the March for Life is a way to bring together all the pro-life advocates to campaign for the reversal of the legalization of abortion.
“People are standing first and foremost for the lives lost, for what we believe is a tragedy. The march shows that a large portion of Americans do believe strongly in the pro-life movement.”

While university administrators have championed diversity initiatives over the last decade, many black and Latino students continue to report incidents of racial bias both on and off campus.
Aya Waller-Bey (COL ’14) authored a viewpoint in The Hoya (“Racial Bias Runs Rampant,” A3, Jan. 18, 2013) in which she shared incidents of bias that student residents of the Black House have confronted.
Waller-Bey decided to write her viewpoint after the Black House held a haunted house in October. Neighbors repeatedly called the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program and the Metropolitan Police Department, even though Waller-Bey says the students were not making much noise and there was no alcohol present. She states that the SNAP officer acknowledged that the Black House students were in the right and had not broken any rules or laws, while the MPD lieutenant forced the students to move the line for their event down the street.
But Waller-Bey said that the haunted house incident was just the latest manifestation of chronic institutional bias at Georgetown.
“The haunted house incident was the icing on the cake for me,” Waller-Bey said. “I was not feeling institutionally supported in any way by Georgetown. …It was like I was talking to a wall with nothing changing or improving.”
MPD said it plans to investigate the October incident.
“We will need to investigate this matter that reportedly occurred in October 2012. We are not aware of any complaints from students,” MPD Communications Director Gwendolyn Crump wrote in an email. “The community calls about parties in [Georgetown] in general. A noise complaint does not equal racial bias.”
Waller-Bey faced a similar situation to the haunted house incident last April, when she had friends over in her apartment in Henle Village, many of whom attended Howard University. There was no alcohol present according to Waller-Bey, and she says the party was shut down at 11:30 p.m. even after complying with the Department of Public Safety officer’s request to lower the volume of the music. DPS did not respond to requests for comment.
“I hadn’t done anything wrong,” Waller-Bey said.
Students of the Black House maintain that they were treated more harshly than the situation warranted.
“Others will say, ‘Well, why did the neighbors call? Because you’re Georgetown students and they just don’t like Georgetown students.’ But it happens too many times to the same people for us to think that it’s just because we’re Georgetown students,” Black House resident David Price (COL ’14) said.
Price said that he never expected he would face situations like this when he decided to attend Georgetown.
“I didn’t think that coming into my junior year, living in the Black House, I’d have these problems,” Price said. “There was someone from the Office of Student Affairs who told us, ‘They called on you because you’re black.’ I never imagined having to experience a conversation like that.”
University Provost Robert Groves has emphasized diversity as a priority of his agenda since his arrival on campus last fall.
“I have been meeting with students to learn from them about their experiences at Georgetown and their aspirations for a more inclusive community,” Groves wrote in an email. “We have discussed several issues, such as strengthening institutional support for student identity groups, creating new and innovative ways to make it easier for students to find courses that explore aspects of diversity and bringing together students and faculty interested in identity studies to foster greater collaboration among them.”
In their academic lives, many black students have been disappointed by the lack of diversity in both Georgetown’s faculty and curriculum as well as bias they have faced in the classroom.
Waller-Bey said that a main concern of many students is the low number of black professors at Georgetown.
“It’s a problem for students not seeing any positive images of black people. It reinforces the stereotype that there aren’t any smart African American [professors],” she said.
Waller-Bey’s viewpoint describes an incident in which a college dean told a student to “be the token they want you to be.” Other black and Latino students, like Yasmin Serrato (SFS ’13), claim to have faced similar prejudices in the classroom.
“One of my professors made a comment about my midterm grades. He noted that the Latino students in the class generally didn’t do as well as everyone else in the class, and he asked if it was a language-barrier problem,” Serrato said. “He was going to offer me more time on the final. I didn’t know whether to be offended or [thank him] for being considerate.”
The university implemented a bias reporting system run through the Office of Student Affairs in 2004, after University President John J. DeGioia convened a Hate and Bias Reporting Working Group in response to student demonstrations. Through the system, students can report incidents of bias they have faced, though the website clarifies that “just because the expression of an idea or point of view may be offensive or inflammatory to some, it is not necessarily a bias-related incident.”
“We encourage anyone who has experienced a bias-related issue to use the bias reporting system, where every case is followed up individually,” university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr wrote in an email.
The Black House collectively submitted the haunted house incident through the bias reporting system, after which they met with Director of the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access Dennis Williams and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson.
Despite her grievances, Waller-Bey said she was pleasantly surprised and relieved by the positive response to her viewpoint from students, alumni and faculty.
“Alums contacted me saying they’re happy there’s a specific account of these incidents to show these things are serious,” she said.
Ryan Wilson (COL ’12, LAW ’15) was among these supportive alumni.
“For so many people it was common knowledge and almost didn’t need to be read, while for other people it was a bolt of lightning,” Wilson said.
For real change to occur, Waller-Bey said, Georgetown will have to overcome what she sees as indifference to diversity issues.
“People … don’t really care. It’s often viewed as a black people problem, a minority problem. We’re often viewed to be hyper-sensitive,” she said.
Price emphasized that creating a more diverse community will take the work of all students, not just those in the minority.
“Georgetown needs to truly promote having a diverse community that is together, that is able to have these conversations, where people aren’t afraid to be uncomfortable. Because it’s going to take other people being uncomfortable, especially the majority being uncomfortable, for there to be diversity.”

As the clock on Healy Tower struck midnight Thursday night, the Georgetown Chimes performed their weekly recital in Dahlgren Quad, the newest of Georgetown’s oldest a cappella group’s long list of traditions.
Frank Jones (LAW ’48) founded the all-male Chimes when he came to Georgetown in 1946. Sixty-seven years and 240 Chimes members later, the foundation that Jones established continues to grow. Jones passed away Dec. 22 at the age of 92, and though there have been changes from the original four-member barbershop quartet, traditions Jones started and songs he added to the Chimes’ repertoire continue to be sung by the 14 active Chimes.
 
A Founder’s Legacy
“When you read about his story, he didn’t just arbitrarily create an a cappella group,” Tim Lyons (COL ’15), the newest Chimes member, said. “He really wanted to start this group and he worked for years and years at it. Even well after graduating, he worked to make sure that the group was going to be sustainable.”
“Baby Chime” Lyons had to learn Jones’ story before he could gain his new title as Chime #240.
Jones, Chime #1, was quarterback of the Yale football team from 1939 to 1941, but before he could graduate, he was drafted into the army to fight in World War II. Jones served from 1941 to 1945 and completed his undergraduate degree in the military while earning the rank of captain fighting against the Japanese in New Guinea.
Jones left the military in March of 1946 and wanted to go to law school. Though he wanted to go to Yale Law, he would not have been able to play football there because of the university’s rules.
“He picked Georgetown because Georgetown would allow you to play for one year,” Kevin O’Brien (COL ’65), Chime #57 and Jones’ best friend, said.
When he enrolled, Georgetown Law School’s rules changed, so he was no longer permitted to play football. Nevertheless, Jones relied on his musical background, which consisted of singing with his father and uncles as a boy, and started an a cappella group.
“While he was in the army, he told me he formulated the plan to create the Chimes,” O’Brien said. “The Chimes — I think that’s his great legacy. I think every time The Chimes sing for people and they clap, there is clapping for [Jones] in it. That’s what he created; he nurtured it.”
Two years ago, Jones returned to Georgetown and performed with The Chimes in Gaston Hall at the Cherry Tree Massacre, the largest a cappella festival on the East Coast. Michael Luckey (COL ’13), Chimes Ephus, or elected leader, and Chime #226, had the opportunity to sing with Jones when he visited.
“The guy was 90 years old and had just the greatest voice,” Luckey said. “We went back to the house and sang all these other songs, and he was just pulling songs left and right — songs I had never heard, songs I didn’t know he would have ever known. The man was like an encyclopedia of songs.”
Jones’ encyclopedia of songs included the fight song of nearly every college in the United States. At a Chimes reunion at a restaurant in Palm Desert, Calif., a group of people asked Chimes alumni to sing the Georgetown fight song, O’Brien recalled.
“Then someone at the table said, ‘You guys wouldn’t happen to know the University of Illinois fight song?’” O’Brien said. “And [Jones] said, ‘Sure, I know it.’ And he sang all four verses. And the fellow from Illinois started crying; he actually started crying.”
The man from Illinois happened to own one of the great wine collections in California and gave Jones and the Chimes two bottles he had in his car.
“As we were drinking it, [Jones] said, ‘See? There is an advantage to being a Georgetown Chime,’” O’Brien said.
Though Jones got the wine, he did not drink.
“He didn’t drink, but he was insane,” Chimes President George Peacock (COL ’84), Chime #118, said. “[Jones was] spontaneous, surprising, uninhibited and always cheery and kind. It was an interesting mix. You don’t always find that in people.”
Every Chime described Jones as unconventional and fun loving.
“I would describe him as unique chaos,” O’Brien said. “It was just one fun thing after another. He was just incredibly brilliant, yet he was eccentric.”
Tyler Holl (COL ’13), Chime #234, sang with Jones at the 2011 Cherry Tree Massacre as a neophyte, or Chime-in-training.
“He was just so fun-loving. He was always looking for a way to make people smile and laugh and make everyone feel included,” Holl said. “He brought so many different types of people together because of this group, and I think that really showed in his character. He loved cracking jokes and telling stories.”
Luckey said that he admired Jones and considered him a role model.
“I’ve only met this guy twice, but he has had such a profound impact on my life that when I met him. It was like meeting a childhood hero,” Luckey said. “The man was incredible. When I first met him, he was 90 years old and I was 19, but he was an immediate friend.”
Jones was a law professor at the University of Southern California for 35 years, and his dichotomy between his eccentricity and academic life made him dynamic and complex person, according to O’Brien.
“He was an incredible contrast. You could sit and sing a song with him, then he would do something crazy like he would get up and put ketchup on his throat,” O’Brien said. “He would lean out into the restaurant with the ketchup on his throat and he’d yell, ‘For God’s sakes, don’t order the swordfish.’ Then he’d come back to the table and could talk about some legal doctrine that was very difficult to understand.”
Peacock first met Jones at a 1986 Chimes reunion in Fire Island, N.Y. Peacock said that he made the mistake of bringing his girlfriend at the time to the reunion.
“The moment we walked into the lunch room, out of nowhere came [Jones] and his wife, Erika,” he said. “She was playing the accordion, the chicken dance. And he quickly grabbed my girlfriend and took her out in the middle of the floor, where she knew no one, and made her do the chicken dance for about a minute. And I thought, ‘Oh well, that’s Jones.’”
But while yodelling and dressing in a leprechaun’s outfit, Jones was able to see his dream flourish throughout his lifetime.
“Someone once asked at reunion a few years back, ‘Did you ever think it would come to this? That you’d have 240 people at the reunion, across all generations?’” Lyons said. “And [Jones] said, ‘Absolutely. That was my dream.’”
 
History and Traditions
Although the Georgetown Chimes are named after the university and its famous clock tower, the group is not officially affiliated with the university.
“We’re technically not a Georgetown group, where we don’t get money from the university, [and] we’re technically not affiliated with the university,” Luckey said. “But I think it is very, very accurate to say we are the Georgetown Chimes.”
The Georgetown Chimes separated from the university in the 1950s.
“[Jones] wanted the group to be very closely tied to Georgetown University, yet he didn’t just want to form a singing group, he wanted to form a collegiate a cappella group,” Steve Alleva (COL ’05), Chime #195, said.
Alleva wrote his senior thesis on the Georgetown Chimes. He credits the Chimes’ initial affiliation with Georgetown for the longevity of the university’s oldest a cappella group.
“The Chimes actually started as a featured quartet of the Georgetown Glee Club,” Alleva said. “After the quartet gained success and notoriety, [Jones] decided to expand the group from four to nine. The university is kind of an anchored rock to tie your boat to.”
The Chimes expanded, the group separated from the Glee Club and eventually completely from the university.
The Chimes maintains its history and traditions with its extensive acceptance procedures, called the neophyte process. To become a neophyte, members must first audition.
“The neophyte process is kind of a combination of a bunch of things,” Jack Sheridan (COL ’14), Chime #236, said. “It’s a preparation for your Chime-dom to see if you can fit into the group, can handle yourself musically and really understand the concept of the tradition we’re trying to uphold. Tradition and history play a big part of our group, and all Chimes — past, present and future — have and will buy into the conception of the group that we have been upholding.”
In addition to learning about the history and traditions of the group, a neophyte must learn more than 120 songs in order to become a Chime. That process can take eight months to several years. Sheridan’s neophyte process took two years.
“[The neophyte process] is basically to test if you are going to fit in with the group, if you can handle yourself musically and if you can kind of keep up the tradition since the Chimes started with Frank Jones,” neophyte Connor Joseph (SFS ’16) said. Joseph was accepted as a neophyte Jan. 13.
Some neophytes never complete the training process and do not end up becoming Chimes.
“It’s a really personal process, and it depends on the character and drive of the individual to push themselves,” Chime #239 Peter Fanone (COL ’15) said. “Some people just haven’t organized their time effectively, and they find themselves junior, senior year still a neophyte, and they decide that it’s best for themselves just not to continue.”
As part of the process, neophytes are required to call and meet alumni. In his years as a neophyte, Lyons called approximately 50 alumni, including Jones, to ask about the traditions and history of the Chimes. Lyons called Jones to ask about the story behind the term “Ephus,” the elected leader of the Chimes.
In February 2010, the Georgetown Voice reported that in Latin, Ephus means “leader among equals.” According to current and former Chimes, however, this is not actually the case. Nevertheless, even within the Chimes, there seems to be confusion regarding the term’s origin. Some of this confusion originates from Jones.
When Lyons called Jones, he told the then-neophyte that the term was from the game of craps.
“There is something when you play craps where you call out ‘ephus iphus ophus,’ and he just liked the sound of ephus, and he decided to coin that as the name of the leader,” Lyons said. “Of course, he’s told some other people some other stories for where he came up with it.”
Current Ephus Luckey and Alleva, who researched the origin of the term as part of his senior thesis, both said that the term was based in baseball.
Rip Sewell, a Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher in the 1940s, threw a special pitch called the Ephus pitch. In the 1946 All-Star game, Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox became the first player to ever hit the Ephus pitch for a home run.
“Whereas other groups were calling their leaders ‘pitch,’ [Jones], this quirky, funny, off-the-wall guy, said ‘Hey, your leader might be called the pitch, but I’m calling myself theEphus,’” Alleva said. “Because he is the Ephus pitch — the bizarre version of the pitch, the wacky version of the group’s leader.”
Alleva said that the sentiment of the Ephus as a “leader among equals” is accurate.
“The Chimes all consider themselves equals as part of the Chimes brotherhood,” Alleva said. “Even though the Ephus is the musical director of the group, he, at the same time, is still an equal.”
Some of the more visible Chimes traditions include the annual Cherry Tree Massacre, an a cappella festival organized by the Chimes, and the monthly Chimes nights at The Tombs. The 40th Cherry Tree Massacre will begin Feb. 1.
“I really love Chimes nights at the Tombs,” Holl said. “I think it’s my favorite [tradition] because it is a way for all of campus to see what the Chimes is all about. They can really see how much we love each other, how much we care about each other, how much fun we’re having with each other.”
The Chimes has many traditions and a strong history and the group is constantly adding new traditions.
O’Brien said that he couldn’t think of any traditions that have been lost.
“I think the things that have been developed over the years have pretty much worked,” O’Brien said. “They are carefully thought out, and most of the things we create pretty much stay the same. I really don’t think there are any; I think that’s one of the secrets to the group.”
 
Fellowship and Harmony
Anyone who walked into 3611 Prospect St. at the beginning of a Chimes practice on a Tuesday or Thursday night would likely hear the song “We Meet.”
“We meet again tonight, boys, with mirth and song, and melody flows wherever we go. We dwell in friendship ever so true and strong,” the Chimes sing at the start of every practice.
The song reflects the sentiment of The Chimes’ motto, “Fellowship and Harmony.”
“You make your best friends in this group because it is so attuned to harmony in its essence,” Luckeysaid. “The more you sing, the more you build trust, the more you build harmony, and that builds true friendship. As Chimes, we are always there for our brother Chimes.”
The Chimes is clearly much more than just a singing organization, but it is the music that brings the group together.
“We’ll spend hours and hours and hours singing with each other,” Holl said. “It’s really a brotherhood formed through music. Music is the common bond that we all share, and it’s really an interesting relationship that you don’t find with people very often.”
This brotherhood is not only for active Chimes. Through the neophyte process and annual reunions, all generations of Chimes have the opportunity to meet each other. It is commonplace for young active members of the group to socialize with alumni who graduated decades before they even arrived on campus.
“The alumni presence is one thing that is really cool about this group, and I think is pretty distinct and pretty unique as a Georgetown group,” Lyons said. “For example, when we had auditions for new neophytes last week, we had two alumni stop in — one from the class of 2009 and one from the class of 1984 — both D.C. locals, and no one thought twice about [it]. They just stopped in, we sang a few songs, we caught up and then they left.”
The 1984 alum who stopped by was Peacock. In his capacity as president of the Chimes, Peacock organizes the reunions and non-musical aspects of the group. He also serves as a contact for active Chimes and alumni.
“[Lyons], who is ‘Baby Chime’ right now, probably knows 50 songs that he could sing with anyone going back to 1950, so I think that tie is very important,” Peacock said. “I think it keeps all of us younger and in touch with the school, and it keeps the current undergraduates rooted in the tradition, too.”
Peacock described the close network of Chimes as “Georgetown on steroids.” Even though it may no longer be an official Georgetown organization, the Chimes and its alumni are very involved with the Georgetown community and give a lot back to the university.
“We think of ourselves as a close-knit group, but we also very much think of ourselves as part of Georgetown and part of a Georgetown tradition as well,” Peacock said.
The alumni will reunite again Feb. 23 for the last night of Cherry Tree Massacre, and they will sing with active members, as per tradition.
 
Continuing Jones’ Legacy
“When Chimes was founded in the ’40s, it was the only a cappella group on campus. A cappella at universities is obviously much larger than it was in Frank Jones’ time at Georgetown,” Alleva said. “I think that bodes well, not just for The Chimes, but for a cappella as an institution. I think that the future is bright for The Chimes.”
 
The 40th Cherry Tree Massacre will be Holl’s last as an active Chime prior to his graduation. Holl said that he wanted see The Chimes return to the more visible role in the Georgetown community that it once had.
“We are looking for ways to make Chimes more well-known on campus again,” Holl said. “I think all the a cappella groups are very well known on campus, but I feel like the Chimes are kind of pushed to the wayside a little bit because of the type of music that we sing. I think we’re looking for ways to make barbershop cool again.”
At Cherry Tree Massacre next week, the Chimes will sing some modern music along with their traditional repertoire, including “I Will Wait” by Mumford and Sons.
“The formula they’ve used has worked and has been really successful. It’s a proud tradition,” Joseph said. “It’s about keeping the same formula and trying to adapt it as time goes on and people change. It’s about keeping an ideal going of musicality, friendship and tradition.”
As a recently accepted neophyte and freshman, if Joseph becomes a Chime, he will be with the group for the next few years as an active member.
“I’m not 100 percent sure what the future holds, but I hope that when I’m an active I can contribute to make it stronger and help make the organization grow,” Joseph said.
Jones intentionally built the Georgetown Chimes as a group that could sustain itself, O’Brien said.
“The way Jones created it … he knew that it was going to last forever,” O’Brien said.
