Washington, D.C. residents have raised concerns about the authenticity of free KN95 masks distributed by District officials.
The issue was first reported by The Eagle, American University’s student newspaper, which claimed American University unknowingly distributed counterfeit KN95 masks to students after The Eagle found masks that were inconsistent with the standards set for the masks by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The KN95 masks D.C. officials have distributed at the city’s COVID Centers, which serve as hubs for District residents to get tested, vaccinated and boosted, cause similar concerns, according to the Washington City Paper.
Counterfeit masks can be less protective against the highly transmissible omicron variant, and do not meet standards set by the CDC. Authentic KN95 masks should present specific markings that indicate manufacturer name and date, according to the CDC.
A clear way to determine whether a mask is poorly made is checking for packaging with misspellings, as the masks handed out to American University students show. After an investigation, American University later confirmed that the masks they had acquired and handed out to students during their first week of in-person instruction did not meet these standards. 
Many organizations unknowingly purchase counterfeit masks, according to Project N95, a nonprofit working to make respiratory protection nationally accessible.  
“The reality is that many procurement professionals simply do not have the information they need to make good purchasing decisions,” the project N95 spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “They are usually doing their best to protect students and teachers, but knowledge about the high level of fakes, counterfeits and substandard masks is not widely known.”
D.C. government officials acquired two procurements of masks for its COVID Centers from V-Tech Solutions. However, KN95 masks distributed by the District at COVID Centers do not contain text providing manufacturing information on the face of the mask, similar to the masks handed out at American University. 
According to Evan Yeats, an advisory neighborhood commissioner in Ward 4, many people in his ward have shared their concerns about the authenticity of masks being handed out in D.C.
“I believe masks work, and I believe good masks work even better,” Yeats said in an interview with The Hoya.
Masks distributed by the District exhibit the issues that health professionals have identified in counterfeit masks, according to Yeats.
“When you look at them, both me and my constituents have noticed that they seem to be of a lower quality than authentic KN95s from reliable sources,” Yeats said. “They seem to be thinner, they seem to be flimsier, they don’t have the markings that they tell you to look for.” 
Around 60% of KN95s imported to the United States could be considered counterfeit, according to Project N95.
“You cannot look at a mask and tell it is authentic,” the spokesperson wrote. “The active part of a mask is the electrostatically charged meltblown layer, and that is on the inside. What you have to do is know who made it and be assured that it is not expired.”
Masks that do have markings on them can often be traced to manufacturers that produce insufficiently protective masks, according to Yeats.
“When they do have markings, like one that a constituent provided to me from the Police Academy, came from a factory that has failed performance testing for its masks,” Yeats said.
The questionable quality of these masks has increased concern over the safety of vulnerable populations throughout D.C., according to Yeats.
“It is great that the government wants to step up and fill that role, that is exactly the role for the government,” Yeats said. “But you allow the inequity to persist if people who rely upon free masks from the government get lower performing masks than people who buy their own on their private sector and verify themselves like me, and that makes things harder for low-wage and essential workers who are critical to keeping our city going every day.”

New voices are entering national conversations as women and people of color realize their power, MSNBC President Rashida Jones said at a Feb. 16 event at Georgetown University. 
The event, titled “Know Your Power,” featured Jones and Ashley Etienne, a GU Politics Fellow and former communications director to Vice President Kamala Harris, and discussed Jones’ career journey, the difficulties women and people of color face in politics and the media, and the future of MSNBC.
Hard work and a focus on delivering tangible results even in the face of discrimination were essential to her rise to success, Jones said at the event. 
“My tactic was always head down, pencils up, do the job, because they can’t deny that. They can challenge what you say about yourself, they can challenge how you position yourself, but the results don’t lie,” Jones said. “My focus was always do the work, because they can’t debate the performance, they can’t debate what your output is, and that’ll kind of shut them up.”
Jones is the first Black woman to lead a major cable news network. She began her role as MSNBC president in February 2021 following the departure of Phil Griffin, who served as the president since 2008. Before becoming MSNBC president, she led breaking news coverage, including the 2020 election cycle, and won an Emmy for her coverage of the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision to legalize same-sex marraige.
Using power in a supportive way is critical to building an inclusive professional environment, according to Jones.
“It’s not only what your power is, but how you use it,” Jones said. “It’s also how do you transfer it to other people, how do you position yourself to be able to uplift and help other people.” 
The overwhelming majority of employees in the field of journalism, including reporters, editors, photographers, broadcasters and videographers, are white and male, with 77% of newsroom staffers being non-Hispanic white individuals. 
As the journalism industry continually undervalues the work of women and people of color, improving representation is vital, according to Jones. 
“How do I use this platform for all of the other young women journalists who didn’t know it was possible, the students who were thinking about where do I go and hadn’t seen somebody who looked like them,” Jones said. “I didn’t see anyone who had done this job, but it didn’t mean that I thought I couldn’t do it.”
As a young reporter, Jones constantly felt underestimated and underappreciated for the work she was doing, she told Etienne. 
“I felt like I wasn’t getting credit for what I was doing, I was getting credit for who they thought I was,” Jones said. “Because of that, I always felt like I’ve got to try harder to make sure they see what I’m doing.” 
However, despite these challenges, it was important to volunteer for every possible opportunity that arises, Jones said. 
“I was always inclined to raise my hand for whatever the next new big project is,” Jones said. “It was that idea of raise your hand even if it doesn’t make sense, even if it doesn’t feel like it leads to a specific place or thing. Just always being hungry for opportunities, always being hungry for learning, and I think especially in places that take you just outside of your comfort zone or your area of expertise, because you never know where it could lead.”
Moving forward in her role at MSNBC, Jones hopes to continue to expand the network’s outreach, especially to a younger audience through more digital and streaming content.
“My vision for the network is to be the brand for everyone,” Jones said. “One of the things I’m really focused on is how we broaden how we define and how the audience defines MSNBC, because we’re a very successful channel, and I want to look for opportunities to bring those successes elsewhere.”
In 2021, the median age of MSNBC viewers was 68, an increase from 65 in 2017 and a trend shared by other cable news networks. In her first months as president, Jones immediately began to address the lack of younger viewers through increasing the use of streaming services and giving younger, rising commentators spots on prime-time. 
As the network continues to expand new digital frontiers, Jones committed to bringing more voices into the conversation.
“It’s very important to me to use the platform and opportunity to help other people along the way at all different levels,” Jones said. “For me, there’s nothing more important than pay it forward.”

The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS) has launched Onward for Afghan Women, which will provide hundreds of Afghans in exile with a network of resources and opportunities. The program was launched earlier this month. 
Spearheaded by GWIPS Executive Director Melanne Verveer, the initiative draws upon years of partnerships with Afghan leaders, journalists, NGO heads, parliamentarians and activists, many of whom are under active threat from the Taliban, ranking high on their kill list. The initiative is centered around supporting Afghan women leaders in their advocacy efforts on the behalf of women and girls in Afghanistan. 
Verveer said the initiative supports women in Afghanistan after the fall of the government to the Taliban last August.  
“They have either arrived halfway towards their final destinations, or they are in their final destinations, until pray to God, they get to go back to their country one day,” Verveer said in an interview with The Hoya. “But right now that seems far off. And so Onward for Afghan Women is a way in which we can continue to support them, so that they can be contributing in all the ways that they would like to the future of Afghanistan.”
Project Onward is committed to promoting the education of its hundreds of female members, according to Verveer  
“We have enabled many of them to get to other colleges and universities complementary with their skill sets so that they can have gainful employment that is commensurate with their skills, their experience and their education,” Verveer said. 
Roya Rahmani, a former diplomat and Afghanistan’s first female ambassador to the United States, is one of the initiative partners living in Washington, D.C. She works at the Walsh School of Foreign Service where she is an expert on issues of foreign policy, security and women’s rights. 
Rahmani joined GIWPS as a distinguished fellow in July 2021, shortly after completing her mandate as ambassador and just weeks before the Taliban took Kabul in August 2021.  She is pursuing her own research on the application and history of Islam and Sharia law, Rahmani said.  
Project Onward increased awareness about the complex challenges facing people in Afghanistan today, through a series of public events led by Afghan experts, according to Rahmahi.  
“These are very deep and important lessons for students in Georgetown and around the country, for those who will be leaders and policymakers in the future,’’ Rahmahi said. ‘‘There is always room for students to come forward. And if they want to discuss their interest, to take on roles and support, be part of research, be part of developing different initiatives, they have the opportunity to learn hands on some of the challenges that we discuss.’’
The panels are meant to help students better understand the perspectives of Afghan women who have worked in advocacy for years, according to Rahmahi. 
The panels reached thousands of people in over 100 countries, covering policy, the future of female education under Talibal rule, the rapidly growing humanitarian crisis in the country and what peace talks and negotiations should look like, Rahmahi said. 
Onward for Afghan Women supports Afghan women leaders who have already done advocacy work in support of women and girls in Afghanistan through engaging with GWIPS to conduct research, host global convenings and support the future generation of leaders. 
Allie Smith, director at Onward for Afghan Women, said that although Afghanistan now finds itself in a dark place, a hopeful future is possible. 
“To evacuate them from their home country, and to have them into the United States is heartbreaking,” Smith said in an interview with The Hoya. “To be able to facilitate opportunities for these women to continue to be the leaders that they are and to continue to contribute to peace and security and equality for Afghanistan, for the women and girls that were made in Afghanistan, is a privilege.”
Rahmani said she hopes the resettlement of experts abroad will sustain their work for the reconstruction of Afghanistan. 
“And then also to think of how to help them resettle, how to help them continue their work, how to make sure that the connection to the ground is not lost,” Rahmani said, “And how to continue the advocacy so that as soon as a new issue comes up and absorbs the entire attention of the international community, the Afghan women would not be forgotten.”

Vital Vittles began in 1972 as a small food co-op selling only yogurt and Coke in the lobby of New South Hall, against the backdrop of anti-Vietnam War protests.
Fifty years later, it’s the centerpiece of The Corp, which is staffed entirely by Georgetown University students. The Corp turns 50 years old this week, and celebrations have abounded, featuring promotions like free coffee from Compass Coffee, free Yerba Mates and an open mic fundraiser night for Georgetown Mutual Aid at the Midnight Mug, a Corp coffee location.
Matt Davis (SFS ’22), CEO of The Corp, said the celebration marks an important milestone in the organization’s history. 
“This is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a student-run business and to my knowledge, there’s never been a student business of our caliber or size that’s celebrated something as big as a 50th anniversary,” Davis said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Celebrations will continue Feb. 18-19 to include a ceremony in Riggs Library on Feb. 18, an exhibition of the organization’s history, and a gala at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art. About 400 former members of the organization have RSVP’d to the gala and are returning to campus to celebrate, according to Adam Shaham (SFS ’22), advancement chair for The Corp.
Originally established in 1971 as the Students of Georgetown, Inc, The Corp was created to advocate for students amid anti-Vietnam War protests. Now it is the world’s largest student-run 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation.
According to The Corp’s co-founder Roger Cochetti (SFS ’72), inspiration for the organization originally came after the university prohibited students from hosting guests in their dorms and prevented protestors from camping overnight on sport fields around the time of one of the largest anti-war protests in 1971.
Cochetti said he felt compelled to create an organization that would give the student body greater freedom. 
“Whatever this entity was going to be, it had to be structured so that it made money,” Cochetti said in an interview with The Hoya. “If it had no assets, if it had no financial basis and no income, then it could never do any good. So it had to be a merger of idealism and pragmatism.”
In 1972, The Corp began with a $10,000 investment Cochetti and other members of the undergraduate student government raised by a donation from the Tennis Association and by publishing an ad-based student directory, according to Cochetti. Its first employees sold Coca-Cola and yogurt on Healy Lawn to continue funding their efforts, according to The Corp’s website.
This week’s celebrations also included free yogurt and Coke in Red Square, according to Shaham.
“Coke is one of our oldest partnerships. We started selling Coke and yogurt out of the New South closet back in 1973, so this is a vendor that’s been with us and partnered with us for almost the last 50 years,” Shaham said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The anniversary presents an opportunity for student employees and leadership to ensure The Corp can continue serving students for years to come, according to Davis.
“We can use this moment and the momentum that comes with something like a 50th anniversary to ensure that we recommit to our mission of students serving students and — more specifically — our philanthropic and community engagement efforts to ensure that we are actually serving the students both on campus and serving student interests off campus,” Davis said. 
Bennie Smith (COL ’86) began working at one of The Corp’s locations during the second semester of his first year at Georgetown in 1983. Smith was hired at Saxa Sundries, the former sister store to Vital Vittles, as a cashier and stocker. From there, Smith then became a shift manager and was eventually promoted to The Corp’s vice president of operations. 
The Corp provided both a stable income as well as a community during his undergraduate career at Georgetown, according to Smith. 
“It was this really fun combination of a fun, built-in social network,” Smith said in an interview with The Hoya. “But it was also hard work. But because you were working with your friends and your peers, it didn’t always feel like hard work.”
Davis said the 50th anniversary is something the entire campus community should enjoy. 
“It’s not just a celebration that we should share within our company internally. I mean, it’s really a celebration for the entire Georgetown community to be a part of and enjoy,” Davis said. 
The success of The Corp is a testament to the decades of hard work from all past members, according to Cochetti.
“I can’t help but be proud of having gotten it started, but the real credit goes to the hundreds and perhaps thousands of people who worked on it over the 50 years that it existed and breathed life into the idea,” Corchetti said. “They’re the ones who made The Corp.”

Following backlash from the Washington, D.C., Public Library’s (DCPL) Board of Trustees’ vote to name an auditorium in the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library (MLK Library) after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Bezos has requested the auditorium be named after Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison. 
The move comes after thousands penned letters demanding the board of trustees reverse their Jan. 26 decision. DCPL Executive Director Richard Reyes-Gavilan had recommended naming the main auditorium of the library, which underwent a three-and-a-half-year, $211 million renovation ending in 2020, after Bezos following his December 2021 $2.7 million donation to the library system. Bezos’ donation is the largest contribution in DCPL history and will support Beyond the Book, the library system’s flagship literacy program, according to a DCPL spokesperson.
Following the board’s vote, MLK Library Friends and Mt. Pleasant Library Friends, nonprofits that provide support for their respective libraries, sent letters to Reyes-Gavilan and the board demanding the reversal of the vote. Additionally, an independent petition campaign has delivered over 19,000 letters of disapproval to library trustees. 
Bezos does not have a connection to the D.C. community, according to a Feb. 3 open letter written by the MLK Library Friends.
“Bezos played no role in building or preserving the DC public library system,” the letter reads. 
“Bezos, we must note in connection with taxpaying residents, is also controversial for paying a lower rate of tax on his income than average Washingtonians pay on theirs.” 
Bezos paid $1.4 billion in personal federal taxes between 2006 to 2018 on the $6.5 billion he reported in income, a tax rate of 1.1%. Meanwhile, the average District resident pays 11.63% of their income in combined taxes annually.
Bezos’ actions do not live up to King’s values and activism, according to the letter, which was written following the approval of the naming proposal. 
“Most importantly, as many have already noted, Bezos’ operating principles to date have often been at odds with the values for which Dr. King gave his life,” the letter reads. 
The Board’s vote was a cause of concern for Mt. Pleasant Library Friends because of the negative effect his past actions have had on libraries, according to Carlos Izurieta, president of the board at Mt. Pleasant Library Friends.
“Jeff Bezos has no deep ties to the D.C. area and his treatment of his workers has led such organizations as Amnesty International to ring alarm bells,” Izurieta wrote to The Hoya. “In addition, some of Bezos’s work has been directly harmful to public libraries.”
Amazon has historically refused to sell e-books to libraries, severely restricting access to low-income readers. The American Library Association has denounced bans like Amazon’s as major obstacles to libraries. 
Following the backlash, Bezos requested the auditorium be named for Morrison instead of himself. Bezos noted a personal connection with the late author, according to an email Bezos sent to DCPL Foundation Executive Director Rob Hartman obtained by The Hoya. 
“I never sought naming rights associated with my gift to the library. When you subsequently informed me it was the largest gift in the library’s history and offered to name the auditorium the Bezos Auditorium, I was honored and grateful,” Bezos wrote. “Since then, some in the community have suggested a person of color would be more appropriate as a name for the auditorium, especially as it sits inside the Martin Luther King Jr. library. That makes considerable sense to me.” 
The DCPL welcomed Bezos’ suggestion to rename the auditorium after Morrison, according to Reyes-Gavilan.
“We are thrilled that Jeff Bezos has recommended that the MLK auditorium be named for Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison,” Reyes-Gavilan wrote to The Hoya. “We could not think of a better individual to be honored in our beautiful new building.”
While Izurieta endorsed Bezos’ request that the auditorium be named after Morrison, he said community members should have a voice in the decision. 
“We are huge fans of Toni Morrison, but we believe that DC public library patrons should have a chance to be heard on who they think the library auditorium should be named after, not Mr. Bezos,” Izurieta wrote. “We are seeking transparency on how the naming process works as well as implementing a procedure for naming the auditorium that involves the input of DC Public library patrons.”

A team of researchers at Georgetown University published an article Feb. 7 in the Journal of Health Affairs on the impact of race on medical treatment.
The article, titled “Race, Place, and Structural Racism: A Review of Health And History in Washington, D.C.” used historical data on federal, state, county and city policies to examine how disparities in medicine have disproportionately impacted the health of Black D.C. residents. The research, led by Christopher King, chair of the department of health systems administration in the School of Nursing and Health Studies (NHS), provides an overview of the history of social, economic and political forces that have created differential health outcomes between people of color and white people. 
Health disparities are evident even in studies that control for socioeconomic variables, according to King.
“Even though it’s 2022, a wide body of evidence suggests the pulse of racism in medical settings continues to reverberate,” King wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Even when income, insurance status, and level of education are controlled, we continue to observe differences in patient experiences by race.”
The Black community has faced higher rates of viral transmission, hospitalization and mortality of COVID-19 compared to other demographics throughout the pandemic.
Recognizing that the medical field has historically excluded topics of race is important to determine how education on race can be expanded, according to Jerome Murray (MED ’22), student co-chair of Georgetown’s Racial Justice Committee for Change (RJCC).
“I think it’s important to understand that many suffer from a lack of knowledge and understanding of when and how these policies came to be,” Murray wrote to The Hoya. “I think that’s the beginning of how we recognize, acknowledge, and ultimately change these historically harmful policies.” 
Understanding historical racial bias in medicine will help the field to evolve to be more inclusive and equitable, according to Theodora Danylevich, adjunct lecturer in the College who has taught courses such as “Medicine, Race & Gender” and “Health Inequity in the Time of Covid.”
“It’s not a question of regaining trust, because there is not some sort of pure space in history where medicine was free from bias,” Danylevich said in an interview with The Hoya. “As practitioners, I think it’s important to learn the unsavory histories, and to ask questions that can help them to exercise empathy, where they can step outside of their own experiences and preconceptions, which is also along the lines of what some scholars and activists call ‘structural humility.’” 
The article drew attention to the fact that many policies continually cause disproportionate harm to Black Americans, such as the uneven distribution of grocery stores and hospitals in minority neighborhoods. 
The inconspicuous nature of medical practitioners’ racialized impact often goes undetected and unchallenged, according to Danylevich.
“There’s rhetoric that is inconspicuously racist: a rhetoric of personal responsibility, such as we often see with fatphobia, rather than looking at the environmental and historical context that could be leading to these conditions that often are the consequences of centuries of racism,” Danyelevich said.
A report published by the NHS found that Black residents in D.C. live on average considerably shorter, less healthy lives than white residents because of systemic racism in the healthcare system, as well as wealth and education disparities.
The authors of the study, most of whom are current professors at Georgetown, find hope in training the next generation of medical practitioners in a way that addresses race and medicine, according to King.
“It is critical for medical students to know this and help us discover better ways to teach and design systems of care with a biopsychosocial orientation,” King wrote.

Nam Vu (COL ’22) represented Georgetown as a competitor in the 2022 Jeopardy! National College Championship.
Vu won the quarter final round on Feb. 16 with a final score of $17,000 after correctly answering trivia questions about topics including Marvel, current events, literature and three-syllable words. The win advanced Vu to the semi final competition that aired Feb. 17, where he was ultimately eliminated. Vu won $20,000 as one of the eight semifinalists to be eliminated.     
After his success in the initial quarter final competition, Vu said he was proud of his performance but wanted to stay calm and prepare for the following rounds of competition.  
“It was definitely exciting to be moving on, but I also wanted to keep my head in the game as I knew I had a game after that,” Vu told The Hoya. “I wanted to stay as focused as I could, but I tried to give myself a little bit of a breath for a celebration to show off for the university and win a game of Jeopardy on live TV.”
The Jeopardy! National College Championship, hosted by actor Mayim Bialik, gives 36 college students the chance to compete against one another for the grand prize of $250,000. The final round will air Feb. 22.
Vu and his family are avid Jeopardy fans — his brother even competed on the official Jeopardy show in 2016 but did not advance to additional rounds — so when the opportunity to apply for the show arose, Vu took the chance. 
“We used to watch it pretty much every night in high school,” Vu said in an interview with The Hoya. “I already had an idea that I wanted to try at some point. It just was more of a matter of when and where makes sense for me.”
Vu decided to apply for Jeopardy after seeing an advertisement for the college tournament in 2020. Vu said the audition process consisted of a timed test in October 2020, followed by a strictly proctored second test in January 2021 and a mock game audition over Zoom in March 2021. 
Going into the audition process, Vu kept his expectations low.
“I didn’t want to get my hopes up in any sense, especially because I had idea of the sheer number of people that ended up auditioning,” Vu said. “I knew there was always a chance, as long of a shot as it was, so I just wanted to enjoy the process.”
Vu found out that he was being considered for the show in September 2021 but did not get confirmation that he would be competing until November, the same month he flew to the Culver City, Calif. set to film the show. 
Vu said that he did not prepare excessively beyond reviewing authors, authors’ works and state and country capitals.  
“There was definitely not a point where I thought, ‘I need to prepare for this audition in case I get on the show or to maximize my chances,’” Vu said. “For the show I prepared a little bit, but I didn’t want to psych myself out too much.”
During the quarter final round, Vu competed and won against students from Tulane University and Spelman College. While in the semifinal competition, he went head to head against students from Harvard University and Kennesaw State University.  
Filming took less than a week and involved a lot of waiting around and watching the filming of other games, according to Vu. 
“It wasn’t a live audience for this event. It ended up being just the other competitors and a lot of their crew,” Vu said. “It was surreal to be on that stage, or to be in the approximate area in the audience and watching that happen.”
Vu’s first game was filmed in the afternoon, which meant that he spent the morning nervously watching his competitors and waiting. 
“It got more and more stressful to wait and sit on set, but during the games, it was kind of fun to even just quietly play along by myself in the Jeopardy live audience in the Jeopardy studio,” Vu said.
Donning a Georgetown sweatshirt while competing, Vu said that it was exciting to have the opportunity to represent the university at the famous competition.
“It was definitely super exciting and super cool to show up for the university specifically, but also to show up for myself,” Vu said. “Especially with how hyped-up the episode ended up and everything, I hope I made Georgetown proud.”

A thrift rack filled with clothes and accessories donated by Georgetown University students opened at The Corp’s Uncommon Grounds (UG) location. 
Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN), a campus organization promoting environmental activism, teamed up with UG to open and operate the thrift store. Proceeds from the thrift store will be donated to Georgetown University Mutual Aid Network, a student-run fund that financially assists members of the Georgetown community. 
The project aims to reduce fast-fashion waste while giving back to the campus community, according to Rita Alan (SFS ’24), GREEN events chair. 
“Textile waste generates a huge amount of energy and water use,” Alan said in an interview with The Hoya. “As fast fashion grows, more energy is being used to make these products. GREEN was talking about that and how there aren’t many good thrifting options available in the Georgetown area.”
The project started developing last semester as an idea to repurpose dorm materials, but soon became a chance for the Georgetown community to upcycle and reuse clothes, according to Brooke Hodge (SFS ’24), co-president of GREEN. 
“We started with an empty table for our first clothing swap, and people brought trash bags and bins full of clothing,” Hodge said in an interview with The Hoya. “At our first swap we were left with four bags full of clothing. So many people had this leftover clothing, like party shirts or dresses with tags on them that people didn’t want to return or things that weren’t in season that people didn’t want to use, but that other people loved and were really excited about buying.”
Following these initial clothing swaps, GREEN brainstormed ways to expand the project. After learning about The Corp Green Initiative that aims to make storefronts as sustainable as possible, GREEN reached out to UG to forge a partnership.
Helen Martin (COL ’22), director of UG, said the coffee shop would provide the space and manage the thrift store while GREEN sourced and priced the clothes. 
“It’s kind of the perfect balance of what we both needed, and I’m really excited about it. I think it’s a great use of space and it’s helping a great cause,” Martin said in an interview with The Hoya. “We signed a contract between GREEN and UG so that we have this ability to keep going until one party says they can’t any more, which I think is really important because it allows the store to not just be a pop-up, but allows the store to be in UG with help from GREEN for the foreseeable future.”
The partnership hopes to expand the thrift store in the coming months to serve a wider variety of student needs beyond just clothing, Hodge said.  
“I think that our grand, long-term vision is to have some concept of a reuse thrift store that can be used to buy clothing, but also school supplies and dorm materials,” Hodge said. “We’ve also talked to Mutual Aid about creating a clothing closet where students are able to access clothing for free rather than pay as a resource for when they have interviews, or if they need winter coats. This would link upcycling clothing and sustainability with elevating accessibility on campus.”
The thrift store project provides students with an ongoing and flexible way to engage with their community through a lens of environmental stewardship, Alan said.  
“We may change up the organization that we’re donating to, because all the money we make from the store is donated,” Alan said. “Right now, we don’t have any concrete long-term plans, and we’re letting the project grow organically.”

Georgetown graduate students received 10 of 26 grants awarded to students in the Washington, D.C. region to go toward graduate research projects.
The Cosmos Scholars grants are awarded by the Cosmos Club Foundation, an organization for advancing science, literature and humanities through awards for charitable and educational purposes, and range up to $5,000. They cover the costs of travel, special supplies and other expenses that would enhance the scholarship for recipients in various academic fields, including literature, biomedical sciences, regional studies and engineering. 
In addition to the 10 award winners this year, the Cosmos Scholars grant program has awarded 120 Georgetown graduate students with research grants since its founding in 1998. 
The Cosmos Club Foundation and Cosmos Club members learn about research in their field during the annual presentations by award winners, according to John Lange, a Cosmos Club Foundation fellow. 
“It’s a way to foster new scholarship; it’s really a source of funds, rather than an accolade,” Lange wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s so enjoyable if you’re one of the foundation members to learn what’s going on in your field at the universities in the metropolitan area and to support new generations of scholarship.”
Erica Lally (GRD ’24), a 2022 Cosmos scholar whose research project addresses the history of a volunteer organization that surveilled private citizens in the United States during the First World War, will use her grant to cover the costs of a research trip to Stanford University to examine rare archival materials central to her dissertation.
“Without the Cosmos funding to help cover the costs, it is unlikely that I would have been able to take this research trip,” Lally wrote in an email to The Hoya. “My research trip isn’t until August, but the content that I expect to review with this funding will help me to add an important set of perspectives to my dissertation research.”
Tianna Mobley (GRD ’22), a 2022 Cosmos scholar whose research project will address African history in the Spanish Atlantic, will use the grant to visit archives in Madrid and Seville this year. 
“I decided to apply for the Cosmos Club grant because of its emphasis on scholarly research and because it would provide funding for me to conduct research internationally,” Mobley wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I received the 2022 Cosmos Scholars grant in support of my research proposal entitled, ‘Legal Personalities of Early Modern Afro-Colombians in the Spanish Atlantic.’” 
Scholars from each field review the proposals first, then the entire committee reviews finalists, ranks them and provides comments, according to Lange.
“We read submissions explaining the scholar’s dissertation or master’s thesis, which these grants help fund,” Lange wrote. “If the proposal is a well-presented piece of scholarship and the budget is reasonable, it’s a fairly easy decision to give them the grant.”
The Cosmos Club Foundation hosts an annual event to celebrate the grant winners and to give them the opportunity to present their research with their academic advisor present, according to Lange.
Charles E. Kiamie, III (GRD ’04, ’08), a 2003 Cosmos Scholar, said that it was exciting to go from a graduate student presenting to the room of Cosmos Club members to being in the audience listening to proposals himself.
“It’s actually very humbling to be in the presence of some really famous people in the audience among the membership of the club, who were showing interest in the limited research of a graduate student at the time,” Kiamie said in an interview with The Hoya. “Then I was in the audience to honor those who came after me and it was really lovely.”
The success of Georgetown graduate students who receive Cosmos Scholars grants demonstrate that Georgetown emphasizes individualized research in the graduate experience, according to Kiamie.
“Georgetown is a campus that really inculcates from the earliest days of the graduate experience, the importance of looking outward,” Kiamie said. “It’s baked in the DNA of the school itself.”

Lara Santana (SFS ’24) announced her resignation in a letter sent to GUSA senate and executive leadership, including GUSA President Nile Blass (COL ’22) on Feb. 14. Santana cited a hostile work environment, ongoing restructuring efforts and internal reforms, and decline in student advocacy efforts as reasons for her resignation. 
Santana said GUSA’s culture no longer made her feel comfortable in the organization. 
“I cannot stay in an organization that continues perpetuating the same oppressive and toxic behaviors it claims to want to eradicate,” Santana wrote in the letter. 
The controversy surrounding the 2022 GUSA executive elections pushed her to resign, according to Santana. 
“It was absolutely disgusting to see how far people would go to ensure that their favorite ticket would win,” Santana said in an interview with The Hoya. “To be honest, I think everything about this election just kept demonstrating how broken GUSA has gotten. I said that in my letter, and I meant it just because all the meetings were absolutely extended long fighting debates.” 
At a Feb. 13 GUSA senate meeting, senators debated for over two hours on whether to certify the win of GUSA presidential elect Kole Wolfe (SFS ’24) and vice-presidential elect Zeke Ume-Ukeje (COL ’24) after the ticket was accused of exchanging alcohol for votes. The senate ultimately decided to certify the results of the election on a vote of 21 in favor, 3 against and 1 abstaining. Santana was not present at the meeting. 
GUSA Senate Speaker Leo Rassieur (COL ’23) said he regrets seeing Santana’s departure from the organization. 
“Senator Santana did a great job in her role, and I’m sorry to see her go,” Rassieur told The Hoya. 
The GUSA Senate will continue to investigate the allegations surrounding the election of Wolfe and Ume-Ukeje, according to Rassieur.  
“There are a lot of students who are concerned with very valid accusations and allegations that the newly elected executive may have seriously violated campaigning roles, and I think that’s something that GUSA is going to take a closer look at moving forward,” Rassieur said “I don’t think anyone who, for example, was trading alcohol for votes should be representing the student body.”
Issues in GUSA arsie from a decline of civility within the organization, according to GUSA Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24), who accepted Santana’s resignation. 
“We get candidates that openly act hostile to the election commission. There’s just the lack of seriousness,” Dominic said in an interview with The Hoya. “We control a million-dollar budget. We don’t need to act like senators all the time, but we do need to ask for some decorum.”
GUSA has strayed from student advocacy to an organization entangled in internal affairs, according to Santana. 
“It’s been months since anything’s been getting done. They spent so many months doing the whole abolish GUSA and that went nowhere,” Santana said. “The proposal was absolutely incomplete, it was not properly written, or properly detailed, and a big part of that is also as time has progressed, they stalled everyone’s projects.”
A referendum that would restructure GUSA, including abolishing the senate, in attempts to promote increased student advocacy on campus failed to pass in the fall 2021 semester after too few students participated in the November election. 
Reform attempts are essential to promoting student advocacy in GUSA, according to Rassieur. 
“I think the internal reforms and changes go totally hand-in-hand with helping us to better respond to student needs and making GUSA run smoothly,” Rassieur said. “The whole idea is that we want to cut out some of the bureaucracy and red tape that makes it difficult for students to participate in GUSA and advocate for their needs.” 
This is not the first time a GUSA senator has resigned from the senate. In 2020, a senator resigned citing a toxic and unsupportive working environment.  
Santana said GUSA must undergo fundamental, institutional change beyond internal restructuring attempts. 
“I think what needs to happen is a whole new election of new senators, not just the consecutive people that consecutively destroy and destroy and destroy this institution further and further,” Santana said. “They issue blanket statements that they’re trying to, quote, revamp it, and that’s nowhere true.”

The second class of formerly incarcerated individuals graduated with a certificate in paralegal studies Feb. 4 through a program at the Georgetown Prisons and Justice Initiative (PJI). 
The Mayor’s Office on Returning Citizen Affairs (MORCA) and Georgetown’s paralegal program, which launched in 2019 and is supported by the D.C. Department of Employment Services (DOES), consists of a 16-week intensive coursework certificate program followed by a one-year paid fellowship with law firms and employers in D.C.
The program provides returning citizens who were formerly incarcerated with opportunities for education and employment that would otherwise be unavailable to them, according to Marc Howard, PJI’s founding director.
“Returning citizens bring an incredible value to their communities and employers, but are so often overlooked or excluded without being given a chance,” Howard wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Returning citizens have personal experience, and often self-taught legal knowledge and skills, that can be an asset to employers, particularly in the legal field. This program aims to equip students with the formal training they need to open doors for themselves and to shift the policies and perceptions that hold returning citizens back.”
The program began in 2019 through a partnership between MORCA and DOES under the leadership of Brian Ferguson (COL ’18), who was the director of MORCA at the time and now serves as senior advisor to President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
Timothy Thomas, one of this year’s paralegal program graduates, previously worked as a law clerk in a federal penitentiary assisting other prisoners with research on their cases. His newly acquired paralegal certificate now provides him with a legitimate social credential in the industry, he said. 
“The paralegal profession allows me to think, research, discuss, and write on a heightened level of legal analysis, beyond what an attorney or jurist may currently know about a problem,” Thomas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I want the opportunity to prepare the core issues involved in a case.”
Guy Redford, another graduate of this year’s paralegal program class, said that the program provided him with applicable knowledge about the legal system.
“The most valuable part of my studies within the program included gaining an overall understanding of the legal system and its basic everyday functions,” Redford wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Understanding the law as written, how to apply the law, and the responsibility to ensure the law is carried out.”
The paralegal program is one of four programs at PJI, alongside the Prison Scholars Program, which is a for-credit program at the D.C. jail that offers courses to currently incarcerated people. 
The Pivot Program, which was founded at PJI three years ago, gives formerly incarcerated individuals the opportunity to earn a non-credit certificate in business and entrepreneurship. 
The Making an Exoneree program is an undergraduate course at Georgetown where students release documentaries advocating for the exoneration of prisoners who they believe were wrongfully convicted.
According to Thomas, the coursework of the academic portion of the paralegal program classes was intense and intellectually demanding.
“Each day was different, exciting, challenging, and fast-paced. The professors started at 9:00 AM sharp. I had to be fully alert and take copious notes,” Thomas wrote. “The interesting part was that our classmates supported each other, despite the competitive nature of legal classes.”
The graduation ceremony showcased the success of this year’s cohort of program graduates, according to Kelly Otter, dean of the School of Continuing Studies.
“They honored us with their hard work and commitment to their studies. They seized the opportunity provided to them and they expressed gratitude to their faculty, the program, and the university,” Otter wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I saw in them people who have powerful lived experiences that they brought to the classroom, to a learning community, and are forging new paths.”
The program went above and beyond to prepare graduates for the legal field, according to Redford. 
“This program was so much more than I expected. The professors have been so helpful and such an inspiration,” Redford wrote. “The information I learned now seems to come into the everyday conversations around me, and it feels so good knowing I understand and can participate in these conversations.”

Multiple items at Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall, Georgetown University’s main dining location, are inaccurately labeled or fail to comply with dietary restrictions.
Students noticed that Hoya Hospitality frequently labels food items as vegan in the downstairs portion of Leo’s despite the ingredient lists including milk or eggs, and fails to ensure vegetarian meals do not include meat products, according to multiple student testimonials.  
Sam Dorsey (COL ’22) received mislabeled items from Leo’s on multiple occasions over the past few months, including a brioche burger bun that was labeled as vegan but actually contained milk and eggs and “vegan” pita bread that contained buttermilk and clarified butter.
“I had stomach problems for more than a month because of this — I tried varying my diet and taking supplements, but I couldn’t figure out what the issue was until I saw an employee at Leo’s opening a package of the naan,” Dorsey wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I recognized the brand, since it’s one that my parents buy, and I realized that I had been feeling sick for so long because the hummus bar was not vegan.”
Dorsey said the mislabeling could pose severe health risks like anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction, if meals were incorrectly labeled as allergen-free.
“Mislabelling allergen-containing food displays a reckless disregard for the safety of students with food allergies,” Dorsey wrote. “Leo’s has displayed little to no respect for folks with special dietary needs or preferences.”
The university is aware of some inconsistencies between menu labels and food being offered, according to a Hoya Hospitality spokesperson.
“Recently, Hoya Hospitality was made aware of menu items on stations outside of the allergen-free station that were not properly reflected on menu boards and the website, and addressed these issues immediately,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These incidents did not occur at the allergen-free station.”
Julia Skeen (COL ’22) ate a curry and noodle dish that was advertised as vegan for her entire first semester in 2018 before finding out that the sauces contained fish. 
“When I reached out to the University, they basically told me to stop eating anything with the sauce and just eat plain rice and tofu,” Skeen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In my sophomore year, there were two instances in which I ate a dish that was advertised as vegan but had cheese in it, which has the potential to make me really sick.”
Skeen said that the frequent mislabeling of food at Leo’s, which has occurred for years, takes both a physical and mental toll on her. 
“Since I’ve been vegan for 6 years, eating animal products can and has made me physically ill,” Skeen wrote. “It’s also really frustrating and emotionally exhausting to not be able to trust that the food I’m eating is safe for me.”
Gwyneth Murphy (SFS ’23) is vegan and was served regular crab cakes instead of vegan ones. 
“I would’ve eaten them without knowing and gotten incredibly sick since I’ve never had seafood before and it’s been 14 years since I’ve had meat, but luckily another worker saw the mistake happen and chased me down right before I walked out of Leo’s to let me know what had happened and to tell me to throw it out,” Murphy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But that kind of situation, as much as a crab cake seems like a small risk, can turn into a major liability when long-term vegans consume meat that gets them hospitalized.”
Murphy has medical dietary restrictions, but Georgetown rejected her request for an exemption from the meal plan.
“Despite my doctor asking Georgetown to exempt me from the meal plan, the university put financial needs above student wellness and refused to offer an exemption,” Murphy wrote. “Now I pay thousands of dollars per semester for a meal plan that I’ve only used twice in the last seven months, once to get a cup of lemonade and once to get a to-go container of broccoli.”
Exemptions are not considered for those who are voluntarily on a vegan, vegetarian or gluten-free diet. 
The university’s strict meal plan policies and limited offerings for students with dietary restrictions force students to choose between their beliefs and their health, according to Dorsey.
“No matter why a person chooses their particular diet, they have a right to eat what they want and control what goes into their bodies,” Dorsey wrote. “Attending Georgetown means gambling your health on a shockingly expensive meal plan that does little to feed you.”

After a surge in positive COVID-19 cases on campus, students isolating in two different locations on and off campus face difficulties receiving adequate food. 
Between Feb. 8 and 9, over 80 undergraduate students tested positive for COVID-19; by Feb. 12, the number of COVID-19 cases increased to 205 throughout the Georgetown University community. With an increase of community members in isolation, students have expressed frustrations over receiving adequate access to necessities like food from university officials.  
The increase in cases filled all available isolation rooms at the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center and prompted the university to acquire additional isolation rooms at the Glover Park Hotel Georgetown, located 1.5 miles from Georgetown’s main campus, according to a Feb. 9 email to community members. 
Some students, including Spencer Woodall (MSB, SFS ’24), who was in isolation at the Glover Park Hotel, say they did not receive enough food or water throughout the isolation period. 
“I was told that we only get 3 boxes of food per week, which to my memory is 4 boxes a week less than my previous quarantine in the Georgetown hotel,” Woodall wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The boxes only include 3 bottles of water each, which means only 9 bottles a week. This is most concerning to me as I only drink water, and it’s not very helpful to people who need fluids because of COVID.”
The university provides students in isolation with multiple meals and snacks that meet dietary restrictions, according to a university spokesperson. 
“In both the on- and off-campus hotel and residence hall isolation scenarios, students are provided with three meals per day as well as snacks and beverages (including water),” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Students in isolation are always allowed to request additional meals and make requests for meals to accommodate allergies or dietary restrictions.”
Other students say they received meals that violate their dietary restrictions. Carly Finley (MSB ’23), who has been in quarantine at the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center since Feb. 8, specified her dietary restrictions when she checked in at the front desk before beginning her quarantine period. 
Despite listing that she does not eat red meat, Finley said the university delivered foods with red meat. 
“The next day I was brought a roast beef sandwich … it’s pretty much a coin toss, some days I am brought a bag that says ‘No Beef’ on the outside, and some days I’m not,” Finley wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Either way, I pretty much don’t eat any of it except if it’s a turkey sandwich, a croissant or a snack like pretzels and hummus.”
Rakhi Parikh (COL ’25), who follows a vegetarian diet, tested positive for COVID-19 on Feb. 13 and isolated in the Glover Park Hotel. 
Parikh said that after receiving an initial box of food when she arrived, no one delivered her food until 4 p.m. on Feb. 14, and the food that did arrive was very limited.  
“That box was all gluten-free vegan, even though the night before it was like normal vegetarian,” Parikh said in an interview with The Hoya. “I guess for the boxes they just combine all dietary restrictions into one which is unfortunate.”
Students can drop off meals at the front desk for friends quarantined in the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center, an option those at the Glover Park Hotel cannot rely on because of the significant distance from campus.
“I have to rely on my friends to bring me food to the front desk because the meals are just gross,” Finley wrote. “For people who can’t afford to DoorDash every meal cause they’re already paying a fortune for a meal plan, it really sucks feeling like you have to burden your friends to bring you like 2 meals a day because you can’t stomach the food they give you.”
The university resumed public health measures Feb. 12 as they were during the fall 2021 semester, including expanding operations to include indoor dining at full capacity.

Georgetown University professors collaborated on a book that examines the complex relationship between Black and Jewish communities in political and religious life. 
The book, titled “Blacks and Jews in America: An Invitation to Dialogue,” analyzes democracy in the United States through underrepresented perspectives. Jaques Berlinerblau, the Rabbi Harold White Professor of Jewish Civilization in the School of Foreign Service (SFS), and Terrence L. Johnson, associate professor of religion and politics in the government department, released the book in February. 
“Blacks and Jews in America” aims to investigate and clarify the connections between race relations, religion and politics, according to Johnson.  
“We really wanted to tell this message in terms of the complicated ways race, religion and democracy intertwine and tell the story through the particularities of Blacks and Jews as a starting point for reinvigorating not only conversation between the two groups but also a broader conversation in terms of political solidarity,” Johnson said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The Unite the Right rally — a deadly 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Va., where white supremacists marched, chanted racist and antisemitic rhetoric and became violent — initiated Berlinerblau and Johnson’s decision to write the book as both authors felt the need to speak about the hateful ideas expressed at the rally. 
“I think what triggered the idea that we needed to do something within the Georgetown community was the Charlottesville incident,” Johnson said. “When they were chanting, ‘Blacks and Jews will not replace us,’ I think we were both stunned.” 
The book explores why Blacks and Jews are not more united in the fight against white supremacy, as well as the deep roots between the Black and Jewish communities extending to before the mid-twentieth century.  
Berlinerblau and Johnson co-teach an undergraduate course titled “Blacks and Jews in America,” where they utilize dialogue to approach intimate issues with sensitivity and structure. 
Students’ reaction to the material in the class, as well as the discussions that took place in the classroom, also inspired the book “Blacks and Jews in America,” according to Berlinerblau.
“We started teaching the class in 2015 and there was tremendous student excitement around the project,” Berlinerblau wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We were propelled by their energy I guess.”
The book, which is intended to be an invitation to dialogue, builds upon classroom experiences, discussions and essays, according to Johnson.   
“We decided to take a portion of that style and then add a couple of our original essays and also interviews with two leading women scholars in part because we find that the discussions around Blacks and Jews are often centered on men and on exchanges between them,” Johnson said.
Student teaching assistants and researchers worked behind the scenes on the book in collaboration with Berlinerblau and Johnson. Ria Pradhan (SFS ’23), who took a proseminar class with Berlinerblau in the fall 2019 semester, worked on a variety of projects with him in the past related to political secularism. 
According to Pradhan, the work that went into “Blacks and Jews in America” required her and another student researcher, Alexander Lin (SFS ’23), to complete a variety of tasks, including general research, drafting and providing editing assistance. 
“The research tasks Alex and I conducted ranged from transcribing and editing conversations between the Professors (which were then adapted into the content you see in the book), finding topical journal articles, collecting primary sources, and providing feedback to the Professors on chapter content,” Pradhan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I feel really grateful to have been able to delve into Black-Jewish relations with Professors Berlinerblau and Johnson as they are both experts in the field.” 
Johnson hopes that the book will urge readers to evaluate their perceptions of Black and Jewish relations in a new light. 
“All the issues that I think divide us come up in between these two groups, and I think that we can dissect what’s happening and what has happened historically,” Johnson said. “It’s not about reviving any kind of alliance, but it’s about how we make this sort of alliance and what we take away from it so that we can push and broaden our imagination about democracy.”

UPDATE: According to a Feb. 18 email from a university spokesperson, the recalled Makena Electronic masks were confirmed to be effective. The masks have been placed back into circulation. 
“We have received test results performed by independent laboratories confirming that the Makena Electronic KN95s on campus meet the performance requirements under GB2626-2006 and the NIOSH N95 requirement for filter efficiency,” the spokesperson wrote.“The effectiveness of all KN95 and N95 masks provided by the university has been verified by independent testing.”
Georgetown University has recalled select KN95 masks distributed on campus while administrators ascertain whether they meet standards for efficiency and safety. 
The university pulled masks made by Makena Electronic, a Chinese company that manufactures digital consumer electronic products, as well as personal protective equipment (PPE). 
Last week, The Hoya submitted to the university examples of masks available on campus that did not visibly meet international standards for quality KN95 respirators. In response, a university spokesperson told The Hoya that administrators decided to pull Makena Electronic masks from distribution until additional details about their authenticity had been gathered.
“Upon additional review of our current stock, out of an abundance of caution we have removed Makena Electronic masks from campus distribution,” the spokesperson wrote in a Feb. 17 email to The Hoya. “While the Makena Electronic Masks are certified by the manufacturer to meet the standard for KN95 masks, we are seeking additional confirmation that these masks meet the applicable efficiency standard.”
The Hoya identified several examples of masks in circulation on Georgetown’s campus that did not visibly meet standards laid out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for KN95 respirators. According to these standards, KN95 masks should include markings identifying the mask’s manufacturer, model, size and a number and publication standard that usually reads “GB-2626-2019” or “GB-2626-2006.” 
The Makena Electronic masks were available at campus PPE distribution stands as recently as this week, including in White-Gravenor Hall.
While masks still in circulation on campus lack the markings that indicate authenticity, the university spokesperson wrote that now all available KN95 respirators have been vetted as authentic. 
“Georgetown has confirmation from independent laboratories that all masks currently in circulation meet the applicable efficiency standard,” the spokesperson wrote. 
The spokesperson said that masks pulled from circulation have been replaced with some that were either approved by the CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) or tested independently to confirm authenticity. 
While guidelines provided by the CDC are useful for spotting potential counterfeit masks, the criteria alone cannot establish whether or not a mask is authentic, according to Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert and professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
“The CDC criteria is a guide and may or may not be completely sensitive or specific for identifying counterfeit KN95s,” Adalja wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The manufacturer of the recalled masks did seek Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Establishment Registration. However, the registration process in no way certifies FDA approval of a product. 
The Makena Electronic masks require additional verification of authenticity, according to Anne Miller, executive director of Project N95, a Buffalo-based nonprofit organization that reviews the quality of masks and PPE for consumers and governments.
“Establishment registration does not mean approval,” Miller wrote to The Hoya. “This product would need to be tested.” 
The recall follows this month’s discovery that American University unknowingly distributed counterfeit KN95 masks after an investigation by the school’s student newspaper, The Eagle. 
The university spokesperson said Georgetown procures masks from several manufacturers and implements a vetting process to ascertain the respirators’ quality.
“We regularly obtain testing results or other proof of certification or efficiency from the manufacturer and/or independent laboratories to ensure the masks provided to the community meet appropriate standards,” the spokesperson wrote. “Staff members also review the university’s mask stock to ensure quality.”
The CDC found that counterfeit respirators made up about 60% of the KN95 masks they evaluated in 2020 and 2021. Similarly, fake N95 masks are common. These masks, which offer increased protection and filtering capabilities than cloth masks, have become more widely recommended in past months. 
Georgetown University updated its mask guidelines for the spring semester to ask community members to wear KN95, N95 or comparable masks while on campus, according to a Jan. 24 email from Provost Robert Groves. 
“Given the respiratory nature of COVID-19 transmission, students, faculty and staff should wear a properly-fitted, high-quality mask (e.g., N95, KN95, KF94) while on campus,” Groves wrote in the email to students. “Individuals cannot wear a cloth mask, or a mask with a vent or valve, because these masks do not sufficiently reduce the transmission of the virus from exhaled droplets and aerosol particles that might contain the virus.”
Georgetown is not the only stakeholder having to deal with the question of potentially inauthentic PPE, according to Miller. 
“There are a large number of these companies who have pivoted to make PPE and it is sort of a vast unknown as to their performance,” Miller wrote.
