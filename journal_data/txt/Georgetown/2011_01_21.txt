As Chinese President Hu Jintao visited the White House Wednesday, first lady Michelle Obama stepped on stage at Howard University to encourage students to study abroad in the dignitary’s home country.
“Studying in countries like China isn’t only about your prospects in the global marketplace,” Obama said. “It’s not just about whether you can compete with your peers in other countries to make America stronger. It’s also about whether you can come together and work with them to make our world stronger.”
Obama discussed major commitments to Chinese cultural exchange as part of the 100,000 Strong Initiative announced by her husband in 2009. In her opening remarks she stated that private sector pledges would provide more than $2.25 million to support an increase in the numbers of American students who study in China by 2014.
China, which is one of the top five host countries to American students, has offered more than 10,000 scholarships funded by the Chinese government called bridge scholarships that cover all in-country costs. The 100,000 Strong Initiative aims to bolster this effort, and also expand it to included even younger students.
“[Studying abroad is] how, student by student, we develop that habit of cooperation,” Obama said.
Some students said that they were inspired by Obama’s remarks.
“As an exchange student from China to America, I have seen that cultural exchange is the only way to get closer for sure, because you learn so much more than just in books of the subtle cultural differences,” Yifei Zhao, a student from Shanghai currently studying at the Sidwell Friends High School, said. “That is part of the educational exchange: if I could express the relationship between the ways we attend class, go out, or just live, then I wouldn’t be here right now.”
Other students, however, prioritize finishing college as soon as possible above living in foreign countries.
“Maybe after I get a job I’d go abroad for a year,” Howard University student Daniel Jacques said.
Empathizing with students who feel that studying abroad is not an option for them, Obama recalled her college experience, which she felt focused on earning a degree quickly above study abroad experiences.
“Maybe [students] may feel like study abroad is something that only rich kids do, or maybe kids who go to certain colleges; they’re the only ones who do that,” Obama said.
The panel following Obama’s speech, which consisted of four high school and college students who had lived in China, sought to curb these fears and discussed the possibility of studying abroad without high costs. Panelist Lyric Carter, a junior at the Phelps Architecture, Construction and Engineering High School, went on a six-week program in Beijing partially funded by the State Department’s National Security Language Initiative for Youth.
“It encouraged me to go out and try anything now,” she said of the program.

Two of Georgetown’s largest student-run organizations, The Corp and the Georgetown University Alumni & Student Federal Credit Union, announced their new leadership, effective March 1, last weekend.
Alexander Pon (COL ’12) was elected chief executive officer and president of The Corp, succeeding Brad Glasser (COL ’11). Brooke Heinichen (SFS ’12) is the new chief operating officer, following in the footsteps of Josh Feller (COL ’11), and Scott Munro (COL ’12) is the new chief financial officer, succeeding Spencer Fertig (COL ’11).
“We looked toward the potential of people to motivate large numbers of people,” Glasser said of the selection process.
The new leadership cited enthusiasm for improving the employee and customer experience as a key motivator in their decisions to apply.
“I wanted to take the love and passion I’ve developed for The Corp, and I thought this was the best opportunity to put my dreams into action,” Heinichen said.
All three emphasized their excitement at tackling their new roles and a desire for customer feedback.
“Over the next weeks, I plan to meet with everyone in The Corp and other people on campus in an effort to push The Corp into the future,” Pon said.
The Credit Union also selected its new leadership last weekend with a similar mission. Katie Cohen (COL ’12) was appointed the new CEO, succeeding Arjun Mehta (SFS ’11). Kristine Cudahy (MSB ’12) was selected as COO and chairwoman of the board. Greg Francfort (COL ’12) was chosen as CFO, while Rachael Piltch-Loeb (NHS ’12) will be the next chief lending officer. Jack Glascott (COL ’12) was appointed chief human resources officer, Ariana Klener (MSB ’12) was selected as chief marketing officer and Jack Mohr (MSB ’12) was appointed treasurer. All of the appointees will be voted into their positions on March 1.
“I could not be more thrilled,” Cohen said. “When I think about Georgetown, I think about the Credit Union. This is my family. This is not about me in any specific position, it is definitely about the whole team.”
Cohen said the new board would sit down to form a strategic plan for the upcoming year over the next weeks.

Campus discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may be stuck in the past, according to experts who visited Georgetown this week to transform talk of Middle East issues into a cooperative effort.
In Copley Formal Lounge, Middle East policy analysts Ghaith al-Omari, a Georgetown graduate, and David Makovsky presented their views about a cooperative two-state solution to Israeli-Palestinian woes, as part of “The Dialogue Initiative,” sponsored by the International Relations Club and the Georgetown Israel Alliance and nationally by the Israel on Campus Coalition.
According to both al-Omari and Makovsky, campus discussions across the country about the conflict are rooted too far in the past, not keeping pace with progress in the Middle East.
“The campus discourse, we thought, was too much about recriminations,” Makovsky said. “Usually the campuses are ahead of the curve on issues, but on this one issue across the country, we felt the campuses are behind the curve. While people are talking to each other in the Middle East, why can’t they talk to each other in the Northeast?”
Rather than forming factions, students should recognize that the interests of Israel and Palestine are not diametrically opposed, al-Omari said.
“You can be a pro-Palestine advocate without being anti-Israel,” he said.
He illustrated the way in which campus dialogue seems focused on the “zero-sum approach,” which states that what is good for one nation is bad for the other and the “tribal approach,” which delves into the history of both nations to justify conflict. Neither of these viewpoints, he argued, leaves room for objectivity or potential consensus.
“It’s very easy to point out the bad side of the other,” al-Omari said. “It is easy to get angry.”
He noted that as far back as the mid-1990s, both sides expressed willingness to settle for a two-state solution, even if media coverage has tended to highlight areas of conflict.
“The loudest voices that we hear are the extreme voices on both sides,” al-Omari explained. “Those who want to get along, get along quietly.”
Centrist activists tend to remain quiet about their activities, Makovsky explained, in part because they do not want to upset or embarrass other members of their nation.
“The reality on the ground is far more complex than you read in the newspapers,” Makovsky said. “It is based on the two sides working together. [There is] a de facto alliance that neither side talks about.”
Shifting collegiate dialogue to a more centrist approach could eventually overpower extremists who now stand in the way of unity. This approach motivates al-Omari and Makovsky in their efforts to campaign across campuses.
“If we are serious people for a two-state solution, then we have to build up both sides of the two-state solution,” Makovsky said. “We found that the faculty was not attuned to these developments on the ground, that their thinking was stuck in a very confrontational age. What we want to do is bring the message to the students that you’ve got to be forces for coexistence.”
The end goal for students is to find a viable solution to the conflict, and students are keen on using dialogue now so that policy implementation can occur later on.
“For us, we hope to change the topics of the dialogue,” Daphna Katz (COL ’12), co-president of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, said. “We are students on college campuses, so we aren’t going to be establishing peace in the Middle East here. What we can do is not go back to 1948, but have dialogue about how we can move forward.”

Charles Smith (SFS ‘14) and University of Richmond student John Perrone will likely plead guilty to violating federal and District law by manufacturing the drug Dimethyltryptamine on campus in October.
Smith, who is no longer enrolled at Georgetown according to university spokeswoman Julie Bataille, and Perrone were arrested on Oct. 23 for allegedly concocting the banned substance in Smith’s ninth-floor room in Harbin Hall.
At a hearing at D.C.’s U.S. District Court on Oct. 28, Smith and Perrone were released to the custody of their parents in Andover, Mass., until the next court date, scheduled for Jan. 24. Monday’s hearing was cancelled, according to the court’s criminal docket, however, as Smith and Perrone have agreed to a plea deal.
The two students’ lawyers filed a motion Thursday night stating that the defendants and government had reached an agreement, according to The Washington Post. Smith and Perrone are expected to sign the plea bargain within two weeks.
Danny Onorato, Smith’s lawyer, and Allen Dale, Perrone’s lawyer, both declined to comment.

A new program at the University of the District of Columbia could enable a small group of high-performing D.C. public school students to get a bachelor’s degree two years after graduating high school.
The pilot program, which could be launched as soon as fall 2012, is an attempt to attract bright students who might otherwise choose to leave the area, UDC spokesman Alan Etter said.
“We first began talking about these issues when it first became obvious that we needed to create a better feeder system,” he said.
Under the proposed plan, accepted students would begin taking classes at UDC during their junior year of high school. After graduating from high school, students would take two more years of college coursework to earn a bachelor’s degree.
The pilot program would at first only accept students from Woodrow Wilson Senior High School, the District’s largest comprehensive public high school which is currently holding classes on the UDC campus while their building is being renovated, and the School Without Walls, a small public magnet high school in Foggy Bottom. The program is part of a larger initiative by UDC to recruit more motivated students, according to The Washington Post.
A similar program kicked off at The George Washington University in 2009 with 14 students from the School Without Walls; six more joined the program this year. The UDC plan is different, however, in that it does not grant students an associate degree when they graduate high school, but instead funnels them directly into a bachelor’s program.
High school students would take college courses that count for dual credit during the last two years of high school and then graduate with a bachelor’s degree two years later, according to The Washington Post.
George Mason University also offers a similar program, Pathway to the Baccalaureate, which guides high school students through Virginia community colleges and to four year schools, according to the program’s website.
“This is cutting-edge for D.C. [public schools], and it’s cutting edge for much of the metro area,” Sheila Harris, a former School Without Walls principal and director of the GWU program, said to The Washington Post.
The UDC partnership still needs to be approved by DCPS interim chancellor Kaya Henderson (SFS ’92), but Etter said he does not foresee major obstacles.
DCPS officials declined to comment until a formal agreement with UDC is reached.

Four Loko has gone from energizing parties to powering 18 wheelers.
MXI Environmental Services, a Virginia-based company, has started purchasing the beverage with the intent to convert it into automobile fuel following the Dec. 13 ban, according to the Associated Press.
The trendy drink was officially removed from shelves around the country by the Federal Drug Administration for its hazardous mixture of caffeine and alcohol, which can cause heart irregularities and dehydration, and which the FDA linked to alcohol poisoning, car accidents and assaults, according to the AP. The beverage had become popular among high school and college students for its simultaneously invigorating and intoxicating effects, leaving liquor stores with large stocks of unsold product after the ban.
MXI has offered to buy cases of the beverage from all over the East Coast and plans to reuse the materials ranging from aluminum cans to alcohol in an effort to environmentally recycle the entire product, according to the AP. The aluminum cans will be sold to a recycler and cardboard casing and shipping pallets and water contained in the drink will be conventionally recycled. The alcohol will be converted into ethanol, a fuel that is typically derived from corn or other crops and is more environmentally friendly than most gasoline.
According to an MXI executive quoted by the AP, the company is receiving such a large quantity of Four Loko shipments that ethanol production from the beverages could continue for months. Gas stations across the nation could soon be receiving the gasoline additive.
Only two other facilities in the U.S. also recycle ethanol, and the AP reports that MXI’s competitors have also been taking shipments of Four Loko.
Ethanol can be blended with petroleum fuels and, along with other alcohol-based fuels such as methanol, it has the potential to significantly reduce the U.S. domestic consumption of petroleum, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Kristin Ng (MSB ’11), president of Georgetown EcoAction, expressed enthusiasm at this new form of recycling.
“There are lots of recalled items that can be safely reused in other ways … instead of just going to waste,” Ng said.
MXI has been converting a variety of products, including unsold beer, wine, liquor, cosmetics and fragrances into fuel-grade ethanol since 2002, according to the company’s website.
Although these developments have certainly appealed to the environmentally conscious community, some former Four Loko drinkers are troubled by the beverage’s easy transition to automobile fuel.
“It’s concerning to think that I’ve practically been drinking gasoline,” Samuel Streitweiser (COL ’14) said.
Phusion Projects will attempt to counter the company’s negative image with a non-caffeinated drink — Four Loko XXX — being released this month, according to a Jan. 4 press release.

When I woke up on Wednesday morning, I could not have anticipated that that evening I would be standing alongside international media giants in the White House. The day marked the second of Chinese President Hu Jintao’s three days in Washington, D.C., and the evening’s state dinner already promised to be newsworthy. By a lucky chance, I was fortunate enough to cover the event.
Here is my experience: a behind-the-scenes view of how the events at the White House become what you see on television, read in the newspapers and watch videos of online — in short, how news is made.
Names on the media guest list have to arrive at the North Gate the exact minute of the scheduled appointment. The same rules do not apply to the weathered reporters in black pea coats armed with red press tags that decree that they may enter at anytime, carrying cameras, cables and even bags filled with Cosi sandwiches.
Once past the gate, there is a crush of people, as ABC cameramen stand neck-and-neck with their counterparts at CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC. Reporters pace around testing different octaves of “Hu Jintao.”
The stairs down to the briefing room lead to a rather small door, inside of which there are rows of well-sized and comfortable blue chairs.
Walking in for the first time, I felt like I was entering a potpourri of journalist clichés — BlackBerrys, newspapers, power cords, laptops, dress pants, North Face fleeces, ties and coffee cups were strewn about.
I was overwhelmed — I just stood there, glued to the floor in disbelief — until a navy blue fleece sleeve interrupted my gaze, and the fleece’s owner asked, “So where ya from kid?” That’s how I met my self-proclaimed briefing room mentor. “Georgetown student paper university. Student university Georgetown,” I stammered. “The Hoya. A paper for the student newspaper. Of Georgetown.”
He laughed and showed me the mechanics of the pressroom, or “the gut of the White House,” as it’s dubbed by its occupants. There are offices behind the briefing room for the media giants, such as the Associated Press, Reuters, NBC, ABC and Fox. About the size of a Rafik B. Hariri Building breakout room, the offices are lined with computers on each side. Inside any one of them, the word “speed” is tangible: Laptops litter the ground, cameras are spread all over chairs and everybody wears headphones while watching a clip, writing, emailing, blogging, or tweeting. Print leaders like The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Huffington Post have desks in the main hallway just outside. Then there is the kitchen — the one place where the expensive equipment does not flood the premises, the hub of chitchat and political jokes. There is only one as abundant in the press room as cameras or computers: the coffeemaker.
Once back outside, on the patio in front of the Palm Room, I and several photographers, reporters and cameramen assembled as we prepared for the first event on the press agenda: a tour of the state dinner set up. At the base of the stairs that lead to the front of the White House, two groups of media emerged: the cameramen, casual in sneakers and jackets, accustomed to the wear and tear of White House coverage, and the photographers and reporters.
The latter group had clearly formed cliques: the regulars and the newcomers. The first group joked about the Christmas dinner they had obviously attended; the novices either fumbled with their smart phones or gossiped about the star-studded guest list for the evening. Vera Wang would be there. So would the Clintons.
I trekked along — up the stairs, towards the front door, inside — and then there I was: inside of the White House.
As we spread throughout the dining rooms, we were literally playing a game of Twister, trying hard not to interrupt the proceedings. We failed. After the aides asked everyone to leave for a fifth time, some photographers actually began to head out. The skilled ones, however, ducked unnoticed into another room and I followed. Unfortunately one aide, a skinny girl with a wisp of brown hair, took me by the shoulder, lightly yet firmly, and asked me to leave. My camera, pointed toward a photo of Nixon, went off again, this time by accident. She pushed down on my shoulder: “I was not kidding.” Her left eyebrow slowly lifted. Other photographers scurried so as to not repeat my fate.
“Good luck with the dinner,” I said meekly as my shoulder was pushed toward the door. A photographer told me not to worry and that he has seen much worse.
My luck was quickly restored, however, when I was invited, this time by a much nicer aide, to the second event — the arrival of President Hu Jintao. An hour later, we rushed up the stairs again, the photographers armed with re-charged, re-lensed cameras. We climbed, no matter our footwear, onto the two wooden platforms in front of the door to the White House. Within the hour, the messy front room was transformed into a sparkling hall with jazz musicians and cherry blossoms.
We stood there for an hour, photographers on the top tier, cameramen on the lower tier. The “presidential pool,” or the main media that covers Obama regularly, got the flowerbeds. While waiting, we exchanged mints, camera settings and stories of photo shoots.
Then the doorman threw open the White House doors and out came the President and First Lady. Everyone was silent. They walked up to the front of the red carpet, and they stood. The First Lady and her husband. Right there. The only sound was that of camera shutters. President Hu’s limousine arrived – he exited, shook hands with his American counterpart, they posed, they walked inside. Everything occurred in five silent minutes.
In the sixth, the red carpet was already rolling back up, the National Guard was marching away, and everyone on the platform had their phones out asking, “Wait, what color was her dress again?”
Tangerine? Burnt orange? Grapefruit? Their Twitter feeds had to be accurate after all. By the eighth minute, one woman from the Chinese press had already composed a short story on her iPhone that she was sending overseas for publication.
We walked back inside, everyone frantically looking at our media packets, trying only to determine what was next on the agenda.
They would be giving a toast in 15 minutes.
Suddenly I understood the nature of news. If somebody had told me before Wednesday that in 15 minutes Obama would be giving a toast, I don’t know if I would have been that concerned. But when you’re in that press room — thinking about the shot, the frame, the description and the story that you have to churn out — the toast at the state dinner is just as important as the arrival of the visiting dignitary 10 minutes earlier. It is what’s happening next, it becomes top priority.
It is, simply put, news.

The two-year battle over the university’s campus plan came to a head Thursday night, as students joined administrators and neighbors for a public meeting held by the Advisory Neighborhood Commission-2E.
Attendees sparred over certain clauses in the 2010-2020 Campus Plan, which has colored town-gown ties since the university began drafting the proposal in 2009. The administration submitted its final version to the D.C. Zoning Commission on Dec. 30.
The meeting and discussion were meant to gauge community response to the plan, according to representatives of the ANC, which plans to draft a resolution by Jan. 31 outlining its stance. From there, the neighborhood body plans to take its case to the Zoning Commission and the D.C. Office of Planning.
“We’re not here to win a debate,” said ANC Commissioner Ed Solomon, who led the meeting.
The forum opened with general statements from University Provost James O’Donnell and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, as well as a coalition of representatives from local neighborhood associations, followed by questioning of both parties by the ANC commissioners and attendees.
Not only O’Donnell and Olson spoke in favor of the plan, however — about 30 to 40 undergraduate students showed up to voice their support.
“It is definitely possible to understand [the neighbors’] concerns to some degree, but at times [they are] almost irrational,” said Ricky Garza (SFS ’13), a student in attendance.
Underlying tensions between university interests and neighborhood grievances bubbled to the surface during the presentation of a petition drafted by DC Students Speak, a blog and network of D.C. undergraduates active in local politics.
At press time, the document had received 747  online signatures in favor of the campus plan. However, an opposition document put forth by the Citizens Association of Georgetown had received only 167 online signatures, a comparatively low count that CAG President Jennifer Altemus attributed to the smaller number of local residents.
Representatives of DC Students Speak said they were pleased to see their peers mobilize behind the campus plan.
“This is a part of the heart of D.C. politics,” Alykhan Merali (SFS ’13) said.
For many residents, no mention in the plan of on-campus student housing construction or new safety measures was a cause for concern.
“[The students] cannot follow basic rules of living,” ANC Commissioner Tom Birch said.
Several members of the community brought up the possibility of building additional dormitories on campus and creating a satellite campus to prevent students’ encroachment into off-campus areas.
In response, Olson said the university had exhausted all possible on-campus housing options after a thorough review.
Georgetown residents in attendance said they were particularly unhappy about the rowdiness of their student neighbors. Members of CAG and the Burleith Citizens Association argued that the latest measures implemented by the university, including more Student Neighborhood Assistance Program and Department of Public Safety patrols, did not eradicate the two neighborhoods’ problems.
“What’s next? The National Guard?” BCA President Lenore Rubino asked.
Despite the tense discussion, ANC-2E Commissioner Jake Sticka (COL ’13) was pleased with student turnout and hopes it will continue. He emphasized the importance of student participation in the next stages of the campus plan discussions.
“We’re going to need that presence continuing, in the ANC meetings and to testify to the Zoning Committee,” he said.
The D.C. Zoning Commission will review the plan on April 14.
Correction: The original version of the article stated that Ricky Garza is in the class of 2014, however, he is in the class of 2013.

Most of their dinner conversations may be ordinary — mulling over the fate of the basketball team, taking stock of their new courses — but once a month this group of male students breaks bread over a weightier topic: the possibility of entering the Jesuit order.
The “Barbistes” — named after the college at the University of Paris where the candidates who first entered this Catholic order met in the 1500s — gather for informal meetings, consisting of Mass, dinner and discussion.
They typically include one of campus’s 64 Jesuits, who tells of his current work and reflects on his decision to enter the order. The number of participants varies, but generally remains under 10 students.
“Georgetown students have a phenomenal resource in the Jesuits on campus,” said Danny Gustafson (COL ’11), who is currently applying to enter the Society of Jesus. “Without the Jesuit community here there’s no way I would have even considered applying. I’ve found their support really moving and inspirational.”
The purpose of the group is not to “funnel people into the Society,” Fr. David Collins, S.J., a leader of the Barbistes, said. Instead, the meetings of the Barbistes offer an opportunity for what the Jesuits call “discernment.”
“It’s a prayerful way of making a decision,” Executive Director of Campus Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., said. “The students share with one another their desire for the priesthood, their questions and their struggles.”
For someone contemplating the Jesuit life, these hurdles are numbered. Potential priests must confront the fact that becoming part of the tradition means a lifelong commitment.
“It’s tough for a 20- or 21-year-old to think about entering for the long haul … especially when models of this kind of commitment are fewer and fewer,” Collins said.
Students who are contemplating a religious vocation must also consider the sacrifices involved in becoming a Jesuit.
“When I came to college I had my whole life plan built around my interest in politics and a desire to enter politics myself,” said Gustafson, a former president of the Georgetown University College Democrats. “The biggest challenge in this process has been letting go of my own expectations and the expectations that everyone else had for me in order to listen to God and think more critically about what I ought to do with my life.”
With the Catholic Church’s reputation shaky in recent years, students considering a religious vocation must also take into account the perceptions of others. According to O’Brien, the growing antipathy toward the Church means choosing to devote oneself to a religious life can be a difficult process.
“Especially in the wake of the sexual abuse crisis, respect for the priesthood has diminished. Many people who don’t know the Church might not understand this decision,” O’Brien said. Gustafson has faced the doubters head-on.
“I’ve had to answer a lot of questions, especially from people who don’t have a lot of experience with the Jesuits,” he said. “Giving up sex, money and individual liberty is completely at odds with societal values. It’s easy for people to only think about the vows [of chastity, poverty, and obedience] as giving things up rather than seeing what’s to gain.”
In spite of these modern pressures, Gustafson says he feels accepted by his peers on campus.
“People here know what it means for me, and they’ve been incredibly supportive,” he said.
And support is essential, especially as the application to become a Jesuit is a long and arduous process. According to the Society of Jesus in the United States, about 35 to 45 men across the country enter the Jesuits each year. Applicants must write a spiritual biography, fill out biographical and financial paperwork, submit references, attend six interviews, and undergo four medical and psychological tests.
“It was mentally exhausting, but very interesting,” Gustafson said. “But this biggest challenge is not getting complacent in my decision but to continually reanalyze and pray, to reaffirm that this is what I want to do with my life.”

With fewer stores closing their doors and new establishments selling everything from sports apparel to pinball museum tickets, the Georgetown area appears to be recovering from the recession.
After a net loss of 13 stores in 2009, the neighborhood saw a net gain of 15 stores last year, according to Jim Bracco, executive director of the Georgetown Business Improvement District.
“I think we’ve had a pretty good year with stores trying to get into Georgetown,” Bracco said. “That’s a great sign, hopefully, of years to come.”
While most retail businesses nationwide saw the effects of the poor economy, local shops fared relatively well, according to Bracco. The national average loss in stores was about 28 percent, but the neighborhood lost only about 8 percent of stores in 2009, Bracco said.
Despite the net gain in stores, there were between 50 and 60 business openings and closings over the course of 2010, reflecting significant turnover, according to Bracco. “It’s a little bit of a mixed bag,” he said.
New business locations in the neighborhood include national brands like Apple, Madewell and City Sports, as well as local businesses such as the National Pinball Museum. According to Bracco, the Georgetown BID tries to maintain a balance between national brands and local business.
“We’re thankful we’ve been able to keep that mix alive,” Bracco said.
City Sports opened in December 2010 and has so far seen success in the area, according to Michael Mosca, executive vice president of merchandising for City Sports.
“We’re very pleased with the store,” he said. “We had a really great response to our opening.”
Mosca said that the Georgetown neighborhood is a great place to open new locations because of the residential neighborhood, commercial aspect and nearby university campus.
“It’s a really sweet spot,” he said.
The area has proved to be a great place for local businesses as well, according to David Silverman, executive director and curator of the National Pinball Museum. While some customers seek out the museum specifically, the attraction’s location in The Shoppes at Georgetown Park has helped the museum gain foot traffic as well.
“It’s probably one of the best locations I could have moved to,” Silverman said of the Georgetown neighborhood.

Who knew the alphabetical order that students line up in during their early years may affect the way they make decisions for the rest of their lives?
According to a paper recently released by the Journal of Consumer Research, the first letter of an individual’s last name may have a significant effect on how quickly they react to various opportunities. Kurt Carlson an assistant professor in the McDonough School of Business, and Jacqueline Conard of Belmont University collaborated to write “The Last Name Effect: How Last Name Influences Acquisition Timing,” a paper published online this month, which shows a correlation between a person’s last name and their response time when offered something they desire.
On average, people with a surname that falls later on an alphabetical list consistently respond to opportunity more quickly than those whose name begins with a letter coming earlier in the alphabet. Carlson became interested in doing research on the “last name effect,” as he and Conard dubbed this phenomenon, when he noticed an odd pattern while tracking the job placements of marketing doctorate degree candidates. When looking at two annual surveys that announced the names of people reporting job placement, Carlson saw that the second survey, released a month later than the first, had far more names added that began with a letter early in the alphabet.
When he observed a similar pattern the next year, Carlson decided the pattern was probably not a coincidence. “Any time I see data that doesn’t make sense, I think to myself there must be a rule governing it, or it’s just a fantastic coincidence,” Carlson said.
Carlson and Conard conducted a number of studies designed to compare how quickly people responded to offers based on their last name. After each experiment, the amount of time it took people to respond to the offers via email was recorded. Carlson and Conard found that when the alphabet was divided into thirds, people whose surname’s first letter fell in the last third of the alphabet responded the most quickly, followed by people with a surname in the middle third and then by people whose last name began with a letter in the first third.
Carlson believes the trend is a result of the custom of sorting children alphabetically from a young age. Because students whose surnames fall at the end of the alphabet are accustomed to being last, they tend to act on opportunities earlier to correct for the inequity.
“There may be situations where expediency serves you well, and there may be situations where it serves you rather poorly,” Carlson said. “And if you can make your decisions based upon that as opposed to the tendency developed in childhood, I think you would be
better off.”

DANNY FUNT FOR THE HOYASam Potolicchio addresses his class during an event at the National Press Club. Potolicchio recently won the K. Patricia Cross Future Leaders Award.
Former Minnesota governor and rumored presidential hopeful Tim Pawlenty did not mention Sam Potolicchio by name during his remarks last Thursday at the National Press Club.
But when Pawlenty stressed the need for “recruiting the best and the brightest to come into teaching,” the students of Georgetown’s Semester in Washington program could not help but smile in response. After all, their professor, who was seated just a few chairs over, is one of the nation’s rising stars in education.
Potolicchio (COL ’04, GRD ’09, ’11), a visiting assistant professor and doctoral candidate in the government department, was recently named a recipient of the K. Patricia Cross Future Leaders Award, an annual honor presented by the Association of American Colleges and Universities. Each year, only eight people across the country receive the award, which recognizes graduate students who “represent the finest in the new generation of faculty who will teach and lead higher education in the next decades,” according to AAC&U President Carol Geary Schneider in the letter announcing the award.
Professor Bradley Blakeman, who teaches the Semester in Washington along with Potolicchio, referred to his colleague’s accomplishments as “incredible.”
“[The Cross Award is] not only an honor for him personally and professionally, but for Georgetown,” Blakeman said.
Ad:
Potolicchio’s interest in education did not begin in the classroom. As a freshman at Georgetown, Potolicchio coached a basketball team at the local Boys and Girls Club and made it his mission to integrate kids in a city he saw as filled with inequities.
He then moved on to the world of formal education during his time at Harvard. As a graduate student there, he obtained the necessary credentials and began teaching at a public high school in Boston.
Professor Clyde Wilcox, Potolicchio’s mentor in the government department and his co-author on many book chapters, affirms Potolicchio’s commitment to education.
“Sam Potolicchio is the best teacher I have ever seen,” Wilcox said. “In 25 years of teaching at Georgetown I have never seen a student more significantly dedicated to teaching.”
In addition to his work at Georgetown, Potolicchio currently teaches fifth-grade Latin and works as an admissions official at the Landon School, his former high school, located in Bethesda, Md. He has encouraged former players from the Boys and Girls Club team to enroll there, transforming the boys’ school into a local basketball powerhouse.
Potolicchio considers coaching the after-school sport to be an important component of his life as an educator.
“To really know a student, you need to know the student inside the classroom and outside the classroom,” he said. “I really don’t separate the coaching from the teaching, because for me it’s the same activity.”
He returned to coach the Boys and Girls Club team, the “Jelleff Hoyas,” in 2006. In total, the team has compiled six undefeated championship seasons under Potolicchio’s tutelage.
Joseph Graziano (COL ’07) was an assistant coach on Potolicchio’s club team while the latter was at Georgetown.
“We had this player who was far and away the best player and athlete in the league,” Graziano recalled. “And he had the ego to go with it. No one could reach him. In the first practice I watched Sam play defense against this kid as hard as he possibly could and do a little trash talking along the way.”
That practice was tense, but ended with a hug. “The young man is now a star at Damatha with scholarship options all over the country,” Graziano said. “And I saw Sam change his life in one practice. It was amazing stuff.”
Off the court, Potolicchio is also a teaching fellow for The American Institute of Political and Economic Systems in D.C. He was teaching in the Czech Republic when Kosovo’s declaration of independence was validated. One memory in particular stands out to him.
“The Serbians were heartbroken by the decision that they thought was very unfair, and for the Kosovar students it was one of the best things that had ever happened in their lives,” he said. “Literally 20 minutes after that happened, I went with eight of my students to go play soccer, and I purposely put a Kosovar and Serbian student on the same team, and they had the best teamwork together … [after one goal] they gave each other this huge high five, and I was like, ‘You can’t write this stuff.'”
But Potolicchio’s influence also hits closer to home. He has taught several government courses focusing on religion and communications in politics at Georgetown and has also served as a teaching assistant. He is a three-time Teacher of the Year at the university. On the popular website RateMyProfessors, Potolicchio has an overall quality rating of 4.9 out of 5.
Ryan Dougherty (COL ’11), a captain on the men’s basketball team, took Potolicchio’s Presidential Rhetoric course last semester.
“Sam had a really great way of teaching, and I think the best part of his class is that he uses analogies that anyone can understand,” Dougherty said. “He really brings the material down to its most basic elements, removing the clutter that kind of muddles the ability of a lot of undergrads to see the real picture.”
With all of his accolades in higher education, one might consider Potolicchio overqualified to teach fifth graders. But according to Potolicchio, it fits right into his method.
“My philosophy is that to be a good educator, you have to be involved in many different points in the educational system to really have that deep knowledge,” Potolicchio said.
“Teaching fifth grade also really gets me energized. There is a different kind of energy in a fifth grade Latin classroom where you have these boys jumping up and down,” he added. “I’m not going to walk into a Presidential Rhetoric classroom and get hugged and tackled by these students since they have a different kind of energy. Having these different types of passions in different areas is incredibly invigorating.”
Potolicchio’s trademark energy is not only intellectual, but perhaps biological as well. He admitted that he needs only one to three hours of sleep a night. With so many accomplishments arriving at such a rapid pace, Potolicchio could probably write his own ticket, but he remains attached to Georgetown.
“It’s the Jesuit philosophy of someone for others,” Potolicchio explained. “I think it’s how I want to live my life. I wanted to be a priest because I want to serve others, I briefly thought about public service because I want to serve others and I’m a teacher now because I think this could be my calling in really helping people.”

Correction: This article originally stated that Potolicchio taught in Kosovo as part of The American Institute of Political and Economic Systems. He actually taught in the Czech Republic.

A record high of 19,300 students have applied for admission to Georgetown’s Class of 2015, signaling a 6.8 percent jump from last year’s 18,070 applicants, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon.
Deacon said in an interview with The Hoya that the increase largely reflects a higher number of black and Latino students submitting applications. Overall, the percentage of non-white applicants was about 45 percent.
“The largest part of the increase is coming from students of color [and] underrepresented minorities in particular,” Deacon said.
Deacon’s office saw applications from blacks spike by over 25 percent in both the early and regular application cycles this year. The number of Latino students applying jumped even more, going up by about 34 percent.
According to Deacon, the demographic changes may be attributed to recent university efforts to diversify the applicant pool, but he added that the allure of a college degree was probably the main reason for the jump.
“You need to get a college degree to compete in this world. Beyond that, a college degree from really elite schools probably is even more of an advantage,” Deacon said. “I think there’s been a big push now for a number of years to try to include underrepresented minority students into the pool. And I think that’s not just Georgetown.”
This increase in minority students might place added strain on the university’s budget, however, as it may result in more financial aid requests, Deacon said. Georgetown’s admissions process is completely need-blind, so the budget would have to expand to accommodate an incoming freshman class with greater need. The yield could reflect the university’s ability to meet the full demonstrated financial need of students, as other schools could offer more competitive financial aid packages to minority students.
Financial concerns aside, Deacon said he was excited by the makeup of the applicant pool.
“We’re very happy with what this year looks like,” he said.
A rise in applications from California, Florida and Georgia — states with growing minority populations — may partially account for the shifting demographic nature of the applicant pool as well, Deacon said.
Other contributing factors include an increase in public school applicants, from 52 percent of the applicant pool eight years ago to about 61 percent this year.
The SAT scores of prospective students appear to be slightly lower than last year’s, according to Deacon, a trend which was probably due to the lower average standardized test scores of minority students. Average class rank remains steady in the 91st percentile, identical to last year’s pool, Deacon said.
Across undergraduate schools, the McDonough School of Business saw the greatest increase in applications, with 3,000 applicants compared to last year’s 2,500. The School of Nursing and Health Studies had its largest applicant pool ever, with close to 1,200 students applying. These increases may reflect students’ growing desire to graduate with more career-oriented degrees, according to Deacon.
The School of Foreign Service saw a pool of almost 3,400 applicants, up about 4 percent from 3243 applications last year; the College had about 12,000 hopefuls — a 5 percent increase in applications.
It is unclear though, whether there are really more individual students applying to elite schools, Deacon said. Each student may simply be applying to more schools because acceptance rates are dropping across the board. Stanford University’s acceptance rate dropped from 7.6 percent to 7.2 percent between 2009 and 2010, and Princeton University’s rate dropped from 9.4 percent to 8.2 percent, according to the Yale Daily News.
The percentage of accepted students will likely go down from last year’s 20 percent to around 18 percent this year because of both the higher number of applicants and an enrollment cap setting the incoming freshman class at around 1,580 students due to pressures from the neighborhood, Deacon said. The early admissions rate was just under 17 percent last fall.

Mourners at Holy Trinity Church remembered the life of R. Sargent Shriver on Friday, who died Tuesday in Maryland at the age of 95.
Shriver, a Peace Corps founder and former university commencement speaker with several personal ties to Georgetown, devoted his life to addressing issues of poverty and inequality in an effort to serve his country.
In 1964, Shriver gave a commencement address at Georgetown in which he emphasized students’ obligation to serve those less fortunate than themselves.
“This program of university service is rather the extension of education, the broadening of education, the deepening of education, which we must have if we are to find our way … into our full responsibilities of human beings,” he said.
“This is a special call to all those colleges and universities like Georgetown which stand in the shadow of the cross. For this war against poverty is America’s holy war, and if you who represent Catholic education in America fail to respond, you will deeply wrong yourselves, your country and your faith.”
Shriver received an honorary degree from the Law Center after delivering the address. In a statement released on Friday, University President John J. DeGioia praised Shriver’s legacy.
“His longstanding commitment to public service, through development of the Peace Corps, and to meeting the needs of the disenfranchised through his efforts to combat poverty improved the lives of individuals and communities around the world,” DeGioia said. “His determination and dedication to improving the lives of others will live on in the organizations he started and the many individuals he has inspired. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this time.”
Shriver is survived by his five children, including Maria (CAS ’77), former ABC News anchor and California first lady, as well as Anthony (COL ’88), who founded the Best Buddies program after his time at Georgetown. Shriver is also remembered by 19 grandchildren, including current student Christina Schwarzenegger (COL ’13).
After graduating from Yale Law School in 1941, Shriver enlisted in the Navy in spite of his initial opposition to World War II. He married Eunice Kennedy in 1953 after a seven-year courtship and worked at her father’s business, JPK Enterprises.
In 1960, Shriver joined John F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign team and later founded the Peace Corps at the President’s request. He subsequently served as director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, an agency that was at the heart of President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty.
He helped to found the Special Olympics with his wife in 1968, ran for vice president in 1972 on George McGovern’s ticket and in 1994 he received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton.
His wake was held from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Holy Trinity Church Friday and was open to the public.

Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, an American-Muslim leader at the forefront of debate over construction of a Muslim community center near Ground Zero, will visit the Hilltop this spring to address controversy.
Rauf, one of the most influential Muslim leaders in the United States, became one of the public faces of the nonprofit group Park51 after the organization announced its controversial plan to build an Islamic community center near the site of the World Trade Center. He will be visiting a number of cities and college campuses across the United States to speak about the Cordoba Initiative’s — a group he heads dedicated to improving relations between the West and the Islamic world — mission and advocate for the Park51 center in downtown Manhattan.
“The major purpose [of this tour] is to make people aware of what America means as a country that protects the right to freedom of religion,” Rauf said in a statement given to the Associated Press on Dec. 24.
Rauf’s visit to Georgetown later this spring will not be his first interaction with the university. On Aug. 24, Rauf visited the School of Foreign Service campus in Doha, Qatar, where he spoke about the Park51 building plans and the importance of interfaith dialogue and Western-Muslim relations.
Park51 promoted Rauf’s speaking tour in a press release published on Jan. 15. The group stated that they believe the campaign “will have a profound and positive impact on the dialogue between different faiths,” but also added that the Cordoba Initiative, which the imam is making the tour for, is distinct from Park51.
The tour, which began with a visit to Detroit on Jan. 15, will consist of speeches given in several major cities across the country, including Chicago, Washington, D.C., and San Antonio. Rauf will also speak at a number of college campuses besides Georgetown, including Harvard, Yale and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, according to his statement.
Students said that they were excited about the impending visit.
“I actually had the good fortune to meet him,” New York native Sam Haass (SFS ’14) said. “He struck me as a very smart individual who has a great vision for Islam. His whole mission is to build up a moderate branch of Islam to compete with the Wahhabis’ intolerant approach … I think we should support him in whatever way we can.”

With past guests such as Barack Obama, Aretha Franklin, India.Arie and Brian McKnight, it comes as no shock that this year’s annual “Let Freedom Ring” music celebration was packed full to the brim with hopefuls for a free ticket. Hosted by the Kennedy Center and Georgetown University, this year’s commemoration of the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. was surely a success.
Headlined by platinum-selling and Grammy Award-winning artist Patti LaBelle, musical performances were also given by the Let Freedom Ring Choir, a collaboration between singers from Georgetown, the Metropolitan Baptist Church and the Capitol Hill Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Led by Music Director Reverend Nolan Williams Jr., the choir, along with LaBelle, delivered a show stopping performance.
The spirit of the entire celebration was hopeful, optimistic and humble.
Bringing the spirit of the Hilltop to the celebration, Jarvis Matthews (COL ’12) opened the ceremony and delivered the invocation, focusing on the necessity of peace and equality. Matthews spoke of the need for continued support and prayers for those affected by the 2009 earthquakes that destroyed Haiti and claimed an estimated 300,000 lives. Along with those affected in Haiti, Matthews asked for the support and prayers of the victims of the 2011 shootings in Tucson, Ariz. To end his speech, Matthews led the 2,500 members of the audience in the opening prayer.
After Matthews, University President John J. DeGioia presented Joseph Lowery, a prominent figure in the American civil rights movement and an influential American figure alongside his colleague King, with the ninth annual John Thompson Legacy of a Dream Award. Lowery spoke from the heart and added his own humor: “They told me I had all the time I needed,” said Lowery, “as long as I didn’t take over five minutes.”
Lowery spoke of 2009, when he gave President Barack Obama his benediction and reiterated the emerging belief of many Americans. “Those who come in resistance, steeped in hate, dipped in the venom of racial hostility, we come to say ain’t no way. Ain’t no way!” Lowery said. He concluded with his inspirational message of the coming of a new day “when justice will roll down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.”
Following a standing ovation for Lowery came the one-and-only Patti LaBelle. LaBelle’s performance brought the audience to its feet, even causing many to rush to the stage to snap a photo of the glamorous and hardly aging diva. After performing an array of musical numbers, LaBelle was still going strong and was convinced to perform a double encore by the enthusiastic applause. Hitting incredible notes, chatting up the ecstatic audience and even taking off her shoes, LaBelle provided an unforgettable experience. Backed by the choir, the two delivered a powerful performance, filled with messages of love, motivation, hope and freedom. A fitting celebration for the wonderful legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.
