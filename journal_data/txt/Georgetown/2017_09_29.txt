Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced her intent to run for re-election in 2018, pledging to use the capital’s growth to benefit more District residents, especially as the economic gap between white and minority residents grows.
Bowser, who began her term in 2014, announced her decision via her personal Twitter page in a short video Sept. 22.
According to Wesley Williams, public affairs manager for the Office of Campaign Finance, Bowser will face several other candidates. The first filing deadline is Dec. 11, 2017.
“Currently we have six,” Williams said, noting the number of candidates who have already filed for the 2018 mayoral candidacy.
Two candidates challenging Bowser are James Butler (D) and Dustin Canter (I).
The most well-known potential candidate to face Bowser would be former Mayor and current councilmember Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7).
Bowser defeated Gray, then the incumbent mayor, in the 2014 Democratic primary after Gray was implicated in U.S. Attorney Channing D. Phillips’s investigation over alleged campaign finance violations. Although prosecutors never charged Gray in connection to alleged misdoing, the U.S. Attorney’s Office prosecuted a dozen people connected to Gray’s campaign.
Gray has not yet ruled out a run to return to his former office.
“Do you want me to make an announcement?” Gray asked at the Gertrude Stein Democratic Club on Sept. 11. “I haven’t ruled it out. Let’s put it that way.”
Bowser highlighted her commitment to “D.C. Values” in her video and said Washington, D.C., has become more prosperous than it ever before under her leadership.
She also touted the promise of what Washington can still accomplish, imploring voters to re-elect her to sustain the District’s economic and social growth.
“Today, I ask for your support again,” Bowser said in her campaign video. “Washington, D.C., has never before experienced better days, and I know that together, we will see that our best days are yet to come.”
Bowser also listed her various accomplishments, such as pushing for an increase of the minimum wage, investing in affordable housing, implementing a body camera program for Metropolitan Police Department officers and investing heavily in District of Columbia Public Schools.
Bowser emphasized her ability to work with citizens of all backgrounds, noting that her main goal for the future is to grow the city’s middle class.
Bowser has made strides in education, as graduation rates at D.C. public schools have increased by more than three percent since she took office. Enrollment in public and charter schools in the District have seen a similar uptick.
In May 2017, Bowser announced a plan to increase per-pupil spending at D.C. public schools by two percent next year, as well as to introduce a “walkability” measure for D.C. public charter schools to give preference to students who live closer to a charter school than a public school.
“With hard work and commitment to our values and an ability to find common ground, together we are ensuring every resident has a fair shot at a pathway to the middle class,” Bowser said in the video. “We are bringing about progress by investing in education, public safety and affordable housing. We’re promoting and defending D.C. values.”
A poll conducted earlier this year by The Washington Post showed that 67 percent of Washington, D.C. residents supported Bowser, seemingly confirming her front-runner status in the coming mayoral race. However, while 47 percent of respondents somewhat approved of her decisions as mayor. only 20 percent strongly supported them.
Bowser may see heightened criticism concerning allegations of corruption leveled against officials serving in her administration during her re-election campaign. Bowser’s efforts to establish homeless shelters in each of D.C.’s eight wards were sidelined in 2015 after reports emerged that some of the sites to be leased were owned by prominent campaign donors. The mayor later amended the plan to open six shelters across the District.
Furthermore, City Administrator Rashad Young, a Bowser appointee, was accused by D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) in May to have improperly pushed for a roadwork contract to be rewarded to construction company Fort Myer, a company that had donated to Bowser’s election campaign.
Bowser has denied any wrongdoing in these situations, and no malfeasance has been found.
“If that’s a one off, that’s one thing, but who knows if that’s something that happens more frequently,” Cheh said at the time regarding treatment from the mayor’s office of Fort Myer. “If that happens more frequently, then that ought to be looked into.”
Despite these incidents, Bowser will likely be the frontrunner when challengers decide to enter the race. In 2014, Bowser won with about 54 percent of the vote, with her next closest challenger, independent David Catania, a former at-large councilmember, receiving only about 34 percent of the vote.
Bowser said to Fox 5 D.C. in an interview that she was ready to face a primary or general election challenge and, despite her frontrunner status, would not take the race for granted.
Bowser said she would challenge anyone running against her to come up with a better platform for dealing with issues in D.C.
“I’ve be challenged every single time,” Bowser said . “We are going to build our campaign to be ready for any and all challenges. And any challenger, especially one with a record of having been in public office, will also have to say, ‘What have we all done collectively to make sure as our city grows and more Washingtonians can participate in that progress.”
Correction: This article previously stated that federal prosecutors “dropped charges” against Gray in the 2014 campaign finance inquiry. Prosecutors never charged Gray in connection to the case.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended free speech rights on college campuses and condemned protesters who have tried to curtail them at an invitation-only Georgetown University Law Center event Tuesday.
Law students protested the event’s organization for being overly selective after more than 130 students who had registered for the event were restricted from attending it, limiting the audience to students affiliated with the host Center for the Constitution, a Law Center program with the mission of educating students on remaining “faithful” to the Constitution’s text.
Sessions, whose remarks were followed by a question-and-answer session with constitutional law professor and Center for the Constitution Director Randy Barnett, warned that freedom of expression is in “retreat” on college campuses.
“Protesters are now routinely shutting down speeches and debates across the country in an effort to stop the forces that insufficiently conform to their views,” Sessions said. “This is not the great tradition of America.”
Free speech on college campuses has become an issue of national interest following protests at University of California, Berkeley, where student groups invited conservative commentators Milo Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro. Similar incidents have occurred at Middlebury College and California State University, Los Angeles.
Georgetown was also the subject of criticism in 2016 over a Lecture Fund event with speaker Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, due to the university’s history as the oldest Catholic university in the United States.
Sessions contrasted the support some college administrators have shown students who disrupt unpopular speaking events with the efforts of Martin Luther King Jr. in ending segregation through his “unrelenting” words.
To safeguard the rights enshrined in the First Amendment, Sessions said, students must avoid ideological bubbles that stifle debate. Universities are harming that development by becoming “echo chamber[s] of political correctness and homogenous thought, a shelter for fragile egos,” Sessions said.
But students said the event ran contrary to the values it purported to advance given that Sessions only answered pre-selected questions submitted by a limited audience.
In an interview with The Hoya, Lauren Phillips (LAW ’19) said this contrast diminished the speaker’s credibility.
“To those of those who were not allowed to be in the room, it seems an awful lot like the one who had a fragile ego was the attorney general, because he could not stand the thought of having students asking questions that were not pre-screened,” Phillips said.
Students first found out about the event through an Axios report Sunday night, and GULC sent out email invitations Monday morning to a list that included students who signed up for the Center for the Constitution’s email list, 85 students in Barnett’s classes and other faculty. Other students who were not part of that list used the link, which was circulated through social media, to enter the lottery for a seat at the event — the channel  regularly used by GULC to accommodate large audiences for high-profile events.
About five hours after receiving an email congratulating them for winning a place in the auditorium, however, 134 students were told that since they were not part of the event’s initial invitation list, they would not be allowed in Hart Auditorium, which seats 290 in the lower level according to GULC.
Student groups including the Black Law Students Association and Georgetown Law Students for Democratic Reform then wrote a press release announcing a protest against Sessions’ policies and the restricted nature of such a high-profile event.
“We, the disinvited, find it extraordinarily hypocritical that AG Sessions would lecture future attorneys about the importance of free speech on campus while actively excluding the wider student body,” the statement read.
Phillips, who co-authored the release, said students believed the list was carefully crafted to ensure a sympathetic audience, because it was limited to those who had an affiliation “either with this conservative center or this conservative professor.”
In the past, the Center for the Constitution has collaborated with conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society, the Fund for American Studies and the Heritage Foundation. In 2012, Barnett represented the National Federation of Independent Business in its constitutional challenge to former President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act.
GULC spokesperson Tanya Weinberg wrote in an email to The Hoya that it is up to event organizers to determine audience selection and questions.
“What Professor Barnett chose to do was not atypical for high-profile speakers with limited time,” Weinberg wrote. “As was done for Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg’s appearance, for instance, questions were solicited from students in advance and then the interviewer chose ones that were representative of the whole and pertinent to the event.”
Barnett explained that he limited questions to ones concerning free speech, but that there were so few that he had to write some of his own.
“My goal was to give the Attorney General the opportunity to make a public policy address on a topic — free speech on campus — that is at the core of the mission of the Georgetown Center for the Constitution,” Barnett wrote in an email to The Hoya.
An hour before the event, about 150 students and faculty members began to gather by the steps outside the venue. They posed the questions they had prepared for Sessions through a megaphone and later “took a knee,” a symbolic gesture made famous by NFL players during the national anthem at football games as an act of protest against police brutality and racial inequality.
The gesture was criticized by Sessions, who said freedom of speech should not come at the expense of respect for national symbols.
“It is a big mistake to protest in that fashion,” Sessions said. “These players, with all the assets that they have, can express their political views other than, in fact, denigrating the symbols of our nation — our nation that provides the freedom to speak and act.”
After Sessions finished his initial remarks, 10 students who were wearing #BlackLivesMatter shirts inside the auditorium stood up and placed tape over their mouths to silently protest the rest of the event.
Sessions also had a message on free speech for the protesters who were chanting outside the room.
“We will defend your views and the right to express them in appropriate and effective ways,” Sessions said. “I would urge you to understand and think about the very uniqueness of this right that we have.”
The conversation on Sessions’ appearance and free speech is slated to continue this afternoon at 2 p.m., when GULC Dean William Treanor is set to host a communitywide town hall.
“It is part of the mission of a great academic institution that we are able to express our views and engage in a civil debate,” Weinberg wrote. “For that reason, it is important that we come together as a community to talk about these issues.”
Imani Waweru (LAW ’18), the attorney general and spokesperson for the Black Law Students Association, said Sessions’ views were not received by the right individuals and highlighted the contrast between the theory taught and the practice of the law at GULC.
“I wish that a wider community could hear what we had to say, but I guess we didn’t have that luxury,” Waweru said. “When we are in an environment where we are taught about these principles, it only makes sense that we are given the opportunity to express these principles.”

What an embarrassment to Georgetown University to have Jeff Sessions “lecture” on free speech to a “supporters only” audience. Who decided it was a good idea to sponsor a one sided forum on “free speech”? Sessions has been a cowardly enabler of Donald Trump’s racism, xenophobia, hate and divisiveness. Was anyone on your campus listening when Corretta Scott King’s comments about Sessions racist history was shared by Elizabeth Warren? It was heartening to see so many of your students, faculty and staff protest Sessions visit. The Georgetown University administration should be ashamed to have hosted a despicable presentation of hypocrisy!

Sad to see professors, who are paid employees, spending time airing grievances and teaching intolerance for any viewpoint, regardless of how distasteful it is to them instead of teaching. Why not let Sessions arguments stand for themselves and let the jury (audience/student body/court of public opinion decide). Isn’t that what law school and the Socratic method is all about.  What a great teaching moment lost.  Professors should teach more and preach less.

A decade ago, LGBTQ students at Georgetown had few places to turn for support. Before the advent of the LGBTQ Resource Center in 2008, students could only go to informal social networks — usually in secret.
Nine years later, the LGBTQ Resource Center celebrated its anniversary in a panel Wednesday highlighting the campus’s great leaps in LGBTQ inclusion. The panel included current and former university administrators in addition to alumni who were leaders of the Out for Change Campaign, Connor Cory (COL ’10, LAW ’16), Julia Reticker-Flynn (SFS ’08) and Jason Resendez (COL ’08).
Student activists founded the Out for Change Campaign in 2007 after years of discontent in the campus’s LGBTQ community, which came to a head after a Georgetown student was arrested for an alleged homophobic hate crime against a fellow student.
Cory, a former student who was active in the original campaign, said the campus climate for LGBTQ students had been lacking long before the alleged attack. Without on-campus support for LGBTQ students, queer students were forced to form informal support networks of their own.
“Everything was so hush-hush,” Cory said. “A lot of what we did was gather off campus. People just did not feel comfortable being out and open on campus, so we relied a lot on informal networks.”
Reticker-Flynn, another student involved in the original campaign, said LGBTQ students accustomed to limited visibility were skeptical that the university would act — particularly after the university took weeks to publicly announce the incident.
“The skepticism came from the fact that we had spent three weeks in silence. It’s important to remember that that silence showed that it wasn’t clear that the university values LGBT young people,” Reticker-Flynn said.
For LGBTQ students, Resendez said, the university’s underwhelming response felt like a sign of disregard from an institution they valued deeply.
“It was about feeling included and part of a community that, for a lot of us, we invested a lot in Georgetown. I’m a first-generation college student. Georgetown was a lifeline for me and my family,” Resendez said. “So for that institution to turn its back on you, that they didn’t value your public safety and its actions embodied that value, that was traumatic.”
However, Reticker-Flynn said the students were driven by a sense of hope that real, lasting change could finally be achieved.
“I was feeling both a skepticism but also a belief that something bigger was possible,” Reticker-Flynn said. ““There was also this possibility of coming out, and this was something we reiterated during our meetings leading up to the campaign.”
The Out for Change campaign called for the formal creation and staffing of the LGBTQ Resource Center, as well as a more effective security alerts system and other protections for LGBTQ students’ safety on campus.
The campaign garnered over 1,500 signatures, and in October 2007, University President John J. DeGioia agreed to the campaign’s central demand for a resource center in a historic town hall.
DeGioia cited the town hall as a watershed moment in the university’s history, saying the campaign enabled the university to provide better support for its queer students.
“Present in that evening in October and in the work that followed was an extraordinary commitment by our community to build a more inclusive community, and by our shared conviction that we could and should do more to support our LGBTQ community,” DeGioia said. “We are at our very best when we recognize our responsibilities to one another.”
The LGBTQ Resource Center has since expanded to hire two full-time and four part-time student staff members and to host awareness events such as OUTober, a month-long celebration of LGBTQ students, and Lavender Graduation, a ceremony highlighting the contributions of LGBTQ seniors to the Georgetown community.
After receiving a $1 million endowment in 2011 funded by the Vice Chair of the Georgetown Board of Directors Paul Tagliabue and his wife, Chan Tagliabue, the center now funds research on gender and sexuality studies along with its central mission of providing resources for LGBTQ students.
DeGioia said Georgetown’s efforts to serve LGBTQ students continues 10 years after that event.
“While we recognize that there is always more work for us to do, we also recognize that the work we’re able to do today has been made possible by the efforts of those who have come before us and by the moments in time when our community has come together in extraordinary ways to deepen our commitments to one another,” DeGioia said.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson recalled that in the fall of 2007 the university had to make significant changes to ensure the safety of LGBTQ students.
“Very difficult situations made clear that these gradual steps, while they moved us forward a bit, while they were well intentioned, were not the kind of transformative change that we needed to truly be the university we were being called to be,” Olson said.
Former Vice President of Mission and Ministry Fr. Phil Boroughs, S.J., said providing a space for the university to better recognize the needs of students was an important campaign achievement.
“So much of the conversations we need to have as a people on so many topics, but particularly this one, we really don’t start with concepts and ideas, as important as they are to educators,” Boroughs said. “We start with relationships because the context of relationships changes how we think about categories and ideas, and if we objectify people into concepts and ideas that are not based on who they are or how we know them, our conclusions never match the realities we hope for.”
Rosemary Kilkenny, Vice President for Diversity and Equity, said the 1987 District of Columbia Court of Appeals decision in Gay Rights Coalition v. Georgetown University gave students a reason to believe in change. The decision mandated that the university provide “homosexual” groups with the same rights as other campus organizations, citing the D.C. Human Rights Act and the public interest in the “eradication of sexual orientation discrimination.”
“It really gave students a greater sense of purpose and a greater commitment with which they were going to continue to make sure there was complete change and transformation so that their voices could be hard,” Kilkenny said. “They could thrive and they could be as successful as they wanted to be and to be recognized as human beings on this campus like everyone else.”
Resendez, a student involved in the original Out for Change campaign, said both the campaign and university ensured that queer students became a significant part of the Georgetown community as a whole.
“It was about feeling included and part of a community that, for a lot of us, we invested a lot in Georgetown. I’m a first generation college student. Georgetown was a lifeline for me and my family,” Resendez said. “So for that institution to turn its back on you, that they didn’t value your public safety and its actions embodied that value, that was traumatic.”
Resendez said the Out for Change campaign serves as an example for future change.
“The success of the campaign was our ability to draw connections between communities and between identities and between issues,” Resendez said. “That’s the only way forward, especially as we are continuously marginalized, the only way we can advance is to build community.”
Correction: This article previously stated the LGBTQ Resource Center celebrated its tenth anniversary. The center is celebrating the ninth year of its foundation in 2008, while the panel marked the 10-year anniversary of the 2007 Out for Change campaign.

A bill proposing the construction of monuments to honor native Washingtonian women and people of color in each of Washington, D.C.’s eight wards will move forward to a public hearing on Thursday, Oct. 5, taking the next step toward becoming law.
The bill comes after D.C. leaders including Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), Attorney General Karl A. Racine and half the D.C. Council signed a letter Aug. 15 to National Parks Service Acting Director Michael T. Reynolds urging him to remove a confederate stature in Judiciary Square.
The Charles Hamilton Houston and Other Diverse Washingtonians Commemorative Works Amendment Act of 2017 also proposes erecting a statue of Charles Hamilton Houston, a black lawyer and dean of Howard University Law School, who litigated cases dismantling Jim Crow laws pertaining to school segregations and housing covenants, in Ward 5.
Councilmembers Kenyan McDuffie (D–Ward 5) and Robert White, Jr. (D-At Large) introduced the legislation June 27.
“There is no doubt that Houston left an indelible mark on society and inspired generations of lawyers to pursue the cause of freedom and justice for the underprivileged,” McDuffie said in a press release June 27.
McDuffie, who has previously stated his support for the removal of a statue in Judiciary Square honoring Albert Pike, a Confederate general and proponent of slavery and segregation, said the bill contrasts with ongoing debates over the status of memorials to Confederate generals around the country.
“My support to remove Albert Pike’s statue should be contrasted by my effort to erect a statue of Charles Hamilton Houston and other notable women and people of color,” McDuffie wrote in an email to Ward 5 residents Aug. 24.
Protests over the Pike statue erupted in the week following violence in Charlottesville, Va., where a white nationalist rally to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee descended into violence. Three people died in the violence’s aftermath.
White said the bill furthers efforts to highlight unsung heroes in Washington’s history.
“Statues are symbols that recognize great people and deeds throughout our nation’s history. The country is currently having a broad dialogue on the types of images we don’t want displayed in the public square,” White wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In the District, we have an opportunity to highlight and display the positive contributions of the people who made Washington the city that it is today.”
The bill directs the D.C. Commemorative Works Committee, an oversight group that oversees maintenance of statues, memorials and historical sites in the District, to engage community members in each of the seven wards that have not decided on a historical figure to highlight.
A spokesman for McDuffie’s office said the councilmember hopes the bill spurs construction of statues that reflect the racial and social demographics of the city.
The council is awaiting a report from the D.C. Office of Budget and Planning to analyze the financial costs of erecting new monuments, but a spokesman for McDuffie’s office said the councilmember hopes the Commemorative Works Committee is able to absorb the cost into its budget.
White said he hopes college students engage in the council’s process to pass the bill.
“We see evidence from recent events that when students engage our governments in a collective effort, they can force progress,” White wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is important to uncover and tell the forgotten stories of the people of color and women who worked tirelessly to build their communities and make D.C. a city that welcomes all people.”
Currently the bill enjoys support from every councilmember except Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1).
Following the open hearing next week, the bill will move into the markup phase of the council’s legislative process, in which any amendments or adjustments to the legislation will be incorporated, sent back to the Committee of the Whole and voted on by the entire council.
Bowser, who has previously called for the removal of the Pike statue, must sign the bill for it to become law.

Georgetown University administration reaffirmed the university’s commitment to combating incidences of sexual assault and misconduct following the Department of Education’s decision to rescind Obama-era sexual assault investigation policies in a statement Sept. 22.
The department rescinded the 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter on Sexual Violence and the 2014 Questions and Answers on Title IX Sexual Violence. The policies advised schools to use a “more-likely-than-not” standard for adjudicating accusations of sexual assault or misconduct, and laid out appeals process standards for handling cases.
Georgetown’s sexual assault and misconduct policies will remain unchanged while the university awaits the Department of Education’s formal regulations, according to the statement.
“We will continue to focus on education and prevention, support for survivors, and prompt and equitable processes to respond to complaints of sexual misconduct,” the statement reads.
The department argued the “Dear Colleague” letter infringed on the rights of accused students by violating due process, according to the Department of Education’s interim guidance released last Friday while it creates new permanent protocols, which are not expected for several months.
“The 2011 and 2014 guidance documents may have been well-intentioned, but those documents have led to the deprivation of rights for many students — both accused students denied fair process and victims denied an adequate resolution of their complaints,” the letter said.
“This interim guidance will help schools as they work to combat sexual misconduct and will treat all students fairly,” Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said in a Sept. 22 press release. “Schools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on. There will be no more sweeping them under the rug. But the process also must be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes.”
Laura Cutway, Georgetown’s Title IX Coordinator, said the Department of Education’s changes have not affected the office’s procedures for handling sexual misconduct.
“Our current processes, procedures, and resources related to campus sexual violence, including the Sexual Misconduct Task Force recommendations, have not changed,” Cutway wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Cutway also said the changes have not affected the recommendations recently released by the Sexual Misconduct Task Force. Several of the recommendations made by the Sexual Misconduct Task Force are already being enacted, according to Cutway.
Mandatory “Bringing in the Bystander” training for first-years is underway. The Coordinated Community Response Team established to monitor sexual misconduct issues in place of the Task Force had its first meeting Thursday. The university is searching for a new Sexual Assault Specialist to add to the Health Education Services team.
Additionally, the Title IX office itself has created awareness campaigns and now holds office hours to inform students about the Title IX reporting process and how to access resources.
“With these types of efforts, we hope to educate community members on the types of support and resources available through the Office of Title IX Compliance,” Cutway said.
Health Education Services, which provides resources and confidential counseling services for students who have experienced sexual assault, relationship violence or stalking, also remains committed to aiding students, according to Associate Director Jen Luettel Schweer.
“[The policy change] has created much confusion and many questions about the commitment of the federal government to these issues,” Schweer wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We should all also continue to support the good work that Georgetown has already done for survivors around resources, reporting, trauma-informed systems, and education and training for our community.”
DeVos said the department does not yet have a solution to the issue of campus sexual assault, but it will be working to create a new set of guidelines.
“In the coming months, hearing from survivors, campus administrators, parents, students and experts on sexual misconduct will be vital as we work to create a thoughtful rule that will benefit students for years to come,” DeVos said in a press release last Friday. “We also will continue to work with schools and community leaders to better address preventing sexual misconduct through education and early intervention.”
Daria Crawford (COL ’20), Morgan Robinson (NHS ’20) and Kory Stuer (COL ’19), leaders in the Sexual Assault Peer Educator program, wrote that the policy change is “a sign that our government is not serious” about confronting sexual violence.
“These impending changes in policy signal to survivors and activists, who have worked for years to improve the protections offered by Title IX, that their trauma and commitment to ending sexual violence does not matter to this administration,” they wrote in a Sept. 13th op-ed for The Hoya.

The Georgetown University School of Foreign Service will host four former diplomats and politicians this semester as the inaugural class of Centennial Fellows.
Former Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser S. Judeh; former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration Anne C. Richard (SFS ’82); former U.S. Ambassador to India Richard Verma and former Guatemalan magistrate Claudia Escobar will partake in panels and discussions, lend their expertise in classes and interact with Georgetown students.
The fellows will also work directly with SFS students selected as Junior Fellows. The groups of fellows will work together to organize a larger event, potentially a lecture or panel discussion, for the entire Georgetown community.
Richard said she was honored to enter this role at her alma mater and was amused at the prospect of working alongside Judeh, with whom she previously crossed paths as a student and professional.
“We ended up at conferences alongside each other, and I worked with his staff, and he was also very close to my bosses, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry,” Richard said. “So it’s funny that we were both at Georgetown as undergrads in the 1980s, and now we’re both back as Centennial Fellows.”
Executive Director of the SFS Centennial Will Layman said the fellows will contribute diversity and expertise to Georgetown.
“The program is bringing important global practitioners to SFS and Georgetown, inviting them to bring their expertise to the campus and bringing them into contact with students and professors,” Layman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “You can see in this first group of fellows great range in geography, strategic issues and method of engagement, and their passion to interacting with students and the community at large is unmistakable.”
According to Layman and SFS Senior Associate Dean Anthony Arend, the fellows were first nominated by SFS faculty, then reviewed by an Advisory committee of undergraduate and graduate student and faculty representatives. SFS Dean Joel Hellman ultimately selected the final group of fellows.
Layman also said that the Centennial Fellows Program would bolster dialogue on important international issues, further cementing Georgetown as a leading institution.
“The Hilltop has always been a place where the big conversations can take place about the critical global issues,” Layman wrote. “The Centennial Fellows Program brings important voices to campus, amplifying Georgetown’s position as a leader in America’s most important international city.”
The SFS also launched the Junior Centennial Fellows Program in conjunction with the Centennial Fellows, allowing undergraduate and graduate students in the SFS to work on research and events with the fellows.
Arend said the program reflected the ideals upon which the SFS was founded.
“Appropriately enough, as the school celebrates its Centennial, it provides us an opportunity to reimagine how the school should adapt in preparing people for this new world,” Arend said. “In many respects it is the same question that Edmund A. Walsh was proposed in 1919 when the school was being created.”
Arend said that the Centennial Fellows program represents an opportunity to further students’ learning and comprehension of the complex world that lies beyond Georgetown.
“One thing we wish to do in the Centennial is to once again look at the world, a very changing and tumultuous world, and say ‘How can we best prepare people for this uncertain world?’” Arend said. “One way that we do it is bringing in distinguished practitioners of international affairs and provide them opportunities to interact with students, faculty and staff.”
With this in mind, Arend said the fellows’ different trajectories contributes to a larger picture of international affairs and politics.
“Someone like Nasser Judeh had to deal with the whole gamut of foreign affairs issues. Someone like Anne Richard dealing with migration, population and refugees as a focus is also a really critical part of international affairs — especially today,” Arend said. “Claudia Escobar is someone who is dealing with important human rights issues and questions of governance and corruptions, and Ambassador Richard Verma brings not only an understanding of the foreign policy process, but also the understanding of the domestic process whereby foreign policy is made in the US.”
Clare Ogden, program administrator of the Centennial Fellows Program, echoed Arend’s views on the importance of the fellows in helping the school reimagine education on foreign affairs.
“When SFS was founded in 1919, its goal was to address an uncertain, changing world. Today, the world is no less tumultuous and uncertain,” Ogden wrote in an email to The Hoya. “What the Centennial Program hopes to do is bring thinkers and practitioners to help the school re-imagine how Georgetown can best address a changing world and better prepare students and scholars to confront it.”

Trader Joe’s, the California-based grocer, has applied for a license from Washington, D.C.’s Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration for a location in Glover Park.
The application, scheduled for a hearing Nov. 27, cites 2101 Wisconsin Ave. NW as the address. The building, currently empty, was occupied by hotel chain Holiday Inn until 2015. The site is being remodeled into a mixed-use development with 225 apartments and additional space for retail shops, according to UrbanTurf, a blog dedicated to real estate in the District.
The application says the grocery will serve hot and cold meals, including salads, sandwiches, pizza, sushi, baked goods and non-alcoholic beverages, in addition to beer and wine.
The new Trader Joe’s location will neighbor Safeway and Whole Foods Market on Wisconsin Avenue. Whole Foods has been closed for a year due to health inspection concerns and remodeling.
Whole Foods has seen slowing customer traffic and reduced sales over the last year, a problem Ajay Jain, an analyst at Pivotal Research, attributed to grocers like Trader Joe’s, according to CNBC. Whole Foods’s stock prices have fallen over 45 percent since 2015. Jain said retailers like Trader Joe’s and Sprouts Farmers Market offer organic options at lower costs than Whole Foods. Safeway’s stock prices have remained stable since 2015.
The news also comes amid concerns that over 11 percent of the District is now considered a food desert, according to the D.C. Policy Center. A food desert is a geographic area in which the walking distance to a grocery store is more than 0.5 miles, over 40 percent of households have no vehicles available and the median household income is less than 80 percent of the federal poverty level in a family of four.
More than three-quarters of food deserts in the District are located in Wards 7 and 8, the most demographically diverse and economically strapped in the city. In 2016, nearly 70 percent of the city’s grocery stores were in the four wards with D.C.’s highest incomes, including Wards 1, where Georgetown is located, 2, 3 and 6. Ward 7 has two grocery stores as of March, and Ward 8 has just one.
Director of D.C. Hunger Solutions Beverley Wheeler expressed frustration with the lack of food options throughout the District in June.
“We’re not talking about high-end Harris Teeters. We’re talking about reasonable groceries,” Wheeler told The Washington Post. “Can we get those stores east of the river?”

Brightly colored bicycles have been popping up on street corners and curbs around Washington, D.C., in the past week, as various companies like Spin, LimeBike and JUMP have rolled out new dockless bike-share programs.
Unlike other bike-share programs that require users to leave bikes at designated docks, these bikes are tracked by GPS and can be left nearly anywhere in the city after each use.
Among the companies to unveil this new program is China-based company Mobike. D.C. is the first city in the United States where Mobike has introduced this program.
“We are thrilled to call Washington D.C. Mobike’s first home in North America,” Mobike CEO Hu Weiwei said in a press release. “We look forward to working with more cities across the nation to make cycling the most convenient, affordable, and environmentally friendly transportation option for residents and tourists alike.”
The bikes were modified to best fit the needs of D.C. cyclists, with several gears added and the shape of the bikes altered. One key component is the bikes’ built-in GPS functions that serve as a theft-prevention device, in addition to making it convenient for users to track the location of the bicycles.
In order to use the bikes, users must scan a QR code from the Mobike app, unlocking the front wheel. In order to return the bike, users simply slide a lever to lock the bike after parking it at an appropriate location.
Mobike and other dockless bike-share programs offer an alternative to Capital Bikeshare, a bike-sharing program with docking stations located around the city, including one outside the front gates of the university. Renting a Capital Bikeshare bike costs $2 for 30 minutes, compared to $1.50 for 30 minutes for a Mobike bike. However, if users park their Mobike bikes incorrectly, fines could reach up to $100 per half hour.
Some D.C. residents are excited about the prospect of a dockless bike program. Lainey Giles (COL ’20) said that she has used Capital Bikeshare on warm days to get around the city, but had trouble finding a location to dock the bikes.
“What was frustrating about it was it was very difficult to find a place to return them. My friends and I tried several different stations and they were all full with people backed up, waiting to return bikes,” Giles said.
Giles said that she would be more likely to use bikes as a means of transportation if she did not have to worry about finding a place to dock them.
“I know that right now I would be hesitant to use Capital Bikeshare again, especially on a day when I thought that it would be really heavily used. But if I knew that I would have a place where I could definitely return it, I would be much more likely to use it again,” Giles said. “I think that if this new system works, it’s really promising and I think that it would be a really exciting change.”
Mobike has said that they hope to expand their U.S. presence beyond D.C. in the future.
“We are working with a number of cities across the country and are confident this successful pilot will be the first of many partnerships, allowing us to make cycling the most convenient and affordable choice for transportation all around America,” Mobike U.S. General Manager Rachel Song said in a press release.

Income inequality broadened between white residents and residents of color in Washington, D.C., in 2016, according to data from the United States Census Bureau’s 2016 American Community Survey.
The survey, which tracks quality of life metrics like diversity and commuting length, found the median annual income of the average black resident of the District is $37,891, just 30 percent of the median white income at $127,369. The median annual income of black and Hispanic Washingtonians each decreased by over $4,000 between 2014 and 2016 while white incomes increased by over $2,000 in the same amount of time.
The data points to racial disparities in poverty levels. The overall poverty rate in the District is 18.6 percent, and the poverty rate for black Washingtonians was 28 percent in 2016. Though the Hispanic poverty rate was below the District’s average rate at 17.8 percent, that rate has risen from 11.6 percent in 2015. White poverty rates only grew .03 percentage points between 2015 and 2016.
The racial disparities in the data reflect issues at the forefront of District leaders’ policy agenda. District Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) launched an economic strategy in March to address racial economic disparities in the District. The program is designed to increase local private sector gross domestic product by 20 percent by 2021 and ensure that all wards and demographic groups in the District see an unemployment rate below 10 percent.
“I am proud to share our new economic strategy, one that reflects DC’s values and helps ensure all Washingtonians share in our continued prosperity,” Bowser wrote in a press release on March 7. “Every day, we are showcasing how Washington, DC’s diverse and innovative community is driving our economy. I am confident that this framework will accelerate our progress as a leader for inclusive prosperity by creating opportunities that are accessible to all, supporting longtime businesses and residents, and benefitting our most disadvantaged communities.”
Claire Zippel, a policy analyst at the District Fiscal Policy Institute, said the census data demonstrates a need for policymakers to address income disparities across the District.
“In the face of a strong economy, these widening disparities show how far DC has to go toward breaking down the barriers to economic opportunity faced by people of color,” Zippel said in a Sept. 14 press release.
Casey Goldvale, a policy analyst at the Georgetown University Law Center’s Center on Poverty and Inequality, said the racial disparities present in the data point to broader economic issues in the District.
“To many of the researchers studying domestic poverty and inequality, the racial disparities in the recent Census Bureau data release are further evidence that the Great Recession disproportionately hurt people of color,” Goldvale wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The drop in wages for African Americans started earlier and was even greater in magnitude than for non-Hispanic Whites, and now the recovery is slower.”
District leaders should focus on expanding affordable housing and investing in economic literacy programs and safeguards, Goldvale said.
“As the disparate impacts of the recession show, poverty and economic prosperity are both heavily influenced by housing and wealth,” Goldvale wrote. “To help households who have already weathered economic storms, we should establish clear avenues for building and rebuilding credit and provide and advertise alternate forms of asset-building that can give households with little existing capital the opportunity to reduce risk and securely accumulate enough for an economically secure future.”
Goldvale added that policymakers should also engage in employment and wage regulation to increase incomes for all Washingtonians.
“To reduce wage gaps, raising the minimum wage to at least a living wage is essential. Further establishment and enforcement of strategies to equalize pay across racial, ethnic, and gendered lines is also important,” Goldvale wrote.
Nevertheless, the data reveals expanding economic opportunities for District residents overall. Between 2007 and 2017, the District’s overall median income grew from $63,000 to $76,000, an approximately 20 percent increase. Additionally, total personal incomes grew almost 3 percent between 2015 and 2016 and resident employment rates were up 2 percent over the same time period.
[…] confirmed by several studies, including reports by The Hoya, income inequality in the District is deeply influenced by race, with black residents […]

A renter in Washington, D.C. could lose over $8,000 a year in rent and utilities due to inflated housing costs, a recent study of renting habits found.
The study, conducted by National Equity Atlas, estimated rent and utilities should cost up to 30 percent of renters’ salary each year. However, the study found 48 percent of renters actually paid more of their salary on rent, meaning renters had less money to spend in their communities.
The study’s results varied depending on a city’s affordability and cost of living. Though an average resident of Washington, D.C. would save $8,600 a year if they only paid 30 percent of their salary on rent, renters in El Paso, Texas would only save $4,000. The average annual savings in cities in the U.S. would be $6,200.
Angela Glover Blackwell, CEO of PolicyLink, a parent company of National Equity Atlas, said high rents charged in different cities are costing the United States’ economy billions of dollars in money that could be spent elsewhere, such as on food or household expenses. The National Equity Atlas’ report stated renters nationwide pay $124 billion too much for housing in total.
“The data is abundantly clear,” Blackwell wrote in a press release on Sept. 12. “Renters are the lifeblood of cities. If rents were affordable, renters could meet their basic needs like transportation, food, and child care and contribute even more to thriving communities. This would have a positive ripple effect throughout their regions.”
According to a study done by GOBankingRates, the median rent in the District is $2,271 a month, with utilities costing renters $123.68 a month during their rental period. These prices are offset by lower costs of transportation compared to other cities, but D.C. still had the fourth highest rent of any city surveyed.
GOBankingRates also found in a similar study that an annual household earning of $80,273 was needed to live “comfortably” in the District due to the city’s high cost of living. However, the median income of $70,848 fell short of that mark, meaning many lower-income residents are forced to go without basic necessities and cannot increase their savings.
“You don’t need to be rich in order to live comfortably — but you do need to make a certain amount of money,” the report said. “The key is to earn enough to cover the cost of your necessities, pay for non-essentials and build your savings.”
Complicating the problem of affordable housing is the fact that more people than ever are being forced to rent instead of buy a home. According to a Pew Research Center analysis, there are more than 43 million renters nationwide, translating to over 36 percent of households renting their home — the largest percentage since 1965.
Most renters do so because they are unable to purchase a home.
“About two-thirds of renters in the same survey (65%) said they currently rent as a result of circumstances, compared with 32% who said they rent as a matter of choice,” the Pew study read. “When asked about the specific reasons why they rent, a majority of renters, especially nonwhites, cited financial reasons.”
Affordability for renters in D.C. could also be a problem in attracting and keeping new residents. A recent study by Apartment List, an online database that helps renters find apartments in their area, found that 77 percent of D.C. renters plan to eventually leave the city, with over half of those planning to leave citing high rents as their primary objection.
“[Y]oung, educated workers flock to these expensive metros to work for a few years after college or graduate school, but don’t plan to settle down permanently,” the study read. “Additionally, the rising cost of living may be putting additional pressure on renters to move out of coastal metros, such as Washington, D.C.”
The study also found that renters from other cities are looking to move to the D.C. area due to abundant job opportunities. The city gained over 10,000 new residents last year, according to Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) office.

More than 30 percent of students voted in yesterday’s Georgetown University Student Association senate elections, an increase from last fall’s 5.63 percent rate and a historically high turnout for the typically low-key competition.
Fall GUSA elections rarely attract more than a quarter of the student population, particularly in the fall when no presidential candidates are on the ballot, according to GUSA Election Commissioner Grady Willard (SFS ’18). Turnout soared in areas of campus populated by sophomores, juniors and seniors, as well as off campus. Turnout was slightly down overall among freshmen.
The slate of senators-elect for the 2016-2017 school year also appears more diverse than past sessions with regard to race, ethnicity, sex and gender identity. The diverse candidate pool fulfills efforts by GUSA leadership to make the student organization more reflective of the student body.
Willard attributed the increased engagement among upperclassmen to efforts by GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’18) and Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’19) encouraging more students to get involved. There also were no uncontested seats, a common problem in recent years.
Turnout reaches 30% in GUSA Senate elections. Must be a record.

The senators-elect will be sworn into their positions in a formal ceremony Sunday at 6 p.m.
This article will be updated when full election results have been released.
