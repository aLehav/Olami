After years of wearing gray and bleeding blue, Georgetown is implementing new efforts to think green.
Last Thursday, University President John J. DeGioiaannounced that a $20 million anonymous donation to the Georgetown’s capital campaign will be used to formally launch the Georgetown Environmental Initiative. The initiative, which will facilitate interdisciplinary environmental research by faculty at all three of Georgetown’s campuses and create an administrative center to expand environmental research, comes at a time when several environmentally oriented groups on campus — led by both students and administrators — are also focusing on making Georgetown more sustainable.
The ongoing conversation about the environment at Georgetown is rooted in DeGioia’s 2008 pledge to reduce university greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent of their 2005 levels by 2020. Since the pledge, Georgetown has already seen improvement; Greenhouse gas emissions dropped by about 17.5 percent during the 2010-2011 school year alone.
Unlike many peer institutions, including Johns Hopkins University and The George Washington University, Georgetown has not issued a formal plan that lays out concrete strategies and goals for sustainability initiatives.
Instead, the university is following recommendations outlined in last year’s Visions for a Sustainable Georgetown study, which looked into the ways the university could become more sustainable in the immediate and long-term future.
The study, prepared for a Hoya Roundtable on sustainability in spring 2012, was conceived at the Visions for a Sustainable Georgetown workshop last fall, in which 50 Georgetown students and administrators met in small focus groups to discuss possible solutions to Georgetown’s sustainability issues.
Many of the solutions recommended by the study have already been implemented.
The recommendation to reduce the amount of Grab ’n’ Go packaging resulted in the new “baggie” system and the provision of reusable water bottles by the dining hall for all students on a meal plan. Additionally, water bottle fill stations have been added to high-traffic areas of campus, such as Sellinger Lounge and the third floor of Lauinger Library.
The majority of New Student Orientation announcements have also gone paperless, and Georgetown University Transportation Shuttles now run on biodiesel fuel.
Student groups have been pivotal to the success of many of these initiatives.
Georgetown University Student Association employed its own subcommittee on sustainability, in addition to working closely with other student groups, including EcoAction, Students of Georgetown Inc., GU Farmer’s Market, Outdoor Education and Georgetown Energy, to move its environmental agenda forward.
Georgetown Energy, a student-run non-profit group independent of the university, worked with GUSA last year on Student Activities Fee Endowment reform, part of which provided $250,000 for the installation of solar panels on 43 off-campus townhouses.
The panels, the installment of which was delayed due to legal complications, will debut in early December on the roofs of seven off-campus townhouses.
“There were contract details with the university and [supplier] SolarCity that had to be resolved,” Dan Mathis (SFS ’13), executive board member of Georgetown Energy, said. “We were negotiating minute details regarding rights to the panels and to the rooftops. … SolarCity is publicly traded, so any changes have to be approved by all of their traders, and we were trying to be compliant with what the university wants. It was a back-and-forth.”
Meanwhile, construction of panels on 36 additional townhouses has been delayed indefinitely by the university, partly because of the structure of the houses.
“The way the solar panels fitting works, there is a new clamp that fits on the seams of the roof. This only works with certain types of roofs. The houses we are outfitting had those types of roofs. If you don’t have that type, you must drill into the roof for a mount. The other houses either had older roofs where drilling would cause major damage, the roofs couldn’t bear the load or the data wasn’t known on the roof material,” Mathis said.
Instead, the $200,000 set aside for the remaining 36 townhouses will be channeled into the newly created Green Revolving Loan Fund, operated by the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, to give grants to students with environmentally conscious ideas.
Mathis considers the installation of solar panels on buildings across campus a long-term goal.
“Because Georgetown is such a huge consumer of power, we get a reduced rate from our energy supplier, Pepco. Unfortunately, this reduced rate is still lower than the rate provided by solar energy, so that’s definitely something we’re working on,” Mathis said.
GUSA recently collaborated with EcoAction, an environmental awareness group on campus, to conduct an audit of the university’s recycling processes.
“As we suspected, there is significant lack of labeling for recycling receptacles across campus. However, many of the issues are pretty simple to be fixed and changes are likely to be made,” said Erin Auel (COL ’14), GUSA’s secretary of sustainability.
EcoAction also worked with the Georgetown Conservation Corps to hold their annual recycling drive last weekend.
Meanwhile, Students of Georgetown, Inc.’s Green Team — a committee that aims to improve the university’s sustainability through environmental, social and economic avenues — released its first sustainability report last year. Chief among the report’s recommendations were that The Corp incorporate environmental awareness in employee training, award contracts to vendors based on their environmental record and review its recycling mechanisms.
Since then, both Uncommon Grounds and More Uncommon Grounds have implemented soda siphons for carbonated water, saving about 400 pounds of plastic annually. The Corp is also working to make its payroll system paperless and has begun incorporating sustainability into its training workshops.
According to Green Team Director Katie Courtin (SFS ’13), The Corp is also working on more inventive sustainability initiatives, such as donating coffee grounds to an alum to be composted and used as fertilizer.
“We did trial runs of this last semester and hope to continue the program and implement it fully this year,” she said.
Across the board, environmental groups stressed the need for engaging the Georgetown campus in the importance of sustainability.
“Students are the ones that can drive the administration,” Park said. “If we succeed in cultivating more environmental awareness and activism, I believe that this fervor and persistence will have a greater impact in activating the [administration] and pushing them to make change faster.”
Courtin sees the little changes — like granting a 25-cent discount to customers for bringing in their own mug at Corp coffee locations — as central to creating a more sustainable campus.
“Given that The Corp is so central to campus life, efforts like these become very visible, and I would like to believe they therefore encourage Georgetown students that it’s cool to be environmentally friendly,” Courtin said.
Biology professor Matthew Hamilton, who will be heading up the Georgetown Environmental Initiative, lauded student involvement in sustainability efforts but stressed that faculty have an important role as well.
“I think that students have been leading the charge [for sustainability] through some of the environmental student groups on campus,” Hamilton said. “We as the faculty are looking for ways to engage in some of those same themes and ideas. We … want to develop a curriculum that lets students study in different fields that are relevant to the environment.”
Hamilton added that the initiative has a strategic plan in place to support student scholarships, curriculum development and new majors and minors related to environmental sustainability.
Auel expressed optimism that the $20 million influx will bring a culture of substantive change for environmental issues on campus.
“We hope to work with the administration to identify priority projects that will allow us to move forward on bringing Georgetown up to speed with peer institutions,” she said.
Hamilton added that an environmentally conscious curriculum is of particular importance to Georgetown, as an institution with Jesuit values.
“When we think about environment and sustainability, [they] go hand in hand with Jesuit ideals,” he said. “[They] have us stop and put into context our own lifestyles and choices, how we consume energy and interact with out environment. It’s part of an ethic.”

From breakdancing on the Hoya Break Squad to performing a fusion of Irish and South Asian dance styles on the Irish Step team, there is no shortage of opportunities to dance at Georgetown.
“I love the people, the swag, the style,” Groove Theory member Nancy Hinojos (SFS ’15) said. “Both the dancers and the audience share in the energy, the hype, the adrenaline rush.”
Though the university has no academic programs for dance, it is home to a wide array of student-run dance companies.
Membership in some groups, like Groove Theory and the Georgetown University Dance Company, requires students to undergo a rigorous audition process. Kelly Kimball (NHS ’16) has been dancing for 16 years and was overjoyed to become a part of Groove Theory after more than a week of strenuous auditions
“I absolutely love hip-hop dancing and have been dancing since I was 2, so dance has always been a huge part of my life,” Kimball said. “I knew that dance was something that I definitely wanted to continue in college.”
But not all groups require such dance expertise. Jacob Arber (SFS ’14) had never danced before coming to the Hilltop and joined the Georgetown University Ballroom Dance Team on a whim. Now, he’s the group’s president.
“I first became involved because I thought ballroom would be a fun and unique activity to try out,” he said. “I’d never danced before and wanted to learn how since I think it’s a useful skill”
Members’ reasons for joining dance groups are as diverse as their backgrounds.
“Many of the members in the Hoya Break Squad join because they want to explore a uniquely dynamic culture that is a blend of physical skill, musicality and individuality,” Hoya Break Squad member Davisson Han (MSB ’13) said. “Others come to hang out with their friends and learn cool moves to show off at parties. Whatever the reason, our end goal is to have a good time doing what we do.”
Although some members are involved in competitions, Han said that the squad, which is composed of nine performing members, promotes breakdancing culture in a welcoming environment.
“Simply put, we’re here to dance,” Han said.
Black Movements Dance Theatre has a similar attitude toward recruitment, with a focus on dedication and passion.
“We move with our bodies but dance with our souls,” said Bernadette Nelson (SFS ’14), co-director and publicity coordinator for BMDT. “We want to find members whose passion for dance is reflected by how they move.”
BMDT is a noncompetitive group that seeks to portray the cultural and ethnic diversity of the Georgetown community by expressing black traditions, values and experiences, according to Nelson. The group incorporates performances by spoken-word artists Vivian Ojo (SFS ’14) and Toby Campion(COL ’13).
While BMDT has had a strong presence at Georgetown for over 30 years, new dance groups have emerged on campus in recent years. Currently in its third semester, Dynami, the Greek dance troupe, has showcased the talents of its 16 members. The group was featured in an episode of D.C. Cupcakes on The Learning Channel and has performed at the French and Greek embassies.
Dynami member Andrew Theodotou (MSB ’14) said that the group has doubled its membership this year and has benefited from funding secured by the Student Activities Commission.
“Initially, we only had eight members and no funding or costumes,” he said. “SAC has been very accommodating to fund our costume purchases and travel expenses. It’s opened up some excellent opportunities for us since we can perform for free.”
But Dynami still lacks the resources to participate in competitions — a problem that Theodotou said puts a damper on growth.
“We don’t have the resources to achieve such authenticity as would be required to be successful at competitions,” Theodotou said. “But our group is far more motivated by camaraderie and personal expression than just the idea of winning a competition.”
Theodotou added that increasing practice space availability would help smaller groups expand their on-campus presence.
Irish Step Team member Catherine Razeto (COL ’13) agreed.
“Irish dancing is supposed to be done on hardwood floors, but that is not available to us on campus,”Razeto said.
The team currently shares space with other dance groups at Riverside Lounge, which houses dance practice areas.
Rangila, an annual cultural show and fundraiser for the Asha Kendra Hope Center in India, is perhaps the university’s biggest showcase of campus talent. More than 400 dancers appeared in Rangila last year, and participating groups ranged from the Irish Step Team to GU Jawani.
Theodotou said he sees room to expand on events like Rangila.
“We should have a single event dedicated entirely to cultural performing groups of all varieties,”Theodotou said. “An event like this would give year-round groups the opportunity to perform side by side.”
But for members of the Hoya Break Squad, raising awareness is a simple matter of holding practices in public.
“For Georgetown as a community, I believe that the best way to promote a group is to show what it’s about when people aren’t expecting it. When something spontaneous happens, people might discover they’re interested,” Han said.

Regulars at Corp locations could be earning loyalty points through a new customer rewards card as early as this spring.
The program, which will be called “Shareholder Card,” was developed by Students of Georgetown, Inc. Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Vidur Khatri (MSB ’14).
Khatri put the plan in place soon after his term as CFO and treasurer began March 2012.
“We turn[ed] 40 in March, and other companies who have been around for 40 years usually give some sort of dividend to their shareholders,” he said. “Since Georgetown students are our shareholders, this is our way of giving back, besides the $75,000 we traditionally give back to the community.”
Though the card is still in the early planning stages, Khatri said he expects that plans will solidify within the next two weeks.
“I envision this card to be something every student already has or can easily sign up for,” Khatri said. “Every student will be able to have one.”
The Corp established an internal committee comprising representatives from its information technology, marketing, finance and business development divisions to assist in the development of the program. The committee has met approximately 12 times since the fall semester began and is in the process of ironing out details.
“We’re trying to decide what kind of card we want to use, what kind of point structure we want and how to have the appropriate rewards program that will be compatible with both grocery and coffee,” Khatri said. “There are just some great ideas that are being hotly contested right now.”
The Corp researched other companies’ customer loyalty cards during the development process and will convene two blind test groups next week to examine the merits of a variety of options under consideration.
“Some have club pricing, point rewards programs. We’re really looking to combine a lot of different things into something that will work best for our campus,” Khatri said. “We want to test brand awareness, usability and our own IT systems. … Especially on the IT side, we want to know exactly how much is possible.”
Khatri added that the new card system will allow The Corp to collect individual consumer data.
“With the card, we can track individual trends. For example, if one customer only shops at Vittles, why doesn’t he go to our coffee locations? Should we increase our promotions to raise awareness that our coffee shops sell things besides just coffee?” he said. “And we can also better serve our students and tailor our promotions and advertisements to them, such as providing more coupons so that Darnall Hall residents will go to Hoya Snaxa.”
Khatri added that students will be offered flexibility in how they can use the benefits attached to their cards.
“Ideally, you can accumulate points and you can either keep the rewards or you can donate the reward points to philanthropy or various organizations,” he said.
Students were receptive to the possibility of a customer loyalty card.
“I really like the idea of a loyalty reward card or a discount card at Corp locations,” Christina Wing (MSB ’16) said. “It’s definitely an incentive to choose Corp locations over other places, since many of the other coffee shops do not have loyalty reward cards.”
Alex Barnes (SFS ’16) also recognized the rationale for the card but said it would not increase his expenditures at Corp locations.
“I think it’s a great idea for the students because The Corp will become a more attractive option for basic grocery shopping,” he said. “I don’t know how much it’ll help The Corp, though, because I don’t intend to spend any more than my $100 Flex Dollars [on Corp products] this semester. … I wouldn’t spend any more money at The Corp under any loyalty card program, but I can see why other students might.”

Although Tuesday’s general election was marked by a surge in student voter turnout and two seats secured by students on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for the first time in 10 years, the remainder of the D.C. political landscape was left mostly unchanged.
Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14) and Craig Cassey (COL ’15) will fill two student seats on ANC 2E, which was expanded to include eight commissioners as a result of recent redistricting.
Prindiville, who ran unopposed in single-member district2E08, will represent Nevils, Alumni Square, Copley Hall,Harbin Hall, Village C East and Henle Village, as well as the two blocks between 36th and 37th Streets and between Prospect and O Streets.
Cassey, who will represent Village C West, New South Hall, Southwest Quadrangle, Village A and the Jesuit Residence, also ran unopposed and won the seat for district 2E04.
Prindiville said he learned of his victory through a friend at about 9:45 p.m. on Tuesday.
“I found out that I won from a friend who texted me the final numbers from the printout tape with vote totals that the Board of Elections posts on the door of the polling place,” he said.
Cassey had to wait longer to hear about his election results and split his night between following the presidential race and checking on his own.
“I spent the first half of the night watching the national results in Sellinger Lounge with the College Democrats and [checking] on the website where they post the ANC results,” he said. “I kept refreshing the page.”
Though the elections were uncontested, voter turnout was higher than in previous years. Prindiville received 61 votes, a number that does not include provisional ballots from voters who registered on Election Day. The total number of votes Prindiville and Cassey received will not be known until the election results have been certified Monday.
Nonetheless, Prindiville’s 61 votes mark a dramatic increase over the nine votes that propelled outgoing student commissioner Jake Sticka (COL ’13), who also ran uncontested, to victory in 2010. Aaron Golds (COL ’11) won an uncontested election with 48 votes in 2008. The last student commissioner to receive as many as Prindiville was Brett Clements (COL ’07), who tallied 96 in 2004.
The increased turnout led to shortages in ballots at the local polling place, forcing many same-day registered voters to cast provisional ballots, according to Prindiville.
“So many voters came to register and vote in my district on Tuesday that the Board of Elections ran out of ballots on two separate occasions,” Prindiville said. “This shows that students care about local politics, and I’m happy that they had the chance to make their voices heard at the polls.”
Prindville attributed the high turnout in part to his own get-out-the vote efforts.
“I was in contact with every single registered voter in my district … sending e-mails, mailing letters and knocking on doors,” he said. “I also stood outside the polls for six hours greeting voters and asking for their support.”
Although Prindiville and Cassey’s elections mark a significant shift for student representation locally, the remainder of the D.C. government looks much the same as it did before Nov. 6.
Incumbent Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) retained the seat she has held in the United States House of Representatives since 1991, winning 89 percent of the vote. With a total of 206,664 votes, Norton defeated challenger Bruce Majors, who received only 6 percent of the vote. However, Norton’s share of the popular vote was lower than in 2008, when she won with 92.3 percent.
Meanwhile, Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans, who has held his seat on the D.C. Council since 1991, ran unchallenged and garnered 97 percent of the vote. Evans’ ward includes Georgetown, and he emerged as a supporter of the university’s neighbors in the battle over the 2010 Campus Plan.
The biggest change in the make-up of the D.C. Council was the removal of independent Councilmember Michael A. Brown in favor of challenger David Grosso (LAW ’01), also an independent. Both ran in the at-large council race, in which the two candidates with the most votes gained seats. Grosso and Brown received 21 percent and 15 percent of the vote, respectively. Both independents fell far behind Democratic incumbent Vincent Orange, who carried 37 percent of the vote in the seven-person race.

Fr. Patrick Rogers, S.J., began gauging student interest for the World Youth Day trip that will take place in July at an information session Wednesday night.
Roughly 10 students attended the session.
“I chose to go to the information session because they talked about it in church, and it sounded like an interesting program that I might want to participate in,” Christina Wind (MSB ’16), a student who attended the information session, said. “I would be applying but … it’s too large of a time commitment, so I can’t apply.”
Georgetown is affiliated with two programs that allow students to travel around the world and learn about social justice, World Youth Day and the Magis Immersion and Justice Program, which are service learning trips for students from Jesuit universities around the world.  This year’s participating Georgetown students will travel to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for both trips, which begin July 12 and end July 28.
It is important for Georgetown students to experience the larger church and to deepen their love for the Ignatian charisma that is already part of Georgetown,” Rogers, the trip coordinator, said.
While Georgetown has not been given an official number of spots for both trips, Rogers said the university should be able to take at least 10 students and two chaperones.
The World Youth Day trip is funded exclusively by donations.  All participants are required to make personal appeals to friends, family and their home parishes in order to fundraise. Rogers said that this year he plans to appeal to university donors, departments and schools to raise money.
“This is a pilgrimage, and as a pilgrimage, we raise the money ourselves, and that means that we have to be dedicated as a group to doing fundraisers,” Rogers said at an information session about the event Wed. “We rely on the generosity of other people.”
World Youth Day takes place once every three years. In 2011, students traveled to Madrid, Spain, and in 2008, they travelled to Sydney, Australia. This year’s World Youth Day was moved a year early to 2013 so it did not interfere with the 2014 World Cup, which is also being held in Rio.
Richard DeMarco (COL ’16), who attended the World Youth Day pilgrimage in 2011 with his high school, said he hopes to go to Brazil with the Georgetown delegation in July.
“I just had such a great experience that I really would love to go again if I’m given a chance,” DeMarcosaid.
DeMarco said his group participated in Catholic masses, which were held in multiple languages every day, an overnight vigil and even saw Pope Benedict XVI.
“The overnight vigil is … where all the people that are there go and spend the whole night … praying in adoration,” DeMarco said. “Being together as a giant Catholic body [is] a real powerful symbol — to realize all these people are here for the same reason as you and you’re all the same in your faith.”
Rogers said that participants will not stay in hotels while on the pilgrimage but will instead live modestly and sleep in gyms with other student travelers.
“When I went with my high school, we stayed in hotels most of the time, but this aspect of it with Georgetown is more like a pilgrimage, and you live on a much lower standard … that almost seems to be a very different view of how we live our life throughout it, so I’m interested to see how that would affect me as well,” DeMarco said.
Rogers chaperoned the past two World Youth Day pilgrimages and will accompany the students to Brazil again this summer.
“My biggest enjoyment and the biggest benefit I’ve gotten is accompanying the wonderful students we’ve had go on these trips,” he said. “And they’ve been all just really beautiful young women and men,” he said. “To be able to share our faith together in that context — I know it’s been life-changing for them, and it’s certainly been life-changing for me, and that’s the blessing that rocks my world. It’s awesome.”

Max Harris (COL ’15) returned to campus this fall hoping to find an internship as a speechwriter in the D.C. area. But when he never got a job offer, he decided to create one of his own, partnering with six other students to form the Georgetown Speechwriting Advisory Group.
GSWAG is a student organization dedicated to writing speeches for university administrators, local politicians and think tanks. Formally founded this October, the club has expanded to include a seven-member executive board and 26 regular members.
The members of the group meet every two weeks. They receive speechwriting requests through the club’s website and the marketing and communications team.
This semester, the club leaders aim to increase awareness about and involvement in the group.
“We just want people to know who we are, what we do, what we can offer,” Harris said.
Harris said GSWAG aims to form partnerships with a wide range of individuals and institutions in the Georgetown and D.C. area. The group does not charge for its services, and GSWAG members are required to sign a confidentiality agreement that says members will not reveal their employers or the content of their speeches.
“We work to ensure that our work and our clients are kept confidential,” Harris said. “Confidentiality is a critical component to our club’s success, so we take it very seriously.”
Although these agreements prevent members from discussing the specifics of their work, Harris said that the group has already written at least one introductory remark for a university administrator and is currently working on another similar project.
According to GSWAG Vice President Will Simons (COL ’16), the group aims to shift its attention beyond the university’s gates soon.
“Off campus is really going to be the main focus going forward,” Simons said. “We really want to target small nonprofits, lobbying firms, county-level politicians and city-level politicians.”
Simons said he is confident that local institutions will be more interested in working with the organization, though none of the members have much formal experience with speechwriting.
“People are interested in using college students,” he said. “We think of it more as a collaboration process than them hiring us. … It’s a learning process throughout while we are working with our clients. We want our clients to receive high-quality work, but we are also going to be learning while we do it.”
Christian Chung (SFS ’15), GSWAG’s director of speechwriting, is one of the few members who can boast formal experience in the field: He interned for Caerus Associates, an international development company, from May 2011 to May 2012 and wrote the CEO’s keynote address for a business conference.
“The first keynote address was challenging and a bit complicated because of the topic and the sensitive nature of characteristics within it, but after working through the drafting process and learning the elements of speechwriting — like writing in the voice of the principal with the audience in mind as opposed to just composing a speech of facts — and after the help of my coworkers in editing, I enjoyed it and continued to work with the CEO to draft remarks and other written products during the rest of my time there,” Chung said.
In order to develop members’ speechwriting abilities, the club is in the process of organizing workshops that will be led by professional speechwriters. According to Harris, the first guest speaker is a speechwriter from the Obama Administration whose name cannot be released because of the confidentiality agreement.
“Guest speakers are a way for our club members to hear about professionals’ past experiences and receive career advice,” Harris wrote in an email. “Writing workshops are more geared toward honing in on specific writing skills and improving our writers’ abilities.
Writing workshops and guest speaker events are open to club members only.
Through the workshops, the club will begin to accomplish its goal of establishing working relationships with Georgetown administrators and off-campus organizations.
“One of the pulls for me, personally, is getting to make all these cool connections,” Simons said.
In addition, Simons indicated that he hoped the Georgetown University Student Association will take advantage of GSWAG’s services.
“We’ve contacted GUSA, and we’re going to try and develop a relationship with them,” Simons said. “We’re hoping that we can write debate prep for them, speeches [and] talking points for senate meetings.”
Simons said that the GUSA members he spoke to about this collaboration were receptive to the idea.
“In terms of speeches, on the rare occasions when anyone in GUSA gives one, they are handled internally,” Jake Sticka (COL ’13), GUSA chief of staff, wrote in an email. “That said, the GUSAexecutive would be happy to work with GSWAG just as it is with any other new and developing group.”
However, former GUSA Deputy Chief of Staff Matthew Stoller (COL ’08) disagreed.
“The day a GUSA presidential candidate or senator enlists a speechwriter for help is the day I burn all my ‘West Wing’ DVDs and cry silently in a corner somewhere,” he said.

Ten students began early planning this year’s Georgetown Day at a meeting Thursday night to avoid the last-minute hiccups that plagued last year’s event.
During the meeting, students shared ideas about food, entertainment and game choices for this year’s Georgetown Day. They also discussed a tentative timeline and stressed the importance of getting a head start on the planning process.
“Part of this ongoing discussion is how the planning process and structure might be improved from previous years,” said Maeve Brody (COL ’14), interim chair for Georgetown Day 2013.
Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), speaker of the Georgetown University Student Association senate, reminded planners of the tensions that arose last April when the university announced that barriers and checkpoints would be set up on the front lawn to limit disruptions from intoxicated students.
Because of students’ negative reactions — anonymous students even created an alternative event to avoid the restrictions — the university did not implement the barriers.
Last year, the event also lacked activities because the committee did not form until one month before the event. According to Tisa, the committee only had 40 days to plan the event.
“You have to reserve performers, face painting and slides in advance, and the earlier you do it, the cheaper it is,” Tisa said. “Because it was so late, [the committee] couldn’t reserve them at a price they could afford. GUSA tried to supplement their funding at the very end, but that wasn’t enough.”
Brody said Thursday’s meeting was a crucial first step in the planning process.
“Ultimately, we hope the general interest meeting will catalyze the formation of a planning committee that includes as many interested members as possible, who will make Georgetown Day 2013 the best yet,” Brody said.
GUSA has also gotten involved in organizing next spring’s Georgetown Day.
Adam Talbot (COL ’12), last year’s GUSA senate speaker, proposed a bill to make Georgetown Day aGUSA event. If the bill had passed, the organization would have used its funds to pay for the event, and in return, students would have been able to give input and share their preferences.
The bill was unsuccessful because it was proposed late in the year, and there was no time to gain support, according to Tisa. However, Tisa said he believes that GUSA will propose some form of similar legislation, either at the end of this semester or early in the spring.
“The senate’s priority is making sure that students have a say over what happens on Georgetown Day. No matter what we have to do to make that happen — whether it’s a GUSA committee or a university committee that GUSA helps moderate,” he said.
The Student Activities Commission is also considering involvement in Georgetown Day planning. Last year, the commission reserved $2,000 from the ad-hoc fund to enable SAC supported clubs to organize events during the day, according to SAC Vice Chair Jennifer Chiang (SFS ’15).
“If they want [SAC] to get involved, we certainly welcome it and will definitely consider it as a commission,” SAC Chair Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14) said.
Tisa said he believes that this advanced planning will lead to a better Georgetown Day.
“I’m thrilled to see that the committee’s starting early, and I think the collaborative effort will produce the desired results,” Tisa said.

A panel inspired by 1960s activist Michael Harrington and his book “The Other America” discussed the progression of issues of activism since Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty Thursday evening.
The event, titled “50 Years After Michael Harrington’s ‘The Other America’: Where is the War on Poverty?” was sponsored by Georgetown’s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor, Metro D.C. Democratic Socialists of America and Dissent Magazine.
The event began with the 1999 film “Today’s Other America: Corporate Power and Inequality,” which showed archival footage of Harrington and interviews with his peers.
His book, which discussed the experiences of the working class and unemployed in America, influenced President Johnson’s 1962 War on Poverty legislation as well as panelist Harold Meyerson, a Washington Post columnist and DSA vice chair, who first saw Harrington speak when he was a student at Columbia University.
“Michael was the most influential person in my life besides my parents,” he said. “He was a prolific speaker.”
Meyerson commented on Harrington’s effect on social leftists in the 1960s and 1970s, especially in his denouncing American capitalism.
“He was concerned with rebuilding the left,” he said. “Capitalists have an accommodation with labor that can easily be undone.”
The other panelist, Heidi Hartmann, a feminist economist and founder of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, focused on the correlation between poverty and gender and the importance of attaining universal benefits in America.
Hartmann said that among children, girls have a slightly higher poverty rate than boys because men are more likely to divorce their wives if the couple has only girls.
“It is not just a gender gap,” she said. “It’s about women being more likely to have and stay with their children.”
Hartman talked about the instability and increased poverty that women face when raising their children alone, relating it to her own experiences being raised by a single mother.
“My mother did not have a stable job because of constant layoffs,” she said. “She was laid off on Christmas Eve once.”
However, both Meyerson and Hartman expressed hope for the future under Obama’s second term.
Meyerson zeroed in on his relief that the presidency had not come under Republican control, especially regarding the economy.
“You hear the Republican Party today — they’re going back to Hoover,” he said. “It took the collapse of Wall Street for others to notice what’s been going on for decades.”
Hartman suggested issues that Obama should tackle in the next four years.
“Welfare is gone. … I would make a plea for universal public policy,” she said.

For the sixth graders at Jefferson Middle School, the world just got a little bigger thanks to a group of Georgetown students involved with the One World Youth Project.
The organization, founded by Jess Rimington (SFS ’09), matches college students with local elementary and middle school students to teach them about global issues and to foster respect for different cultures.
Project managers Brian Potochney (SFS ’15) and AsjedHussain (SFS ’15) currently run Georgetown’s program.
The pair spent the week of July 9 in Kosovo for the OWYP annual Summer Training Conference this past summer learning how to manage and inspire a team of Georgetown students — reffered to as project ambassadors — as they took to the classroom.
“A big part of it was getting to know the people at the other hubs because when you’re working throughout the year over the computer, you don’t really get to have that face-to-face interaction,” Hussain said. “It really makes you invested in the organization.”
Once a week, eight Georgetown students travel to Jefferson Middle School to teach four classes of sixth grade students about local and global perspectives on the cultures of Kosovo, Turkey, Guyana and Pakistan.
Each OWYP lesson consists of two parts: a general lesson about different aspects of American traditions and an exchange activity, which usually includes a video made by the middle school students that portrays a specific aspect of the home country’s culture.
“Last time we did ‘what was your favorite artist or musician,’ so we picked some kids to sing some of it in front of the camera, and we are going to send it over to them [in Guyana],” project ambassador Nilesh Seshadri (COL ’15) said.
The goal of the exchange component is to demonstrate American culture to students at the partner school,and vice versa.
“One of the best things is that a lot of the people who are in these classes … they haven’t really been able to leave D.C., and if they have, it’s not been very far,” Seshadri said. “I think it’s really eye opening for them to see what another culture is like compared to what they actually view of this one city.”
But students’ insularity can sometimes slow down the teaching process.
“In the process of breaking [the material] down for the students, we have to go a little slower, so we don’t always follow the timeline that OWYP gives us,” Project Ambassador Camille Squires (COL ’15) said. “Getting them to understand that Turkey is halfway around the world and is a place — not a food dish — definitely takes time.”
Scheduling conflicts also arose this semester; the sixth grade teachers have to plan their lessons and simultaneously coordinate OWYP classes.
On the other hand, some Georgetown students had to leave the program. This semester alone, the program dropped from 15 to nine members because of commitment conflicts.
Stephanie Zhou (SFS ’15) became a project ambassador last spring but left the program this fall because it conflicted with other extracurriculars.
“I think it’s an excellent program, [but] in terms of curriculum, it is being ironed out,” Zhou said. “What’s unique about it is a lot of the curriculum; how it’s taught is based on how it’s interpreted by the individual peer project ambassadors. That’s really cool, but it also adds to the time commitment for the individuals projects.”
Hussain was not deterred by the decline in membership.
“We over-recruited because we knew that people would drop out,” Hussain said. “It is kind of a big commitment, and people don’t realize that originally.”
Georgetown’s OWYP branch aims to expand the program from six to 15 universities next year in order to begin a partnership with South Africa and India.
Hussain said he also hopes to expand Georgetown’s program to include seventh and eighth grade students. However, accomplishing this goal, will require additional committed project ambassadors.
“It would be like a three-year program. … It’s definitely a long-term goal,” he said.

The authority that manages Washington, D.C., airports was condemned for corrupt contracting and hiring practices in a report released Nov. 1 by the Office of the Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Transportation.
According to the report, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has awarded a disproportionately high number of contacts in an uncompetitive fashion in recent years. The authority failed to facilitate appropriate competition for almost two-thirds of high-value contracts for legal, financial and other services it awarded between January 2009 and June 2011. The inspector general’s report said that these practices lack accountability and are in violation of MWAA’s own Airports Act, which mandates a series of best practices for contracting and hiring processes.
“While the criticisms and issues raised have been unpleasant to hear — and will require hard work to address — we appreciate their interest and guidance, and we know they share our goal of making the airports authority a better organization,” Michael Curto, MWAA chairman, stated at a Nov. 1 news conference.
The MWAA operates both Reagan National and Dulles International Airports, as well as the Dulles Toll Road that links the airport to the city.
In addition, the inspector general’s office found that many new employees did not have appropriate background checks, allowing employees with known criminal offenses to work in management positions for over a year.
The report further criticized the authority for hiring non-student employees as student interns to bypass required screening. Additionally, MWAA Vice President of Human Resources Arl B. Williams was found to have secured top positions for his relatives, including one who failed an MWAA background check.
The report also claims that George R. Ellis, MWAA vice president for information and telecommunications systems, and his staff have received 46 gifts worth a total of $12,000. The report also showed that contractors started working before their contracts were approved at least 17 times in the same period of investigation.
The infractions cited in the report, however, are not new problems for the MWAA. A federal report in March 2002 and an interim report in May 2012 also cited issues with hiring and contracting in the authority.
In addition, The Washington Post reported Oct. 25 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has launched a probe into the authority’s practices related to its oversight of the $5.6 billion Dulles Corridor Rail Project, an addition to the D.C. Metro Network intended to link the airport with the District by 2016.
While the November report acknowledged that MWAA has begun to make progress on the malpractice identified in the May interim report, it stressed that several problems remain outstanding.
Kimberly Gibbs, MWAA assistant media relations manager, emphasized the company’s focus on the current violations rather than how past violations have affected the company.
“We’re focused on the current report and implementing its recommendations,” she said.
Curto added in the press conference that the organization has already begun to address the problems identified in the May interim report.
According to Gibbs, the new initiatives include changes to MWAA’s bylaws, freedom of information policy, travel policy and code of ethics.
“The new policy bars directors and members of their families from being employed by, or having contracts with, the authority during their terms and for two years thereafter. In addition, it expands the financial disclosures to be made annually by directors and employees, strengthens the rules against nepotism, tightens the rules relating to the solicitation and acceptance of gifts and defines the obligations of directors and employees when faced with conflicts of interests,” a Nov. 1 WMAA press release stated.
Gibbs also recognized the impact of the report on public opinion of the authority.
“We will use this report as a tool in expanding and enhancing our work to increase transparency, strengthen governance and build renewed public trust,” she said. “We take all the issues and concerns cited in the report very seriously and will respond to all of the report’s recommendations.”

One of the core values that shapes the work that takes place here at Georgetown is a commitment to doing more, being more and always looking for new ways to improve. The concept of magis informs the highest standards of academic excellence to which we hold ourselves as a community.
This constant pursuit of growth and self-improvement asks us to seek and consider new tools and opportunities to achieve stronger and better outcomes for our students. One such area to explore lies in the opportunities and challenges presented by rapidly evolving technologies.
At Georgetown, we have a long and proud tradition of fostering innovation in the classroom to improve the experience of teaching and learning. For example, through the work of our Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, Georgetown has been recognized as a leader in integrating technology into its classrooms. Soon, members of our community will come together for Georgetown Hackathon, where teams will work to design processes and tools to improve the Georgetown experience through their imagination and creativity. It’s my privilege to support their work and serve as a judge in the competition.
As the landscape of technology in higher education continues to evolve and new tools become available, we remain committed to seizing the opportunities before us in our work to find the most effective ways to enhance the learning experience of our students. A month ago in a university-wide email, I announced our Initiative on Technology-Enhanced Learning, which will support faculty who are interested in incorporating technology into the classroom. The grants made under this initiative — the first of which we will issue early next semester — will help faculty with innovative ideas ranging from introducing technology into single course elements to providing complete course and program redesign.
Our efforts to launch and execute this initiative have been supported and informed by two working groups, which both include faculty and staff from across our campuses as well as undergraduate and graduate students. The opinions of the members of our community involved with the ITEL working group have been instrumental in advancing our efforts.
It’s important to be clear about the aims of our work. Our primary objective, in the spirit of magis, is to strengthen the environment for teaching and for learning on the Hilltop. We need to determine under what circumstances technology may allow us to free more in-class time for students and faculty to engage in deep dialogue leading to richer understanding of material. Through technology, we also can create more opportunities for self-paced student learning. These two examples represent a small portion of the opportunities before us to enhance teaching and learning by integrating technology more fully throughout our campuses. We must also learn the limits of technology in helping us do our work and identify which learning experiences don’t translate well to an online environment.
By sponsoring a set of pilot projects, we will also create new opportunities for assessment. We will evaluate which projects enhance learning and produce stronger student outcomes and which ones don’t work, and we will respond by setting higher standards and expectations for our curricula, ourselves and our students.
It’s important for members of our community to know that we are encouraging these innovations to enhance the experiences of students. No faculty will be forced to participate, and for some courses, adding technology may not be the right choice. We are pursuing broad engagement throughout our community because wider participation will produce better opportunities to share lessons learned and best practices. We will jointly discover the optimal use of technological assistance for learning on the Hilltop to meet the challenge of magis.
This is an exciting time to be at Georgetown.
ROBERT GROVES is the provost of Georgetown University.

I t’s Monday morning, and Zach Ashenfarb (COL ’15) is sitting in a too-small chair in a classroom at Beers Elementary School in Anacostia. Across from him sits Robert, a third grader struggling to complete a worksheet on adjectives.
“He couldn’t even read the instructions, so it was very stressful,” Ashenfarb, a volunteer for D.C. Reads, said. “I finally explained to him what the sheet was about, and when he figured it out, he said, ‘You’re smart,’ and I said, ‘No, you’re smart.’ … I really cherished that moment.”
Ashenfarb is one of nearly 500 Georgetown students who volunteers in classrooms and community centers across the city on a weekly basis through D.C. Reads and the D.C. Schools Project, the university’s two main volunteer programs promoting educational outreach in the District.
Though the nation’s capital is home to several successful universities, the District’s public education system is notorious for its shortcomings. The local government spends more money per student than any state in the nation, but the results aren’t there. According to the National Center for Educational Statistic, the city’s fourth graders underperform on math and reading tests by a margin of about 20 points below the national average.
Disparities exist across the District as well. Wards 1, 2, 3 and 4, which include Georgetown, The George Washington and American Universities, are the most affluent and home to the highest-performing public schools. Ward 2, for example, where Georgetown is located, has a poverty rate of 15 percent, just below the city-wide average of 18 percent. By contrast, Ward 7 and Ward 8 have rates of 26 and 35 percent, respectively.
According to a report released by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education, students at schools in the more affluent areas can drastically outpace peers at schools in Wards 5, 6, 7 and 8 on standardized texts after just one year. The study looked at students with similar numbers on standardized tests after a year in their respective schools and noticed a large disparity in growth.
These disparaties are reflected in the resources available to schools in Southeast D.C. According to The Washington Post, just 10 percent of the city’s teachers designated by the government as “highly effective” work in these areas, home to 41 schools. Meanwhile, 20 percent work in the 10 Ward 3 schools alone. Wards 7 and 8 are where programs like D.C. Reads and D.C. Schools Project step in to try and bridge the achievement gap.
“Students aren’t necessarily given the tools or resources that they need to perform at the level that the District is asking them to perform at,” said Cat Skolniki (COL ’13), a coordinator for D.C. Reads.
The program, which is run through the Center for Social Justice, sends about 250 Georgetown students to elementary schools and community centers in Ward 7 and reaches roughly 400 schoolchildren on a weekly basis.
Skolniki began working with D.C. Reads as a freshman and became a coordinator the following year.
“As I came to learn about all the issues and as I built relationships with students and parents and families, I became highly engaged in … education in D.C.,” she said.
Elisa Manrique (COL ’14), another D.C. Reads coordinator, added that the program is about more than improving reading levels.
“There are other things we can do to complement [reading efforts] — creating relationships that are durable with the kids and helping in their personal lives,” she said.
The D.C. Schools Project, another student-run tutoring organization, focuses specifically on serving the city’s immigrant community. Tutoring both on and off campus, DCSP’s 300 members work with about 100 adults and 150 school children to help them improve their grasp of the English language.
Hui Min Cao (COL ’13), a DCSP coordinator who works with adult groups, explained that the program was started in 1984 to aid children from Sudan but now features one-on-one tutoring in people’s homes and the more community-based approach of helping adults. Cao, a first-generation American whose parents emigrated from China, was inspired to get involved by her own experiences.
“I missed my parents and understood the mission of the program,” she said. “The tutees are almost exactly like my parents.”
Though the two programs are hugely popular on campus — about one in 20 students participates in one of the groups — the work they do is no easy task. Much of the success of campus tutoring organizations depends on the dedication of tutors and their ability to work successfully with students who can sometimes be uncooperative.
“Dealing with the children can be a little rough,” D.C. Reads tutor Marcus Byrd (NHS ’15) said. “They’re not really paying attention, they’re playing around or they’re asking to go to the bathroom. They’re always so distracted.”
Byrd also explained that some of the students served by D.C. Reads deal with learning and attention disabilities.
“I know a lot of the tutors will get frustrated because their tutee has a slight learning disability, so it can be hard to get over that hurdle and reiterate things.”
Many of the students also come from families that face economic hardships, and as a result, tutors must manage the stereotype of the affluent Georgetown student.
“What we have to do is go in there without any notion of privilege,” Manrique said. “As Georgetown students, we carry a certain label with us within the D.C. community. … Walking into these schools and presenting ourselves in a way that we don’t seem condescending is a challenge.”
But perhaps the most daunting challenge of working with the District’s struggling public schools is the absence of tangible progress.
“The system isn’t very good, and that’s why we tutor,” Byrd said. “But I personally haven’t seen a huge change.”
Byrd added that it can be hard to see progress, given that he has only worked with only one student per semester. He added that the system itself doesn’t always seem conducive to students’ learning.
“Standardized test scores are sometimes posted for all the class to see, [which can cause] morale issues when students know they aren’t performing up to standards.”
Ashenfarb deals with many of the same concerns and sometimes questions his work.
“Am I even doing anything? Am I making a difference at all? Am I going to finish this problem, and they’re going to forget it completely by the next time I come?” he said. “In [these] situations … I feel powerless.”
But Manrique believes that while the programs may not be creating widespread, systemic change, there is value in impacting individual students.
“It’s hard to say we are improving literacy for the whole community. We would need triple the number of people,” she said. “We take it school by school and child by child, and it comes down to looking at each child as an individual. Within the arbitrary standards given by standardized testing, we are definitely creating the change we want to see.”
While D.C. Reads tutors labor in individual classrooms, the D.C. public education system at large is in the midst of substantial change.
Before 2007, the education system was governed by the D.C. Board of Education, which would often become entangled in ward politics. When the District of Columbia Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 was passed, it made the mayor the ultimate executive over the system, in an attempt to bypass the long delays that the council had inflicted on reforms.
When Adrian Fenty took office that year, he appointed Michelle Rhee to the newly created position of chancellor of public schools in the District. In her first year in office, Rhee, who had previously run a non-profit that trained teachers for urban schools, shut down 23 schools, cut over 120 administrative positions and fired 36 principals. During her term, she also renegotiated teacher contracts to eliminate tenure and allow for removal of teachers based on student performance on standardized exams.
The administration was criticized by parents, members of teachers’ unions and councilmembers for lack of transparency and fairness, and Rhee resigned her position in 2010 after Mayor Fenty lost his primary bid for re-election. She was replaced by Kaya Henderson under current Mayor Vincent Gray.
Skolnicki expressed frustration with both administrations.
“There is a common misconception that once Michelle Rhee left, a lot changed or improved,” she said. “What a lot of people don’t know is that Kaya Henderson worked directly under Michelle Rhee during her term, and [Henderson] actually proposed a lot of the reforms that went into place when Rhee was in office. There really hasn’t been that much of a change since Rhee left. It’s still in a really bad state.”
This year, a new round of budget cuts has put a serious dent in the funding provided for afterschool programs like D.C. Reads and DCSP.
The city recently cut the contact person these groups used to coordinate their efforts, instead giving each employee three schools to watch over.
“We don’t have as easy communication with our programming,” Skolnicki said. “It forces us to reach out to other administrators and community members to make sure we can still operate.”
The lack of stability proved problematic for both tutors and their students.
“We saw a lot of pushback because the coordinator was eliminated and [we] had to forge new partnerships,” Manrique said. “We had trouble with new school coordinators’ thinking they could shift kids around. It was a battle for kids.”
Despite the students’ continued struggles, Skolnicki considers D.C. Reads to have had a positive impact.
“I’ve seen the program grow and have been with a lot of the students because I have been able to follow students and their siblings throughout these four years,” she said. “I’ve seen how they react to D.C. Reads, and it’s — for the most part — entirely positive.”
While Skolnicki is optimistic about D.C. Reads’ long-term prospects, for Manrique, it’s the small victories and day-to-day progress that make her work worthwhile.
“If a kid you were working with reads a word he couldn’t read two weeks ago, it’s a big deal,” Manrique said. “If a kid jumps three reading levels, it’s a big deal. If we pull off a successful advocacy event, it’s a big deal. There are amazing things happening every day, and they are all different and all rewarding.”

Each license plate on a car registered in the District reads “Taxation Without Representation,” the old Revolutionary War-era saying. But to residents of this city, that sentiment isn’t merely historical — it’s the slogan of a decades-old struggle that’s still ongoing.
Many in the District are fighting for D.C. statehood. This would give Washingtonians full representation in Congress — residents currently have no voting representatives in either chamber — and control over their local budget, which currently is subject to full oversight by Congress.
“We have all the responsibilities of American citizens, but people we did not elect are making decisions about our money, whether or not we fight wars, [and] they decide how we spend local dollars,” Communications Director for D.C. Vote and D.C. resident James Jones said.
A Historic Effort
Though the issues of voting representatives in Congress and control over the budget now dominate the conversation about D.C. autonomy, there was a time when District residents couldn’t even vote for president and vice president. In 1953, President Eisenhower supported a constitutional amendment granting D.C. voting rights in presidential elections, but it took another eight years before the 23rdAmendment was ratified in 1961, granting the city three electors in the Electoral College. In 1969, a group including Julius Hobson, civil rights activist and statehood advocate, established the D.C. Statehood Party, an organization committed to ending congressional control over the District’s laws and budget.
In 1970, Congress granted the District a delegate to the House of Representatives, a post currently filled by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.). Norton is able to vote in committee and draft legislation, but she lacks the full voting rights of the 435 other members of the House of Representatives.
Achieving the lofty goal of statehood would require the cooperation of most of the country. In order to become a state, a constitutional amendment would require approval from two-thirds of both houses of Congress and from three-fourths of state legislatures. The other method of amending the Constitution, which has never been used, requires a convention of two-thirds of the state legislatures who can propose as many amendments as they want for ratification by three-fourths of the states.
But advantages of statehood go beyond budget and voting rights. According to Georgetown history professor Maurice Jackson, statehood would allow the District to establish a reciprocal state income tax for those who work in Washington but live in the neighboring states of Virginia and Maryland. Since 67 percent of the District’s workforce claims residence outside the city, the capital would be able to fund more of its own projects and investments through new taxpayer revenue. Moreover, as home to many nonprofits and lobbying groups, Washington as a state would be able to collect taxes from previously tax-exempt organizations including National Geographic and the National Rifle Association.
Battling Over Budgets
While full statehood is the end goal for most voting rights advocates in the District, organizations like D.C. Vote, a nonprofit founded in 1998, have set their sights on a more achievable goal for the immediate future: budget autonomy.
“We support any means to getting a vote in the House of Representatives and getting our two senators,” Jones said, explaining his organization’s advocacy for an independent D.C. budget. “That path for us involves a couple of things, the most important one being advocating for any step that increases our right to self-determination.”
Under current laws, the District’s yearly budget has to be approved by Congress, a process that can take months and can impact the functioning of the local government.
This state of affairs was created when the District of Columbia Home Rule Act was passed in 1973, allowing for the election of the mayor and the city council. This was an important step in giving the local government control but in many ways left the city subject to the whim of Congress.
“That’s a basic violation of our rights to self-determination. No one else has someone [whom] they did not elect tell them when and how to spend their money,” Jones said. “And it always gets caught up in the partisan bickering on the Hill.”
In case of a federal government shutdown — a possibility that has reared its head twice in 2011 and once in 2012 — the results would be far more troubling for Washington residents than for citizens of states. Not only would the government stop working, affecting thousands of employees for an unknown amount of time, but local services would also cease operating.
“Because D.C.’s budget is directly tied to the federal budget, our garbage would stop being picked up and the [Department of Motor Vehicles] would shut down,” Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13) said, explaining the consequences of a federal shutdown. “These are just other examples of why it is important for D.C. students to care about statehood.”
The co-founder of D.C. Students Speak, Stirrett works alongside peers from across the District to promote student voices in the city government. The organization supports full voting rights for the District of Columbia, among other platforms. According to its website, the organization  “will not realize our shared vision of collaborative universities and communities until all of D.C.’s residents achieve full democracy.”
To reach this goal, DCSS is currently drafting a letter to send to students in order to encourage support for certain aspects of D.C. representation.
“Regardless of where people stand on the issue … the elected representatives in the District of Columbia should have a say where taxpayer dollars go under its jurisdictions. The federal government should not be able to boss D.C.,” Stirett said.
Partisan Politics
Whether in the context of calls for statehood or the fight for an independent budget, advocacy for D.C. autonomy often gets wrapped up in partisan political battles raging on the Hill.
In April 2011, several prominent D.C. officials were arrested during a protest against a federal budget rider that denied District politicians the ability to make decisions regarding funding for public education and for abortions for low-income women. The rider, which was added to the budget as part of an 11th-hour deal to stave off a federal government shutdown, was largely supported by congressional Republicans.
Mayor Vincent Gray and D.C. Councilmembers Kwame Brown and Muriel Bowser stood outside the Dirksen Senate Office Building along with 200 other advocates to condemn the measure. The protesters sat in the middle of Constitution Avenue and chanted, “Free D.C.” and “We can’t take it no more.” The Capitol Police arrested 41 people in the protest, including Gray and Brown.
“The District of Columbia’s right to govern itself has, once again, been sacrificed on the altar of political expediency,” Gray said in a statement released after the protest. “This indignity comes on top of the fact that no other state or jurisdiction had to endure the hardship of planning to shut down a municipal government, thus spending valuable resources and personnel on a process that never should have been necessary.”
Just as in the April 2011 protest, showdowns over District autonomy often come down to party politics. Historically, the GOP has been opposed to D.C. statehood — the party formally adopted an amendment to its platform opposing statehood for the nation’s capital earlier this year.
According to the Director of Communications for the Georgetown College Republicans Kathryn Bolas (COL ’15), the reason for the GOP’s opposition is based in the Constitution.
“The will of our founding fathers is explicitly stated in the Constitution, Article I Section 8, calling for not a state but a ‘District’ to house the federal government. As Republicans we support strict interpretation of the Constitution and, therefore, oppose D.C. statehood,” Bolas said in an email.
But the politics of support for greater independence for the District has been shifting. Recently, top Republicans, including House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), declared their support for D.C. budget autonomy.
Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) also voiced his support for budget autonomy in a letter written to Cantor and Issa in which he wrote, “It’s what the governors of every state enjoy.”
And while the issue may bring about partisan difficulties on the Hill, within the city the subject unifies the two parties.
“There wasn’t a lot of opposition to [the Republican platform] except from Republicans in the District, who are very supportive of budget autonomy and statehood,” Jones said.
Following Congress’ return to the floor after next Tuesday’s election, Norton is hoping to push the issue onto the lame-duck session agenda. Chances of federal success seem slim, however, given the opposition Congress has historically displayed towards the movement.
Journey On
While their delegate advocates for statehood at the federal level, the city council is beginning to take matters into its own hands. On Nov. 9, the council will conduct a hearing about a possible citywide referendum in favor of budget autonomy that would limit Congressional oversight. The procedures for this referendum were established under the 1973 Home Rule Act.
“We believe we have the rights under the charter to pass a referendum that would allow us to spend our own tax dollars after the mayor has signed the bill without Congressional approval,” Jones said of the plan for which his organization has been advocating. “Congress would still have the ability to overturn that. They would also have the ability to offer legislation to meddle with our budget, but this would create a budget process that would be much more in line with the way people are treated in every other part of the country.”
According to Joshua Matfess, a sophomore at American University and president of Students for D.C. Statehood, the District’s status is as much an issue for the college students who call the city home as it is for permanent residents. The District and its surrounding area serve as home to at least 140,000 college students.
“Students, especially university students, should care about local issues in general, including D.C. statehood, because they are likely to live and work here in the future,” Matfess said. “[At] the very least, students will live in the District for four years, so they ought to take some ownership and fight to make it a better place to live for everyone.”
Matfess’ involvement with Students for D.C. Statehood began after visiting Gray’s office on a field trip for a government class. Having learned about the District’s subordinate status, he and a few other students picked up the paperwork to start a new organization to advocate for statehood.
According to Matfess, garnering student interest in the topic can be challenging because a large majority of students do not live in the District. Nevertheless, advocates say this diversity can be advantageous; once students learn about the issue, they are better able to educate people in their home states about the importance of D.C. statehood.
“The voting rights movement has been cursed with inward thinking, and so Students for D.C. Statehood wants to go outside the box and bring education to high schools across America and to tourists visiting the capital,” Matfess said.
Stirrett also emphasized the potential that D.C. college students have to raise awareness about the issue outside of the city.
“Where college students fit into this is that they are able to create a network across the country,” he said. Ideally, these students would carry the message back to their homes and help stimulate a national call for change, the only hope the city would have for the passage of a statehood amendment.
At the same time, Jones realizes that a national political climate that is receptive to the issue of D.C. statehood is a long way off.
“In the current political setup, achieving statehood is a very difficult proposition. People don’t understand it well,” he said. “People respond well to issues of democracy and voting rights and representation, but when you make the jump to statehood, it’s more difficult … Statehood raises a lot of questions with people.”
Jones believes that a strong educational program that would raise national awareness is the missing link for the movement.
“I think once a critical mass of people understand what’s happening in the District and understand the injustice, I think it’ll be a lot easier to get statehood,” Jones said. “In the end, we will get statehood. The District of Columbia will be a state.”
