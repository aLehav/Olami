University President John J. DeGioia raised objections to two Republican tax reform proposals in the House and Senate, writing in a Nov. 21 email to the community that provisions of the bills “reduce the affordability of higher education.”
“We strongly object to any provisions that limit our ability to support our mission of education and research or that inhibit access and affordability,” DeGioia wrote.
DeGioia wrote that the university is “particularly concerned about several provisions that reduce the affordability of higher education,” including provisions that would remove the tax-exempt status of employees’ and graduate students’ tuition benefits and prevent borrowers from deducting interest paid on student loans.
The university has voiced its concerns to members of Congress and is cooperating with other higher education institutions to make them resonate on Capitol Hill, according to DeGioia.
Provost Robert Groves endorsed DeGioia’s comments Monday in a campuswide email. The Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees, formed by recently unionized graduate students, has independently mobilized against the bill: GAGE members visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday to deliver letters denouncing the Senate tax plan to the offices of U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Steve Daines (R-Mont.), according to GAGE’s Facebook page.
The statement marks the third time DeGioia has voiced public opposition to policy initiatives backed by the Trump administration in the past year.
He previously condemned the administration’s decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era program providing legal protection to about 800,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. DeGioia also spoke out against Trump’s original travel ban executive order, which banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and restricted the acceptance of refugees, calling its implications “significant and concerning” in a campuswide email Jan. 29.
Separate versions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of President Donald Trump’s flagship proposals, are working their way through the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House’s version passed Nov. 16 with 227 votes, while the Senate version is scheduled for floor debate beginning Nov. 30 after clearing the Senate Finance Committee on Nov. 16 by a one-vote margin.
Both versions curtail government aid for students by cutting programs such as the Lifetime Learning Credit, which allows families making less than $130,000 a year to claim a credit of up to $2,000 per year. The bills would also terminate the Hope Scholarship Credit, which refunds families making less than $180,000 a year up to $2,500 per student for the first four years of post-secondary school education.
The bills would also repeal the Student Loan Interest Deduction, a program through which students who have already graduated can subtract $2,500 off their student loan interest payments each year if they individually make less than $80,000 per year, or less than $160,000 if married. Twelve million taxpayers benefited from this provision in 2014.
But the reform would also affect the university’s financing, as the House’s version contemplates terminating private activity bonds, which are used by colleges and universities to build facilities. Both versions would end the use of advanced refund bonds, which allow the university to refinance its debt at a lower interest and would accumulate funds over the years.
DeGioia encouraged students, faculty, staff and family members to inform themselves on the bill, and directed them to the website of the American Council on Education, a coordinating body for American colleges and universities.
“Since the legislative process is evolving, I encourage you to stay informed of the latest developments,” DeGioia wrote.

“[T]he university is ‘particularly concerned about several provisions that reduce the affordability of higher education’.” Are you serious, Jack? Why don’t you take a good look in the mirror and pay attention to the RIDICULOUS tuition costs before casting a stone. Your dump, academic-insular administration continues to kick the can down the road by raising tuition time and time again versus looking at ways to cut costs via technology, elimination of unnecessary payroll in the university, pulling back over focus on special interests, etc. 
You’ve been president of Georgetown for over 15 years, and you’ve been nothing short of terrible. I am one of thousands – yes THOUSANDS – of alums who won’t give a dime until you’re gone.

The Washington, D.C. Council proposed a bill Nov. 7 to increase the city’s sales tax to 6.5 percent from 5.75 percent to fund repairs and other expenses for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority as the transit agency looks to fund capital improvement projects.
The proposal came before Metro announced a change to its policy Nov. 24, saying that it will no longer allow negative balances on SmarTrip cards, the system’s stored-value transit cards, in an effort to increase revenue.
The sales tax would apply to the greater D.C. region that is serviced by Metro, including suburbs in Maryland and Virginia. A panel of local leaders last April recommended a 1 percent increase, but the Council ultimately settled on 0.75 percent, as this was the lowest rate that would still provide the $500 million dollars the Council hopes to generate annually.
Starting Jan. 8, passengers will not be able to exit Metro stations unless they have at least $1.75 on their SmarTrip cards. Currently, Metro passengers who lack enough funds on their cards to pay for a trip can still exit a station when they tap their cards at fare gates; the fare they owe is subtracted from whatever balance they have. Still, exit machines only accept cash and coins — unlike regular fare-vending machines.
Metro cited a $25 million loss in revenue over the last 17 years for this change.
The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments published a report April 26 outlining the possible funding solutions.
“Local governments cannot afford the steep bill for Metro’s needed capital and maintenance program while simultaneously financing their jurisdictional needs for schools and other critical infrastructure,” the report said. “Doing nothing is not acceptable.”
WMATA lacks a dedicated funding source, relying on the D.C. government and seven other local and state jurisdictions for funding. In the past, Metro has relied on fare increases and service cuts to make up for its financial shortfalls, though these actions worsen WMATA’s declining ridership.
Three left-leaning think tanks — the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute, the Maryland Center on Economic Policy and The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis — published a report in August advising against the sales tax proposal, citing a greater impact on low-income families.
The think tanks reported that lower-income families could experience an effect five times greater than middle and upper-class families. The report suggests that each participating jurisdiction be given a revenue goal, but each jurisdiction would come up with its own plan to raise the money.
The think tanks also proposed a tax on corporations because “they can best afford to pay and because they have benefitted most from D.C.’s growing economy.”
The Metro already increased fares last year, but it is against its policy to do so two years in a row, according to a spokesperson for WMATA.
Metro declined to provide a statement on the tax increase, citing it as a government matter, rather than a WMATA decision.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has proposed an alternate plan for fundraising, promising Maryland will put $500 million toward Metro funding over four years if Virginia and D.C. agree to do the same. This proposal has been criticized for not providing the adequate funds necessary for the Metro repairs.
Hogan wrote a letter to Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) about his funding proposal.
“The region can no longer avoid taking action, and the needs of the Metro system are immediate and overwhelming,” Hogan wrote. “When comparing each jurisdiction’s investments over the past three years, and by any logical measure, Maryland has not only been paying our fair share, but actually more than our fair share.”
Residents of the region have expressed disapproval of this new sales tax plan, especially those who do not live in the immediate D.C. area and those who do not use the Metro often.
Charlotte Lindsay (COL ’20) said that she does not think that the increase in sales tax is fair to all D.C. Metro area residents. The Georgetown neighborhood’s lack of a Metro stop means that she rarely uses the trains to commute through the city.
“I would say that it’s a little frustrating since sales tax is already pretty high here, and we don’t at all have easy access to a Metro,” Lindsay said. “Almost one percent seems pretty high. Given that [the rates are] already pretty high, and D.C. already is an expensive city, I don’t think that that would be at all ideal.”
Metro’s Chief Financial Officer Dennis Anosike said in a Nov. 24 news release that Metro’s current economic needs were a factor in this decision.
“In an environment where every dollar counts, we are taking a common-sense approach to ensure that Metro is properly collecting the value of the transportation it provides in order to reduce the demand on Metro customers and the region for additional funding,” Anosike said.
The sales tax bill has been referred to the Committee on Finance and Revenue for further consideration. WMATA was unable to provide a statement as of Thursday night.

The Republican Party’s current tax reform efforts will be passed into law, three tax policy experts predicted during a Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service discussion on tax cuts Tuesday.
Grover Norquist, president of anti-tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform; Tony Sayegh, an assistant secretary for the United States Department of the Treasury; and Cathy Koch (GRD ’94), the Americas tax policy leader at accounting firm EY, defended the GOP’s tax reform and tax cut efforts.
Sayegh and Norquist, both GU Politics fellows during spring 2017, addressed not only the difficulties of passing a tax reform bill in Congress but also their views on the current status of the tax reform plan. They emphasized the political opportunities and challenges of tax cuts and tax reforms.
Sayegh said that analysis of the plan’s overall effect on Americans must take into account President Donald Trump’s goals for economic growth.
“We would love to make the entire package permanent, and there was sincere interest in making the middle-class taxes better. We need to make people understand that we have expanded the zero-tax bracket for the vast majority of the people, those who need it the most,” Sayegh said.
This conversation on tax reform came three weeks after Republicans in the U.S. Senate released their own version of the House of Representatives’ initial tax plan. Currently, the Senate plan cuts taxes on all seven tax brackets and raises after-tax incomes for all income groups in the short run, though tax benefits for lower-class and middle-class Americans would expire after 2025.
The plan, one of Trump’s major legislative efforts, also repeals local and state deductions, personal exemptions for family dependents and the Affordable Care Act’s mandate for Americans to purchase health insurance while cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent in 2019, according to ABC News.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Senate plan would add $1.4 trillion to the annual deficit over the next ten years, which is less than the House’s plan, which would add $1.7 trillion over the same period.
Koch said that any tax reform plan should prioritize reforming corporate tax breaks and reducing the current 30 percent corporate tax.
“Our corporate rate is way higher than any other industrialized country’s and has the wrong incentives,” Koch said.
Norquist said that tax reform analysis should also take into account the unemployed population.
Norquist said that an increase in employment similar to the trend under President Ronald Reagan’s administration would have a positive impact on the economy. The unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent from 7.5 percent during Reagan’s term, due to significant economic growth and his tax cuts.
“We have 8 percent of unemployment if you count those who used to want to work but are or have been discouraged,” Norquist said. “The biggest winners in a percentage basis are those who get their jobs back and who come back into the labor force. I think it would be helpful to point out that the world is not yet perfect.”
The panelists agreed that they wanted to remain as optimistic as possible about the futures of tax reform and the national unemployment rate but conceded that there remains more work to be done.
“Where we are now is the worst possible place for 30-something million households. People say we are overestimating, but I am afraid that they won’t go over [this number].” Norquist said. “We’re going to see capital flows from around the globe at rates we haven’t seen because of the changes in capital reform.”

A divisive, us-versus-them approach to debating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict impedes progress, argued pro-Israel activist Chloé Valdary at a Nov. 28 discussion.
The U.S. conversation regarding the conflict, a decadeslong struggle between Israelis and Palestinians over the two sides’ competing claims to lands controlled by Israel, pits proponents of Israeli security and self-determination against advocates for the rights of Palestinians.
Valdary, who works as director of partnerships and a Shillman Fellow at the educational film production company Jerusalem U, said an oppressor-versus-oppressed framing misrepresents the conflict.
In an oppressor-versus-oppressed mindset, Valdary said, morality only supports victims. She said Americans who supported Zionism out of a shared sense of oppression or intersectionality could no longer view Israel as relatable or even “moral” once it won statehood.
“If you see history through this very narrow framework, anything that falls out of these boxes, you can no longer fight for, you can no longer stand for. It’s a worldview, in my opinion, that doesn’t allow for complexity,” Valdary said. “Instead of having that paradigm, why don’t we just empower everyone?”
She criticized the concept of intersectionality for reinforcing categorical labels of the “us-versus-them” binary.
“Intersectionality is responding to categorization, but it is not, in my mind, challenging the categories,” Valdary said. “It is reinforcing the categories, in a sense, because it is making claims that I, as a person of color, have most assuredly experienced ‘x’ at the hands of someone who was white by virtue of being in the categories, in the skin colors that we have.”
Instead of intersectionality, Valdary proposed restorative justice, or repairing harm caused by misdeeds, and her “theory of enchantment,” which is the promotion of constructive discussions about differences to build compassion for a common humanity, as alternative paradigms through which to understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Valdary said she hopes to transcend the “us-versus-them binary” through this approach.
“Restorative justice tries to transcend that [us-versus-them] and ask the question, ‘How can we heal both of our communities?’ That is something I’m very much attracted to,” Valdary said.
If Israelis and Palestinians could stop seeing their losses as the other group’s gains, they could move toward healing, Valdary said.
Georgetown Israel Alliance President Sean Lerner (SFS ’20) and Vice President Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20) organized the event, hosted by the GIA and the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, to bridge what Lerner called a “racialized” divide in the Israeli-Palestinian discussion on campus.
“I’ve known about Chloé for a while. She’s pretty popular in the young pro-Israel world, especially on social media,” Lerner said. “We also recognized that there was a sort of element around the discussion of Israel-Palestine on this campus that was racialized in a way; there was a divide in the community.”
Valdary encouraged students to analyze the dilemmas Israelis and Palestinians face while recognizing that some of them are currently irreconcilable and to engage with organizations that bring together contrasting perspectives.
“We, as students and educators, need to volunteer for those organizations, seek out those organizations that are bringing Israelis and Palestinians together and creating dialogue,” Valdary said. “Dialogue that might not have all the answers, but… is much more interested in saying, ‘Even though you and I disagree about x, y and z, our goal is to foster compassion and empathy in the midst of profound disagreement.’”
Ultimately, Valdary said she hopes to redefine how people conceptualize the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“We are so much more than these weird, objectified terminologies. I think we have to enter the conversation with the desire to lean in toward the other, so that we can see ourselves in them and see them in ourselves,” Valdary said.

What a wonderful oncept. Unfortunately, given the tribal stone-age mentality of one of the parties, it won’t work. The idea depends on an assumption of reasonableness by both parties to the conflict. History has shown time and again (we have such a penchant for ignoring the lessons of history) that one of the parties will enter the dialogue with a hidden agenda that assumes any ‘give’ by the other side is a sign of weakness (difficult to accept that an inhuman society that glorifies martyrdom and terrorism can be reasonable) and fall right back into the original paradigm of tribal conflict.

This article is shallow and makes the situation in the Middle East sound so complex and conveys a purely emotional and unrealistic “lets understand each other over coffee” solution, while using such interstesting terms that sound so sophisticated, educated, and knowledgeable. Do people just make up words today?
 First, this is not about “Israelis & Palistinians”, but “muslims vs Jews”. Its that simple. For over 6 years I have lived in Israel as  non-Jewish independent journalist and travelled the details of the country, know the the history,  been on the front lines of war, infiltrated terror groups, and having shown first hand via interviews that young and old muslims, in and out of Israel, openly call for the destruction of the Jewish State. Might I also add that these everyday muslims are not islamic leadership or part of a militant group like hamas or hezbollah.
Most Isrseli’s, especially Israeli born Jews, clearly understand the intent of their islamic enemies desire to destroy them from the river to the sea and historically speaking whenever there was a CALL for peace it was simply a muslim moment to build up to the next attack on the Jews. Whenever there was a treaty signed and historically owned Jewish land was given away it would be used as a platform for miltant activity to attack Israel.
Hamas and Hezbollah hold no countries/people hostage. No military exists without the support of the civilain population. muslims encourage, cheer, and groom their children to join these 2 groups for the sake of allah as directed by the koran. As well, if not to join militant islam openly, but to act independtly to bring glory to the prophet and further global domination.
I would venture to say, with great assurance, that the people involved in the article speak ONLY from a Western perspective and know nothing of islam, the koran, the intimate details of the culture, language, history, and mentality of the players involved. I do appreciate and respect advocacy for Israel, but when one continues to use “fake terms” that promote the lie of “palistinians”, when you have never attend the funeral of soldiers, or sat with vicitms of terror for 6 years then you bring nothing to the table realistically as far as a solution

The whole point of the article is to discuss constructive dialogue, not Islamophobic vitriol. I will say that seeing an article about your “constructive dialogue” with the IDF was refreshing. I’m glad that even the people you so enthusiastically support can see through your charm and knowledgeable facade for the hate monger you truly are.  https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-allows-anti-islam-activist-to-spread-hate-chocolate-to-soldiers/?fbclid=IwAR3UPziTlfSC1yuhyYjuKkmgFuQIzLsCVyC9L_YbkGBqyJz35K99lpaUQVc

Chloe knows the history and reality and I admire her efforts, but as the others have stated: there are no 2 parties with a happy outcome.  As long as the Jews violate the dhimma and refuse to die or return to subjugated dhimmi status, muslims will wage war.  The muslims will not mind dying (unless they did not succeed in killing Jews along the way) and the Pentagon/EU backed leaders of the muslims reward the killers of Jews.
Western and European leaders have full power to defund and destroy both hamas and fatah, but deliberately choose not to.
These basic facts render the kumbaya efforts at harmony and peace a waste of time.

Successful entrepreneurs should offer special products and learn from their experiences in the industry, founders of Washington, D.C. food startups said during a panel discussion on entrepreneurship in the food industry Tuesday.
Featuring the founders of Eat Pizza, JRINK and Snacklins and the CEO of Union Kitchen, the panel focused on starting a food business and how to grow that business to a national level. Student entrepreneurship group StartupHoyas, Students of Georgetown, Inc., GU Eating Society and Spoon University Georgetown organized the event, which was the fourth installment of the Food Entrepreneurship Series, a StartUpHoyas initiative that allows food startup founders to share their experiences in the food industry with students.
The event also included samples of the panelists’ products.
Each of the three startups featured in the panel got its start at Union Kitchen, a food business accelerator that works with entrepreneurs to develop their products and scale their brand to a regional and national level.
Cullen Gilchrist, the CEO of Union Kitchen, said that major consideration for Union Kitchen when choosing new business partners includes the applicant’s ability to learn and be coached.
“We’re looking for a person that we think is an entrepreneur,” Gilchrist said. “We think they’re smart; we think they’re going to hustle; they’re going to work hard.”
Gilchrist called the food industry a meritocracy, emphasizing that a food entrepreneur can be successful with good food and hard work.
“So much of culture is based around what we’re eating,” Gilchrist said.
The founders of Eat Pizza, JRINK and Snacklins each had distinctive paths to starting their brands, but they all noted the importance of being open to new ideas.
Andy Brown, the founder of Eat Pizza, a frozen pizza company, said he founded the business in January 2017. After partnering with Union Kitchen, Brown, a former DJ at The Tombs, went from having just a concept for “better” frozen pizza to having a product in regional Whole Foods markets in the span of three months.
Brown credits his swift success not only to the resources available to him through Union Kitchen but also to his own business strategy.
“As long as our product’s better and our price point’s competitive, we’ll continue to grow,” Brown said.
The concept of offering something other products do not is key for all of the panelists, who each credited their success to a unique aspect of their brand.
Shizu Okusa, co-founder of JRINK, a fresh-pressed juice brand, worked in the finance world before founding JRINK. The juice bar now has five locations across the D.C. area, including in Dupont Circle and Foggy Bottom with a sixth coming soon in Eastern Market.
Okusa said that she saw a “market opportunity” for JRINK in D.C. Initially, Okusa and her business partner made juice in addition to their day jobs but soon realized that D.C. did not have many fresh juice shops, despite the growing popularity of the beverage nationwide. This market opportunity became the starting point for JRINK, which now sells its juices made-to-order, online and in-store.
Samy K, the co-founder of Snacklins, a vegan pork rind brand, got his start as a radio personality on the The Kane Show, a music radio program. Snacklins began as a challenge from a friend to create a product that tastes like a pork rind, or “crackling,” but is vegan — a pork rind without the pork.
He succeeded with a recipe featuring mushrooms and yucca. Snacklins now come in three flavors: Chesapeake Bay-style, barbecue and soy ginger.
Samy K named two things as key for an entrepreneur’s success. The first is reliable employees.
“You need a good team behind you,” he said.
The second thing that Samy K named is a “willingness to continue learning.” Samy K described how much he now knows about chip bags that he previously did not because of his willingness to learn about a new aspect of his product.
Okusa also noted the importance of continuing to grow one’s knowledge, particularly for entrepreneurs.
“A good entrepreneur knows they don’t know everything,” Okusa said.

The prison labor system must be reformed to combat prison recidivism and include basic minimum wage rights, said a panel of ex-offenders and criminal justice experts at an event Tuesday.
Criminal justice reform advocate Sekwan Merritt and journalist Chandra Bozelko spoke to the benefits of their jobs in prison. They said they attained both tangible job experience and social skills. Merritt worked in print and wood shops while imprisoned and now works as an electrician.
“You learn an employment skill; this skill is needed in order to combat recidivism,” Merritt said. “We have to teach ex-offenders how to provide for themselves. These jobs are a means to do that.”
Outside the job experience and skills learned, however, Merritt and Bozelko said that prisoners are not being respected as actual workers but rather being exploited. Merritt said Maryland Correctional Enterprises, the prison labor arm of Maryland state prisons, has seen large profits from prison labor.
“In [its] 2017 fiscal year report, [MCE] actually had sales revenue in excess of $58 million,” Merritt said. “When you have an excess of $58 million, and you’re paying workers 15 cents an hour, $2 a day, it seems a little exploitive.”
Merritt also noted the prices of prison commissary goods, with basic essentials costing almost a whole month’s wage.
The panel, hosted in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room, also included David Fathi, director of the National Prison Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, and Arthur Rizer, national security and justice policy director at the R Street Initiative, a public policy think tank.
Marc Howard, director of the Prisons and Justice Initiative, moderated the conversation.
The panelists emphasized the power of educating incarcerated citizens with basic employment skills to fight recidivism and increase the likelihood of employment post release.
To address the problems with prison labor, Fahti said that state legislatures could amend minimum wage laws and other legislation to include wage rights for prisoners.
“The more prisoners are paid and protected just like other employees, the less risk that a desire for cheaper or more docile or more easily controlled prison labor will either undercut positions of free workers or distort the criminal justice system by creating a perverse incentive to maintain or even grow the prison population,” Fahti said.
Rizer, however, argued that the goal of prison reform is not to raise wages but instead to heavily focus on unemployment post release.
“It doesn’t offend me [to get paid $2 a day] because I think that’s part of your punishment,” Rizer said. “What offends me is [prisoners] got out, they could not get a job. For some reason, our society says that if you commit a crime, we are going to disinherit you from the American dream. That is the thing that we should talk about. Sixty percent of people that are released within one year are unemployed.”
On a more personal level, Bozelko felt transformed by her experience working in the prison’s kitchen, where she learned to “humble [herself],” ultimately making her “reevaluate the way [she] saw other people.”
Bozelko pointed out the exploitation of prison laborers, connecting it to a lack of respect and value for all low-wage workers.
“I don’t think it’s that different than the exploitation of a low-wage worker who is not incarcerated,” Bozelko said. “When I look at the prison labor problem, I see it very differently. I see it as a larger issue of how we treat people who earn low wages, no matter whether they are legally protected by minimum wage statute or not, but also how we view labor and the value of work.”
Regardless of one’s primary focus, however, the panelists agreed that workers’ skills should be valued whether they are incarcerated or not.
“Workers are workers,” Bozelko said. “What they do should be valued, whether inside or outside.”
