Georgetown University’s Earth Commons Institute opened a new garden to provide a resource for students and professors to learn about sustainable agriculture. 
The Earth Commons, Georgetown’s institute for sustainability and the environment, launched the Hoya Harvest Garden with the goal of creating a sense of shared responsibility about sustainable food systems in the Georgetown community. The Earth Commons collaborated with urban agriculture experts in Washington, D.C. and members of the local community for 18 months to plan the garden. 
To create the garden, the Earth Commons converted existing planters on the fourth floor patio of Regents Hall into a vegetable garden. The Earth Commons plans to host workshops and community lectures and will work with students to integrate the garden into their projects, volunteer opportunities and internships.
Shelby Gresch (SFS ’22), a research associate at the Earth Commons, said the institute established the Hoya Harvest Garden to demonstrate the relationship between food production and the environment.
“This felt important to the Earth Commons’ mission of ‘infusing environmental and sustainability research, education and action throughout the Georgetown University community and beyond’ because we really can’t talk about today’s environmental challenges without talking about the food system,” Gresch wrote to The Hoya.
Gresch said the garden will produce food to distribute across campus, primarily through the Hoya Hub, an on-campus food pantry, and occasionally at Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall.
The Hoya Harvest Garden will also serve as a “living laboratory,” demonstrating sustainable agriculture.
Gresch said students and professors can use the garden as a resource in classes and for research.
“We are hoping that the garden will increasingly serve as a ‘living lab’ that faculty can integrate into their classes and students can use in research, capstones, etc. We’ve had a couple classes out this spring, but I’m excited to develop that further,” Gresch wrote.
At the Earth Commons’ Earth Day celebration, called Breaking Ground: A Spring Festival, they invited attendees to plant vegetables and herbs to learn about sustainable growing practices. 
Abby Rich (SFS ’25), a student who working on the Hoya Harvest Garden, said the garden can spark a bigger conversation on campus about food waste. 
“I hope that it continues to be used educationally as professors bring their classes to visit the Hoya Harvest garden, and that it sparks a larger conversation about where our food comes from,” Rich wrote to The Hoya. 
Charvee Dua (CAS ’25), a member of Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN), a student club that promotes environmental education and advocacy, said the Hoya Harvest Garden initiative will encourage collaboration among the student body.
“I know that a big part of Hoya Harvest was making sure that all student groups that already have gardens also feel supported, and it’s not necessarily a competitive thing, but more about working together,” Dua told The Hoya.
Student groups also participated in the festival. GREEN’s energy and water team showed attendees how to make tote bags out of old T-shirts and GREEN’s zero waste team, which works to reduce waste on campus, showed community members how to compost waste. 
Local vendors — including pop-up bookstore Kahini Books, neighborhood bakery VegHeaven and knitwear vendor MisfitsKnitz — showcased environmentally friendly products such as thrifted clothes and used books at the festival. 
Dua said it is crucial for the Georgetown community to learn about the environment through celebrations like the Breaking Ground Festival, not just through pessimistic climate news.
“It’s really crucial to celebrate Earth Week so we remember what we’re fighting for and get the whole community engaged with it — not just environmental organizations but just as many of the students on campus involved,” Dua said. 
Dua said she hopes that as many students as possible will get involved with sustainability work on campus throughout the year.
“I think breaking down that barrier a little bit — where it’s not about perfection with the environment but just enough people making an effort — that’s something we really value at Georgetown,” Dua said. “You don’t have to be someone who perfectly understands environmental practices or how to be eco-friendly to be interested in this stuff.”

The American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) elected four Georgetown University faculty members April 19 to join its ranks as members of the 2023 class.
The four inductees are Marcia Chatelain, a history professor; Carolyn Forché, an English professor; Anita Gonzalez, a professor of performing arts and African American studies; and Maria Cancian, dean of the McCourt School of Public Policy. They will join 265 other newly elected members of the academy, a prestigious society started in 1780 by Declaration of Independence signatories John Adams and John Hancock that aims to convene academic leaders and advance the common good.
Chatelain, a scholar of African American life and culture, said that in a modern age of digital disinformation, institutions like the Academy are key in disseminating the truth.
“I think that the Academy is an excellent opportunity to join like-minded people who are most concerned about the ongoing attack on facts and on research and the importance of exploring ideas,” Chatelain told The Hoya. “I think that as an organization, I’ve been very impressed by the ways that they’ve really focused on the importance of fighting misinformation and disinformation, both in the sciences as well as the humanities.”
Chatelain has authored extensive research on twentieth-century African American life, including civil rights and Black food culture. Chatelain said she hopes joining the Academy will enable her to make such work accessible to a broader audience.
“I’m really excited to see the ways that the membership really focuses on making clear to the broadest and most public audience the importance of academic research and the importance of the work that happens on college campuses,” Chatelain said. 
Daedalus, the Academy’s open access journal that features work from its members, is part of an accessibility and outreach effort to share their research and ideas with the general public outside of academia. Georgetown students can access the journal’s content on JSTOR, an online research repository, free of charge.
Cancian researches how public policy impacts family wellbeing. She said she is looking forward to the new connections she will make as a member of the Academy.
“Membership in the Academy offers expanded opportunities to build connections and community with an extraordinary set of scholars and leaders,” Cancian wrote to The Hoya. “I am deeply honored and humbled to be elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.”
Gonzalez, the performing arts and African American studies professor, studies the intersection of culture and performance. Gonzalez said the Academy is a diverse institution that seeks to bring an array of perspectives across different disciplines to important issues.
“The AAAS community engages in analysis of some of the most strategically important issues nationally and globally,” Gonzalez wrote to The Hoya. “I deeply appreciate that the community includes a spectrum of political perspectives and seeks innovative solutions to pressing problems.”
Gonzalez has published works on how dance, theater and performance can influence political discourse. Gonzalez said the study of art offers key perspectives to policy-oriented issues.
“It’s important that the arts have a voice in policy making because they represent the humanity and cultures of so many diverse peoples,” Gonzalez wrote.
Chatelain said that through the professors’ membership in the AAAS, a larger audience will be able to understand the greater societal purpose of their research.
“I think it’s important for people to understand that a lot of the research that we undertake is not just for our own benefit or the benefit of our students or our campuses, but it’s really research that can be used for the common good,” Chatelain said.

Two Georgetown students were among 413 U.S. students named Goldwater Scholars for their endeavors in scientific research. 
Naomi Greenberg (CAS ’24) and Roma Dhingra (CAS ’24) beat out over 5,000 applicants for the scholarship, which is one of the most prestigious scholarships for undergraduates studying science, engineering and mathematics, with awards amounting up to $7,500 to sophomore and junior students for up to two years. Congress established the Goldwater Scholarship in 1986 to encourage American students to pursue careers in scientific research.
Full disclosure: Naomi Greenberg previously served as Senior Science Editor and Copy Chief for The Hoya.
Greenberg, a biology major, researches theoretical evolutionary genetics using mathematical models. Her research specifically focuses on X chromosomes, which are one of the two human sex chromosomes involved in determining biological sex. 
Greenberg said she first developed an interest in biology after taking Foundations of Biology II with geneticist and professor Manus Patten, now her research mentor. 
Patten said Greenberg presented her own original idea for research, which looked to examine potential biases in the process of X chromosome activation or the determination of which genes on an X chromosome appear.
“I offered her three ideas to see what she might be interested in, one of which involved X chromosome genetics. Then she pitched her own idea on the topic and it was the best out of the four,” Patten told The Hoya.
Greenberg began this research project with Patten in Fall 2022, and due to her work ethic, she was able to present results in January 2023, completing a process that usually takes a year in just a few months, according to Patten. 
In the future, Greenberg plans to study for a Ph.D. in molecular biology, allowing her to take a more hands-on approach to genetics through lab work.
Dhingra’s research focuses on how psychosocial factors — external characteristics influencing individuals psychologically or socially — impact biological aging. Particularly, Dhingra has investigated the impact of discrimination-induced stress on the process of aging.   
During the COVID-19 pandemic, when Georgetown’s labs were unavailable for student research, Dhingra joined University of Pittsburgh psychology professor Rebecca Reed’s laboratory. She has worked with Reed and University of Pittsburgh Ph.D. student Abby Hillmann virtually since May 2021.
Dhingra, a biology of global health major, said she completed scientific research in high school but was excited to cross disciplines through her current project.
“Through my research, I was able to get out of the ‘hard science’ bubble and see how research is interdisciplinary. Interdisciplinary research is not very common, so it was my first time getting exposure to the field,” Dhingra told The Hoya.  
Biology professor Heidi Elmendorf has worked closely with Dhingra as her on-campus mentor and said Dhingra’s cross-disciplinary approach to research is remarkable.
“She has studied the impact of stress caused by discrimination on an individual’s epigenetic age — an innovative interdisciplinary study blending molecular biology with sociology with large-scale data analysis,” Elmendorf wrote to The Hoya. “I’ve been so impressed with Roma’s research. She has developed formidable data analysis skills while embracing the humanity of the research focus.”
Dhingra said she plans to continue research on the influence of psychosocial factors on health in the future, specifically focusing on cancer research in a clinical setting as a physician-researcher. 
Dhingra said she was both ecstatic and shocked when she received the news of her award. 
“I couldn’t believe it at first. I knew I couldn’t have done it without Dr. Reed or Abby Hillmann,” Dhingra said. “It was nice to know that my research had been recognized, especially since it is unique compared to the research done by other Goldwater Scholars.”
Greenberg said receiving a Goldwater Scholarship would push her to continue her work in scientific research.
“When you actually see, ‘Congratulations, you’ve been named a Goldwater Scholar,’ that’s a really big moment and has made me feel proud of my accomplishments,” Greenberg said in an interview with The Hoya. “There is an element of motivation and expectation that comes with it because now I feel like I’ve had this validation that I am on the right track.”

The LGBTQ Resource Center announced its new associate program director on April 13.  
Activist and educator Riley Jelenick, who comes to Georgetown with previous experience in developing LGBTQ+ outreach and education as a student services coordinator at the University of Dayton, will lead the center’s events and programming initiatives to promote greater inclusion of the LGBTQ community at Georgetown. Jelenick’s primary goal in this position is to normalize conversations and work around identity and queerness on campus.
“I’m in this work because I care about the well-being of all students, and I want them to succeed. So if that means leaving space for questions and curiosity, if that means connecting them to resources that support them in their academic journey, whatever that thing may be, I’m another human on campus to support them,” Jelenick said in a press release. “I just have a tailored focus on supporting LGBTQ+ students.”
The LGBTQ Resource Center, which opened in 2008, was the first of its kind at a Catholic university. It offers resources in community building, education and outreach, as well as support in navigating life at Georgetown, student leadership development, student wellness and alumni engagement. 
Jelenick said he was vocal about his experience as a young transgender student when interacting with students in his leadership role at the University of Dayton’s LGBTQ+ center, and he hopes to do the same at Georgetown.
“I’ve often opened up about my story as a young trans student navigating the world and systems that were not made for me,” Jelenick said in a press release. “I try to give back to other young queer students like myself who didn’t know there was a human there to support them, who didn’t know that they could feel comfortable as their whole self, exist and belong.”
Ella Lesher (CAS ’25), a co-president of GUPride for the 2023-2024 academic year, said she is eager to see the LGBTQ Resource Center prosper after the position’s temporary vacancy.
“I am glad that the university has finally hired someone to fill this position, and I am excited to see the LGBTQ Resource Center thrive under his leadership,” Lesher wrote to The Hoya.
Sivagami Subbaraman served as executive director of the LGBTQ Center for more than a decade until she stepped down in June 2021, leaving behind Amena Johnson as associate director, who then left in September 2022. Annie Selak, the associate director of the Women’s Center, has served as interim associate director of the LGBTQ Center until Jelenick was hired.
GU Pride and the LGBTQ Resource Center have collaborated on events together including Trans Day of Visibility and will continue similar collaborations through next year. Lesher believes that this work will enable both groups to support queer students on campus. 
“I’m confident that GU Pride and the LGBTQ+ Resource Center will continue to advocate for inclusivity on campus, and that means allowing students to live how they want and with whom they want,” Lesher wrote.
Liam Moynihan (SFS ’25), the co-president of GU Pride, said Jelenick has already taken initiatives to hold events for LGBTQ+ students, including LavGard, an annual graduation ceremony for the LGBTQ+ community at Georgetown. 
“We’ve met with Riley a number of times since his hire, and I’m strongly optimistic about his future work at the LGBTQ Resource Center and on campus,” Moynihan wrote to The Hoya. “Over the past two months, he has dived headfirst into the job, advocating for gender inclusive bathrooms and housing, as well as planning and hosting important LGBTQ+ community events like LavGrad.” 
Moynihan said Jelenick’s hire is crucial to LGBTQ+ life at Georgetown after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted momentum in Georgetown’s LGBTQ+ community. 
“Clubs lost much of the institutional and generational knowledge passed down from board to board, and many big events no longer have the same hype they had before COVID,” Moynihan wrote. 
“However, with an enthusiastic and capable director of the LGBTQ+ Resource Center and re-energized student organizations like GU Pride, QPOC and Haus of Hoya, the future of LGBTQ+ life at Georgetown is looking up,” Moynihan added. 
Ulises Olea Tapia (SFS ’25), an employee at the center, said Jelenick’s appointment will bring new ideas and energy to the space.“He seems very eager and very excited to put in the work to really like, you know, sit back and think on the things that we’re doing good and the things that we can be doing better,” Tapia told The Hoya. “I think that that’s important, and he’s very enthusiastic, and that really brings a really nice energy to the Center.”
Jelenick said he has enjoyed his time thus far and hopes to continue building connections in the Georgetown community.
“I have truly enjoyed my experience thus far in joining the Hilltop community! It has been a wonderful meeting with various students, faculty, and staff from across campus — across departments and disciplines — that are committed to increasing a sense of belonging and support for our LGBTQ+ community,” Jelenick wrote to The Hoya. 
“I have been warmly welcomed by so many and hope to continue meeting and connecting with folks as we look forward to the next academic year,” Jelenick added. Jelenick will respond to community needs to create a stronger center, according to Tapia.
“I think that we can always continue to do research and really try to see what the needs from the community are,” Tapia said. “I’m really excited to see how we can readapt the Center and adapt it to the needs of everyone.”

Two Georgetown University clubs hosted an open mic night April 25 to advocate for reproductive justice.
Bossier, a Georgetown magazine that empowers people with marginalized gender identities on campus, and H*yas for Choice, a pro-abortion rights and sex-positive organization for Georgetown students, organized the open mic night in the Healey Family Student Center. Ten students shared their poetry, instrumental music, songs, spoken word recitals and paintings in front of over 50 attendees during the event. 
Rebecca Glickman (CAS ’23) said she introduced the idea of an open mic night as a final project in one of her courses, Professor Emma Jaster’s theater and performance studies class “Empathy and Embodiment.”
“As someone really passionate about reproductive rights and social movements in general, I decided an open mic night would be such a great way to combine the ideas of reproductive justice with healing, embodiment and wellness through performance art,” Glickman wrote to The Hoya. “Embodied practices can help us grieve and work through trauma and pain, things we most often experience through the body.”
Glickman, the former organizing director of H*yas for Choice, said Bossier and H*yas for Choice often work together to facilitate students’ creative expression on gender issues.
“As clubs with similar values, they collaborate together often, especially in events like open mic nights which bring together art and social issues,” Glickman wrote.
Since the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in June 2022 that overturned Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion, 14 states have fully banned abortion, and five more have enacted gestational limits. 
A federal judge in Texas invalidated the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval for mifepristone, a common abortion pill, on April 7. Although the Supreme Court maintained the approval, the case is ongoing, and a future ruling invalidating FDA approval could drastically reduce access to mifepristone, according to the New York Times.
Serena Barish (CAS ’25), Bossier’s managing director and a board member at H*yas for Choice, said art like the pieces performers displayed at the open mic night plays an important role in allowing people to deal with trauma related to reproductive health.
“I think that, especially in the case of reproductive justice, there’s a very distinct kind of pain that comes with it,” Barish told The Hoya.“I mean, this is really more relevant today than ever before. Art is really powerful in that sense because it’s something that I think increasingly becomes accessible to people as a form of self-care in the wake of having to kind of grapple with what’s happening.”
Emily Hardy (SFS ’23), Bossier’s former executive editor, said giving students platforms to express themselves about reproductive justice allows them to find support in the community around them.
“We come together to name our emotions and voice shared pain, but also shared joy,” Hardy wrote to The Hoya.“We are creators who will not be contained by a system that seeks to deny reproductive agency.” 
“Even if all we can do is gather in shared spaces, we will continue to hold space for the rage, fear, and exhaustion that is wrapped up in the Dobbs decision,” Hardy added. 
Community events like the open mic night allow attendees to feel a sense of empowerment, according to Hardy.
“We have the power to do something, even if that something is providing care for members of our community affected by the decision,” Hardy wrote. “While we may not be able to reverse the Dobbs decision, simply by making space to share communal outrage and feel supported by others experiencing similar emotions makes the pain less isolating.”
Glickman said she was proud that the performers could comfortably share their art at the open mic night. 
“What was so rewarding was the feedback we got about the event: how we created such a safe and comfortable space and even helped audience members feel inspired, empowered and comforted,” Glickman wrote.
Barish said art provides a unique way of speaking out that government restrictions cannot diminish. 
“It’s really important to give people an opportunity to claim their own voice because I think that’s a deeply humanizing force, and it will continue to be,” Barish said. “At the end of the day, you can ban books, you can ban healthcare in some ways, you can ban my access to reproductive autonomy — all of these things — but you can never claim my voice as yours, and I think art provides that space.”

Members of Georgetown’s Circle of Indigenous Students’ Alliance (CISA) partnered with two Smithsonian Institution museums to view tribal artifacts in museum archives on April 7. 
Alanna Cronk (CAS ’23), CISA’s chief liaison to the Smithsonian and a member of the Ventureño Chumash tribe, led CISA’s partnerships with the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian and the Museum of Natural History last summer after becoming familiar with many Smithsonian collections through previous research.
In addition to CISA’s partnership with the Smithsonian, the group has also partnered with an educational liaison to develop a museum program for fall 2023 examining the evolution of Indigenous arts and the environment. This program will be hosted at the Museum of Natural History’s Q?rius, an interactive exhibit that features hands-on exploration of animals and objects from around the world. 
“It was a very moving experience for everybody and it felt really great to get to be a key player in helping facilitate a bunch of other Indigenous students to have the kind of experience I did — which is not necessarily a joyous experience in the archive, but one that does feel deeply meaningful,” Cronk told The Hoya.
Cronk, a descendant of the Ventureño Chumash basket weaver Petra Pico, whose art is part of the Smithsonian’s collection, conducted an independent project last summer on the epistemology of basket weaving through Georgetown’s Kalorama Fellowship, an award for students in the humanities, social sciences and environmental sciences with original ideas for summer research projects. 
Matthew Vestuto, an anthropological researcher and the vice chair of the Ventureño Chumash tribe, introduced Cronk to Torben Rick, the Natural History Museum’s curator of North American archaeology, who took Cronk on a tour of the Smithsonian’s Indigenous archives.
Cronk said viewing the archival cabinets at the Smithsonian brought them unexpected feelings. 
“When Rick opened the cabinets, I felt a wave of loneliness smack me in the face, and I didn’t anticipate that,” Cronk said. “I sang to the baskets in my Native language for some time, and then I went to work photographing them to confirm details for my research.”
While in the archives, Cronk also saw their ancestor’s artistic artifacts, an experience that they said was inspiring.
“I got to access some of Petra Pico’s baskets, and that’s always very exciting when you can directly hold an object one of your ancestors made,” Cronk said.
Cronk said their experience inspired them to ask Rick about a potential collaboration between CISA and the Smithsonian.
“Here I had this connection with the curator of North American archaeology himself, and then I had CISA, which I care about so much, and I mustered up the courage to ask for an opportunity for a partnership between the two,” Cronk said. 
CISA board member Tianna Young (CAS ’25), a member of the Diné tribe, said she saw a variety of Diné objects during CISA’s tour of the museum, ranging from weapons like bows and arrows to more personal belongings like turquoise jewelry and spiritual dolls.
While the trip fascinated Young, she said it also left her conflicted about how to interpret the Natural History Museum’s ownership of over 800 Diné artifacts.
“There’s the big question of ownership, of how this all got here,” Young told The Hoya. “Should I be upset or should I be honored that there are 800 artifacts here? But the answer to that question comes down to the individual, and how they choose to feel about that.”
The artifacts were typically purchased or stolen by wealthy donors or archaeologists to display in the museums’ collections. One such collector, the mining engineer George Gustav Heye, opened the National Museum of the American Indian in 1916 to display and conduct research on his collection of 800,000 pieces, which included a variety of artifacts such as Plains Indian pottery and Diné tribal shirts.
Young will transition with Rachel Two Bulls (CAS ’24) into Cronk’s role as CISA’s head liaison with the Smithsonian when Cronk graduates this spring.
Two Bulls, a member of the Lakota tribe, said visiting the museum, which displays only a small proportion of the Smithsonian’s 825,000 tribal artifacts, was a unique experience, but that it made her consider the implications of keeping so many valuable artifacts in storage.
“It leaves you wondering what you do with these spaces, with these artifacts that don’t see the light of day in this very large facility,” Two Bulls told The Hoya. “There definitely needs to be a conversation about that.” 
Two Bulls said she plans on organizing more tours and meetings between CISA and the Smithsonian in the future, including another tour of the Smithsonian’s other collections.  
“There was just so much for everyone to see and so much for everyone to think about,” Two Bulls said. “I didn’t want to rush.” 
Cronk said they anticipate furthering CISA’s partnership with the Smithsonian even after their graduation to create networking opportunities for Indigenous students interested in anthropological, historical and cultural studies. 
“The resources may have been hoarded, but they still can be used in a positive way for all Indigenous students to discover their heritage,” Cronk said. 
“It’s not always a joyous experience, but it’s an empowering and uplifting one, and it helps them develop as critical thinkers, educators and future leaders,” Cronk added.

The Georgetown University Women’s Center hosted several religious leaders on April 17 to discuss the expansion of roles for women in the Catholic Church. 
The event, “Faith, Feminism, and Being Unfinished: The Question of Women’s Ordination,” discussed the writings of the late theologian Anne E. Patrick, SNJM, a 20th century scholar who researched feminist ethics, conscience, liturgy and contemporary expressions of religious life. 
The panel was moderated by theologian and Georgetown University Women’s Center Associate Director Annie Selak, Ph.D., and Georgetown University Schools of Health and Nursing Chaplain Sister Celeste Mokrzycki, SSJ. 
“This event brings to light the diversity of women’s experiences in the church,” Selak told The Hoya. “In the midst of the ongoing global synod, it is a moment of making visible the many ways that the church, understood as the people of God, is yearning for gender equity.”
The event primarily focused on Patrick’s 1975 essay, “A Conservative Case for the Ordination of Women.” In the essay, Patrick highlights sexism among the clergy and calls for greater acceptance, appreciation and inclusion of women in ministerial and spiritual leadership positions. 
The conversation also came as a response to the October 2022 release of the Vatican synod document “Enlarge the Space of Your Tent,” which includes a global call for inclusivity and expanding roles for women in the church.
“Feminist theology seeks to center the experiences of women and marginalized genders, affirming experience as a source of God’s revelation,” Selak told The Hoya. 
Georgetown invited a panel of female religious leaders to the event to share their thoughts on the question of women’s ordination. 
The panel included Dr. Mary E. Hunt, the co-founder and co-director of the Women’s Alliance for Theology, Ethics, and Ritual (WATER), and Alice McDermott, the award-winning author of “Charming Billy” and “The Ninth Hour.” 
Hunt said that the church needs to expand ordaining privileges in addition to adopting a feminist mindset. 
“Priesthood as currently conceived was inadequate to the needs of those whom priests serve,” Hunt said at the event. “The model of top-down clerical caste-led Church with no shared decision-making simply does not work.” 
McDermott said at the event that the Church has traditionally ignored women’s issues.
“Over the course of my adulthood I have watched our Church abandon the complex moral discussion that pertains to women’s reproductive health in exchange for a simplistic legal solution,” McDermott said. “I’ve seen the leadership of the Church reject the challenge to convince, to counsel, to discern, to preach, in favor of promoting secular laws that will only coerce.” 
Lin Henke (CAS ’23), a current senior studying theology and religious studies, said on the event panel that it is hard to pair her identity with seeking leadership roles in the Church.
“I thought that certain attributes of myself were not compatible with the symbol of God,” Henke said at the event. “When I thought that my voice was too high, or that I wore too much pink, or that no one would ever see me as anything but a silly little girl, I was implicitly using the symbol of the conquering male God to undermine my very self.” 
Leah Raymond (CAS ’26) said the event helped her reflect on her experience with the Church. Raymond was raised Catholic and said that, despite the Church’s strict traditions, women should still feel empowered to enact positive change. 
“I think all women have a moment where they are sad that they will never be able to celebrate Mass,” Raymond told The Hoya. “But I think there is a lot of merit as well — men seem to almost get stuck in the priesthood if they want to religiously contribute to their community, whereas women cannot be priests but have so many other ways to impact their community.” 
Selak said that Georgetown has a unique opportunity and duty to be a pioneer in the movement for more women in the Church. 
“As the first Catholic University in the United States, Georgetown can be a leader on gender justice in the church and in the world,” Selak said. “All of us have a responsibility to work for a more just world and a more just church.”Update: This article was corrected on 4/30 to reflect that the Georgetown University Women’s Center, rather than the Berkley Center, was the main sponsor of the event.

Five students and five external speakers presented on topics ranging from diversity, equity and inclusion to personal adversity during TEDxGeorgetown’s annual conference. 
At the student-organized conference, titled “Seasons for Change,” speakers discussed their battles with change and the power in embracing uncertainty during life’s different “seasons,” such as isolation in winter and hot topics in the summer. The April 23 event was a collaboration between Georgetown University and TED, a global nonprofit organization that aims to spotlight fresh ideas.
The event featured consultant Kia Afcari, a consultant, and Michael Marion, an educational adviser whose talk focused on the importance of education, diversity and freedom. Creative contractor Bilal “Bali” Khan discussed how he turned his struggles with homelessness into motivation to co-start a restaurant for homeless Washingtonians in a conversation titled “Rethinking My American Dream.” 
“Oppression is a jail cell for everybody. It hurts both the oppressed and the oppressor,” Afkari said in his talk. 
The nonprofit TED invites globally known speakers to present on ideas and issues during its broad annual conference. TEDx events allow local speakers to present at conferences following the TED format, with ten speakers presenting for 18 minutes each throughout the conference.
Rithvik Veeramachaneni (CAS ’25), TEDxGeorgetown’s co-chair, said events like TEDxGeorgetown help student speakers develop and gain confidence in their stories. 
“It’s always fulfilling to see a talk go from ideation and brainstorming to a nuanced, inspiring talk that has the potential to reach millions on TEDx’s YouTube account,” Veeramachaneni wrote to The Hoya. “To create this platform for speakers to share their stories and inspire a global audience with their insights has truly been an honor.”
Five Georgetown undergraduate and graduate students also presented at the conference, including Paneez Oliai (CAS ’23), who advocated for taking risks through public speaking, and Umayr Shaikh (MED ’26), who addressed the need for a holistic education in his talk “So, You Want to be a Doctor? Study English!” 
Anna Kutbay (LAW ’25) then reflected on being diagnosed with autism in a talk titled “What My Late-In-Life Autism Diagnosis Taught Me About Change.”
Marissa Nissley (MSB ’24), who discussed how her guide dog changed her view towards independence, said the online presence of TED talks expanded the audience and impact of her talk, allowing more people to identify with her story. 
“The talk itself on Sunday was only a small fraction of what I want this piece to do,” Nissley told The Hoya. “The majority of views for TEDx talks are all on YouTube. They’re online. It’s not just your family and friends in Gaston Hall.”
The event also featured Zahab Kamal Khan, a Pakistani-born professional squash player and holder of two Guinness World Records, who discussed her experience as a woman of color and as a professional athlete, and Dr. Sofia Din, who spoke about her experience as a renowned geriatrician researching non-surgical anti-aging treatments.
Nissley said that the TED platform allowed her to make her topic of disability studies more accessible to the general public. 
“While I was creating my TED talk, I wanted it to be something that people could relate to, even if they didn’t go to Georgetown University, even if they didn’t know me personally, even if they weren’t super familiar with disability justice,” Nissley said. 
Anisa Nanavati (SFS ’26), who discussed embracing emotions and vulnerability during her presentation “Crying: The Path to Happiness” and is the first first-year to speak at a TEDxGeorgetown event, said she aimed to inspire listeners despite her age. 
“As a young person it’s like, ‘What do I know about life?’” Nanavati told The Hoya. “It’s still really cool to be able to share my story and be able to impact people who are much older than me, people that are younger than me and even my peers.”
Nanavati said she encourages students to embrace nervousness when sharing their personal backgrounds and stories. 
“If you have a story, there’s a 100% chance that there’s someone else who will resonate with it,” Nanavati told The Hoya. “The value that someone gets from resonating with a speech that you deliver is so much more valuable than the fear.” 
The value of TEDxGeorgetown’s conference lies in creating engagement between the speaker and the audience, Veeramachaneni said.
“It’s not a motivational speech where someone talks down to you and tells you exactly how to ‘do better,’” Veeramachaneni wrote. “Rather, speakers are offering their reflections on their experiences and suggesting how they may be applicable to audience members’ lives as well. Whether or not an audience member chooses to act on a speaker’s reflections is up to them.”

The Anacostia Watershed Society (AWS) hosted its annual Earth Day Cleanup April 22, with volunteers collecting garbage in the Anacostia River watershed. 
Over 40 corporate, university and family groups from around the DMV picked up trash at over 33 sites around the watershed in Maryland and Eastern Washington, D.C. Participants fished recyclable plastic beverage containers, car parts and tires, among other waste, out of the Anacostia. 
The AWS, a local nonprofit that aims to reduce pollution in the Anacostia River, has been addressing the environmental needs of the river and its watershed communities since 1989. Contamination, sewage overflows and littering have historically polluted the Anacostia.
The Anacostia River stretches 8.7 miles from the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. to the Potomac River. Its watershed covers around 176 square miles of Montgomery County and Prince George’s County in Maryland, as well as most of eastern D.C. 
Emily Conrad, the Anacostia Watershed Society’s director of development, said that the society partnered with companies such as the utilities company Pepco, health care company Kaiser Permanente and Starbucks Coffee for this year’s cleanup. 
“Our annual Earth Day Clean-up is our largest volunteer event of the year, and through the event, we partner with dozens of community organizations, corporate sponsors, and government agencies,” Conrad wrote to The Hoya.
At the 2022 Earth Day cleanup, over 1,300 volunteers pulled out 20.4 tons of trash, including 278 tires, at 34 sites throughout D.C., Prince George’s County and Montgomery County. The AWS expects similar statistics this year.
Ariel Trahan, the AWS’s director of river restoration programs, said the event was difficult to coordinate because it involved more than 40 individual groups simultaneously collecting refuse from different parts of the watershed. The AWS provides supplies for each volunteer and works with waste management companies to remove trash and recycling.
“Lots of planning and coordination goes into the event as we work with many different site leaders and community partners at sites across the watershed,” Trahan wrote to The Hoya.
Conrad said the event brought together community members with many participants who volunteer annually. 
“It is an annual tradition for a lot of families, community groups, and companies to participate, and it’s amazing to talk to folks who have been volunteering at this event for more than a decade,” Conrad wrote. “My favorite part of the event each year is going to a lot of sites and seeing volunteers wearing event shirts from so many previous Earth Day clean-ups.”
Valerie Mallon (CAS ’24) the president of Georgetown University Eco Consultants, a student consulting club that advises local businesses on their environmental impacts, said cleaner water is crucial for businesses and communities near the Anacostia.
“The water can actually be used as a sustainable alternative for businesses that would use the water,” Mallon told The Hoya. “And making sure that it’s clean is one of the most important factors and that has everything to do with whether the species, both flora and fauna, are taken care of.”
The Anacostia has gradually become cleaner due to D.C. government funding toward adding litter control systems and mussels, which are filter-feeding shellfish that can purify water to the river. In its 2022 State of the River report card, the AWS found positive long-term trends in reduced levels of fecal bacteria, increased water clarity and increased vegetation. 
The amount of trash volunteers have collected has decreased as the river has become cleaner, according to Conrad.
“Each year, there seems to be less trash to pick up, which is a positive sign of the river’s rebounding health,” Conrad wrote.
Mallon said effectively cleaning up the Anacostia requires addressing the root causes of pollution, such as climate change.
“I think that the next steps in taking care and improving our environment have everything to do with how we define sustainability,” Mallon said. “Species becoming extinct, communities being polluted, waste piling up nationally and internationally, that often just means that we’re addressing it too late.”

The Georgetown Environmental Justice Program (EJP) hosted a global photography contest’s photo exhibition in the Intercultural Center (ICC) Galleria from April 17 to 22.
The annual photo contest, titled “Faces of Climate Change,” aims to spotlight people fighting against or affected by climate change to raise awareness of global warming’s impact on humans. A jury of photographers, artists and climate experts selected one hundred finalists from around the world, and their photos with accompanying 250-word stories were displayed in the ICC. 
The EJP collaborates with governments, businesses and communities to center local social justice in a future global transition to green energy. Jennifer Eagleton, the EJP’s associate director, said the program wanted to host the Faces of Climate Change to remind the Georgetown community about the individuals most impacted by the climate crisis.
“We were so excited at EJP when we were approached about hosting this exhibition at Georgetown,” Eagleton wrote to The Hoya. “EJP’s work to accelerate just sustainable transitions amplifies their voices. Highlighting the moral as well as scientific urgency of tackling this crisis, these individual voices become part of the global call to each and every one of us to care for our common home.”
During the exhibition, the EJP held a discussion with Nishita Karad, the founder of Faces of Climate Change, and Gaël Giraud, a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy and the EJP’s founding director.
Giraud said he was impressed by Karad’s dedication to giving everyone the opportunity to speak up about the personal effects of climate change.
“Each of us is a witness of the devastating impacts of climate change. The condition is that you open your eyes,” Giraud wrote to The Hoya. “Thus, amateur photographs could compete and provide us with a glimpse of the way people are affected in their area.”
The photo stories focused on one of four themes: faces of the bold, faces of the brave, faces of the past, present and future and faces of the unheard. These “faces” included scientists, flood victims, young people and those from marginalized groups.
Wesley Della Volla, an adjunct lecturer in Georgetown’s environmental studies program, said such stories allow people to better recognize the scale of each other’s struggles with the climate crisis.
“In sharing those human scale stories it gives us something we can wrap our brains around and share with others in a way that’s understandable and relatable,” Della Volla wrote to The Hoya. “In many ways it helps people feel seen and heard when they are experiencing first hand the manifestation of that existential problem because their story matters and people can connect with it and understand what’s happening to them.”
Giraud said real climate justice requires reorienting science away from the Global North and toward marginalized communities in the Global South, which face the most devastating effects of climate change.
“The most affected populations are located in rather poor areas and are those least responsible for Green House Gas emissions or, more broadly, pollution,” Giraud wrote. “I believe that science is absolutely essential but that it must be oriented not towards technophilic or transhumanist fantasies but towards the service of women, children and men who suffer today with their biome.”
According to Giraud, it was important for the entire Georgetown community, not just the student body, to see the Faces of Climate Change exhibition and be exposed to the reality of climate change.
“In Georgetown and, to a lesser extent, in DC, we live in a sort of bubble: in the global South, the ecological crisis is already extremely severe,” Giraud wrote. “The generation of our students is very aware of the cries of distress of the Earth and the poor, but my generation is much less so. So this exhibition is at least as much for the faculty and staff as for our students.”
Although the exhibition is no longer on display, Eagleton said she thinks Georgetown can continue its focus on the human impact of climate change to seek solutions and justice for the climate crisis.
“At EJP where I work, this focus continually sharpens our vision because we collaborate with governments, communities and companies across the world who are impacted by climate change to advance environmental justice that is globally inspired and locally enacted,” Eagleton wrote.

The Georgetown University Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS) will offer 10 new courses on topics ranging from public health to foreign policy in the Fall 2023 semester.
A wide array of expert policy practitioners and academics will teach the new courses that will expand the SFS’s offerings in subject areas including Jewish Civilization and the Middle East and North Africa. Many of the instructors for the new courses will be teaching at Georgetown for the first time, and will bring outside experiences such as serving in the U.S. Foreign Service and working in counterterrorism to the Hilltop through seminars and lectures.
The full list includes seven three-credit courses: “Iran and the Arab Gulf,” “Global Terrorism and Weapons of Mass Destruction,” “Love in the Time of War,” “Lying: Liars Fakes and Frauds,” “Social Construction of Pandemics,” “Economics of International Trade Policies and Agreements” and “Arguing with God: The Bible as Literature.” It also features three one-credit courses: “German Catholics in Hitler’s Army,” “Intro to Military Concepts” and “Gettysburg: Strategy and Tech.”
Meital Orr, an associate teaching professor at the Center for Jewish Civilization, is teaching two courses on the list: “Interfaith Marriage in Literature and Film” and “Arguing with God: The Bible as Literature.”
Orr said her course on interfaith marriage is about an issue that is relevant to current students who are familiar with many religious traditions but experience pressure to marry within their religious group.
“The course is particularly relevant to college students because it provides an
academic context to delve deeper into this very controversial realm that is so immediate to students’ lives,” Orr wrote to The Hoya. “Many are under internal and external pressures to marry within the fold and preserve communal, religious-cultural values, but at the same time they live in a reality of increasing diversity in a modern, pluralistic society and are cognizant of the inevitably of these unions and the benefits they can bring.”
Orr said her class on arguing with God allows students to uniquely approach the Bible through multiculturalism and art. The class will use the Bible itself to challenge the notion that it lacks an interpretive aspect, according to Orr.
“The class incorporates traditional faith interpretations at the same time that it moves far beyond them — and in a multiplicity of genres, eras and cultures — to probe why and how this timeless work of literature persists in its endurance and relevance today and what we have yet to learn from it,” Orr wrote.
Suzanne Brown-Fleming, a Catholic studies and German history researcher and adjunct professor at the Center for Jewish Civilization, is teaching a one-credit class titled “German Catholics in Hitler’s Army.” She said the course will survey how religion impacted soldiers’ battlefield decisions.
“All human beings are faced with choices — at times extreme choices,” Brown-Fleming wrote to The Hoya. “Students will have the opportunity to study human behavior in a war of atrocity, a war of extremes.”
Brown-Fleming said that students will work to understand decisions Catholic soldiers made in the Wehrmacht, the German Army during World War II, through photographs, diary excerpts and film.
“This course will examine the role of Catholics in the Wehrmacht, including its crimes against Jews and other civilians,” Brown-Fleming wrote.
More than 50 students have registered for the three one-credit courses next semester. 
Sebastian Zuba (SFS ’26), who took a one-credit course this semester titled “Water, Science and Society,” said he enjoyed the chance to delve deeper into a topic without the commitment of a full-credit course.
“It’s an opportunity once a week to learn about something you have no idea about,” Zuba told The Hoya. “Without having to dedicate too much of your time and effort, you can connect with your classmates in a really unique way.”
A benefit of a one-credit course like Brown-Fleming’s on Catholic Wehrmacht soldiers is that it exposes students to diverse perspectives, according to Zuba.
“It’s a chance to see a lot of interesting speakers,” Zuba said. “A lot of one-credit classes have outside speakers because a lot of the work you’re doing is experiential. It’s a great chance to connect and learn about an industry.”

The National Cannabis Festival, an annual event held at the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium festival grounds, celebrated progress in marijuana legalization in Washington, D.C., and across the nation April 22.
The festival, which featured concerts, games, contests, food and drinks, served as a reminder of the complicated federal cannabis regulations for District residents.
Groups and artists such as 2Chainz, Juicy J, Free Nationals and Backyard Band performed at the festival. The event also featured various stands with exhibitors, including Weedmaps, a company that uses location information to connect prospective cannabis buyers with ideal strains; Zippo, a company that makes customizable, high-quality lighters; and Takoma Wellness Center, a family-run medical marijuana dispensary. 
Founder Caroline Phillips said she hoped that this year’s festival went beyond a concert and selling space for those involved in the cannabis industry. 
“We hope that the National Cannabis Festival can become sort of like a South by Southwest for cannabis lovers where people are coming here for a full week of policy programming, cultural events and opportunities to network, all capstoned by the festival that takes place over the weekend,” Phillips told The Washington Post.
This year’s festival featured various panels on cannabis policy and politics. Politicians, business owners, economists, journalists and researchers discussed in these sessions solutions to marijuanas issues with legalization.
Andrew Beaujon, a senior editor and reporter at Washingtonian, shared his expertise in a midday panel titled “Legacy Operators and the New Medical Cannabis Amendment Act: What does the Future of Cultivation Look Like in D.C.?” Beaujon was joined by Beau Whitney, a leader in cannabis business consulting; Antione Pritchett II, CEO of a medical marijuana cultivation center; Diana Alvarez, owner of Lit City Smoke Shop; and Terrence White, owner of Monko.
Beaujon and other panelists on the “Legacy Operators” panel delved into the political, racial and socioeconomic implications tied to Initiative 71, a ballot measure in D.C.’s marijuana policy that legalized the possession of up to two ounces of cannabis and the ability to gift up to one ounce to friends or consumers.
Beaujon told The Hoya that it is vital to recognize how race plays into conversations around cannabis in the United States.
“There’s a huge racial component to this. The drug war landed most heavily on Black and Brown people in this country,” Beaujon told The Hoya.
The festival followed the National Cannabis Policy Summit, which occurred April 20 at the Capitol and invited sponsors involved in cannabis legalization. The summit featured Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other politicians, as well as prominent voices in the cannabis policy space. 
Beaujon said that he believes cannabis policy reform in the District may be far in the future and can only happen on the federal level.
“I seriously doubt that’s going to happen in my lifetime. I just don’t see the Republican Party giving up two more Senate seats. I think the action has to happen on the federal level,” Beaujon told The Hoya. “There has to be some kind of legalization.”
Beaujon said that despite his doubts regarding major policy change, the National Cannabis Festival served as a reminder of how cannabis has become an important part of the fabric of American life. 
“Not too long after my panel ended, the skies opened up and there was a biblical rain. I had to walk to my car in that and wait to get out of it,” Beaujon said. “That is all to say, I was really blown away by how many people were there. This is not a tiny, uninteresting part of American life. This is something people really care about.”

The University of Southern California (USC) opened a new “Capital Campus” in Washington, D.C.’s Dupont Circle neighborhood April 19.
The 60,000-square-foot campus, located at 1771 N St. NW, will host both undergraduate and graduate programs for USC students.  
USC President Carol Folt said the opening of the new campus, the only USC campus outside Los Angeles, was an exciting development for the university. 
“Washington, D.C., is the natural place for us to establish a thriving hub,” Folt said in a March press release announcing the campus’s opening. “Washington, D.C., offers unparalleled opportunities for our experts, researchers and students to learn and listen, connect, and share views on the national stage.”
Folt said the Capital Campus will allow USC to develop its curriculum in fields such as medicine and global politics and increase its connections with over 6,000 alumni in the D.C. area. 
“It is a nexus for the arts, public policy organizations, research agencies and foundations,” Folt said of D.C. “We are significantly expanding our academic excellence and innovative research on the East Coast.” 
Dylan Chen, an incoming student at USC and native of Southern California, said he believes the new campus will have a significant impact on the undergraduate population.
“I think USC’s new Capital Campus can be a valuable asset to both student networks and programs,” Chen wrote in a message to The Hoya. “With the campus being in the heart of D.C. I’m sure my peers and I’s potential to become a part of a global community will greatly expand.” 
Dana Goldman, the dean of USC’s Price School of Public Policy, said the Capital Campus will allow USC students to experience D.C.’s political, academic and cultural environment while retaining ties to the university’s main campus in Los Angeles. 
“Undergraduate and graduates will immerse themselves in the politics, business and even the culture of D.C. like never before,” Goldman said in a speech at the opening ceremony. “And if you’re thinking of a career in government service or international relations, what better place to dip your toe in the water to see if it’s the right temperature for you.”
Goldman said the Capital Campus would allow students new opportunities to learn by doing. 
“For our students, the Capital Campus will amplify one of USC’s most cherished values: experiential learning,” Goldman wrote. “For journalism students, imagine attending news briefings on Capitol Hill, having a class taught by a press secretary, and breaking news from our own in-house studio.”  
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said she hoped the new campus will encourage development in Dupont Circle, where the district has been searching for ways to repurpose office space. USC’s Capital Campus building was formerly home to the offices of the National Association of Broadcasters.
“The USC Capital Campus will be catalytic for the northern end of D.C.’s Central Business District,” Bowser wrote in a March press release.
The Capital Campus fits into Bowser’s five-year Comeback Plan, which aims to increase growth in the District through investments in medicine, education and government and to increase the population of Downtown D.C., the mayor said.
“The new campus fits into D.C’s Comeback Plan as we emphasize the strong presence of ‘Feds, Eds and Meds’ in the district,” Bowser wrote. “We cannot wait to welcome Trojans to the nation’s capital as together we ‘fight on’ for D.C.’s comeback.”
Folt said USC’s presence in D.C. will boost the District economically, culturally and academically.
“America’s research universities are a cornerstone of our great democracy. We’re the sources of invention and lifesaving discoveries. We’re the holders of civilization’s knowledge,” Folt said at the opening ceremony. “And together with our cities, we’re the heart and soul of culture; we’re economic engines, and we’re places for discourse and debate about the issues of our day.”

Sarah Stewart Johnson, an associate professor in biology and the Georgetown University Science, Technology and International Affairs (STIA) program, received an award dedicated to scientists whose discoveries offer new insights into previously underexplored areas of study April 14 for her role in the search for life beyond Earth and on Mars.
Johnson accepted the 2023 Roy Chapman Andrews Society Distinguished Explorer Award — an annual prize that acknowledges innovative approaches in field work, including the methods, scope or subjects of a study — at the Beloit Public Library in Beloit, Wis. The award includes a commemorative statue.
Johnson joins a cohort of renowned scientists, including Robert Ballard, who discovered the Titanic, and Sylvia Earle, a marine biologist who holds the record for the deepest walk on the seafloor. Johnson delivered an acceptance lecture at the award ceremony titled “Contending with the Truly Alien,” in which she discussed the foreign nature of other planets. 
Johnson is renowned within and outside the Georgetown community for her scholarship on astrobiology, which focuses on searching for traces of life beyond Earth and, in particular, Mars. Johnson is a former Rhodes scholar and White House fellow. 
Johnson said that her work, which focuses on searching for life on Mars and the limits of life in Antarctica, is based on biological principles. These developments will help spaceflight, an application of astronauts to fly spacecraft into or through outer space either with or without humans on board. 
“Despite massive advances in the last several decades, biology remains a largely descriptive science, in part because we only have one point of reference: life on Earth,” Johnson wrote to The Hoya. “Finding life on Mars, or anywhere beyond Earth, would be as revolutionary as any scientific breakthrough that’s ever been made.”
Johnson opened the Johnson Biosignatures Lab in 2015. The lab is dedicated to planetary analogs, which are locations similar to Earth’s Moon, Mars and asteroids, and biosignatures, which are any character, element, molecule, substance or feature that can be used as evidence for past or present life. 
As part of the Johnson Biosignatures Lab, Johnson and her team of fellows have set up field sites in Antarctica, the Atacama Desert, Iceland, New Zealand and more. The data collected at these sites support the implementation of planetary exploration, the analysis of data from current spacecrafts and the innovation of new techniques for future missions. 
Johnson received her doctorate in philosophy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has worked on NASA’s Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity Rovers. Johnson is also a visiting scientist with the Planetary Environments Lab at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. 
Johnson’s recent book, “The Sirens of Mars,” was selected as one of the New York Times 100 Notable Books of 2020.
Zachariah John (SFS ’25), a STIA major, conducts independent research in Dr. Johnson’s lab regarding survival in extreme climate conditions. 
“I am studying sedimentary samples from dried-up lava tubes in California as an analog for subterranean Martian environments, to see what kinds of life survive in those extreme environments,” John wrote to The Hoya. “Dr. Johnson has taken me in early and allowed me to flourish in the lab. I’m truly grateful to have her as a mentor; she has inspired and spurred me on all at the same time.” 
Maggie Weng, a Ph.D. candidate in Dr. Johnson’s lab, said Dr. Johnson’s mentorship has helped her develop a greater appreciation of the field of astrobiology.
“Sarah’s mentorship has been a huge part of my growth as a scientist,” Weng wrote to The Hoya. “She is fearless in her pursuit of big ideas, even when they lead to challenges in the lab or the field. She is also a wonderful writer, and reading her non-technical work has inspired me on my own writing journey.”
Johnson said astrobiology fascinates her because it challenges the scientific world’s knowledge of the outer boundaries of life.
“Instead of thinking about life as we know it, we are thinking about how to detect life as we don’t know it. It’s a really interesting challenge, like trying to imagine a color you’ve never seen,” Johnson wrote. 
John said he deeply appreciates Johnson’s mentorship and support.
“Dr. Johnson provides not only a very unique perspective in her wide swath of experiences and achievements, but she provides a helpful and compassionate personality among the faculty,” John wrote.

Katherine Perez joined Georgetown University on April 17 as the new chief of the Georgetown University Police Department (GUPD).
Perez, GUPD’s first female chief, will lead the university’s on-campus law enforcement organization, which maintains security on Georgetown’s main campus as well as its graduate, law and medical schools.
“The more I learned about the University, the more intrigued I became,” Perez wrote to The Hoya. “I took several trips to the school to look around and observe, then I applied.”
Perez has worked in law enforcement for over 40 years in a broad range of positions. During 20 years in the Hartford, Conn. Police Department, she rose to the rank of captain before becoming the chief of the District Heights Police Department and the first chief of police of the Bowie Police Department in Maryland. 
The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) and the Georgetown Graduate Student Government (GradGov) were both involved in Perez’s selection process, organizing student interviews and giving their feedback on the applicants for chief, according to GUSA President Camber Vincent (SFS ’24). 
“The student interviews for the candidates were an informal step of the process for members of GUSA, and some invited to GradGov, to meet the candidates and ask specific questions of the candidates for a feedback and recommendation form,” Vincent wrote to the Hoya.
Vincent said GUSA based its questions on the qualities it sought for the new leader of GUPD, such as compassion and resourcefulness, and their applicability to real world situations.
“We were looking for empathy and a chief who could take GUPD in a new direction off the course they were currently following,” Vincent wrote. “We asked questions to hear about how they would establish programs on or deal with bias, sexual assault, off campus safety, intruders, and other issue areas.”
Most recently, Perez was the assistant chief of police for the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors at their Washington, D.C. headquarters. The Board of Governors manages the Federal Reserve System banks and financial policies. 
At Georgetown, Perez will replace Jay Gruber, who had served concurrently as associate vice president for Public Safety and chief of police since July 2012. Gruber now serves only as associate vice president for Public Safety and chief public safety officer; as GUPD chief, Perez will work under him. 
Perez’s responsibilities as chief incorporates a wide range of safety precautions and programs to strengthen the security of Georgetown and its students, according to a university spokesperson.
In the past, students of color have expressed concern over GUPD, with a disproportionate number of Black students saying they have been stopped by GUPD officers in comparison to white students, according to the university’s 2021 campus climate survey. Students have also reported hyper policing on campus, with students of color saying they have experienced excessive use of force and unnecessary surveillance. 
Vincent said that he recommended that the university choose Perez as their final candidate 
because she demonstrated the qualities and the experience that he thought was necessary for the job.
“She clearly brought a new perspective to the table from her personal background and her professional background,” Vincent wrote. “I am excited that we will have a new face in GUPD and can’t wait to see Chief Perez get started.” 
Perez said she aims to develop stronger partnerships across campus through initiatives such as the Student Safety Advisory Board (SSAB), which works with GUPD to ensure officers adhere to standards of justice and equality while protecting students’ safety, to make the department’s work more effective and more inclusive.
“My years in law enforcement allowed me to have an incredible cadre of partners at all levels of public safety, and it is through partnerships that law enforcement can truly be effective in the goal of keeping a community safe, informed and engaged,” Perez said in a university press release.
Perez said she plans to approach her new position with an attitude of listening and learning.
“I want to build upon the great work that has been done thus far and continue to be inclusive, transparent and present in the quest to keep the Georgetown community safe and secure,” Perez wrote. “I am looking forward to this opportunity and getting to know the Georgetown community.”

U.S. Marine Corps veteran and author Phil Klay discussed at an April 18 event the interaction between theology, art and society in his three award-winning books — as well as the role of faith and humanity throughout his life.
The Office of President John J. DeGioia and the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace & World Affairs, a teaching and research center committed to advancing peaceful cooperation, hosted the event. Vice President of Mission and Ministry Mark Bosco began the event by presenting Paul Elie, a Senior Fellow at the Berkley Center, who moderated the conversation with Klay.
Klay said that because of his upbringing, he identified as Catholic for most of his life until his time in the military. 
“After Afghanistan, I stopped believing in God because it made it easier, because it meant there were some questions I didn’t have to ask,” Klay said at the event.
Klay said witnessing the extreme disfigurement of children contributed to his loss of faith, compounded with the feeling of victory and growing peace on both sides near the end of his deployment.
“I’d never seen the kind of injuries that bombs do to bodies before,” Klay said. “By the end of my deployment, violence just dropped and everybody felt like we’re winning. So it felt to me like the world was this rational, controllable place, and the faith just kind of withered away.”
Klay graduated from Regis High School — one of the most prestigious, all-male Catholic high schools in the United States —  in 2001, after which he served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2005 to 2009. Klay’s first collection of short stories, “Redeployment,” won the National Book Award for Fiction in 2014.
“Redeployment” is a collection of 12 stories that all follow people entrenched in war. The novel recounts the horrors of war as well as moments of faith and hope.
Klay also read the first page of “Missionaries” at the event.“Missionaries” is Klay’s first novel, which follows four American and Colombian individuals post September 11, 2001. Klay said the novel, which was one of Barack Obama’s favorite books of 2020, exemplifies the human cost of battle and counters the prevalent dehumanization of war by highlighting what makes a human, human.
Klay said keeping one’s humanity during war is crucial for analyzing one’s actions on a moral, spiritual and political level.
“I think that having a richer sense of what a human being is, is just necessary for understanding what you’re doing when you’re waging war, what you’re doing when you’re killing people, and that’s essential,” Klay said.
“‘A person is what happens when there is a family and a town, a place where you’re known,’” Klay read from “Missionaries.”
Klay said he was not a pacifist and supported war on some occasions despite condemning the violence and death of war in his literature.
“I’m not wholly opposed to every aspect of American war,” Klay said. “There are places where I’m very glad that we have American troops.”
Klay said encounters with others off the battlefield illuminated the fragility of life and allowed him to envision a more concrete future with his family, which transformed him from an atheist back into a believer in God.
“I had this like image moving forward in time,” said Klay, of him and his wife “growing all together as us at the end of our lives. And after that experience, I drove slower, because I didn’t need to get my kicks from being a thrill seeker anymore.”
Robert Fanciullo (MSB ’23), an event attendee, said he was fascinated with how Klay interweaves violence and peace in his novels.
“I enjoyed Klay’s use of acts of war and acts of terror as tools when illustrating a narrative, rather than just having them as very suspenseful moments.” Fanciullo told The Hoya. “This unique artistic tool helps him convey a different message than seen in most other war novels.”
Fanciullo said he is ultimately impressed with how Klay communicates his message in writing.“He’s a great novelist,” Fanciullo said.

The Center for Contemporary Arab Studies (CCAS) partnered with several organizations to host a conference April 14-15 honoring the evolving legacy of the Druze, a tight-knit religious group most populous in Lebanon and Syria whose tradition reflects pre-modern elements of Hinduism, Islam and Greek philosophy.
The CCAS collaborated with the American Druze Foundation (ADF), a group dedicated to preserving Druze heritage in the United States, and the department of history and archeology at the American University of Beirut (AUB) for the two-day conference, “The Druze in their Adopted Lands,” which featured panels, lectures and receptions. Conference speakers included Michael Provence, a history professor at the University of California San Diego; Makram Rabah (GRD ’16), a history professor at the AUB; and Chad Radwan, an anthropologist.
Provence opened the conference with a lecture on Druze culture and the Druze diaspora, sharing that there are nearly a million Druze worldwide, with many living in South America as well as Australia, Canada and the United States. Provence said the conference allowed participants to share conflicting and diverse perspectives, something he said is crucial to further conversations. 
“It was a great collaboration, and, I think, a smashing success,” Provence told The Hoya. “We had big attendance for the whole time, from Friday afternoon until Saturday afternoon, little arguments here and there, I suppose, about recent history and what it means. That is how we know we’re doing good work — when people have a response. The worst thing is indifference.”
Provence said the conference brought together diverse perspectives on the Levant, a region located along the Mediterranean coast that includes countries with large Druze populations.
“As we know from recent American history, the way that people think about the Middle East is not reflected in the way that people who live there think about it and what their priorities are,” Provence said. “We got to see things from all, from a whole bunch of really important viewpoints.”
The Druze hold significant influence in Lebanon, where the politically prominent Jumblatt family, who are adherents to the Druze religion, held power throughout the late 20th century. In neighboring Syria, however, militant groups have persecuted the Druze, which analysts say has fostered political unity in Lebanon as leaders seek to avoid similar strife in the country.
The Saturday portion of the conference included a lecture from Radwan about the Druze in North America, who number approximately 40,000 individuals. Radwan said he incorporated his Druze identity to shape his approach to the conference.
“The fact remains, that as a Druze, my identity allows me a greater capacity to understand the aspects of my identity that I share with research participants,” Radwan wrote to The Hoya. “I also greatly appreciated getting to know other Druze scholars not of Druze descent and I can recognize their work and perspectives as making key contributions that benefit the field of Middle Eastern studies, particularly among ethnic and religious minority groups like the Druze.”
Provence said he tried to make his academic arguments at the conference accessible to all audience members.
“I was trying to strike a balance,” Provence said. “I didn’t want to overwhelm everybody with complicated and sort of incomprehensible academic arguments, and I also didn’t want to seem like I was being simple-minded to my colleagues in the academic departments at Georgetown and at AUB.”
Benan Grams, a social historian and the ADF fellow at CCAS, said she feels the conference’s wide range of attendees and speakers reflected its commitment to the Druze.
“The organization as well as the funding of such an event reflects the ongoing interest and commitment of the American Druze in the United States to producing knowledge on the history of their community,” Grams wrote to The Hoya. “Participants as well as the audience came from several parts of the United States and some came from Lebanon to attend this conference and discuss the papers presented.” 
Provence said his time as a Fulbright Scholar in Lebanon and Syria turned his life’s trajectory toward studying the region. Provence said he encourages students to pursue similar opportunities that expose them to an array of diverse perspectives.
“I had three and a half years of Fulbright support,” Provence said. “It was, as I say, a completely transformative experience.”
More research regarding the Druze community will empower its members both in the Levant and in diaspora communities, according to Radwan.
“It is my belief that individuals in the Druze community may feel more recognized when they witness scholars dedicating their time and energy to expanding knowledge on the Druze in a variety of fields, such as history, sociology, the arts, and even epidemiology,” Radwan wrote.
Grams said she appreciated how the structure of the conference enabled participants to profile the Druze in a multitude of unique ways.
“The conference was organized thematically, with each panel addressing an aspect that is important to the religious, social and cultural history of the Druze community in Lebanon and Syria,” Grams wrote. “The conference provided a rich and wide spectrum of themes and views.”
