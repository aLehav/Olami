Fr. Richard Curry, S.J., a professor in the Catholic studies department, was hospitalized Monday due to complications from pneumonia.
He is in the intensive care unit at the Medstar Washington Hospital Center in Northwest D.C., according to Fr. Eugene Nolan S.J., an administrator in the Jesuit community.
“His family and members of his Jesuit community are keeping watch and request no visitors until further notice,” Nolan wrote in an email to THE HOYA.
Curry joined the Society of Jesus in 1962 and was ordained as a priest in 2009. He began teaching at Georgetown in the spring of 2010.
Curry has had a profound effect on several of his students, according to Christina Costa (COL ’13), who has taken two classes with him.
“Since I’ve met him I’ve told all my friends and family that he’s changed my life,” she said. “I saw him as a professor but [also as] a great friend.”
This semester, Curry is teaching two classes, Theater as Prayer and Theater and the Catholic Imagination.
He is also the founder and director of the Academy for Veterans at Georgetown, which works in collaboration with the National Theatre Workshop of the Handicapped and Atlas Medical Research to aid veterans’ return to civilian life. Curry is a published cookbook author and founded a bakery staffed by handicapped and returning veterans. He also directs the National Theater of the Handicapped in New York City.
Costa said she was unaware that Curry was ill until he was hospitalized.
“He’s a really strong person,” Costa said. “Everyone’s hoping he’s going to get through this. … He’s a really important person to have around.”
