Aiming to provide a 10-year blueprint for the improvement of student life, GUSA released the final version of its Student Life Report Monday.
Some of the report‘s recommendations, such as hiring a professional director of club sports and adding satellite offices for the Center for Social Justice, will require significant cooperation from student organizations and the university administration in order to be enacted.
Report Committee Chair Shuo Yan Tan (SFS ’12) cautioned that while the suggestions are specific, they are intended to catalyze conversation rather than prescribe exact changes.
“The recommendations are specific, but step back and say this is just a small inkling of the possibilities,” Tan said. “Ultimately, there’s so much more that can be done.”
The report is the first comprehensive set of recommendations for improving student life since the Georgetown University Student Association released a similar document in 1999. That report led to the establishment of the Club Sports Advisory Board and laid the groundwork for Student Activities Fee Endowment reform.
This year, the committee scrutinized the university’s five advisory funding boards. The document also examines intellectual life and university regulations related to student life.
Tan listed the three most notable recommendations as the centralization of student space reservations, enhancement of student intellectual life and the addition of a sixth advisory board encompassing groups providing alcohol-free programming.
The report recommends a merger of the Georgetown Program Board and What’s After Dark. That new entity would collaborate with the Lecture Fund as members of the sixth advisory board focused on offering low-cost events, like concerts and lectures.
Other recommendations include giving student organization officers online access to their finances, codifying student organization sanctions and increasing opportunities for faculty-student interaction.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson noted that many of the recommendations, such as weekly office hours held by Olson and University President John J. DeGioia, are aligned with initiatives that the university is currently pursuing.
According to Olson, the administration wants to look seriously at the report’s recommendations and identify areas in which it wants to improve.
“We want to engage in ongoing conversations with students,” Olson said. “All these issues are very much worth talking about.”

Two male students were robbed at gunpoint of more than $2,000 worth of cash and other property Sunday night, according to a Metropolitan Police Department incident report.
The students told MPD that they were walking near N and 33rd Streets when they saw the two suspects, both described as black males wearing dark clothing, standing against a fence. One of the suspects asked the students for a cigarette, and both students turned.
One of the suspects then brandished a handgun and told the victims to “shut the [expletive] up” while the other searched through the victims’ pockets and took their property.
After the theft, the suspects told the two students to turn around and count to 10. The suspects then fled toward Wisconsin Avenue.
The robbery was the second of two unrelated incidents to occur on N Street Sunday. At about 2 a.m. that day, a female student reported that she believed she was sexually assaulted on the 1400 block of36th Street, a block from the front gates.
Though she could not remember the details of the incident, the victim told MPD that she either fell or was pushed to the ground by a white college-aged male with a buzz cut. The suspect was described as wearing a dark shirt and blue jeans.
The victim, who suffered abrasions to the face, was interviewed at the scene by MPD detectives and agreed to go to the hospital later with a friend.
These crimes are part of a string of incidents marking an overall increase in crime during the past month.
The Department of Public Safety reported 57 crimes on and around campus in February, a 67 percent increase from the same period last year and a 15 percent increase since January, when 48 cases were reported.
Fifteen of February’s cases are severe enough that they are being handled by MPD, more than double the seven cases referred to MPD in January.
A slight increase in theft contributed to the jump in overall crime incidents. DPS reported 25 cases of theft this month, compared to 20 in February 2011 and 22 in January 2012.
However, burglaries, which involve breaking and entering while thefts do not,  declined significantly, falling to two from nine cases in January.
The month also saw a greater incidence of harassment than any recent month. Five cases have been reported since Feb. 1, while none were reported in January.
The remaining cases include two cases of destruction of property, five cases of public indecency and three drug violations.
Of the 57 incidents reported, 15 were referred to MPD, eight were closed by DPS, eight were referred to student conduct and 26 are still pending investigation.

A proposed $0.66-per-mile fare increase for D.C. taxicabs could take effect within the next month.
The proposal was first submitted in December. It was amended earlier this month and is now being considered by the D.C. Taxicab Commission.
After revisions, the plan includes an increased per-mile rate of $2.16 from $1.50, an increased waiting time rate of $25 per hour from $15 and a 50-cent charge per piece of baggage handled by the driver. The starting rate will remain at $3.
“We thought that at airports where drivers put luggage in the trunk, they ought to be compensated for it,” D.C. Taxicab Commission Chairman Ron Linton said.
Linton said that reactions from passengers have been positive, but for some students, the increase in the per-mile rate will create challenges.
“Since we have no Metro stop and the [Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle] buses are running more and more infrequently, taxis are really important to students,” Craig Melcher (MSB ’13) said. “This fare increase will definitely make it more difficult to get around.”
The proposed changes will be voted on after a 30-day public comment period.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the D.C. Council, not the D.C. Taxicab Commission, was considering the rate increase. The corrected version was posted at 12:56p.m. Wednesday afternoon.

Student organizations requested over $1.484 million at the annual Georgetown University Student Association Budget Summit Sunday.
The GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee has about $960,000 to allocate this year due to the increase of the Student Activities Fee to $150 per student. This increase was approved as part of the Student Activities Fee and Endowment Reform referendum in December 2010.
GUSA itself was the only organization that did not request more funding. The newly elected executives, Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13), requested $23,400. GUSAPresident Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) requested $28,000 last year.
The Georgetown University Lecture Fund, which moved under the purview of the Student Activities Commission in 2005 for greater freedom over its operations, returned to GUSA for funding this year.
According to Lecture Fund Chair John Gwin (SFS ’12), the group is requesting funds from GUSAbecause of the stipulations SAC has imposed on its budget.
Each of the five student organization advisory boards requested more funding Sunday than last year. Despite the removal of the Lecture Fund, which comprised 17 percent of SAC’s budget in the fall semester, from under SAC’s jurisdiction, the commission asked for over $205,000, an increase of $125,500 from last year’s request.
According to SAC Chair Jack Appelbaum (COL ’14), increased funding would accommodate newly formed student groups and expand the commission’s newly formed ad hoc account, which allows groups to propose events not originally included in their budgets during the semester.
“There [are] a lot of needs among clubs and organizations, and SAC’s budget reflects that,” GUSA’s Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) said.
The Performing Arts Advisory Council requested $255,640 for a new air conditioner in the Poulton Hall Theater and other renovations, requests which were made last year but denied by GUSA.
Fin/App Committee members again questioned the legitimacy of allocating student activities fees for such purposes.
According to Malkerson, those issues should be paid for by University Facilities and Student Housing.
The Center for Social Justice Advisory Board for Student Organizations requested $204,987 to fund additional Alternative Spring Break trips due to a record number of applications this year. It also targeted $7,000 of its requested fund to make the Kino Border Immersion trip, which currently receives most of its funds from Campus Ministry, an institutionalized Alternative Spring Break Trip.
Director of Student Programs Erika Cohen-Derr represented the Center for Student Programs and requested $16,489 for the purpose of purchasing a golf cart to help CSP programs operate more efficiently. Cohen-Derr promised to look into cheaper vendors when Fin/App Committee member Yupang Chang (MSB ’15) questioned the high cost.
“We’ll try to fulfill the requests, but I don’t think anyone will get the entire amount they requested. The math just doesn’t work,” Malkerson said.
The Fin/App Committee will issue a draft budget Wednesday, which will then be open to comment by clubs and the public. The GUSA Senate will ratify the finalized budget after spring break.

Campus Society, a social network slated for release to D.C. university students this spring, aims to combine the social and professional spheres.
Founders Rashid Ajami (COL ’12) and his cousin Oliver Muller intend to only allow users with university-affiliated email addresses to register and leave posts related to campus life on their universities’ profiles.
“With all of these social networks like Facebook and Twitter, you start with your own profile, so we thought, what if we take the university and make that the profile instead?” Ajami said. “It’s a bit of a different concept.”
Ajami and Muller see the website, which they have been developing for six months, as a solution to the lack of online overlap between the academic and social aspects of college. Muller, who works at Standard Chartered Bank in Dubai, is responsible for the financial side of the project, while Ajamiserves as the university connection. The pair has also enlisted creative design and marketing experts.
According to Muller, each campus will have its own page where users can view and post messages, as well as apply filters to tags so that they focus on specific areas of interest, such as tutoring, complaints and housing.
“We wanted to create a website that would make life for students easier by putting everything concentrated in one place,” Muller said.
According to Sophia Chumburidze, head of marketing, the site also has the potential to serve as an important tool for networking and career building.
“There’s going to be a large alumni portion to it as well, so that you can maintain your contacts and network after you graduate,” she said.
Muller and Ajami said they have already secured close to $1 million for use in the website’s first year and hired 10 interns from Georgetown and The George Washington University.
Campus Society will launch at Georgetown, GWU, American University and George Mason University. Muller and Ajami anticipate making Georgetown’s page available first before introducing the other three school’s sites.

The School of Foreign Service is exploring the possibility of offering more business classes within its curriculum due to student interest.
The potential decision to incorporate more business classes was catalyzed by student feedback SFSAcademic Council President Lucas Stratmann (SFS ’12) personally received from peers.
The council emailed a survey to all SFS undergraduates Wednesday in order to gauge opinions on the addition of the business courses. The results will be compiled after this coming Wednesday.
“I can’t say how realistic the chances are,” Stratmann said. “If there’s a certain demand, there’s a good chance that there will be business classes.”
The administration has yet to formulate a timeline for the inclusion of business classes in its programs. It also has not decided whether it would offer business classes specific to SFS students or incorporate McDonough School of Business classes into the curriculum.
One concern with the addition of business classes is a possible overlap with the International Business Diplomacy certificate. The certificate combines the political and economic focus of the SFS with more business-oriented coursework, including accounting and finance, and emphasizes the role of business in international relations.
Stratmann said that the popularity of the certificate was a major reason for the decision to potentially add a wider array of business coursework to the SFS.
“It makes sense,” he said. “A lot of SFS alumni are going into business or investment banking, and many students are also interested in seeing how business interacts with international relations.”
Jerrod MacFarlane (SFS ’15) shares Stratmann’s sentiment that business classes will add a new dimension to the SFS curriculum.
“I think it’s a really good idea,” MacFarlane said. “Business classes in the SFS will help us to see both the political and economic ties throughout the world.”

In less than a semester, Georgetown Leaders for Unity and Equity has evolved from an idea into an organization that meets weekly to encourage dialogue and design plans of action that address diversity issues.
Co-founder Stephanie Frenel (SFS ’12) felt compelled to start the organization, which meets every Thursday, in order to confront the frustration she has felt while dealing with diversity issues on campus.
The group is centered on conversations about race and related to race and its cultural associations. An integral part of these discussions is the developed of the plans of action, or an ideal plan to address specific issues within the community. The meetings are led by the six board members and have recently been opened to all interested students.
“One of the reasons we keep coming back is because we can talk about racial tensions in a place that isn’t strictly about unity,” Communications Coordinator Elisa Manrique (COL ’14) said.
While the group aims to foster conversation, GLUE’s leaders understand that race and related issues can be contentious topics.
“We’ve come to know this is an uncomfortable issue that hits everyone differently,” Co-chair Jescinta Izevbigie (SFS ’14) said.
However, according to Co-chair Carly Rosenfield (COL ’14), tackling tough issues is one of the group’s goals.
“There is value in having conversations in a comfortable place,” she said. “However, there is immense value in being uncomfortable.”
The group is working to expand its presence on campus by promotings its blog and targeting students who are interested in social justice. Rosenfield emphasized the importance of continuing to reach out to students.
“The idea that we’re in a post-racial society is becoming more prominent, but there is more progress to be made,” Rosenfield said.

As the cost of subscriptions to scientific journals continues to rise, academics at the university and across the world have begun to voice their frustrations.
More than 7,300 researchers have joined a boycott of Elsevier, a prominent publisher of science journals.
The protest began in January, when Timothy Gowers, a mathematics professor at Cambridge University, declared in a blog post that he would no longer edit, contribute to or referee Elsevier publications.
Gowers’ announcement came a little more than a month after two Representative Darrell Issa (R-Calif) introduced the Research Works Act for consideration by the House of Representatives. The bill would make it illegal for federally funded research organizations to require scientists to make their studies freely accessible online and originally garnered support from Elsevier and other publishers.
Since the start of the boycott, thousands of researchers, including Georgetown chemistry professor Richard Weiss, have joined Gowers. In response, Elsevier retracted its support of the RWA in a statement issued Monday.
Elsevier is not the only for-profit company in the academic publishing industry, but according to many professors, it has built a reputation for overpricing its materials.
“Of all the publishers, Elsevier is the one that gives the most concern,” Wesley Mathews, a professor in the physics department, said. “Elsevier is a strictly commercial publisher. They’re in it for profit.”
Journals like Elsevier bundle article access according to subject, forcing subscribers to purchase articles they may not want in order to read the articles they’re looking for.
According to Gwen Owens, head of the Blommer Science Library, purchasing three bundles could cost more than $100,000.
Though the university already has print copies of most important journals, it is willing to pay database fees for the ease of online access, Owens said.
“We’re paying not for the intellectual content of the material. We’re paying for the convenience of people being able to access it from their desktop or at home,” she said.
Chemistry department chair YuYe Tong agreed.
“For science, particularly physics and chemistry, archival is very important,” he said. “How easy it is to access the [archives] beyond 10 years has become a very important part of scientific research.”
In 2010, 272,871 full-text Elsevier articles were requested by Georgetown users, a figure that increased to 278,884 articles in 2011.
Tong emphasized that rising costs have negatively impacted scientific advancement because they affect scientists’ use of previously published findings.
“They charge such high prices to the library that it impedes the scientists’ [ability to] access collectively the work that they have done,” he said.
In a press release responding to the boycott, Elsevier noted that the average cost of downloading an article has never been lower and is one-fifth of the cost it was a decade ago.
But Owens countered that, for Georgetown, the average price for a chemistry journal subscription rose more than 24 percent from 2006 to 2011, while the cost of the average biology journal subscription increased by more than 40 percent.
According the Mathews, the impact of rising journal costs will grow this summer with the completion of work on Regents Hall, the university’s new science facility.
“The number of [postdoctoral fellows] associated with the sciences will double, the number of graduate students will probably double and the number of undergraduate [science] majors will go up substantially as well,” Mathews said. “There are going to be a lot more people who will need access to the scientific literature.”
According to Owens, other libraries have begun to cancel some of their subscriptions.
“There’s got to be a point at which we say we can’t do this anymore, and some major universities have already hit that point where they’re starting to cancel journals,” she said. “When enough libraries hit that point, [the publishers’] market is diminishing. They can’t keep bleeding us.”
However, Mathews said that increased costs may play a role in rising prices.
“They are in business to make a buck and it’s an area where making a buck is increasingly difficult,” he said.
Still, Tong hopes that the boycott, combined with recent efforts by the National Institutes of Health and other organizations, will help increase access.
“Slowly, slowly maybe online publication and free open access will force those for-profit companies to lower their prices,” Tong said. “In this regard, I think this boycott is doing a good service for the scientific community.”
Representatives of Elsevier declined to comment.
