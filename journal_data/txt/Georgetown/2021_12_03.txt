Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Acting Vice President Thomas Leonard (COL ’23) will be up for confirmation as vice president of GUSA at a Senate meeting Dec. 5. 
GUSA President Nile Blass (COL ’22) nominated Leonard to replace Vice President Nicole Sanchez (COL ’22), according to Leonard. Leonard announced his nomination via his public LinkedIn profile the afternoon of Dec. 1; Leonard confirmed the news in an interview with The Hoya that evening. Sanchez officially announced her resignation via a public Twitter statement on Dec. 2. 
Sanchez is taking a medical leave of absence but will remain involved with ongoing GUSA projects, according to a statement she posted on her public Twitter. 
“I’m so grateful for all the amazing work I was able to get done with amazing people,” Sanchez wrote.
According to GUSA Senate Speaker Leo Rassieur (COL ’22), Sanchez’s decision deserves respect, and the former vice president still plans to assist GUSA.
“I hope that everyone respects Nicole’s decision to step down, and I know that she has full faith in the rest of the GUSA leadership team, including Thomas, to continue the important work we do to help marginalized communities at Georgetown,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In a Slack message sent to all GUSA members obtained by The Hoya, Blass said that Leonard will be sworn in at the Senate meeting Dec. 5. However, according to GUSA’s constitution, Leonard must receive a majority vote of the Senate in order to be sworn into office following his nomination. GUSA leadership did not formally inform GUSA staff of the decision until the afternoon of Dec. 2, according to Slack messages from Blass and Sanchez.
Amid the transition of power, GUSA leaders experienced a lack of communication from remaining staff members; before speaking to The Hoya on Dec. 2, GUSA Executive intern Gitanjali Reddy (COL ’25) had not been informed by remaining GUSA leaders of Leonard’s nomination for vice president. 
“The executive staff meetings have been canceled for the past couple of weeks,” Reddy said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I didn’t even know Thomas was being sworn in as vice president.”
According to Reddy, the last time the whole executive staff met together was in late November, as GUSA members have primarily been working on separate group projects, including the National College Consortium and the GU272 petition released Dec. 1.
GUSA Senator Zev Burton (SFS ’22) also said he was not aware of the leadership change. 
“I was made aware of her resignation by a tweet from The Hoya,” Burton wrote in a text message to The Hoya.
Working as chief of staff served as preparation for stepping into the role of vice president, according to Leonard.
“As chief of staff, my roles were very much so related to support staff tasks, such as making sure everyone in the organization was healthy as a person, as a student, as a member of GUSA,” Leonard said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It was sort of a natural function of my accomplishments within the organization to step up as vice president.”
Leonard has shown energy and commitment toward GUSA matters and will transition smoothly into the position, according to GUSA Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (COL ’22).
“I think Thomas will do a fantastic job,” Flores wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He has been helping with a lot of policy advocacy and has been at the forefront of many conversations with the administration on issues such as dining and student safety.”
According to Leonard, his transition into the role of vice president will be a continuation of the work he has already done at GUSA. 
“My responsibility has always been to advocate on behalf of students who are vulnerable at a university like Georgetown,” Leonard said. “My serving as vice president is sort of meant to continue carrying out those goals, more broadly.”
Former GUSA Community Outreach Director Genevieve Grenier (MSB ’24) will take Leonard’s place as chief of staff, a position that does not require senate confirmation, according to Grenier.
“I am honored to take on the job, and I am excited to keep doing the important work to serve our community,” Grenier wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Leonard, if confirmed, will serve Georgetown students in a beneficial way, according to Flores.
“I will be supporting Leonard’s confirmation on Sunday and hope that my peers in the Senate feel the same way,” Flores said. 
This article was updated Dec. 3 to correct Reddy’s title which was incorrectly labeled on GUSA’s website.

Gaston Hall erupted in deafening applause as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took to the stage for a Nov. 30 discussion with the Georgetown University community. 
The event, titled “A Conversation with Senator Elizabeth Warren on Leveling the Playing Field,” was hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics). Rebecca Pearcey, a GU Politics fall fellow and former political director and senior advisor for Warren’s presidential campaign, moderated the discussion.
Throughout the event, Warren discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable communities, such as low-income Americans, and legislative policy for increasing equity in the United States. 
The first step to leveling the playing field in the wake of the pandemic is to see healthcare as a form of infrastructure that needs to be improved in an effort to better meet the needs of struggling Americans, according to Warren.
“The difference between having housing and not having housing is a huge health issue, as well as an education issue,” Warren said at the event. “These things link up, and we have to think about health infrastructure — it’s also about transportation, it’s also about housing, it’s also about food security — and so if we build out in that direction, it helps us all.”
The pandemic also exacerbated racial injustice in America, as Black Americans are 2.4 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than white Americans and are less likely to have access to COVID-19 tests and treatments. Barriers like lack of access to insurance protection, transportation or child care can prevent minorities from accessing healthcare.
When Pearcey asked how the country should move forward after the pandemic disproportionately impacted Black and Brown individuals, Warren highlighted the work of Ibram X. Kendi, an anti-racist activist, historian of race policy and author of “Stamped From the Beginning.” Warren utilized Kendi’s expertise to explain what it means to move forward while prioritizing anti-racism.   
“For me, it’s Ibram Kendi and anti-racism,” Warren said. “It is not enough to write a policy that so long as you didn’t deliberately discriminate against someone overtly and use words that say ‘not that group’ then it’s okay. The answer is you must stop and ask yourself with every one of these policies, what’s going on here? And who does this effect? And how is this affecting communities that have been left behind?”
Another way to level the playing field is by investing in children and parents in an effort to prioritize people who are going back to work in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic across America, according to Warren. 
“It’s universal childcare and pre-K, the best dollars that we can spend to invest in our babies,” Warren said. “Particularly when we’re talking about childcare, when we invest in our babies, we’re investing in our moms and dads so they can go back to work.”
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Build Back Better Act on Nov. 19. The bill includes expanded access to child care and prekindergarten, a minimum corporate tax and other provisions intended to tackle climate and healthcare. However, Senate Republicans enacted the filibuster to block much of the Biden administration’s agenda, so the act will face an uphill battle in the Senate. 
When asked by a student at the event about progressive tax policy, Warren advocated for a wealth tax she introduced during her presidential campaign, the Ultra-Millionaire Tax, that would tax the top 0.1% of Americans and generate $3.75 trillion in revenue that could be used to fund child care, eliminate student debt and improve infrastructure.
“Three trillion dollars over 10 years and we can make an investment in anybody and everybody under 25,” Warren said. “We should give them a real boost, just that one bit, and that’s what we need to do. We need to change tax law in America so that it focuses on those at the very top and says we are going to invest across the board in developing opportunities for all young people in this nation.”
Racial and socioeconomic inequalities in the United States continue to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as billionaires have gained $1 trillion dollars while millions of Americans struggle with poverty.
Warren left students in the audience with a final piece of advice, encouraging them to engage in fights that are difficult, as they often become most impactful.
“You have to be willing to get into fights that you could lose,” said Warren. “If you’re always going to fight fights you can win, then that cannot be the test, because we will not make real change under the circumstances. What’s always tough to evaluate is if you’re going to lose this one, is the fight nonetheless important? And I mean well worth it. And the answer sometimes is you bet it is.”

At an event titled “Georgetown F*cking Lied,” the Georgetown University Student Association’s (GUSA) GU272 advocacy team demanded Georgetown pay reparations to descendants of enslaved people sold by the university. 
The Dec. 1 discussion came two years after students voted in favor of a GUSA referendum to establish a semesterly fee for undergraduate students of $27.20 to create a reconciliation fund to be allocated to descendants of the GU272, the 314 enslaved people sold by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus in 1838 to financially sustain the university. However, Georgetown University did not enact the fee and instead announced in 2019 its intentions to establish a $400,000 reconciliation fund. GUSA hosted the event to keep the memory of GU272 and the 2019 referendum alive among the student body, according to  GUSA Chief of Staff Genevieve Grenier (MSB ’24). 
Georgetown must provide reparations, according to descendant Julia Thomas (COL ’24), who helped lead the discussion at the event which was attended by over 160 people in person and via live stream. 
“It’s time for Georgetown to atone for their past actions to fulfill their promises and honor the lives of the people they enslaved,” Thomas said at the event.
Thomas, who has not received any reparations from the university, said only Georgetown has benefited from their commitment to a reconciliation fund. 
“In reality, to this day, they’ve given $0.00 to this fund. The only group that has gotten anything from this fund is Georgetown with the good publicity that they’ve gotten,” Thomas said.
The university’s proposed fund was not an acceptable solution and descendants have yet to receive any funding from the university, according to a petition GUSA introduced at the event.
“This decision was met with frustrations from members of the campus community who opposed charity as a means to achieve justice, voicing support for reparative justice instead,” the petition reads. “Since then, the university has failed to deliver on any of their pledges to provide support to GU272 descendants, going even so far as to erase mentions of these promises.” 
However, statements made by the university regarding slavery and reparations are available for public view, and the university plans to enact compensation plans in the coming semester, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Year one (AY 21-22) funds have been set aside for a spring 2022 launch of the grant review committee and grant application process,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Planning for a spring fundraising campaign is also underway.”
Student commitment to GU272 reparations remains strong, according to Grenier.
“What the university is doing currently is they’re hoping that all of us in this room and all of us on this campus are just going to be quiet, go away, move on, forget about it,” Grenier said at the event. “That’s not the case. We’re here. Today, we’re calling them out.”
In 2019 student activists protested at a meeting of Georgetown Board of Directors over their decision to not implement the referendum reconciliation fund. Furthermore, descendants of the GU272 have honored their own history, including Mélisande Short-Colomb, who performed an autobiographical play entitled “Here I Am,” a personal integration of the university’s sale of the enslaved people.  
Additionally, there have been many forms of activism in support of descendants including a song written by Carlos Simon, an assistant professor of music at Georgetown University, which honored the enslaved people sold. He performed his work at the Library of Congress last month.
According to Thomas, students’ rich history of activism — especially work from descendants, as well as GUSA President Nile Blass (COL ’22) — has been key to the GU272 movement.
“My brother and Nile and other students have worked for such a long time and here I am fighting for the same exact fight,” Thomas said.
According to Blass, even with a rich history of activism, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult for activists to continue pressuring the university and has erased institutional memory of the referendum.
“By virtue of COVID-19, I think it’s very hard to maintain a lot of the organizing and activism,” Blass said at the event. “A lot of the activism that we were able to do, including consistent pressure on the university, has worked. Promises to continually update and at least attempt to assure the student body that they would be doing something meaningful happened because we occupied physical space.” 
Moving forward, efforts will concentrate on rekindling interest in the issue of reparations for the GU272 through providing information to the student body, according to Blass. 
“I think a lot of what made initial activism efforts effective was because we have a student body outside of those who are expected to care who might feel that because of their identity, they do care, they have to care,” Blass said.

The Georgetown University Figure Skating Club’s (GFSC) annual winter showcase will return Dec. 6 to the Washington Harbour Rink on the Georgetown waterfront after the event was cancelled last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The holiday-themed showcase will feature five solo and one group performances choreographed by GFSC skaters to the song “Let it Snow.” After the show, there will be a public skating event at the rink, which was closed last year because of the pandemic.The first 100 Georgetown students to arrive will be able to skate for free.
The event will be the first holiday-themed performance for many GFSC skaters, according to GFSC member Elizabeth Rauenhorst (SFS ’25). 
“All of the solo programs are kind of mish-mashes of old Christmas or holiday programs that people have done in years past,” Rauenhorst said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Most of us have done little holiday shows before we came to Georgetown.”
The performances will differ from competition-style figure skating, in which routines must satisfy a certain number of technical requirements, according to Rauenhorst.
“They’ll probably be a lot of fun because they will be geared towards just having something fun for the audience to watch,” Rauenhorst said. “We designed the program so that it’s pretty easy to learn.”
Preparations for the event began last month. While skaters do not have to try out to be in the showcase or the club, most performers have had several years of skating experience, according to Madeline Tirschwell (COL ’24).
“On our own, we are each working on our solos,” Tirschwell said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Most of us skate one to two hours a week or more.”
GFSC Co-President Lauren Russell (COL ’22) said because of the outdoor nature of the event, she does not anticipate any significant changes from pre-pandemic showcases. 
“We’re lucky in the sense that since it’s outdoors, we can mostly do everything pretty much the same way,” Russell said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We unfortunately, of course, weren’t able to have our show last year, but this year, we’re back and so I think that pretty much everybody can do what they did a couple of years ago. I don’t think things are going to be too different.”  
However, this year, fewer skaters are performing than usual, which Russell said could be due to the pandemic. 
“I think with COVID a lot of people have taken time off the ice,” Russell said. “It’s obviously a little more difficult to arrange practices and get everybody in the same place at the same time just because COVID makes things a little more challenging.”
In past years, GFSC has collaborated with local universities including American University and The George Washington University, according to Russell.
The smaller size of the group has some benefits, however, according to Tirschwell. 
“In previous years, we worked a lot harder on choreographing a cohesive group number,” Tirschwell said. “That’s a lot easier to do with a smaller group.”
Although the club practices around once a week at the MedStar Capitals Iceplex in Virginia, Tirschwell said she hopes the team can get into a more regular practice schedule as the competition season nears.
“I’m really hoping we can just get a lot of team practices in and just build a better team dynamic,” Tirschwell said. “We’re trying to foster more of a community where we can all work together.”
While the club will shift its focus to competitions for the spring, non-members can still look forward to future events, including free skates, according to Tirschwell. 
“I’m super excited for the free skate because I think it’ll just be super fun to have regular people from the community come and skate,” Tirschwell said. “We are hoping to host some more open skate nights where community members can come and skate and hang out in the future.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate and Executive leadership met with Georgetown administrators earlier this week to discuss housing and dining options for students remaining on campus over winter break. 
International students can now apply to remain in their on-campus residences during winter break, which lasts from Dec. 17, 2021 to Jan. 11, 2022, according to an email obtained by The Hoya from the Office of Residential Living to international students with J1 or F1 visas. The meeting between GUSA and administrators was held to secure housing for international students over the break, according Vice Speaker of the GUSA Senate Rowlie Flores (COL ’22). 
The decision came after international students raised concerns about facing housing insecurity during the break, as many are unable to travel home amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Any individual with demonstrated need should be allowed to stay on campus over winter break, according to Yichu Huang (SFS ’23), an international student who circulated a petition last month demanding winter housing for international students. The petition has garnered 59 signatures.
“I think they should really re-define what international means in this case,” Huang said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I know people who have American passports but are essentially international students because they have lived abroad for all of their lives. Also, if international students are allowed to stay, anyone who demonstrates a housing need should be able to stay, as maintenance costs won’t increase dramatically.”
International students who wish to stay on campus during the break must apply for housing, which will only be available for the full break period and will cost $1,560, by Dec. 8 according to the email. 
Students will be housed in the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center as utilities will be shut down in residence halls during the break, according to GUSA President Nile Blass (COL ’22).  
Huang, an international student who will apply for on-campus housing, said that this new opportunity to stay on campus is beneficial for those facing uncertainty about their winter break plans. 
“Before, when I spoke to some international students, they were making plans, because they weren’t sure that the school would allow them to stay, basically. But now, if we are allowed to stay, and a lot of them, including me, I would just stay in D.C.,” Huang said. 
International students who receive winter break housing will not be provided with financial aid, according to acting GUSA Vice President Thomas Leonard (COL ’23), who said that GUSA is working to develop a stipend to help students pay.
“We definitely want to make sure that any students who need financial support over the break are able to get it, maybe through a stipend that’s offered by the university in a way that doesn’t impact financial aid,” Leonard said in an interview with The Hoya.
Students in the Georgetown Scholars Program (GSP), which provides support for first generation and low income students, in accordance with previous years’ policy, will also be allowed to stay on campus during winter break at no cost, according to a university spokesperson. 
“These students may stay in the university hotel during the break, and the cost will be covered,” the university spokesperson said in an email to The Hoya.
GUSA also plans to address issues of food insecurity over break, which stemmed from concerns students expressed in regards to dining hall operating policies over Thanksgiving break, according to Leonard. 
“We were most concerned about the fact that Epi’s was the only location operating and Leo’s was closed, which created a lot of financial burden and issues regarding dietary restriction for students. I think what happened with Thanksgiving break is that there wasn’t enough turnaround to address those issues, and we want to get the ball rolling ahead of winter break,” Leonard said in an interview with The Hoya.
While Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall and other dining locations on campus will be closed for winter break, with the exception of Epicurean, students who remain on campus will have access to kitchens and laundry facilities in Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Hall, according to a university spokesperson. 
 “GSP will host a few events for students who stay during the break, including a holiday dinner and a meet-and-greet of other students who will be on campus over the break,” the spokesperson wrote. 
Dining hall operation plans for winter break and Thanksgiving break are consistent with past years, according to the spokesperson.
Students who anticipate challenges to their food, financial, or housing situation over winter break should contact GUSA, according to Leonard. 
“GUSA is always there as an advocate for students, and it’s very important that we have tangible student concerns that we can use as testimonies,” Leonard said. “In a lot of the conversations that we have with the administration, we’re speaking about problems in a very abstract sense, although the problems are very real and tangible for students.”
The change in the housing situation for international students comes as a relief, according to Huang. 
“We sent the petition, but we never received any confirmation from the school side,” Huang said. “So I felt like no one really cared about it, but then it seemed like they were talking; they were doing something and talking about this all the time. And I’m happy to know that I have a place to stay for winter break.”
This article was updated on Dec. 3 to clarify Epicurean’s winter break status.

A Georgetown University professor testified for the second time at a people’s tribunal investigating the Chinese government’s ongoing human rights abuses against Uyghurs. 
James Millward, an expert on historical and contemporary Xinjiang, testified Nov. 27 at the London-based Uyghur Tribunal as a peer reviewer of a new report based on hundreds of top secret Chinese government documents. The report, authored by Adrian Zenz, directly links China’s crackdown on Uyghurs and other ethnic groups to speeches from high-level Chinese leadership.
Peer reviewing the report included examining and verifying the documents, considering Zenz’s argument and verifying his translations, according to Millward. These secret documents demonstrate intent from the upper echelons of the Chinese government — including President Xi Jinping — for policies later imposed in the Uyghur region, Millward said.
“In these speeches and other things that are in these documents, he identifies the problem as religion and extremist thinking, and he says that that needs to be the focus of any kind of solution,” Millward said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “And the camps have been created and the re-education system put in place to address things in people’s minds — or things that the Chinese state imagines are in everyone’s minds, if they’re religious.” 
Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, also testified for the second time Nov. 27 on his new report. The Uyghur Tribunal asked him in September to review the documents after an anonymous source leaked them to the tribunal. 
The Uyghur Tribunal is an independent people’s tribunal investigating China’s alleged genocide and other atrocities against Uyghurs and other Turkic and/or majority-Muslim ethnic groups. The tribunal will issue its determination Dec. 9 on whether China has perpetrated genocide and other atrocities against Uyghurs. 
Established in September 2020, the tribunal held hearings in June, September and November 2021, at which witnesses — including victims, human rights activists, and academics — provided evidence of China’s abuses. Millward also testified at the September hearings as an expert on the region. 
The Chinese government has persecuted these ethnic groups for decades, but repression has drastically increased since 2017 under the guise of combating religious extremism. China’s campaign includes severe restrictions on religious practice; repressive population control policies, including forced sterilization; arbitrary detention of over 1 million individuals, mainly Uyghurs; and widespread forced labor, among other crimes. The United States condemned the crisis as genocide and crimes against humanity in January. 
The New York Times first reported on the cache of documents in question — known as the Xinjiang Papers — in 2019, but most of the documents were never made public. 
After reviewing the documents, Zenz and Millward concluded they are far more significant than previously believed. 
The documents, which include top-secret speeches from Xi, provide substantial evidence connecting the crackdown in the Uyghur region to central government demands, especially related to so-called “re-education” camps and population control, according to the report. 
“Xi’s statements that religious extremism is like a ‘powerful psychedelic drug’ and that acts of terror will ‘multiply like cancer cells’ if extremist thought is not eradicated are quoted verbatim (and attributed to Xi) in a widely cited March 2017 government document that likens re-education to free medical treatment for ‘sick thinking,’” the report reads.
That chilling, medical rhetoric has been part of this campaign since the very beginning, Millward said.
“That echoes dehumanizing and scientific and other kinds of rhetoric from the Holocaust and other episodes of genocide in the past,” Millward said. 
If the Uyghur Tribunal concludes that China has perpetrated genocide, it will hopefully prompt the international community to take greater action to combat Beijing’s abuses, according to Rushan Abbas, founder of Campaign for Uyghurs, a nongovernmental organization that advocates for Uyghur human rights. 
“One of the biggest successes of the tribunal was its ability to gather a significant amount of evidence in the face of obfuscation and propaganda by the Chinese government,” Abbas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Nations will be able to look to that body of evidence to make determinations about what can be done to end this atrocity.”
Abbas, whose sister is detained in the Uyghur region, testified in June at the Uyghur Tribunal. 
The Uyghur Tribunal is especially significant because China is blocking substantial action at the United Nations level, according to Millward.
“These kinds of organizations and initiatives, such as the Uyghur Tribunal, by the very fact that they aren’t state led, are very powerful,” Millward said. “What we’re hearing here is the voice of people organizing outside of the network of states. And so that’s where the import lies.”

Over 50 students came forward with concerns about food insecurity over the Thanksgiving break period.
Only one Georgetown University dining facility, Epicurean and Company, remained open through the break. Because the restaurant requires payment in Flex dollars or other methods of personal funding, students were not able to use their meal swipes throughout Thanksgiving break. 
Without alternative options from the university, these dining limitations created an issue for students who remained on campus over the break, according to Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (COL ’22).
“A lot of people who stay on campus tend to be low income, so that became problematic because they didn’t know where their next meal was going to come from,” Flores said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Even in past years, Leo’s has always been closed, but this year was especially harmful because COVID is still going on; in general, there was no financial support from the university.”
The Georgetown University Mutual Aid Network, a student organization that collects and redistributes funds to students, saw an influx in requests for aid during Thanksgiving break, according to Megan Huynh (NHS ’22), one of the organization’s founders.
“We’ve just reopened our form today and have already seen a lot of requests from students who will be facing food insecurity due to the break,” Huynh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We’ve seen an increase in requests relating to food and are generally aware that Leo’s closing poses a huge threat to food access on campus because we also received a lot of funding requests when the same thing happened last year.” 
Newly nominated GUSA Vice President Thomas Leonard (COL ’22) met with university administrators Nov. 18 to discuss the concerns students brought to GUSA about food insecurity and lay out possible solutions.
Providing extra Flex dollars for students staying on campus during Thanksgiving break or keeping more dining options open would help to eliminate food insecurity, according to Leonard.
“One of the biggest things for us was hoping to get stipends available to students who need it, whether that be through offering of additional FLEX or funding that would not affect their financial aid,” Leonard said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “The other solution we wanted was to make sure that we had other dining locations open on campus.”
The university made free meals and food available to students through the Hoya Hub, an on-campus food pantry on the fourth floor of the Leavey Center, according to a university spokesperson.
“The Hoya Hub food pantry remained open during the break and had additional resources, including meal vouchers, available to students who needed emergency support,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Hoya Hub is stocked with non-perishable foods available on an immediate, emergency basis.”
Still, this accommodation proved inadequate for many students with dietary restrictions or a lack of access to kitchens, according to Flores.
“People were relying more heavily on the Hoya Hub pantry, but that doesn’t really support everyone,” Flores said. “It’s very limited in food, limited in funding and limited in supplies, so essentially people had to use their own money.”
The Georgetown Scholars Program (GSP), which supports first-generation and low-income students at Georgetown, provided grocery grants and three meal vouchers to students in GSP who applied for the resources. 
The grocery grants only covered dry ingredients, leaving some students unable to use them, according to Flores.
“There’s things that people have to consider like cooking utensils, pans and pots,” Flores said. “The money might be enough for ingredients and groceries, but if you don’t have the materials to cook your food then that’s also an additional cost.”
For low-income students who are not in GSP and were not able to apply for the additional food resources over Thanksgiving break, and even for GSP students whose approval was not guaranteed, access to food was even more limited. 
According to Leonard, GUSA plans on meeting with administration again to discuss solutions for future breaks.
“It’s a problem of the utmost priority as it relates to making sure that our students are taken care of,” Leonard said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It’s an issue that we’re absolutely going to have to revisit with a much more aggressive approach, both in our communications with administration but also the timeline in which we communicate with administration.”

The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate will aim to restructure itself through an internal bylaw reform after a referendum on the same matter failed to pass last month. 
Despite 72.12% of students voting in favor of the referendum to replace the GUSA Senate and Executive with a single body student assembly, the referendum failed to pass because it did not meet the 25% minimum voter threshold required for referendums to pass. In contrast to a student referendum, an internal restructuring process amending the bylaws would only require approval within GUSA and not the broader student body. 
Bylaw amendments are expected to be drafted during the first week of the spring 2022 semester and scheduled to be voted on by the GUSA Senate in late January or early February of 2022.
Although the referendum failed to pass, GUSA perceived it as approval for restructuring, according to GUSA Executive Restructure Co-Director Dakyung Ham (COL ’22). 
“The referendum results show that a lot of people are very interested in restructuring GUSA, especially in aspects like elections and policy areas, and having more of a policy focus in GUSA,” Ham said in an interview with The Hoya. “It shows in the election results because a majority of people voted ‘yes’ for the referendum.” 
The current structure of GUSA prevents the organization from effectively addressing student needs on campus, according to GUSA Senator Bora Balçay (SFS ’23), one of two senators who introduced the restructure referendum in October.
“I think that it’s overly bureaucratic, and not enough people work on policy,” Balçay said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Others have said that the system of hierarchy, from their experience, has been toxic and unwelcoming. I think that it is important for us to, going into a new decade, make sure that our student government is as welcoming, as diverse, as accessible, as the student body itself.”
Through a bylaw reform, the restructure will be restricted to merging legislative and executive policy teams, according to Balçay.
While internal restructuring is narrower in scope and does not abolish the constitutional council and leadership positions, GUSA is still committed to meeting the original goals outlined in the referendum, according to Balçay.
“We’re just moving both to the long term,” Balçay said. “The feedback we’ve received overwhelmingly is that there’s some desire for change in the areas of particular policy, which is something we can do through bylaw changes. We want to do that now so that we can do the hierarchical change and the constitutional council change somewhere down the line. So we’re still not abandoning those goals.”
However, according to GUSA Senator Zev Burton (SFS ’22), who opposed the referendum, problems with GUSA will not be resolved with procedural changes. 
“The problem with GUSA is people don’t show initiative,” Burton said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “People run and say they’re going to do all of these things and then they don’t. You have an attendance problem. You have people not signing up to be on executive boards. Once people have the title, on balance, they aren’t doing anything after that.”
The decision to pursue an internal restructuring process came after much discussion and deliberation within GUSA, according to Ham. 
“We are very much more so considering doing the bylaws or planning a lot more towards it,” Ham said. “Myself and the executive committee overall is very much leaning towards the bylaws option.”
An internal restructure process takes attention away from more important issues that GUSA should address, according to Burton. 
“When GUSA does stuff right; when we focus on students, we can be really really beneficial to the community. When we focus on ourselves, it’s just pandering to ourselves and building up our own ego,” Burton said.

Metro delays will continue through the end of the year, causing transit disruptions for Georgetown University students.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) announced Nov. 22 that riders should expect to see continued delays in Metro services following an investigation of the derailment of a 7000-series railcar Oct. 12 that led to a 60% reduction in the Metro fleet. As a result, riders, including students who rely on the Metro for transportation to their internships and jobs, continue to face wait times of up to 40 minutes.
Metro trains are arriving every 10 to 12 minutes at 75% of Metro stations, although increased service depends on an increasing number of railcars meeting appropriate safety standards. Once the 7000-series railcars that were removed for inspections return to standard service, testing will be conducted more frequently to ensure passenger safety, according to a Nov. 22 press release.
For Georgetown students with internships around Washington, D.C., Metro delays inhibit their ability to arrive on time to their workplaces.
According to Margaret Koulen (MSB, SFS ’23), who rides the Metro three days a week for her internship at the Oversight and Reform Committee in the House of Representatives, recent Metro delays have prompted a need to allot more time for transit to and from her internship.
“It’s really hard to gauge if I’m going to be on time to work, because if I miss a Metro, then it’ll be another 20 or 30 minutes, which means I’m usually late to work if that happens,” Koulen said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I luckily have an office that doesn’t deduct pay or anything crazy like that if you’re late, but it just kinda reflects on you poorly if you show up 30, 40, 45 minutes late.”
Some students, like Trey Di Bona (SFS ’23), who has an in-person internship in the United States Senate, have opted to ride the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle (GUTS) in lieu of the Metro because of reduced rail services.
“Before the travel delays, I had been taking the GUTS Bus to Dupont Circle and then taking the Metro over to Capitol Hill from there,” Di Bona said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “The closure kind of forced me to rethink that route a bit, so I ended up getting on the GUTS Bus to the Law Center, and that ended up being a more efficient solution, both because it was a more direct line and because it’s free.”
WMATA is attempting to reintroduce each train to service as quickly as possible but remains cautious against prematurely adding trains that have not been properly examined, according to Paul Wiedefeld, Metro general manager and chief executive officer.
“​​While we know service is not as frequent as customers would prefer, we will add each train as it becomes available to help incrementally improve service reliability and frequency,” Wiedefeld said in the press release. “We are intentionally not setting deadlines so that safety and good data drive our decisions, but we are mindful that customers want the best service we can provide as soon as we can deliver it, and we are committed to building back up in phases.”
A return to full rail services would provide more free time without the extended wait times at Metro stations for students with internships, according to Koulen.
“I think it would just make my day a little bit shorter,” Koulen said. “When I leave work, I might get home much later and so I have less time for homework, less time to just relax, because I’m waiting at the Metro stop.”
For other students, like Di Bona, Metro delays have forced them to realize permanent transit route changes that will persist even as WMATA services return to full capacity.
“I’d probably not go back to the Metro, as far as getting back to work goes,” Di Bona said. “The GUTS bus is an efficient option, it’s not a very well-publicized one, but I think it’s probably what I should’ve been doing from the beginning, honestly.”

Georgetown University’s School of Continuing Studies (SCS) announced Nov. 15 it will launch a master’s program in strategic digital transformation (SDT) starting in the fall 2022 semester.
The master’s program, which will consist of 33 credits offered in full-time or part-time programs to last two to five years, will focus on digital business innovation, organizational change and strategic communication. The program will offer courses in areas such as “The Ethics of Digital Innovation,” “Communication for Corporate Entrepreneurs,” “Developing Digital Solutions” and “Leading Organizational Change.”
The idea for the program developed in fall 2019 when SCS administrators organized an internal committee to develop new programs related to technology, according to Frederic Lemieux, faculty director of the master’s in strategic digital transformation program and professor of the practice at the SCS.
“Something we realized fairly quickly that I brought that up was that we were missing out on digital transformation,” Lemieux said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “While we have a technology management program that is focusing on it, we didn’t really have anything that was addressing organizational change based on technology and also massive changes like innovation and things like that.”
Lemieux worked on developing a curriculum for the program and reached out to field experts at companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Currently, the program has an established partnership with Google, which is supporting the SDT master’s by sharing subject matter experts and research faculty, according to Lemieux.
The SDT program will incorporate aspects of technology, security, marketing and communications that stretch across other programs of the SCS, according to Kelly Otter, dean of the SCS.
“This new program enables early- and mid-career technology or management professionals to lead technology change in their organizations, integrating both the technology aspect (e.g. artificial intelligence and blockchain) with the human (e.g. responsible innovation and ethics),” Otter wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As both public and private firms worldwide increasingly need to adapt to the digital economy, program graduates will be well-positioned to shepherd digital transformation effectively and ethically.”
The SDT curriculum is a combination of technical and strategic applications of digital operations, according to Lemieux.
“We decided to create a balanced curriculum where on one side students would be learning what it takes to strategize about digital transformation, understand the digital innovation process, understand ethical issues related to digital innovation and be able to communicate innovative ideas throughout the organization and work with different stakeholders that will be impacted by the change,” Lemieux said.
This specific program combines a multitude of topics uncommon in master’s programs offered at other institutions across the United States, according to Otter.
“We at SCS are proud to launch one of the few master’s degrees in the U.S. that focuses on business innovation, organizational change, and digital transformation,” Otter wrote. “Anchored in Georgetown’s Jesuit values, this curriculum was developed in close collaboration with some of the world’s largest and most successful companies leading the digital economy.”
The new master’s program will attract a range of students across different sectors and subject interest areas, according to Kristen Hodge-Clark, senior assistant dean of program planning at the SCS.
“It’s been extraordinary to see the concept of Strategic Digital Transformation come to fruition — from early market research and industry focus groups to curriculum and proposal development and now to officially launch and be in the market,” Hodge-Clark wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m most excited to see the diverse range of students and sectors that we will serve with this dynamic program.”
Lemieux says he will expect graduates from the program to pursue opportunities in both the public and private sectors.
“I see the program as it evolves and as we have more students pursuing their capstone projects being able to develop more partnerships with leading organizations or leading government agencies,” Lemieux said. “Right now, with the investment in critical infrastructure, there will be a lot of opportunity right there for companies that really want to invest in digital infrastructure to look for talents.”
