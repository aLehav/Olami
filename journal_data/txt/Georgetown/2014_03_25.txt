Daniel Milzman, the Georgetown sophomore accused of manufacturing and possessing ricin in his McCarthy Hall dorm room, was ordered released pending trial today by Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola.
The U.S. government, which is prosecuting the case, however, requested to appeal within the next 24 hours, at which point Chief Judge Richard Roberts will decide the status of Milzman’s incarceration. Until Roberts reaches a decision, Milzman will remain in custody.
In ordering Milzman’s release, Facciola would require the 19-year-old to spend two weeks in an in-patient psychiatric program at Sibley Memorial Hospital before returning to his parents’ home in Bethesda, Md., where he would not be allowed to remain in the house alone.
Facciola made his decision after listening to Milzman’s attorney, Danny Onorato, who argued that in making the ricin, Milzman only attempted to harm himself and that he is not a danger to others. Onorato, a former assistant U.S. attorney and a partner at Schertler & Onorato, cited a history of depression and suicidal tendencies, which he said Milzman has struggled with since he was 15, and claimed that Milzman intended to commit suicide using the ricin — a method that would not clearly convey the cause of death, mimicking the symptoms of a virus — so that his family would not know he had taken his own life.
The prosecution, represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Maia Miller, argued that Milzman should be detained because the substance he produced was lethal, and he had said to resident adviser Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) that he was planning to use the toxin on “someone.”
Miller cited details of Milzman’s process — the fact that he wore goggles and a mask while making the ricin, that he paid for the necessary materials in cash and that he disposed of the remnants of the process in a dumpster far from McCarthy Hall — as evidence that he may not have intended to use the substance on himself. She said he “intended to cause harm in the worst way,” whether to himself or to someone else.
The judge interrupted Miller’s suggestion that Milzman’s use of goggles and a mask indicated he did not intend to commit suicide to say, “You can’t kill yourself until it’s done,” and Onorato also refuted that claim by emphasizing that Milzman’s actions indicated he took pains to ensure his parents would not know he had made ricin, and therefore would not know he had committed suicide.
Miller also read from Facebook messages between Milzman and another Georgetown student sent earlier this year in which Milzman threatened the undergraduate, telling him, “You would be more useful to the world if you were chemically dis-incorporated and the elements that composed your body were sent to laboratories.” Milzman and the other student met with university officials regarding the messages earlier this year, and both received “stay away no contact orders” against the other.
Onorato acknowledged the troubling nature of the Facebook messages, but emphasized that the feud involved both parties, and said that Milzman did not start the exchange.
The detention hearing took place at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on Tuesday afternoon. The courtroom was near capacity, with approximately 70 people present, including 17 students from both Georgetown and Walt Whitman High School, which Milzman graduated from in 2012.
Milzman entered the courtroom shortly before 2 p.m. wearing an orange jumpsuit and accompanied by deputy U.S. marshals. His parents sat in the first row and stood at Facciola’s request to acknowledge their responsibility for Milzman upon release. Milzman’s father, Dave Milzman, is research director of the Department of Emergency Medicine at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, while his brother, Jesse Milzman (COL ’15), currently attends Georgetown and his other brother, Matt Milzman, is a 2013 graduate.
Since his arrest Friday, Milzman has been held in the medical unit at D.C. Jail. Between the discovery of ricin in his dorm room last Tuesday and his arrest Friday, Milzman had been in the care of the Psychiatric Institute of Washington.
Even if Milzman is released, he will not be allowed to return to campus, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr.
“He is not permitted to return to campus at this time. The possession or manufacturing of illegal substances are issues we take very seriously and are violations of the university’s … Code of [Student] Conduct,” Kerr wrote in an email yesterday.

It seems a bit unnecessary to rewrite the same story everyday when there isn’t any new information released. The family is going through enough isses without the Hoya cashing in on their situation for page views. Especially since you insist on drawing attention to both his siblings and father who are associated with Georgetown.

A Concerned Hoya says

Ron, people want to know what’s going on. I’m sure his family feels awful. But they would want everyone to know the truth, rather than circulate fantasies around the rumor mill.
‘K, Ron?

Since Daniel Milzman (COL ’16) was arrested for possessing a lethal quantity of ricin Friday, his friends and colleagues have slowly come to terms with the fact that the science student had been quietly concocting the biological toxin in his dorm room.
“Nothing ever would have led me to think that he would make a dangerous substance or do anything to hurt anybody. I’m extremely surprised by all of this and dismayed, but he was a great kid,” said Jan Denis, Milzman’s Quiz Bowl coach at Walt Whitman High School in Montgomery County, Md., which Milzman graduated from in 2012.
On Friday, Milzman, 19, was formally charged with possession of 123 milligrams of a white powdery substance, within which concentration of the toxin was 7.7 micrograms per milligram. Federal law enforcement seized the substance from Milzman’s dorm room on the sixth floor of McCarthy Hall early March 18.
In an interview with Federal Bureau of Investigation agents last Tuesday, Milzman reported that he had made the agent in his dorm room a month prior wearing goggles and a dust mask and using materials purchased at Home Depot and the American Plant Company after researching how to concoct the substance on his iPhone.
Milzman, who studies physics and math, has followed a pre-med track at Georgetown, set to follow in the footsteps of his father, Dave Milzman, who is the research director in the Department of Emergency Medicine at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and with whom Milzman has co-written two articles in the Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine. Dave Milzman and two brothers, Jesse Milzman (COL ’15) and Matt Milzman, a 2013 Georgetown graduate, did not respond to requests for comment.
“He seemed like a quiet, odd kid, but we’re physics majors so everyone’s like that,” said a fellow physics major, who requested anonymity.
Within the small department, classmates remarked that Milzman had begun to miss a noticeable number of classes over the past few months.
“He started missing a lot of classes midway through the semester. Our professor started asking about him a lot. If he wanted to hand back a problem set he would ask, ‘Has anyone seen Danny?’” another classmate said.
Fellow classmate Nevin Snow (COL ’16) also noticed Milzman’s frequent absences, though he attributed the ability to miss classes to Milzman’s intelligence.
“Those are the two defining things that I remember: he never showed up for class, and when he did it would only be for a test,” Snow said.
Milzman, who could face up to 10 years in prison for possession of the biological toxin, has also served as a tutor in the university’s Math Assistance Center, where one of his students, Arianna Petillo (MSB ’17), said he had been a skilled teacher.
“He seemed very sarcastic, but at the same time, it was just how he was; it wasn’t anything really malicious, I guess, and he was helpful with math,” Petillo said.
On campus, Milzman is a member of the Secular Student Association as well as the founder and captain of the university’s Quiz Bowl team.
Jim Coury (SFS ’15), a member of the Quiz Bowl team, praised Milzman’s leadership of the fledgling organization.
“He really took care of what needed to be taken care of, in terms of getting the club together and getting people together and getting things done,” Coury said.
Like much of campus, Coury was shocked by news of Milzman’s arrest Friday.
“He seemed normal,” Coury said. “I obviously didn’t see that coming.  I guess I knew he was into science — he took a lot of science classes and stuff. Other than that, I had no idea.”
Milzman’s decision to pursue Quiz Bowl in college followed his participation in the activity in high school at Walt Whitman, where he was also a National Merit semifinalist and a member of the school’s hockey team.
Lilli Seabol (COL ’17), who first met Milzman when she joined Quiz Bowl last fall, said that after hearing about the possibility of ricin on campus, she never would have predicted that Milzman would be the student held responsible.
“He hadn’t been to Quiz Bowl in a couple days, a couple practices, but I just thought he was sick or something like that. I was really surprised when I found out,” she said.
Seabol described Milzman as a normal college student with a sense of humor.
“I thought he was just pretty average.  He would make jokes a lot, and stuff like that, so he seemed pretty nice,” she said.
Josh Tsung (COL ’16), a friend of Milzman’s, agreed, praising Milzman for his intelligence and wit.
“Danny is a great friend and really knows how to brighten your day up. Those who knew him well will think about him every day,” Tsung wrote in an email.
Milzman will appear before U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia this afternoon for his detention hearing. He will be represented by Danny Onorato, a partner at Schertler & Onorato.
While Milzman has yet to face the Federal Court’s decision, he has already violated the Code of Student Conduct, according to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr, and is not permitted on Georgetown’s campus at this time.
“An undergraduate has been arrested on a charge of possession of a biological toxin and remains in custody. He is not permitted to return to campus at this time. The possession or manufacturing of illegal substances are issues we take very seriously and are violations of the university’s … Code of [Student] Conduct,” Kerr wrote in an email. “We continue to closely cooperate with law enforcement authorities for this case.”

Nearly a month after winning the race for GUSA executive, Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) were sworn in as president and vice president of the Georgetown University Student Association on Sunday.
After the GUSA senate officially certified the results of the Feb. 28 election Saturday, Tezel and Jikaria acknowledged a subtle ideological shift in the role they believe GUSA should play in students’ lives. While continuing “What’s A Hoya?” student conduct events, they hope to move GUSA’s focus away from programming and toward advocacy.
“We’re looking to continue to keep that going, while also looking to … the great programming being put on by other student groups and see if we can integrate that into ‘What’s A Hoya?’ so that we are letting them do what they do best, and GUSA can continue to focus its resources on being primarily an advocate for the student body,” Tezel said.
Jikaria sees this shift as playing to GUSA’s strengths.
“I think based on the resources that GUSA has and the connections that it has, it should be an advocacy body because that’s kind of its strength — and why not capitalize on that?” Jikaria said. “That being said, obviously a lot of student organizations put on great programs, so if we can facilitate that great work that’s awesome. But our priority should be kind of advocating for students.”
The new executive administration is creating a GUSA Transfer Council to address the interests of transfer students, as well as a Multicultural Council.
Senate Speaker and former vice presidential candidate Sam Greco (SFS ’15) said he thinks this shift toward advocacy will change the approach of the executive.
“I know that Trevor and Omika … think GUSA is an advocacy body and not a programming body, and I think that is one of the bigger philosophical differences that exists in the student government,” Greco said. “I think that that will affect how they operate a little bit.”
Conversely, outgoing GUSA Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) did not see this difference of approaches as important.
“I think that what matters is as long as they continue to be the voice of students, ‘how?’ is going to be an afterthought,” Ramadan said.
He noted that the “What’s A Hoya?” program came about in response to a student need that surfaced.
Tezel and Jikaria hope to build upon former GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Ramadan’s legacy, while at the same time accelerating the progress made by the previous administration.
“We need to always be looking not just to improve upon GUSA at the same rate as last year, but get an even faster clip of changes and improvements to the student body,” Tezel said.
The new executives are currently finalizing their cabinet, which they see as key to achieving their policy goals.
“In terms of leadership style we are definitely taking one where we expect and are putting together a staff and cabinet that has the types of personalities that will go out and work on these initiatives without having to be pushed and prodded, and I think that that’s the difference between a GUSA executive which gets a bit done during the year and a GUSA executive which gets a lot,” Tezel said.
According to Tezel, an improved senate-executive relationship is also key to the student government’s success.
“It’s time for the senate and the executive to bury the hatchet and join together for the betterment of Georgetown. Some of the brightest and most capable students are sitting in this room today, and every day we are not working in a cooperative manner, we are falling short of our potential,” Tezel said in his inaugural speech.
The administration released executive staff appointments on Sunday, including a position for an executive-senate liaison, filled by senior advisor Ben Weiss (COL ’15), who ran for president with Greco as his running mate.
“There has not really been the greatest of relationships between previous executives and the senate — or at least a lack of communication — and having someone in the executive actively working to make sure that it is a positive, collaborative relationship is a priority for both the new executive and current senate leadership,” said Weiss, a current senator.
Tisa and Ramadan delivered their farewell addresses Saturday, with Tisa reflecting on the importance of student opinion in decision-making.
“Georgetown is a massive institution. It has an educational mission but it balances financial constraints, differing entities, different viewpoints, differing philosophies. And sometimes it gets it wrong. And Georgetown students are the conscience to that situation,” Tisa said.
The outgoing GUSA president also reaffirmed GUSA’s role as an advocate for students and a way to give a voice to student needs.
“GUSA doesn’t really have any power,” Tisa said. “We have a voice and when we mobilize students, when people vote in our elections and engage with us, that voice starts having power.”

Tuition will rise 4.34 percent next year, according to the university’s financial plan for fiscal years 2015 to 2018, published by the Division of Financial Affairs on Jan. 31 and released to the Georgetown community March 19.
The financial plan specifies ways to increase revenue and cut costs to scale back a $9 million deficit as well as the use of student loans in financial aid packages.
The 4.3 percent tuition increase will take effect for the 2014-2015 academic year, bringing undergraduate tuition, not including room and board, from $44,280 to $46,200. The university will also allocate $4.4 million more to funding for financial aid in the upcoming year.
Despite the increase for 2015 tuition, according to Rubenstein, the university hopes to prevent large tuition increases.
“This is a nationwide issue, but for our students and parents we act to limit tuition increases as much as possible, while continuing to fund and raise philanthropic dollars to fund our need-blind, meet-full-need admissions policy,” Rubenstein wrote in an email.
“Philanthropic support is critical in order to invest and pay for those things which cannot be met with tuition dollars.”
Although yearly tuition increases, generally below 5 percent, are fairly standard across universities, some students object to the increase.
“We already have very high tuition rates and we don’t want to see those increase, which is why, and I’ll reiterate, the university should be engaging students in the nitty-gritty details of long-term and short-term financial planning so that we can see their decision-making process when it comes to tuition increases, for instance,” GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) said. “A 4.3 percent increase is kind of alarming anyway, along with the fact that we believe that a Georgetown education should be within the reach of any student and it should not be exclusionary based off of a high price, and every time we have a tuition increase, that guarantee becomes a little less valid, so we always need to be looking at that.”
According to Rubenstein, the tuition increase, along with the rest of the financial plan, aims to help the university remain strong, despite outside obstacles.
“This plan seeks to maintain our competitive position as a top research university. The financial plan builds upon the success of fiscal year 2013 and our projections for fiscal year 2014, while being mindful of the external economic factors facing higher education today,” Rubenstein wrote in a campus-wide email.
In upcoming years, the university will also confront the problem of decreased federal funding due to governmental budgetary constraints. Despite these constraints, Rubenstein said that he does not think that the change will negatively impact students.
“At Georgetown, we forecast that federally sponsored research after falling in fiscal year 2014 will decrease again in fiscal year 2015 before it stabilizes,” Rubenstein wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will still have an active research program, albeit a bit smaller, so I don›t think that our students will be directly affected.”
Major expenses for the university in the upcoming years include new residence halls — both the construction of the Northeast Triangle and the renovation of the Old Jesuit Residence Project — as well as the construction of the Healey Family Student Center and the Intercollegiate Athletic Center.
The HFSC, mainly funded through donations, will maintain annual operation costs of $930,000, while the new residence halls will bring in $4 million in revenue each year.
“The student center is primarily gift-funded, which is of tremendous benefit because that means students will benefit without us having to use tuition dollars to cover construction costs,” Rubenstein wrote. “We are also very excited about being able to provide more housing on campus because that serves a real need.  It is also a way to capture revenues and keep it on campus to maintain and develop an important resource for our student body into the future.”
The university will also implement cost-cutting measures, specifically by reducing costs in each school and working toward efficiency. These changes will lead to a projected $400,000 improvement to the projected deficit this fiscal year.
“Integration is the key concept here,” Rubenstein wrote. “More than ever our approach to financial planning brings together the various parts of the university, from academic units to university services departments, to avoid duplication, share best practices and take advantage of those things we can do better or more efficiently by acting together.”
Kyle Zhu (SFS ’14) wrote a response to the financial plan addressed to Rubenstein and University President John J. DeGioia, which he forwarded to The Hoya. He said he thinks the university does not keep students informed on financial matters.
“In my four years here, this is the first financial plan that I have seen,” Zhu wrote. “Students are the major source of revenue and major stakeholder of this university, and I have felt a continual lack of information in regards to how my very large tuition is spent.”
This year, decrease in financial aid forced Zhu to take out a student loan for the first time.
Zhu said that he attempted to start a dialogue through his email, although he has not yet received a response from the university.
“As a senior, I wanted to respond to an issue that had been frustrating me for a long time. I was just really curious about certain financial decisions made and was surprised by the lack of information about Georgetown’s financials,” Zhu wrote in an email.
According to Rubenstein, the university will alter its financial aid offerings based on student need in order to address this problem.
“We believe we have forecasted accurately the financial aid need for purposes of our financial planning,” Rubenstein wrote. “But I want to stress that this is a forecast.  Undergraduate financial aid is based upon our need-blind, meet-full-need admissions policy and is not limited to what we forecast. We will modify our budget and plan based upon the actual financial aid determinations.”

Researchers at the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center have identified an assembly of 55 genes, related with low levels or impairment of a certain protein, which could predict poorer prognoses and survival rates for patients with breast cancer.
The study report, “SYK Allelic Loss and the Role of Syk-Regulated Genes in Breast Cancer Survival,” published Feb. 11 in the scientific journal PLOS ONE, detailed the link between the levels of a potent tumor suppressor, SYK tyrosine kinase, and alterations in the 55-gene set as indicative of tumor progression. Researchers found that lower levels of SYK in conjunction with gene alternations tended toward a more invasive tumor and a worse prognosis for the patient.
Senior investigator for the study and professor of oncology emeritus at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Susette Mueller began studying SYK levels and gene mutations back in 2000.
“The study can be broken into two parts,” Mueller said. “The first part was when we got the tissues at Georgetown, and we wanted to find out that, if SYK is lost from the gene … if that would affect the outcome of the cancer.”
Director of the Cytogenetics Shared Resource of the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and most recent study report author Jan Blancato (GRD ’87) and Mueller examined 24 samples of tissue from the “Human Tissue Bank,” available to researchers at the Center.
These samples included 19 tissue samples with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a cancer that shows no sign of invasiveness, 11 of which also contained invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) that had developed in nearby cells.
Evidence from the study displayed that the tissues with DCIS, but without IDC presence, contained the same level of SYK as normal, benign tissue. However, of the 11 samples that had dual DCIS and IDC present, five of those demonstrated a highly suppressed level of the SYK gene in the DCIS tissue and more invasive tumor cells nearby.
Mueller and Blancato continued SYK cell studies, identifying specific genes that interacted with SYK to give rise to the progression of tumors. In 2009, the two conducted an experiment that would allow them to observe any changes in the cell after its SYK gene was removed.
“We did a study where we had done an experiment that knocked out the SYK gene, and we wanted to see what happens in the cell,” Mueller said. “What we saw was that [normal cells] turned into very malignant cells that looked like cancer.”
Recently, Mueller analyzed a broader sample of 696 cases of IDC using the National Institute of Health’s Cancer Genome Atlas, a comprehensive archive of cancer data sets for scientific analysis.
“I picked out 51 genes from the 2009 study set that … are related to metastasis genes because, after all, it’s metastasis that kills you,” Mueller said. “Together with three other genes that were already known to interact with SYK in another way, the total group including SYK is called the 55-gene set.”
Of the 696 cases of IDC, Mueller found that 205 had SYK gene loss. Paired with patient outcomes, the study showed that IDC tumors with decreased or absent SYK levels and gene alternations in the other 54 genes held a predictive quality for the survival rate of the patient.
“The estimate for IDC cases is that about 80 percent will survive if no changes occur in mutations or gene copy number of the 55 genes. About 20 percent will not survive if there is any change in the 55-gene set,” Mueller wrote in an email.
Blancato said that, while the results of this research detailed a causative relationship between SYK and cancer survival rate, the implementation of this study in common practice will require further development.
“This isn’t a test that cancer patients can get, and you’d have to validate a test system. So the next trial step might be to look at patient samples and find the best measure for [the SYK-related 55 gene set],” Blancato said.
Mueller echoed Blancato’s assessment, pointing toward the need for more acute gene specification and concrete statistics before developing a clinical test.
“If you could sequence a cancer patient’s DNA from their tumor and ask if any of the 55 genes have changed, then you might belong to the group where 80 percent of the patients survive or where 20 percent of the patients survive,” Mueller said. “This helps with deciding to get further treatment … but we’d like to have a better predictor of 100 percent will survive if you test ‘x’ on this particular test. There is a lot more research to be done.”
While noting that there should be more research into this topic, Jeffrey Weitzel, chief of clinical cancer genetics at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., praised the study’s discovery.
“This discovery may help us understand why some DCIS never changes and others transition into invasive cancers,” Weitzel said to HealthDay.

Although a recent study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that public institutions outmatch their private counterparts when it comes to ROTC, Georgetown University’s own Army ROTC is thriving.
The report, which is entitled “Services and Support Programs for Military Service Members and Veterans at Postsecondary Institutions,” is based on survey responses from more than 1400 two- and four-year colleges. The study claims to be the first nationally representative data on the subject and has raised questions about ROTC and veteran programs at schools across the country.
Georgetown ROTC is a member of The Hoya Battalion, which also includes The George Washington University, American University and The Catholic University of America. According to Lieutenant Colonel Michael Donahue, who oversees The Hoya Battalion, many of the national differences in funding depend on the size of the training staff, or cadre, in each university’s ROTC program.
“The Army funds every ROTC program most directly through the number of cadre assigned to the school, and that’s dependent upon the number of cadets,” Donahue said.
According to Donahue, Georgetown’s high production of cadets allows its ROTC program to receive more funding than most state schools — providing its cadets with more resources.
A school’s ROTC training budget is partly determined by its commission quota, or its ability to produce a required number of cadets at a specific level of performance. Although certain programs do not meet these standards and receive less funding by consequence, Georgetown still overproduces cadets each year. This has resulted in the program’s increased selectivity and funding.
The amount of money that the battalion receives from the Army, however, varies annually because it is dependent on the budget allocated by the Department of Defense. The battalion primarily uses these funds to conduct training and to pay equipment and uniforms costs.
The Army also funds cadet scholarships, which vary according to tuition costs. According to Cadet Noah Taylor (SFS ’17), state schools have lower tuition costs and therefore attract more cadets, which results in more funding for their ROTC programs.
“Tuition at the public and state schools is cheaper, so they want to delegate their resources to maximizing the number of cadets they can process,” Taylor said. “The incentive the state tries to make to keep top students in the state is to have lower tuition for in-state scholars. The Army is emphasizing an enticement in the form of more scholarships for in-state tuition for veterans and ROTC cadets in in-state schools.”
Taylor is one of 91 cadets in the 143-person battalion who are on scholarship. According to Alex Klock, a junior at the University of Connecticut, UConn’s 160-person Nathan Hall Battalion only has four cadets from each grade who are on scholarship.
Georgetown ROTC also touts a mentorship program: Seniors meet with cadets to discuss their adjustment to ROTC as well as Georgetown academics.
“We’ve had instances where the chain of command has come forward and raised to the cadre’s awareness that a cadet seems to be struggling,” Donahue said. “That’s been a huge help for us because we can talk to them, and we direct them to where they can get resources.”
This caring-for-the-whole-person initiative has had tangible results. According to physical and written evaluations given to rising seniors each summer, The Hoya Battalion overachieves compared to other programs nationwide.
“Georgetown has fallen above the average year after year,” Donahue said. “Our average cadet outperforms the average cadet in the country.”

Daanish Jamal (MSB ’16) took a leave of absence from Georgetown this semester to found his company and smartphone app, NextSpot, aimed at those who find Facebook events too formal for planning group gatherings and group messages annoying,
Jamal and co-founder Adhir Ravipati, a graduate of Northeastern University, sought to streamline coordination for group meetups and location-specific events through a casual, but structured network.
“What we tried to do with the app is make it as bare-bone as possible in terms of structure,” Jamal said. “We’re really trying to maintain the fluidity of the messenger, trying to make it casual and light, while still trying to incorporate some aspects from Facebook events.”
NextSpot, which was released as a free app to the Mac App Store on Jan. 31, allows its users to set meeting locations, known in the app as “spots,” vote on activities and coordinate with groups through a messaging system that is built into the application with phone number verification.
“We were hoping to solve a problem that we saw in super-connectivity,” Ravipati said of the founding idea.Both founders came up with the idea behind their application in part because of personal experiences with group meetings and several years of conversations regarding social interaction.
“The core concept came from this night over the summer before Daanish’s freshman year and [my friends and I] all ended up in the same place without having any idea that we were all in the same location,” Ravipati said. “We thought that there’s something around the idea of the connectivity of friends and groups that brings people together.”
While Jamal noted that NextSpot is not the first of social apps to coordinate group meetings, he stated that the app intends for a more privatized and intimate experience, not just event planning.
“We were looking at micro-local events that were hyper-personal,hyper-location based, and we realized that there were a lot of apps coming out that tried to aggregate local information into one feed,” Jamal said. “So instead we moved more towards the privatized side where it’s just your own events.”
Positive feedback from friends, venture capitalists from Silicon Valley in his native Northern California and advisers at Georgetown prompted Jamal to consider investing his full attention in NextSpot.
“I got to a point my first semester sophomore year where I was much more engaged with this app than I was some of my classes at the time,” Jamal said. “I would go to … people who would understand the scale of this project … and I asked them the question of should I leave school? And you get sort of two answers — one, that you should totally take a semester off and see where it goes, and the other people basically think that you’re just another college kid trying to make a social app.”
Ultimately, Jamal said, he listened to the answer that he wanted to hear and took a leave of absence for the sophomore spring semester.
Ravipati, too, took full-time leave of his job and founded NextSpot Inc. with Jamal.
“It was a lot of work and extra time, for both of us I think we kind of owed it to ourselves to invest fully in the app,” Ravipati said.
Ravipati and Jamal joined forces with Y Media Labs, an iPhone app developer in Redwood City, Calif. that invests in start-up apps as well as big businesses.
Despite leaving academic and young professional environments, Jamal and Ravipati used their experiences with social networks to form their business model and target a college-aged demographic.
“I think that initially we started with three demographics: college students, young professionals and high school students,” Ravipati said. “The reason that we were so focused on college students is that they have the most active social life.”
Ravipati, who now coaches high school soccer and football, said that he utilizes the app to coordinate practices with his team members.
“The kids I coach they like setting up practices through NextSpot … and I am a young professional myself so I’m using my friends to see what they think of it,” Ravipati said. “So far we’ve had good feedback.”
The app had a soft opening in January, with Jamal and Ravipati quietly promoting the first trial of their social network to 25 friends.
“We ended up getting about 200 people on those first trials, which seems to be a good sign,” Jamal said.
On March 15, NextSpot released version 1.2, which the founders more actively promoted in their extended social circles.
Jamal has tapped into his college network and is promoting the app at Georgetown with the help of NextSpot representatives Calvin Millien (COL ’16), Alana Snyder (MSB ’16) and Parker Wilf (MSB ’16).
Millien, who uses the app to coordinate his own meetings with friends and student groups, described the plan for promotion as gradual, but ultimately organization focused.
“We’re going to target friend groups so we can get feedback and once we get the best NextSpot, we can start to engage with student organizations,” Millien said. “We’re going to meet up with respective student groups and give a presentation about how they might be able to use it to help them organize.”
Jamal, too, accounts for a gradual growth of the app and looks to pursue his company for the long term, presenting NextSpot to investors to replace their current seed funding, which will determine future plans.
“The process of putting together a company really drives me, and I hope to do this for a while longer and see NextSpot grow into something much bigger than it is right now,” Jamal said.
As such, Jamal says he is unlikely to return to Georgetown, at present.
“I really love doing this and I miss school. It’s strange not having anyone around and being significantly younger than everyone else,” Jamal said. “But I’m really enjoying it and I don’t think that I’m going to come back next semester.”

After forced spending cuts put the U.S. Navy’s flight demonstration squadron,“The Blue Angels,” on the ground for a year, the Angels have gone airborne once again, with Lieutenant Commander Mark DeBuse (MED ’09) serving as the team’s official flight surgeon, following in the steps of Lt. Cmdr. Mark Lambert (MED ’00).
DeBuse was chosen for this position through a highly selective application process and is beginning his second year on tour with the Angels.
As flight surgeon, DeBuse is responsible for helping the team maintain optimal health and physical condition. For demonstration pilots travelling at extremely high speeds and low altitudes, something as minor as a head cold can be life-threatening.
“My patients are among the healthiest and the fittest individuals on the planet,” DeBuse said. “My job is to keep them that way.”
DeBuse, a Colorado native, decided to attend the United States Naval Academy with an interest in both medicine and aviation.
“I wanted to pursue both,” DeBuse said, “but I knew it would be easier for me to do aviation first.”
After graduating from the Naval Academy in 1996, DeBuse attended flight school in Pensacola, Fla., and subsequently spent nine years as a naval flight officer. When it came time to apply to medical school, Georgetown was his first choice.
“The idea of a well-rounded education aimed at eventful service was what I wanted, and Georgetown’s tradition of cura personalis absolutely fit me,” DeBuse said. Despite the 10-year age difference between him and most of his younger classmates, DeBuse said he loved his time at Georgetown and even participated in a Liberal Studies program.
“[It] provided a great balance to the science-heavy medical school curriculum,” he said.
After completing medical school and an orthopedic surgery internship at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., DeBuse elected to defer the remainder of his residency in order to become a flight surgeon, thus following in the footsteps of his maternal grandfather who was stationed at Pearl Harbor during the 1941 bombing and went on to become one of the Navy’s first-ever flight surgeons.
“He was very proud to have served, especially in a capacity that allowed him to take care of his fellow servicemen,” DeBuse said. “I wanted to do the same.”
Nearly 70 years after his grandfather, DeBuse completed the aerospace medicine course at the Naval Aerospace Medicine Institute and was officially designated a naval flight surgeon.
His decision to apply for a position with the Blue Angels came after talking with friend and former classmate Lambert, who served as the Angels’ flight surgeon from 2006 to 2008.
Lambert and DeBuse met during their undergraduate years at the Naval Academy where they ran on the track team together. Unlike DeBuse, however, Lambert attended the Georgetown University School of Medicine immediately after graduation.
While at Georgetown, Lambert formed close bonds with his classmates, with many of whom he still maintains frequent contact. He also got to know many of the deans and professors of the medical school and noted how they would often invite students to dinner or to do community service.
“My professors were so supportive of us,” Lambert said. “And that’s part of what made Georgetown so special.”
During his time at Georgetown, Lambert was exposed to many different specialties and surgical rotations, but in his third year, he found his passion in the anesthesiology department. After graduating in 2000, he completed a transitional internship in Bethesda before entering flight surgery school.
Lambert completed a two-year tour as flight surgeon at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, followed by another two-year tour with the Naval Reserve squadron at Whidbey Island, Wash; before becoming the flight surgeon for the Blue Angels.
At first, Lambert found it challenging to live in the public eye.
“I went into medicine because I wanted to be behind the scenes and help people,” he said. “I wasn’t looking for recognition.”
However, travelling and serving with the Angels proved to be a rewarding experience, during which he had the opportunity to visit schools and talk with potential medical students and military personnel and to visit children’s hospitals
“Seeing the kids’ eyes light up as we walked through in our uniforms made it all worth it,” Lambert remarked.
For Lambert, the Blue Angels team was just like a family. Even now, he keeps in close touch with many of the team members, both old and new. He recalled how DeBuse reached out to him during his application process.
“I could tell he really, really wanted to join the team,” Lambert said. “I remember calling him the day he got accepted and congratulating him. He was so excited, and I’m excited for him.”
DeBuse said that traveling with the team until November will be a true honor.
“Georgetown definitely prepared me for the mission of the Blue Angels,” he said. “My time with them has made me a better person, and next year, when I return to my specialty training in orthopedic surgery, I know for certain that having been a part of this high-performing team will translate into being a better physician and surgeon.”

The Kennedy Institute of Ethics will launch a massive open online course on bioethics April 15. As part of the creation of the course, the KIE hosted and filmed six TED-style talks featuring KIE Director Maggie Little in Gaston Hall on March 17, 19 and 24.
A MOOC is a free, online course open to anyone with an internet connection. More than 25,000 people from across the globe have signed up for the six -week bioethics course, the second MOOC Georgetown has offered as part of its edX partnership. The course, which has been in development since April 2013, will feature lessons from seven Georgetown faculty members. Little’s talks aim to provide MOOC students with an understanding of bioethical concerns in health.
The first talk on March 17 focused on medical and disability ethics, as well as bioethical concerns in hospitals and doctors’ offices. According to Little, an increased focus on bioethics came about during the civil rights movement.
“It’s a field that started in the time of the civil rights movement, the time of the women’s movement, when groups of people came forward with new voices to assert that they had rights that weren’t being respected,” Little said. “At just that time, another group came along that said ‘we’re patients or we’re clinical research participants and we have certain fundamental rights of autonomy that are not being respected.’”
Little also spoke about the modern-day erosion of the paternalistic idea that doctors know best.
The subsequent talks March 19 focused on bioethics with regard to beginning and end-of-life treatment, including abortion and physician assisted suicide. The talks on March 24 centralized on environmental bioethical concerns and global health systems.
After each talk, Little invited students to ask questions. Student questions were filmed for inclusion in the MOOC. According to KIE Head of Communications & Project Development Kelly Heuer, the question-and-answer section was created to help MOOC students get a better sense of the dynamics of an in-person classroom experience.
“As scholars and especially as educators, it’s our students who keep us on our toes, who push us to learn and experiment and explore more about topics that might already feel very familiar,” Heuer wrote in an email. “By including Georgetown student voices in the MOOC … we hope that a broader audience will be able to experience the dynamism of a typical Georgetown classroom — to learn from the questions as well as the answers themselves.”
According to Heuer, this section is an attempt to remedy a few of the setbacks and challenges associated with MOOCs.
“MOOCs are a tremendous challenge even for very experienced teachers and scholarsbecause so much of the traditional classroom experience is missing from the massive, open, online context,” Heuer wrote.
According to KIE senior research scholar Karen Stohr, despite their challenges, MOOCs align with Georgetown’s goals and Jesuit values.
“The Jesuits were explorers, educational innovators,” Stohr said in a video. “Nearly 500 years later, Georgetown’s mission continues to direct us to respond generously and creatively to the needs of a changing world.”

For graduate students looking for study space dedicated for them on the Hilltop, many find their options limited solely to the undergraduate-packed Lauinger Library.
Although the graduate student population of 8,226 students at Georgetown outnumbers the university’s 7,092 undergraduates, there is a scarcity of on-campus spaces reserved for graduate students. Graduate Student Organization President Samuel Osea (GRD ’14) said that study space is a large problem for the entire student body.
“Space is an issue that everyone, including graduate and undergraduate students, has to deal with. It’s doesn’t just impact graduate students,” he said. “I don’t think that any grad students have a chip on their shoulders about undergraduates using space: it’s limited and everyone needs to share it.”
Some graduate students expressed dissatisfaction with the availability of space on campus.
“Honestly, I do most of my studying at my house,” graduate student Damien Hedden (GRD ’14) said. “Lau is too filled with undergraduates, and it’s also really inconvenient for me to get to. There aren’t many other places on campus I could go, either.”
According to University Librarian Artemis Kirk, Lauinger Library has some study spaces reserved particularly for graduate students.
“The study carrels in Lau are reserved for specific graduate students, usually those working on finishing their doctorates,” Kirk said.
Others, however, expressed satisfaction with the options offered by the library and other open areas on campus.
“I don’t have any trouble finding study space, to be honest,” Kathleen Salls (GRD ’14) said. “Lau doesn’t bother me, especially the graduate student reading rooms. Otherwise, Sellinger is an okay place to work.”
Additionally, there are two graduate reading rooms in Lauinger and short-term study rooms are also available for graduate students to book for private or group studying.
Kirk also said that the library is working on increasing availability of study spaces for all students, including graduate students.
“We understand the value of study spaces exclusive to graduate students, especially because the work they do is often of a different nature than undergraduate work,” Kirk said. “It often requires much more independent and quiet study, so we try to facilitate that.”
When the second floor of Lauinger was renovated last year, increased study space became available. Kirk said that the effort to make the library more usable will continue.
“The library is tight on space, but we are exploring ways to maximize the available space,” she said. “The removal of those stacks on Lau 2 really opened up a lot of study space.”
“In the past, the Georgetown University Student Association and the GSO haven’t worked together very much, though [former GUSA President] Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) reached out to me to start that partnership,” Osea said.
Osea said that he hopes to work with new GUSA President Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) to improve spaces.
“We endorsed Trevor and Omika, and we have high hopes for this year and coming years,” he said. “Hopefully, this is one issue that undergraduates and graduate students can work together on.”

The second annual China-U.S. Forum, co-hosted by the Georgetown University Chinese Students and Scholars Association and the School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program, involved discussions on changes to economic and global governance patterns Friday in Lohrfink Auditorium.
CSSA Chair Miaomiao Shao (GRD ’16) emphasized the importance of examining the relations between China and the United States.
“The goal of the forum is to provide a unique platform for policymakers, business leaders, scholars [and] students to discuss current issues regarding China-U.S. relations in the area of economic, political and cultural cooperation,” Shao said. “We are so lucky to have so many distinguished speakers with us here today.”
Victor Cha, the director of the SFS Asian Studies Program, served as the moderator for the event. Cha introduced David Dollar, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy and Global Economy and Development programs at the Brookings Institute. Dollar is a preeminent scholar on China’s economy and relations with the United States.
Dollar’s opening talk focused on China’s growth model. He expressed a desire that that the model will contribute to a strong foundation for China-U.S. economic relations.
“China’s obviously had a very long and successful period of economic growth. It’s grown at an average rate above 10 percent for three decades,” Dollar said.
Dollar drew connections to his previous experiences overseeing economic development in Japan and South Korea, countries that both share a similar growth model to China. Although there were commonalities between the three economically successful Asian nations, Dollar did note that certain parts of the Chinese experience are unprecedented: high levels of investment have been critical to the Chinese economy, more so than the technological growth that provided the surge for Japanese and South Korean sectors.
Dollar tempered his report of China’s unprecedented growth, warning that the economic model for China is also unsustainable.
“When you are so dependent on capital accumulation, you end up seeing diminishing returns to capital,” Dollar said. “The model is running out of steam. Investment is still going up, but growth is slowing down. It’s taking more and more investment to grow at slower and slower rates.”
While Dollar noted that the growth model had been successful in poverty reduction, the negative environmental externalities and the unsustainability of the system remain major flaws in need of reform.
He identified four specific features of the Chinese fiscal growth system that need reform in order to free China’s economic sector: the household registration system, financial repression, a large state enterprise sector and the one-party system.
Dollar affirmed current legislation promised by the Chinese government — such as opening up the economy to foreign investment — as positive actions if implemented.
After Dollar’s presentation, three panels were introduced to fill out the remainder of the seven-hour event. The first panel was focused on new trends in global economic patterns and China-U.S. cooperation. The second panel dealt with China-U.S. relations as a whole, including cultural and military aspects. The final panel helped develop the issue of social welfare and development in China.
There were over 50 people in attendance at the event, though attendees migrated in and out of the seven-hour forum. Despite minimal attendance from undergraduates, graduate students, primarily from the McCourt School of Public Policy, largely populated the event.
Students pointed to the opportunity to see experts from other schools as a highlight of the event. Claire Peng (GRD ’17) also appreciated the interaction and debates between the different professors at the forum.
“Most people would think economic growth results in more pollution, but [the professors] kind of disagreed with each other. There were a lot of debates, but it’s very interesting to see how they get their conclusions,” Peng said.

Ownership of the Corcoran Gallery and the Corcoran College of Art and Design changed hands to the National Gallery of Art and The George Washington University, respectively, on Feb. 19.
The gallery currently serves as the largest privately supported cultural institution in Washington, D.C., and it is renowned for its wide collection of contemporary American art. Since the administrative change, the gallery was renamed Corcoran Contemporary, National Gallery of Art. While the National Gallery oversees the gallery collection, GWU oversees the college of art and design and the operational responsibilities of the gallery.
Corcoran Gallery Vice President of Marketing and Communications Mimi Carter explained that the new collaboration provided a sustainable solution for the future of both the gallery and the college.
“The Corcoran College and Art of Design needed a financially sustainable solution for the gallery and the college,” Carter said. “Partnering with GWU and NGA helped us to preserve the Corcoran collection, keep the iconic building as a gallery and a showcase for contemporary art and simultaneously enabled us to maintain the connection between the college and the gallery.”
Carter added that the board of trustees thought the decision was the best option that would both safeguard and increase access to the gallery’s collection while maintaining deep roots in the community. Since its creation in 1874, the gallery has provided numerous services as a cultural, educational and civic resource, such as art outreach programs, community service partnerships and exhibitions highlighting local District artists.
Georgetown Director for the Art and Museum Studies Program Alison Hilton agreed that the administrative change was the best immediate solution.
“I hope with the change with this new and interesting balance of administration will yield some creative long term solutions,” Hilton said. “I should also say that the Corcoran is not only a museum but also an art school, and it’s the only thing of its kind. So in some ways, it makes sense to try this different kind of solution.”
Hilton stressed the importance of the art collection’s accessibility, particularly in light of founder William Corcoran’s reasoning behind a joint art school-museum entity.
“Studio art students go to the gallery very often to be in touch with contemporary art. For art history, we use the collection for studies and research and enjoyment,” Hilton said. “I hope the museum part will be even more accessible for the undergrads coming along. It will be a big benefit to students who aren’t necessarily majors but who care about the art.”
In addition to exhibition accessibility, Hilton added that professors themselves take art and art history classes at Corcoran College.
“We do this. We always use the museum,” Hilton said. “For art history students, it’s great. Same goes for American Studies students and the other major students who have an interest in art.”
As the gallery transitions from a private entity to a public one, Hilton said the museum’s operations may change depending on GWU’s administrative decisions.
“The study of art history in universities and the study of art in museums are much more integrated than in the past,” Hilton said. “This collaboration between GWU and the National Gallery of Art could be an ideal way to demonstrate that integration.

In an attempt to advance Georgetown’s reputation as a connected, worldly university, the Office of Communications founded the Social Media Working Group in 2012 with the goal of developing a unified strategy for social media as an engagement tool on campus at the administrative level.
Although the administrative working group has seen much success, a partner student working group is still waiting to take off.
Since its creation, the administrative working group has focused on publicizing the Georgetown experience from students’ perspectives.
“It’s been really fun to experiment and talk with students about the way that we can allow them to tell their experience of events, not just in the typical way that we would tell outside audiences about what happens on campus,” University Social Media and Communications Manager Rob Mathis said.
For example, the group has dispatched student live tweeters to high-profile Georgetown events and put out short student news profile clips of events.
Mathis also reported that while there is widespread interest in the formation of the partner student social media working group, it has not gotten off the ground yet.
“We put a poll out there and there was a lot of interest in it, but I don’t know that we are ready yet and that we understand what the most useful way is for students to come together on it. We want it to start as organically as the university-level working group did,” Mathis said.
Cody Cowan (SFS ’14) is working with Mathis in determining the best way to create a student working group, but efforts have been met with difficulties.
“Our original intent was to provide students and student groups with the resources and support that university departments and administrators have through their working group, but at the same time, student groups are not all the same, and not all trying to show a united front,” Cowan said.
Another issue is that the amount of information to put out for student groups is significantly less than administrative level information, which takes away from the prospective student working group’s usefulness. Despite these obstacles, Cowan has hope for student-run social media at Georgetown and has seen marked progress in university groups’ usage of social media resources since he arrived on campus four years ago.
“[Four years ago] some clubs didn’t have HoyaLink pages, some had websites and Facebook groups, and some didn’t. Some clubs have definitely gotten a lot better [with social media], and The Corp is probably at the top of the hierarchy because they have an entire department dedicated to IT and marketing,” Cowan said.
Students of Georgetown Inc. Marketing Director Norma Hutchinson (SFS ’16) noted the increasing importance of social media in the group’s marketing campaign.
“I think in the next year social media is going to play an even more pivotal role in marketing and how we structure our department, how we campaign and how we focus our resources,” said Hutchinson.
While The Corp and other student groups used to advertise through more traditional media, including paper flyers, social media has changed the nature of student-group advertising and awareness efforts.
“We’ve noticed that a lot of students don’t engage with flyers as much anymore. It’s not a physical thing that is just posted around campus anymore. Everything is through social media, and we’ve moved a lot more towards that route,” said Hutchinson, who helps maintain The Corp’s large Facebook, Twitter and Instagram presences.
International Relations Club Chair of the board of directors Jeff Caso (SFS ’15) detailed the student group’s increasing social media movement.
“We’ve made the decision to switch from using a Facebook group to a Facebook page. This enables us to post material, such as photos and events, as the IRC. We’ve found that this is a great way to market events to a larger demographic. We typically host events that are very specialized substantively, so it’s excellent to be able to reach an audience composed of the entire Georgetown community,” Caso wrote in an email.
In addition, the group launched a new website, expanded its Flickr account to capture visual memories of IRC events and posted its membership and leadership applications as Facebook event pages to expand their reach.
With student groups amplifying their respective social media efforts, and the SMWG working to improve the university’s social media prowess at the administrative level, Georgetown is set to strengthen its grasp on multimedia recruitment, fundraising and event awareness. Mathis believes that this ongoing process will require all facets of the university to work in cohesion.
“I think social media is really becoming the home page for any organization. I have always said ‘If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, then go together.’ I think the working group has been really great at that,” Mathis said.
