A Washington Post poll released Wednesday shows incumbent D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray holding a double-digit lead for the April 1 Democratic mayoral primary, despite concerns over the ethics scandal that engulfed his 2010 run for mayor.
However, with just 24 percent of registered Democrats saying they would back the mayor’s re-election bid, Gray leaves plenty of room for his opponents to narrow the gap over the next two and a half months.
This statistic has left hopefuls like Councilmember Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) confident that the race is wide open.
“I don’t think this poll changes our strategy at all. We’re running against an incumbent. If we were ahead of him, it would be stunning,” Bowser said. “I think the number that jumps out to me is that 76 percent of D.C. wants somebody else to be mayor, and we think we’re going to be the one people coalesce around throughout this campaign.
Candidate and Councilmember Jack Evans’ (D-Ward 2) campaign spokesman Jermaine House was similarly encouraged by the poll numbers.
“Over 70 percent of District residents want a change in leadership,” House said. “As people continue to learn about Jack’s record of creating jobs and bringing economic opportunity to every resident, he will emerge as the strongest candidate, and our campaign has the resources to ensure this message is heard citywide.”
Gray’s nearest challengers include Bowser, Evans and Councilmember Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), who garnered 12, 11 and 11 percent of the vote, respectively. Councilmember Vincent Orange (D-At Large) received 9 percent of the vote, and Busboys and Poets restaurateur Andy Shallal rounded out the field with 5 percent.
The mayor did receive high marks among D.C. residents on some topics, with 68 percent of respondents saying he has done a good job attracting new business to the District. In addition, almost 60 percent of D.C. residents believe the city is on the right track. Candidates’ reactions to the poll demonstrated that they were quick to pounce on what they perceived as a desire for change among District voters.
“The major finding from the poll is that D.C. Democratic voters want fresh leadership with unquestionable integrity and a new vision to overcome the growing economic inequality in the District,” Shallal said in a press release from his campaign on Tuesday.
To Shallal’s point, the poll found that 54 percent of D.C. residents do not believe Gray is honest and trustworthy, a sign that his vulnerabilities are still left over from his 2010 investigation persist.
Candidate and former State Department official Reta Jo Lewis, who officially launched her campaign back in November, remained confident even though this poll had her support at around 1 percent.
“This race is wide open — many are undecided, and most don’t yet know me,” Lewis said in a statement. “But it shows what we’ve been saying: Education, crime, jobs, ethics and integrity — all are important to voters when deciding who should lead this city. I look forward to introducing myself to voters, and then they can decide if my vision for D.C., to include everyone in its progress, is right for them.”
Thus far the election’s potential wildcard is Councilmember David Catania (I-At Large) (SFS ’90, LAW ’94), who is well known in the District, but has not come to a decision on whether or not to run in the November general election. Former city contractor and fellow mayoral candidate Christian Carter garnered 1 percent of likely votes.

Although Georgetown students are mourning the loss of the popular Mexican restaurant Qdoba, several new nightlife and retail options have opened in the Georgetown neighborhood since students left campus before the holidays.
Qdoba, a popular franchise around the country best known in Georgetown for its weekly half-price night, closed its doors at 3303 M St. in early January. The restaurant owner could not be reached for comment.
However, Danielle Winslow, a public relations and marketing consultant for Chipotle Mexican Grill, which operates a location down the street at 3255 M St., remained optimistic regarding the prospects for Georgetown restaurants.
“Being near a university, Georgetown is one of our hot spots. We put our restaurants in locations where we think we are going to have strong daytime and nighttime traffic,” Winslow said.
In the meantime, a new Irish pub, Rí Rá, opened at 3125 M St. in the former location of Asian restaurant Mie N Yu which closed in October 2012.
According to a recent press release, Rí Rá aims to be “a true Irish pub experience.”
“We have artifacts and wood from Ireland that create a beautiful space that fits in really well with the Georgetown area,” said Andrew Christie, mid-Atlantic group business director for the Rí Rá Group of Companies, which also operates a Rí Rá pub in nearby Arlington, Va. “A neighborhood social gathering is really what an Irish pub should be all about,” Christie said.
Though Rí Rá attracted many Georgetown students in its first week, Rhino Bar and Pumphouse Manager George Kennedy was not worried about possible competition.
“They cater to a different clientele. There’s not really a competition factor,” Kennedy said.
Kennedy in fact characterized the opening of more bars as a positive development, pointing out that general foot traffic in Georgetown at night has declined since the bar Saloun closed in September 2011.
“There are fewer places to venture out in Georgetown than there used to be,” Kennedy said. “The more bars that become popular, the more people that will come to Georgetown. It’s a positive to have more [bars and restaurants].”
Emily Gaffney (MSB ’15) thought the pub brought a nice change to the Georgetown nightlife scene.
“I liked it a lot. I thought it was a fun new spot that was conducive to socializing and hanging out with your friends and had good drinks that would make me choose it over Rhino as a nice change,” Gaffney said.
In the retail industry, one new stores has opened and another will open this year: high-end clothing and accessories store Tory Burch, which opened November 2013 at 1211 Wisconsin Ave., and luxury resort-wear spot Calypso St. Barth, which is set to open this spring at 3307 M St. These Georgetown locations are the first for both brands in the D.C. area.
Students expressed excitement over the opening of the new Tory Burch store, though the high price point did dissuade them from making purchases.
“I know I’ll go in and see how pretty it is and just see what’s up to date, but I probably won’t buy anything in them, obviously, because I’m a broke student,” Emma Barnitt (MSB ’17) said.
Hill & Dale Records will also open a new location at 1054 31st St. on Feb. 7. Owned by Rob Norton, a Georgetown professor who teaches “The Art of Advocacy” in the Master of Science in Foreign Service program, the store will offer “new records and music-related photography, posters and collectibles,” according to Norton.
Despite the proliferation of digital music, Norton said that vinyl is a growing niche in the music industry.
“It’s an exciting time in the music business. People are switching to digital, but vinyl is growing,” Norton said.
Norton selected the Georgetown neighborhood after looking at other neighborhoods in D.C.
“I had been looking for space all over the District and focused on the U Street corridor and initially hadn’t thought about Georgetown, but when the space became available, I jumped right on it,” Norton said. “It sounded like a great opportunity, so I took it. Georgetown is a fantastic place to do business.”
While Devon McCann (COL ’16) would prefer lower-priced stores in the neighborhood, she understood that the area has bred an upscale retail environment.
“I think that’s what makes Georgetown Georgetown, is like the high-end stores, not saying that I support that because I can’t shop there at all, it’s just kind of a trait of Georgetown.”

Students across the country, including those at Georgetown, got the opportunity to trade words with Secretary of Education Arne Duncan during a Twitter conversation that stressed financial literacy and the affordability of higher education Monday evening.
The conversation came just three days before President Obama unveiled a new college affordability plan in conjunction with universities and non-profit groups.
The dialogue, under the hashtag #StuVoice, was part of a series of weekly Twitter chats led by Student Voice, a non-partisan, non-profit student-run organization aimed at addressing the nation’s educational problems and allowing student voices to be heard through its digital platform. It was the first time the Department utilized Twitter as a formal platform for discussion.
The Dept. of Education also sought feedback through the Twitter discussion, asking students to help with the creation of a college rating system that would help students and families to determine the value and affordability of different colleges.
“I’m a huge proponent of financial literacy. We must do a much better job of giving students the tools and info they need,” Duncan tweeted.
Georgetown University Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming (SFS ’72) said that the amount of financial aid that a college gives should be considered when debating how much reform is needed at individual institutions.
“As the administration looks at how it would structure a ratings proposal, it’s important that they not look at simply sticker price … because of the importance of institutional aid in bringing down that cost for many students,” Fleming said.
Duncan called for more information, such as post-graduation employment statistics, to become accessible to current and prospective college students.
“Transparency will empower students and change behavior,” Duncan tweeted.
Fleming said that while it is important to communicate graduation outcomes, such as statistical information about employment and earning, schools such as Georgetown that have a tradition of graduates entering service-oriented professions must also be taken into account.
“We think it is very important that if any kind of rating system is developed, it take into account things like people who decide on their own to go into professions like Teach for America, the Peace Corps or the clergy,” Fleming said.
According to Fleming, the Office of Federal Relations has communicated to the Obama administration that this qualitative information should be included in the rating system.
“They’re very understanding,” Fleming said, “I think they’re stilling grappling with how to actually make that happen.”
Throughout the hour-long Twitter conversation, Duncan tried to gauge the opinions of students and parents concerning how families compare colleges, which factors are most important in selecting a school and how to judge the value of a particular college.
“Student voice is so important to our team as we think through policy decision,” Duncan tweeted.
While most students cited program quality and academic strength as the most important factors in selecting a college, many agreed that these considerations were oftentimes trumped by financial concerns.
Last summer, Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) reached out to student body presidents across the country to sign a letter urging Congress to pass a bill to freeze student loan rates until 2015.
“It’s something that doesn’t only hit home for me but for all students at Georgetown who have substantial loans in order to be able to afford an education,” Ramadan said.
The duo also circulated a Georgetown-wide petition to encourage Congress not to raise student loan rates. Ramadan commended the university’s need-blind policy and continued commitment to helping students afford their Georgetown education.
“Access to education and students’ ability to receive their education isn’t something that those students see as a game,” Ramadan said.“The fact that we are need-blind and that we stay true to that I think is something that needs to be advertised more and

5 members of the Georgetown University and Georgetown Law communities were named to Forbes’ prestigious “30 Under 30” list for 2014.
Derek Khanna (LAW ’15), Lauren Wilson (LAW ’12) and Jonathan Fantini Porter (SFS ’06) were selected to the Law and Policy list while Jonathan Amoona (LAW ’09) and Luke Holden (MSB ‘07) were recognized on the Sports and Food lists respectively. The list, which began in 2012, seeks to recognize tomorrow’s brightest, all of whom are under 30 years old. Forbes lists individuals in 15 fields, ranging from Finance to Art & Design.
“All being selected to Forbes’ ‘30 Under 30’ Sports list means to me is, first, my hard work is being recognized and, second, to keep working hard and to keep doing what I’m doing and always strive to get better each day,” Amoona, 29, said.
Amoona is currently an associate at Winston & Strawn in New York. According to Forbes, Amoonawas selected for his work “at the forefront of some of the biggest sports legal battles in recent years.”
Notably, Amoona was a member of the trial team that overturned National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell’s punishments against four New Orleans Saints players in the Saints’ bounty scandal, in which the team rewarded players financially for certain hits during games.
Wilson, 26, currently works for Free Press in policy counsel.
“I was stunned and absolutely thrilled,” she said. “Actually, when last year’s list came out, I said to a friend, ‘I have to make this list before I turn 30,’ and always kept that in the back of my mind. I was really shocked that I received the recognition so soon.”
For Wilson, the recognition is especially meaningful because of the attention it has brought to her work and Free Press’ mission.
“The issues I work on aren’t always sexy. When people think about causes in which they want to be active, few think of communications issues,” she said.
Unlike the others named, Khanna, 25, is still a student at Georgetown Law and currently in his third year. Khanna was largely recognized for his work on copyright reform for the House Republican Study Committee and his cellphone unlocking campaign that resulted in new legislation.
Khanna said he feels the award is in part recognition of the work of everyone who worked on thecellphone unlocking campaign, which included the first White House petition to reach 100,000 signatures.
“It really shows that people can overcome the most powerful lobbying interests when they unite behind an important cause,” he said.
Honorees noted the role that Georgetown played in both their professional and personal development.
Apart from attending every Georgetown basketball game during his time at Georgetown, Amoona said his relationships with faculty and peers have been instrumental in his success.
“Everybody who goes to Georgetown has a very unique background and that benefits, in my view, the student as a whole, and that’s what made my three years there so special,” he said.
As for her time at Georgetown Law, Wilson said her work with Angela Campbell, the clinical director of the Institute for Public Representation’s First Amendment and Media Law Project, stands out as impacting her profoundly. “It’s safe to say I would not be doing what I do now were it not for Georgetown and a professor I had there, Angela Campbell. She introduced me to the public interest side of communications law, relayed why this work was so important and most importantly, trained me.”
Porter, 29, who studied international affairs at Georgetown, currently works for the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, overseeing day-to-day management of a $5.8 billion Federal budget as chief of staff for management.
“It’s great to see younger professionals recognized for the decision to pursue public service by a major publication like Forbes,” Porter wrote in an email to the Los Angeles Daily News. “I’m humbled that they chose to include me, and most of all it makes my mom happy.”

A new bill working its way through the D.C. City Council could make the District one of only a few cities in the country to award legal, non-U.S. citizens the right to vote in municipal elections.
The Local Residents Voting Rights Act, introduced in early December by Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) and co-sponsored by Councilmembers Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) and Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), would give the approximately 49,000 age-eligible residents in the District who are foreign born, but not naturalized U.S. citizens, the ability to vote for things like their Advisory Neighborhood Commission representative, District councilmember and the mayor.
According to Grosso, the bill would be strictly limited to local municipal elections and would not expand to the federal level.
“This bill would not, for example, allow non-citizens to vote for Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) or for the president. It would only be the local elected offices,” Grosso told THE HOYA.
Currently, there are seven jurisdictions in the U.S. that allow non-citizens to vote in local elections, six of which are located in neighboring Maryland.
Capitalizing on the “taxation without representation” theme popularized in District politics, the bill’s proponents like Councilmember Wells see it as simply an expansion of voting rights to people whose daily lives are affected by representatives they currently cannot vote for.
“D.C. residents know all too well what it means to be denied equal voting rights in the United States,” Wells said. “It goes without question that every resident of D.C. deserves a vote and a voice in our local government. D.C. needs to be a great place for everyone to live, work and raise a family.”
A similar bill was introduced in 2004 to the council but, Grosso said, was ultimately rejected due to the political climate at the time.
“Personally, I think the farther we get away from the disasters that happened in the early 2000s with 9/11, the more our country will recognize that it’s important to embrace other people into our society, including immigrants that are here legally and are residents in our city,” he said.
Wells and Bowser, who are both vying to be the District’s next mayor, emphasized the bill as part of their aim to decrease inequality in the city.
“While we’re fighting for the members of our community through marriage equality, minimum wage increases, better services and more – we can’t pick and choose one group over another,” Bowser wrote in an e-mail to THE HOYA. “It’s time to give our residents who are legal immigrants and have worked hard to contribute to this great city something they’re deserving of: a voice.”
Besides the specifics of the bill, Grosso said he believes it holds importance for the District’s push for more autonomy from the federal government.
“ I know we’re in a unique place and I don’t want to be naive about it, but I’m tired for asking the federal government for permission to do what I think is right,” Grosso said.
President of Hoyas for Immigrant Rights Citlalli Alvarez (COL ’16) said she is optimistic about the bill’s passage, though was wary of the bill’s potential use as a political ploy in the mayoral race.
“There are two things which make me optimistic about this bill. First, last fall, undocumented immigrants were granted the opportunity to apply for driver’s licenses in the District. The provision is set to take effect this year. Second, some of the council members are currently running for mayor.,” Alvarez said.
Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15), former president of the College Democrats, hoped that the bill would be accompanied by more progressive immigration reform.
“I think first and foremost there needs to be [federal] immigration reform so that a lot of these individuals are put on a path to citizenship,” Tezel said.
The bill currently remains on the docket of the council, and it is unclear whether or not a major push is in line for its sponsors before the April 1 Democratic mayoral primary.

The School of Continuing Studies has launched a new master’s in hospitality management program to keep pace with the District of Columbia’s growing hospitality industry, including the highly anticipated Trump Hotel that will take over the former Old Post Office Pavilion in 2015.
The program, which is accepting applicants for fall 2014, was created in response to D.C.’s emerging hospitality industry, according to Interim Dean of the School of Continuing Studies Walter Rankin.
“There is a real industry need for leaders who have a mix of business, legal, and creative skills to bring real innovation to the global hospitality and tourism industry,” Rankin said. “We also identified this emerging field as one that fits ideally with our other programs in areas like real estate and urban and regional planning.”
According to data from the Department of Labor, the D.C. hospitality industry added 11,700 jobs from February 2012 to 2013. Rankin also said that Georgetown’s location in D.C. is ideal for teaching about hospitality.
“Many people don’t know this, but the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region is home to major international hotel and tourism companies,” Rankin said. “These include the global headquarters for Marriott, Hilton, Choice Hotels and Urgo. Additionally, students will have many opportunities for internships and externships in our local downtown neighborhood.”
The hospitality management program will be the tenth degree offered by the SCS and is already generating excitement among faculty.
“It is an exceptional blend of theory and practice and will be taught by an amazing cadre of faculty,” SCS Senior Associate Dean Christopher Metzler said.
According to Metzler, the program will focus on the international market and emphasize practical training and experience.
“This program, through classes and internships, gives students the opportunity to gain knowledge and apply it right away,” Metzler said. “The program has tremendous potential to bridge the gap between academia and industry, is highly interactive, and will define standards of hospitality and management and service for generations to come.”
The degree will also emphasize the growing role that technology has played in the hospitality and tourism industry.
“Today, for example, hotel guests expect to be able to check-in from their mobile devices, charge food and drinks to their key card and receive loyalty discounts via email,” Rankin said. “We think the next generation of hospitality industry leaders will need to be technology-savvy and use innovation as a driving force behind their work.”
The SCS is currently in the process of appointing the program’s executive director, who will spend the following nine months constructing course curriculum and hiring experts in the hospitality and management industry as faculty.
“We are looking for a creative leader who knows the industry,” Metzler said. “One who is both a visionary and an executor. One who values students and can create a globally outstanding program.”
Christian Fernando (SFS ’17), was not surprised by the major, given D.C.’s booming tourist industry.
“Washington, D.C., is definitely a hub of tourist activity, because it has so many interesting museums and there are things like the Washington Monument, the Capitol, and the White House. People either from other states or from around the world, who come to the United States, want to see these tourist destinations,” Fernando said.

University President John J. DeGioia joined more than 100 other leaders in higher education at a White House event focused on expanding college opportunities for low-income students Thursday.
The College Opportunity Summit, held by President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, brought together college presidents, as well as business and nonprofit leaders, to discuss how they could work toward the goal.
“The main reason for the initiative is to increase social mobility for America’s underprivileged youth,” National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling, who led a panel at the event, said in a media call the previous day.
The event is part of Obama’s “year of action,” a proposed series of executive actions designed to promote job creation and economic growth that is focused on cooperation between the public and private sector and implement new policy without formal legislation.
“Today is a great example of how, without a whole bunch of new legislation, we can advance this agenda,” Obama said. He also mentioned the possibility of using executive powers to authorize future governmental actions related to increasing college enrollment.
While Obama spoke about the newly resurgent national economy, he nevertheless warned that this growth represents just a fraction of the improvement necessary to fully conquer the nation’s struggle with inequality. Obama, a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, noted the importance of promoting equal opportunities for social advancement through higher education.
“We need to make sure that there are new ladders of opportunity in the middle class, and that the rungs on those ladders are solid and more accessible,” he said. “More than ever, a college degree is the surest path to a stable middle-class life.”
While educational progress has occurred under the current administration, Obama stressed the persistently low percentage of low-income students enrolling in higher education and receiving degrees.
“We still have a long way to go before we unlock the doors to higher education to more Americans, and especially lower-income Americans,” Obama said.
Michelle Obama also spoke at the event, describing her personal experiences applying to and attending Princeton University, and how this time shaped her current educational ambitions.
“I know from my own experience just how important all of that work is that we are doing,” she said. “I know that there are so many kids out there just like me, kids that had parents that never went to college, or maybe they were never encouraged to believe they could succeed there, and it’s our job to find those kids and get them enrolled in a college that can meet their needs.”
The first lady urged those present to continue their previous efforts to promote educational opportunity, especially in developing programs designed to assimilate students of diverse and troubled backgrounds to collegiate life. “You all have shown that you have the experience, the passion and the resources to help these young people thrive,” she said. “We need you to direct that same energy and determination toward helping these kids face their unique challenges.”
The universities represented at the event, including Georgetown, agreed to aid secondary schools with their college-preparation programs, boost remedial programs and work to level the playing field with regard to college admissions by helping low-income students with standardized testing.
“Everybody here is participating, I believe, because we know that college graduation has never been more valuable than it is today,” the president said.
Prior to the summit, DeGioia released a statement expressing support for Obama’s educational initiatives and the mission of the White House convention.
“We wish to thank the White House for convening this conversation,” DeGioia said in the statement. “One of the most important commitments we can make, as university leaders, is to ensure that the very best students have the opportunity to attend our institutions — and to provide them with the necessary resources to do their very best work and become their very best selves.”
Additionally, the press release highlighted Georgetown programs designed to support qualified high school students requiring financial assistance. These initiatives include the Georgetown Scholarship Program, the Community Scholars Program, the Preparing to Excel pre-orientation program and a partnership with the Posse Foundation designed to promote exploration of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.
Following the remarks at the summit, DeGioia expressed excitement for Obama’s educational goals and promised a future commitment to expanding educational opportunity for disadvantaged students.
“We were invited in early in the planning, and so we are strongly aligned with the goals of the president and ensuring their success, and we have a number of programs that we put in place over the course of a generation to try to ensure that,” DeGioia told The Hoya. “We’re very excited to be a part of it, and excited there is such a strong commitment to higher education from our White House to ensure focus on this in the future.”
DeGioia described the high level of interest in engaging low-income students that he sensed from the other academic representatives at the event.
“I think there’s a profound commitment that has been in place in higher education, and that what you see here is the depth of engagement that characterizes this form of higher education,” DeGioia said.

GUSA Election Commissioner Ethan Chess (COL ’14) filed a petition with the GUSA Constitutional Council on Thursday night requesting the invalidation of Sunday’s election for GUSA speaker, which propelled Senator EmilySiegler (SFS ’14) to the position after Vice Speaker Sam Greco (SFS ’15) failed to win a majority in a confirmation vote to assume to role.
The petition, which also requests an injunction against senate procedures until the speaker issue is resolved, claims that Greco automatically assumed the speakership when former Speaker George Spyropoulos (COL ’14) resigned Dec. 8, and that the confirmation vote that Greco lost 13-9 on Sunday was not in line with GUSA procedure. If the confirmation vote is deemed unnecessary by the Constitutional Council, the subsequent election for speaker, which Siegler won with 10 votes to Greco’s three, will be invalidated.
Chess submitted his petition by email to the three members of the Constitutional Council, which has not seen a case since 2010. Chess said he did not consult any other members of GUSA in drafting the petition and does not have political motivations behind its filing, which is not part of his official capacity in the Election Commission.
“My concern is more for the process than the political,” Chess said. “I’m apolitical; I have no horse in any race, anywhere, ever. My horse in the race is process, which was very clearly violated.”
“My aim in filing this petition is not to directly protect Sam Greco, it’s to protect the institution,” Chess said. “It’s not for me about Sam Greco. It’s more about protecting the institution.”
In his petition, Chess stresses the significance of this decision to upcoming GUSA elections.
“The petitioner believes that it is fundamentally important for the procedural and electoral health ofGUSA that the results of an illegitimate election be held from entering into force,” the petition reads. “Without this injunction, the procedural and institutional legitimacy of GUSA enter a precarious state. With important electoral and fiduciary decisions for the Association on the near-term horizon, it is essential that this process be carried through in an orderly and civil manner.”
Though Greco was not involved in drafting this petition, he agreed with Chess that the election’s circumstances were suspect.
“I think that there are definitely constitutional questions that deserve a second look,” Greco said.
Siegler commented briefly on Chess’ decision to file the petition.
“I believe that we all have the agency as individuals to act as such, and Ethan is using his agency as an individual, so if he so feels that that’s the right avenue then he has the right to do that,” she said.
The three-member Constitutional Council plans to meet tomorrow and to issue a press release after their meeting. At least one member of the council must vote to accept Chess’ petition before it is considered, and two members must agree on a final decision if the petition is accepted.
“We have received Ethan Chess’ petition,” GUSA Justice Josh Shinbrot (COL ’16) said. “We have not yet voted on whether we will accept the petition.”
The decision whether to approve the requested writ of mandamus that would invalidate Siegler’selection as speaker and put Greco in the role is separate from the decision whether to issue an injunction to suspend senate operations until a decision on the speakership is made. The council could decide on any combination of the above two decisions.
GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) appeared unaware of the events Thursday night, with neither acquainted with the details of the petition or its filing.
“The senate is, for all intents and purposes, its own body,” Ramadan said. “I will be there if it needs me to be there, but I’m not concerned going forward.”

A campus-wide free speech forum held by the Georgetown University Student Association and the university administration on Thursday night attracted students passionate about the issue. The forum’s purpose was to promote discussion and debate of Georgetown’s policy on free speech and its practice on campus.
The forum, titled “Free Speech in the Digital Age: Are There Boundaries?” featured Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., history professor Marcia Chatelain, former Chair of The Hoya Board of Directors Lauren Weber (COL ’13) andGUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14). The panel was moderated by Vice President for Public Affairs and Senior Advisor to the President Erik Smulson in LohrfinkAuditorium.
Reform of free speech at Georgetown was a central component of Tisa’s campaign for the GUSAexecutive spot last year, and in October, he highlighted speech reform as a goal of the second half of his term. This forum, however, represents the first public push toward bringing free speech into wider campus conversation.
“We wanted to provide an opportunity for students to voice their concerns directly to administrators and we wanted to do it in a way that would promote change afterward, as opposed to just voicing concerns and letting it fizzle,” Tisa said.
Panelists were chosen based on their knowledge of and experience with the free speech policy, which says “expression that is indecent or is grossly obscene or grossly offensive on matters such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation is inappropriate in a university community and the University will act as it deems appropriate to educate students violating this principle.”
“I don’t think it’s up to me, or in some cases, the university, to determine what’s offensive. For me, my quibble with the speech policy is essentially that it’s hard to tell what’s offensive and what’s not,” Weber said during the panel.
During a question-and-answer session, H*yas for Choice Vice President Abigail Grace (SFS ’16) questioned the benefits of the free speech policy for clubs that are unrecognized by the university, such as H*yas for Choice.
“The free speech and expression policy is something that is very central to our ability to exist on campus. Unfortunately for us, we haven’t been able to operate in the way the free speech and expression policy outlines, specifically in regards to free speech zones,” Grace said. “You can sit here and say how we’re all a community and how we all want to have discourse, but if that’s not actually implemented on the ground, then the words on the page are useless.”
In response to Grace’s question and similar inquiries about the free speech policy in practice, administrators referenced a document they plan to release that will clarify the university’s free speech policy.
“By the end of the semester, we will produce a document that tries to really clarify and smooth out a lot of these issues. It will not solve all of them, but it is the best step forward to try to get clearer and more explicit,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said. “Before the last day of classes this semester, we will produce at least a version of that.”
The forum comes at a time when student representatives on the Speech and Expression Committee are seeking to update the university’s 24-year-old Speech and Expression policy.
“When you look at the policy, it says that all campus is supposed to be a free speech zone, but the kind of way the policy is implemented, it hasn’t always lived up to that expectation,” Tisa said. “We’re hoping to leave the forum with an idea of where we need to go next, not only for us, but for the administrators who are in there.”

Both intensive and non-intensive language courses produce students with similar language abilities, according to a recent internal case study conducted by the Georgetown University German Department.
“[A] thing that we did for our assessment procedure in the department is that the outcomes of those who study in the intensive track and those who study in the regular tracks are very comparable,” German department professor and Director of Curriculum Marianna Pankova said.
Although the intensive track, in which students attend an hour long class every day, moves at a faster pace than the non-intensive track, in which students attend 50-minute classes three times a week, the content and material covered in the class is the same for both the intensive and non-intensive tracks at their respective levels.
“We have a very coherent curriculum across levels, which means that the learning goals and the learning outcomes are formulated very clearly in terms of … language affairs, language aspects, in terms of content … and types of genres that our students are supposed to produce,” Pankova said.
According to Coordinator of the Intensive Track for the French Department Alissa Webel, one of the major advantages of the dual track system is that it allows students to pursue a language to the extent they want based on individual aims.
“I think it’s a very useful thing because it helps to cater to different styles of students and different goals for students,” Webel said.
As the language levels become more advanced, however, the material of the courses in the non-intensive tracks shift to focus more on oral proficiency and current events and civilization, whereas the intensive courses place more emphasis on the study of writing and literature.
This difference is made to accommodate the different types of students in each track. As many School of Foreign Service students gravitate toward the non-intensive track to satisfy their language requirements, the non-intensive courses aim to prepare them for their oral proficiency test.
For Georgetown’s Director of Spanish Language Instruction Professor Ronald Leow, who teaches non-intensive courses, the difference between the knowledge of students in non-intensive courses and intensive courses is mostly based on content, not on skill. Consequently, students in non-intensive classes will not necessarily fall behind students in the intensive courses due to the mere nature of the course.
“What I think is that the abilities are going to be the same … the subject matter that they discuss in class, the textbook that they use, that’s going to be different, but in terms of your specific ability, in terms of your opportunity to speak, they’re basically the same,” Leow said.
However, Spanish linguistics professor Cristina Sanz suggested that the additional two days of class that accompany intensive courses provides an advantage.
“They write more, they speak more, they have two more days of practice in the classroom, but also more homework,” Sanz said.
Professors also find that students in intensive tracks are more focused than those in non-intensive tracks.
“Usually what we hear from the instructors is that, very often what happens in the intensive track is that the students are more motivated, and that can be for different reasons,” Pankova said. Pankova highlighted that German majors are usually more motivated than those that are taking it for a requirement.
Since the non-intensive track meets less frequently, students find the courses to be much easier.
“I felt like [the intensive track] was so rigorous, and now taking the step down to regular, I guess you’d call it. … I do feel like I have a leg up,” Kenneth O’Brien (COL ’16) said. “I feel like intensive, I learned so much. I had never, I barely had any exposure to Spanish, and the level that I’m able to speak at now, it’s enormous to me,”
Since students can move freely between intensive and non-intensive courses, and most SFS students choose to take non-intensive courses to fit in with the SFS course load, it is impossible to determine whether students in intensive or non-intensive tracks pass the proficiency exam more often.
However, a general trend or difference in the grades between students taking intensive or non-intensive courses does not exist.
“I don’t believe there’s a difference in the quality of the grades, or the kind of grades you get per track,” Webel said.

Brendan Quinn (COL ’14) has adapted his senior thesis production of “A Mouthful of Birds,” written by Caryl Churchill, into a performance that will be brought to life and performed as part of the Davis Center of Performing Arts’ 2013-14 “Remember Me” season.
Although it is typical for a senior presenting a thesis in theatre and performance studies to see his thesis brought to life in production form, Quinn’s thesis is unique in that it will be the only thesis performed as part this year’s Davis Center’s performance season.
“I always wanted my thesis to be a co-production with Nomadic Theatre after directing with them sophomore year,” Quinn said, referring to the troupe co-producing the show with the Theater and Performance Studies Program. Last year, Nomadic Theatre co-produced “Polk Street” with the Mask & Bauble Dramatic Society; adaptor and director T. Chase Meacham (COL ’14) is currently fine-tuning the work to submit as this year’s other senior thesis.
The play explores the volatile nature of human pathology in everyday life through the telling of seven vignettes. Loosely based on the Greek tragedy “The Bacchae” by Euripides, the production involves a visceral embodiment of a variety of psychoses, from possession to madness, through highly physical movement.
“As [the actors] delved into reading the play, a lot of it is hard to picture because so much of it is dance and movement, so we had a lot of conversation about psychological disorders and gender and there was a lot of table work that went into the show,” producer Sarah Konig (COL ’16) said.
Department of Performing Arts Chair Maya Roth, who serves as Quinn’s thesis advisor, attributed the collaboration to the strength of Quinn’s thesis proposal, which was submitted in the winter of his junior year.
“[The department] has a formal process for thesis proposal … for high standing juniors who are majoring in theatre and performance studies, and the faculty committee who vets the thesis looks for original research and an individual voice,” Roth said. “The committee wants to have a conversation with the [other major] field of study to understand the context of the proposal and see if the student has a culminating project that fits in with the trajectory of their academic studies.”
Quinn’s inspiration for the production traces back to his freshman year at Georgetown.
“I always knew that I wanted to [major in] theatre and something, but I actually came into Georgetown as a classics major,” Quinn said. “I took a course in Greek tragedy my freshman fall that I call now one of the most important academic classes that I have taken at Georgetown because it set me up in terms of exposure to the classics as a basis of western theatre.”
Quinn’s academic studies proved vital to the construction of the production and the cast’s understanding of the production.
“Brendan began as a classics major … so he was able to relate [the show] back to Grecian themes and present a really complete picture of the show. … The cast spent the first two weeks reading ‘The Bacchae,’ which gave us a place to start our own exploration,” cast member Conor Ross (COL ’16) said.
Although “A Mouthful of Birds” was not Quinn’s initial choice for production, he found a true balance of drama and psychological exploration in Churchill’s work during a reexamination of his thesis.
“The play is entirely based on psychology, but what I love about this play is that it doesn’t put labels on different psychoses or corner people into pathologic illness in a certain way,” Quinn said.
Quinn collaborated with Georgetown University Dance Company Production Director Nora Rosengarten (COL ’14) to choreograph movement sequences for the play.
“It has been a gift to have Nora on this project because the movement has truly come from both of us,” Quinn said.
Quinn echoed that it is the combination of academics along with performance that allows for the most poignant comment on the human condition.
“The psychological struggle is in the dramatization, which anthropomorphizes mental illness in a way that allows the audience to viscerally react to things that might otherwise be internal,” Quinn said.
“A Mouthful of Birds” opened Thursday at the Davis Center of Performing Arts’ Devine Studio Theatre and will run for a total of eight performances, closing Jan. 25.

Students and professors met the first Jesuit pope, Francis I, during the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs conference “Christianity and Freedom: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives” in Rome this past December.
The conference, which ran from Dec. 13 to Dec. 14 at Pontifical Urbaniana University, was organized by the Berkley Center’s Religious Freedom Project and supported by Baylor University, the Witherspoon Institute, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation and the program on Religion and Innovation in Human Affairs. The Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty contributed organizational and planning support.
The conference, a culmination of the two-year study on Christian contributions to freedom throughout history and in modern Christian minorities, included presentations by research fellows on their findings, such as Rebecca Shah’s work on the transformative effect of Christianity on underprivileged Indian women.
The RFP’s goals included increasing awareness of worldwide religious persecution against Christians and illustrating the societal destabilization caused by this persecution. “Our most basic goal was to highlight the contributions of Christians to their own societies, including contributions to the concept and practice of religious freedom for all,” RFP Director Tom Farr said. “When you repress or exile minority groups, such as Christians and others, who have contributed so much to your own societies, you are not only harming them — you are harming yourselves.”
On the last morning of the conference, the speakers and staff, including Farr, Associate Director Timothy Shah and students Kevin Sullivan (SFS ’14) and Nick Fedyk (SFS ’14), took part in a private meeting with Pope Francis.
The encounter occurred in the Clement VIII room in the Apostolic Palace.
“Walking into the papal apartments and then meeting the Holy Father is a beautiful combination. The grandeur, history and tradition of the building demonstrate the glory of the Church, while the humility and personability of the Holy Father provide the much-needed human element,” Sullivan wrote in an email.
Pope Francis posed for a photograph with Farr and Shah, holding Sullivan’s Georgetown scarf. “His gesture and good humor with the Georgetown scarf I provided for the picture (I wanted to give it as a gift but he refused!) connected our history and mission of the university — building the Kingdom of God by molding men and women for others — to that of the representative of the Church,” Sullivan wrote. “It truly became an instant moment in Georgetown history.” At the end of the meeting, Pope Francis received a Spanish copy of Tim Shah’s book “Religious Freedom: Why Now?” from Farr. The Pope left with a request for the group: “Pray for me!”
Those in attendance carefully noted the words of Pope Francis upon their meeting.
“Although he does not know English very well, he carefully chose his words when he asked us: ‘Pray for me.’ There was the Holy Father, a man so full of prayer and blessings and baby-kissing, and yet he was asking us to pray for him,” Fedyk said.

O’Donovan Hall has redoubled its efforts to make its eating options more gluten-free friendly. Although it has expanded its food storage areas and added more meal options, students have yet to see any concrete changes take hold.
Dietitian Allison Marco has facilitated a focus group for concerned students to request accommodations for celiac disease, gluten allergies, gluten intolerance and personal choice.
“We discussed several ideas regarding gluten-free options in Leo’s, including what the students liked and what they wanted to see more of,” Marco said. “Students had a range of suggestions based on personal preference and group ideas. … We also discussed what they want to see continue in Leo’s, such as gluten-free soup options and some of their favorite items in the gluten-free fridge.”
In response, the Leo’s staff has added a larger fridge in the gluten-free section — it is protected by an access code — a sweet potato bar and a toaster oven. Possible plans include offering gluten-free items in Grab ‘n’ Go, a panini press, pasta options and two cereals. Students welcome these changes since many have experienced sickness from contaminated food in Leo’s before.
“I think the only times I’ve really gotten sick from Leo’s — [although] they’re okay at labelling what actually has gluten in it — is the issue with cross-contamination, and I always get sick when I have peanut butter or stuff like that,” Maribeth Teresczuk (COL ’16) said.
Although students are excited for these reforms, some feel that they are addressing a long-standing problem.
“I think it’s definitely needed, but I think it’s a good thing that they’re doing it because so many people that eat there have celiac like I do,” Joe Lanzilla (SFS ’16) said.
The changes were scheduled to be completed at the beginning of the semester, but Teresczuk said she has not noticed many changes so far.
“We have a gluten-free section, and the fridge last semester was very poorly stocked. It was basically empty all semester,” she said. “So far this semester, it’s been filled with bread at least every day, and it’s nice that you can at least make a sandwich. As for the other things, I haven’t really noticed any other changes.”
Contamination remains a fear despite new accommodations like a corn taco option at the burrito station, a locked bin for dry goods and two gluten-free cereal options that are in the process of implementation.
“I think it is important that they not only make these changes, but make their workers knowledgeable about the changes and knowledgeable about what gluten-free actually means and to take it seriously,” Lanzilla said. “If you ask for gluten-free, they have to make sure because if they make a mistake with that, it could really be bad.”
Many contamination problems arise from the lack of gluten-free only cooking materials.
Marco teaches Leo’s chefs how to handle gluten allergies with yearly presentations and training sessions geared at preventing contamination.
“Employees are aware of food allergies in the dining hall and take them very seriously,” Marco said. “They also know that they can come to me with any questions regarding this topic.”
Despite continued confusion, gluten-free students appreciate the effort that Leo’s staffers make to accommodate them.
“In general, I think that it’s great that Leo’s is taking the steps to at least be responsive to what they hear from these focus groups and trying to take the necessary steps towards it,” Lanzilla said.

Director of Muslim Chaplaincy Imam Yahya Hendi and Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner discussed the difficulty of interpreting religious text and their societal role in an interfaith dialogue entitled “That’s What God Said: Torah and Quran,” held in McShain Lounge on Tuesday evening. Fr. Pat Rogers, S.J., served as the discussion’s moderator.
Hendi spoke about how ambiguity can lead to different interpretations of scripture.
“When people talk about the right to kill, people refer to scriptures, or why they have to refrain from killing, people refer to scripture. So what scriptures are we talking about, the same or different?” Hendi said.
He stated that the Quran has two types of verses, encompassing those that are clear and cannot have multiple understandings and those that are ambiguous. In regard to the latter, there is ample opportunity to debate and change interpretations.
“I mean verses that hold within their words or wordings or sentences or format, the possibility of different, multiple interpretations. The Quran acknowledges this fact, giving Muslims the right to debate on those verses and also giving Muslims the right to redefine those verses as time moves on,” Hendi said.
On the other hand, Muslim interpretation of the Quran is unambiguously limited by certain rules, or what Hendi calls the “Bill of Rights of the Quran.”
“Muslims develop what’s called guided general rules for what the Quran wants you to know about Islam, about God, about the human rights, social ethics, financial ethics. If you follow these general guiding principals, move on, interpret things as you wish, but we never violate those guiding principals,” Hendi said. “No one can come up with a rule that violates any of these rules.”
Gartner spoke of the important interpretive role of rabbis in deciphering Jewish faith.
“In a sentence, the source of authority for Jewish life is the Tanakh as read through the ancient and contemporary rabbis,” Gartner said, referring to the Five Books of Moses, accompanied by writings from later prophets. Like the Quran, interpretation of Jewish texts is similarly limited by Rabbinic interpretation.
However, she acknowledged the complex nature of authority in Judaism.
“We are looking back at the text, and we are looking at each other and we are looking inside, but where authority lies is somewhere in the mix. You can never leave out the rabbis,” Gartner said.
Gartner further emphasized the Jewish notion of understanding the text through the past and present. The rabbi mentioned a Jewish saying that says, “don’t call yourselves children, children inherit; call yourselves builders.” She explained that due to the lack of vowels in original text, the word for children and builders were both possible interpretations. “We inherit and we build. And there is a celebration of that building,” Gartner said.
Neither speaker explicitly addressed the relationship between textual interpretation and the sectarian rifts that exist within their respective faiths.
Devika Ranjan (SFS ’17), who is part of the Interfaith Student Association, enjoyed how the talk managed to highlight both similarities and differences between the faiths.
“There are always a lot of questions as to how Judaism, Christianity and Islam especially correlate and there is so much tension between them, so I think this talk showed really well how they can come together in that way and how they really are not so dissimilar while highlighting that there are some contradictions between them,” Ranjan said.
Rabbi Gartner also addressed the acknowledged differences.
“To me, what’s beautiful is what is different,” she said.

Four student participants in the Education and Social Justice Project presented  research on their efforts to promote social justice through education from their respective summer experiences all over the globe Tuesday at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs.
Currently in its fourth year, the ESJ Project, a creation of the Berkley Center and the Center for Social Justice, awarded research fellowships to Nick Dirago (COL ’14), Annie Dale (COL ’14), Sarah Baran (COL ’14) and Elisabeth Lembo (COL ’14).
“Often [other] programs are about arriving to developing countries as a student from the first world with something to teach or impart or bestow, which generally reproduces the same power dynamics that have marginalized so many communities in the first place,” Dirago said. “[ESJ] allows us to listen to the voices of communities that often go unheard.”
The project aims to help students build knowledge about the connections between the global challenges of poverty and education, by enabling students to travel abroad for three weeks to examine innovative Jesuit education initiatives. The ESJ Project is made possible through the support of Rodney Jacob (GSB ’86, LAW ’89) and other members of the Georgetown community. The research fellowships include travel, lodging, meals and a $1500 stipend.
Dirago, who visited Lima, Peru, was struck by the socioeconomic disparity and the challenge it poses to educators in Peru. By examining the broader mission of Jesuit education in the country through the lens of globalization and inequality in Lima, Dirago was impressed to discover Jesuit efforts to support all students, regardless of socioeconomic status. He presented his research on the ethos and pedagogy of the College of the Immaculate Conception, the Jesuits’ prestigious flagship institution, and of Fe y Alegria, an institution serving underprivileged students in Peru.
Dale discussed her examination of the efforts of the Apostolic Prefecture in Battambang, Cambodia, to reduce school dropout rates through innovative family support mechanisms.
Determining the factors behind the high dropout rates between primary and secondary school for young Cambodians, Dale’s interviews concluded that lack of parental support, financial and physical inaccessibility and forced child labor are the biggest factors.
“I feel like the best way to truly understand other people is to recognize their challenges and work together towards finding solutions,” Dale said. “This was my motivation in Cambodia. I really wanted to understand the Cambodians I was working with as well as the other international volunteers, and the best way to do that was to join their fight for educational equality.”
Baran travelled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to research Protagonizar, a small microfinance institute founded by Jesuits. She conducted interviews with its entrepreneurs and workers, focusing on how the institute infuses values of financial accountability into the community and promotes the economic and  personal development of the entrepreneurs.
“It was very overwhelming and inspiring to see the impact of this microfinance model on individual lives,” Baran said.
Lembo shared her research from her work at the Jesuit University of Krakow, Poland, where she explored the revival of Jesuit education with a particular interest in the lack of understanding of social justice in Poland, despite the country’s Roman Catholic majority.
As a future corps member for Teach for America, Lembo was drawn to the ESJ Project as an opportunity to compare international education initiatives with the more familiar domestic initiatives.
“It was really neat hearing [Jesuit] enthusiasm about the innovative work that is being done by Jesuits across Poland,” Lembo said.
Though each student had a reportedly positive experience, the fellows’ research was not without challenges. Most found it difficult navigating a new country completely on their own. Dale, for example, knew no Khmer, the spoken language in Cambodia, before arriving in the country.
“[I] had no one to guide me, and was responsible for organizing and executing 15 interviews with educators, many of whom did not speak any English,” Dale said. “This was not like a study abroad program through which everything was planned for me. I had to arrive in Cambodia, hit the ground running and get a job done independently in three weeks.”

University President John J. DeGioia joined more than 100 other leaders in higher education at a White House event focused on expanding college opportunities for low-income students Thursday.
The College Opportunity Summit, held by President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, brought together college presidents, as well as business and nonprofit leaders, to discuss how they could work toward the goal.
“The main reason for the initiative is to increase social mobility for America’s underprivileged youth,” National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling, who led a panel at the event, said in a media call the previous day.
The event is part of Obama’s “year of action,” a proposed series of executive actions designed to promote job creation and economic growth that is focused on cooperation between the public and private sector and implement new policy without formal legislation.
“Today is a great example of how, without a whole bunch of new legislation, we can advance this agenda,” Obama said. He also mentioned the possibility of using executive powers to authorize future governmental actions related to increasing college enrollment.
While Obama spoke about the newly resurgent national economy, he nevertheless warned that this growth represents just a fraction of the improvement necessary to fully conquer the nation’s struggle with inequality. Obama, a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, noted the importance of promoting equal opportunities for social advancement through higher education.
“We need to make sure that there are new ladders of opportunity in the middle class, and that the rungs on those ladders are solid and more accessible,” he said. “More than ever, a college degree is the surest path to a stable middle-class life.”
While educational progress has occurred under the current administration, Obama stressed the persistently low percentage of low-income students enrolling in higher education and receiving degrees.
“We still have a long way to go before we unlock the doors to higher education to more Americans, and especially lower-income Americans,” Obama said.
Michelle Obama also spoke at the event, describing her personal experiences applying to and attending Princeton University, and how this time shaped her current educational ambitions.
“I know from my own experience just how important all of that work is that we are doing,” she said. “I know that there are so many kids out there just like me, kids that had parents that never went to college, or maybe they were never encouraged to believe they could succeed there, and it’s our job to find those kids and get them enrolled in a college that can meet their needs.”
The first lady urged those present to continue their previous efforts to promote educational opportunity, especially in developing programs designed to assimilate students of diverse and troubled backgrounds to collegiate life. “You all have shown that you have the experience, the passion and the resources to help these young people thrive,” she said. “We need you to direct that same energy and determination toward helping these kids face their unique challenges.”
The universities represented at the event, including Georgetown, agreed to aid secondary schools with their college-preparation programs, boost remedial programs and work to level the playing field with regard to college admissions by helping low-income students with standardized testing.
“Everybody here is participating, I believe, because we know that college graduation has never been more valuable than it is today,” the president said.
Prior to the summit, DeGioia released a statement expressing support for Obama’s educational initiatives and the mission of the White House convention.
“We wish to thank the White House for convening this conversation,” DeGioia said in the statement. “One of the most important commitments we can make, as university leaders, is to ensure that the very best students have the opportunity to attend our institutions — and to provide them with the necessary resources to do their very best work and become their very best selves.”
Additionally, the press release highlighted Georgetown programs designed to support qualified high school students requiring financial assistance. These initiatives include the Georgetown Scholarship Program, the Community Scholars Program, the Preparing to Excel pre-orientation program and a partnership with the Posse Foundation designed to promote exploration of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.
Following the remarks at the summit, DeGioia expressed excitement for Obama’s educational goals and promised a future commitment to expanding educational opportunity for disadvantaged students.
“We were invited in early in the planning, and so we are strongly aligned with the goals of the president and ensuring their success, and we have a number of programs that we put in place over the course of a generation to try to ensure that,” DeGioia told The Hoya. “We’re very excited to be a part of it, and excited there is such a strong commitment to higher education from our White House to ensure focus on this in the future.”
DeGioia described the high level of interest in engaging low-income students that he sensed from the other academic representatives at the event.
“I think there’s a profound commitment that has been in place in higher education, and that what you see here is the depth of engagement that characterizes this form of higher education,” DeGioia said.

A campus-wide free speech forum held by the Georgetown University Student Association and the university administration on Thursday night attracted students passionate about the issue. The forum’s purpose was to promote discussion and debate of Georgetown’s policy on free speech and its practice on campus.
The forum, titled “Free Speech in the Digital Age: Are There Boundaries?” featured Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., history professor Marcia Chatelain, former Chair of The Hoya Board of Directors Lauren Weber (COL ’13) andGUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14). The panel was moderated by Vice President for Public Affairs and Senior Advisor to the President Erik Smulson in LohrfinkAuditorium.
Reform of free speech at Georgetown was a central component of Tisa’s campaign for the GUSAexecutive spot last year, and in October, he highlighted speech reform as a goal of the second half of his term. This forum, however, represents the first public push toward bringing free speech into wider campus conversation.
“We wanted to provide an opportunity for students to voice their concerns directly to administrators and we wanted to do it in a way that would promote change afterward, as opposed to just voicing concerns and letting it fizzle,” Tisa said.
Panelists were chosen based on their knowledge of and experience with the free speech policy, which says “expression that is indecent or is grossly obscene or grossly offensive on matters such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation is inappropriate in a university community and the University will act as it deems appropriate to educate students violating this principle.”
“I don’t think it’s up to me, or in some cases, the university, to determine what’s offensive. For me, my quibble with the speech policy is essentially that it’s hard to tell what’s offensive and what’s not,” Weber said during the panel.
During a question-and-answer session, H*yas for Choice Vice President Abigail Grace (SFS ’16) questioned the benefits of the free speech policy for clubs that are unrecognized by the university, such as H*yas for Choice.
“The free speech and expression policy is something that is very central to our ability to exist on campus. Unfortunately for us, we haven’t been able to operate in the way the free speech and expression policy outlines, specifically in regards to free speech zones,” Grace said. “You can sit here and say how we’re all a community and how we all want to have discourse, but if that’s not actually implemented on the ground, then the words on the page are useless.”
In response to Grace’s question and similar inquiries about the free speech policy in practice, administrators referenced a document they plan to release that will clarify the university’s free speech policy.
“By the end of the semester, we will produce a document that tries to really clarify and smooth out a lot of these issues. It will not solve all of them, but it is the best step forward to try to get clearer and more explicit,” Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said. “Before the last day of classes this semester, we will produce at least a version of that.”
The forum comes at a time when student representatives on the Speech and Expression Committee are seeking to update the university’s 24-year-old Speech and Expression policy.
“When you look at the policy, it says that all campus is supposed to be a free speech zone, but the kind of way the policy is implemented, it hasn’t always lived up to that expectation,” Tisa said. “We’re hoping to leave the forum with an idea of where we need to go next, not only for us, but for the administrators who are in there.”

GUSA Election Commissioner Ethan Chess (COL ’14) filed a petition with the GUSA Constitutional Council on Thursday night requesting the invalidation of Sunday’s election for GUSA speaker, which propelled Senator EmilySiegler (SFS ’14) to the position after Vice Speaker Sam Greco (SFS ’15) failed to win a majority in a confirmation vote to assume to role.
The petition, which also requests an injunction against senate procedures until the speaker issue is resolved, claims that Greco automatically assumed the speakership when former Speaker George Spyropoulos (COL ’14) resigned Dec. 8, and that the confirmation vote that Greco lost 13-9 on Sunday was not in line with GUSA procedure. If the confirmation vote is deemed unnecessary by the Constitutional Council, the subsequent election for speaker, which Siegler won with 10 votes to Greco’s three, will be invalidated.
Chess submitted his petition by email to the three members of the Constitutional Council, which has not seen a case since 2010. Chess said he did not consult any other members of GUSA in drafting the petition and does not have political motivations behind its filing, which is not part of his official capacity in the Election Commission.
“My concern is more for the process than the political,” Chess said. “I’m apolitical; I have no horse in any race, anywhere, ever. My horse in the race is process, which was very clearly violated.”
“My aim in filing this petition is not to directly protect Sam Greco, it’s to protect the institution,” Chess said. “It’s not for me about Sam Greco. It’s more about protecting the institution.”
In his petition, Chess stresses the significance of this decision to upcoming GUSA elections.
“The petitioner believes that it is fundamentally important for the procedural and electoral health ofGUSA that the results of an illegitimate election be held from entering into force,” the petition reads. “Without this injunction, the procedural and institutional legitimacy of GUSA enter a precarious state. With important electoral and fiduciary decisions for the Association on the near-term horizon, it is essential that this process be carried through in an orderly and civil manner.”
Though Greco was not involved in drafting this petition, he agreed with Chess that the election’s circumstances were suspect.
“I think that there are definitely constitutional questions that deserve a second look,” Greco said.
Siegler commented briefly on Chess’ decision to file the petition.
“I believe that we all have the agency as individuals to act as such, and Ethan is using his agency as an individual, so if he so feels that that’s the right avenue then he has the right to do that,” she said.
The three-member Constitutional Council plans to meet tomorrow and to issue a press release after their meeting. At least one member of the council must vote to accept Chess’ petition before it is considered, and two members must agree on a final decision if the petition is accepted.
“We have received Ethan Chess’ petition,” GUSA Justice Josh Shinbrot (COL ’16) said. “We have not yet voted on whether we will accept the petition.”
The decision whether to approve the requested writ of mandamus that would invalidate Siegler’selection as speaker and put Greco in the role is separate from the decision whether to issue an injunction to suspend senate operations until a decision on the speakership is made. The council could decide on any combination of the above two decisions.
GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Vice President Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) appeared unaware of the events Thursday night, with neither acquainted with the details of the petition or its filing.
“The senate is, for all intents and purposes, its own body,” Ramadan said. “I will be there if it needs me to be there, but I’m not concerned going forward.”
