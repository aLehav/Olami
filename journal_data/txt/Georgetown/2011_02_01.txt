The turmoil in Egypt may have hit home for the 15 Georgetown students evacuated from their Cairo study abroad program on Monday, but for others spending time in the Middle East, the threat of wholesale geopolitical change has also dominated daily life.
“In every cab the radio is tuned to a news program that is talking about Egypt; every night and every morning I watch hours of Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya with my host family,” said Sam Solomon (SFS ’12), who is studying abroad in Amman, Jordan this term.
Jordan has also seen demonstrations in recent days, but experts as well as students in the region do not believe that they will become volatile. The country’s protests have remained peaceful, and King Abdullah II met demonstrators’ demands and replaced the country’s prime minister Tuesday.
“The protests in Jordan are getting a disproportionate coverage because of the events in Egypt; larger protests occurred in 2004 and 2009 but those did not make a very big splash in the news,” Solomon said in an email. “Furthermore, the protests in Jordan — as I understand them — have been peaceful and have not been calling for a revolution.”
According to Solomon, that is not to say that there is no potential for more unrest.
“But who knows what could happen? No one expected the events in Tunisia or Egypt,” Solomon said. He added, however, that he does not expect the riots to become violent.
The student’s assessment matched that of Georgetown university, which sent an email to students alerting them of the situation and urging them to stay away from the protests.
“The situation in Egypt is unprecedented and worrying from the perspective of student safety and continuity of instruction for students seeking to study there this spring,” CIEE Amman Resident Director Allison Hodgkins wrote in an email. “Jordan is not Egypt and I have no reason to predict that a full scale pursing or revolution is imminent here.”
The crisis in Egypt is primarily affecting students’ political dialogue, permeating everything from radio waves to conversations on the streets.
“The biggest effect that I have seen is that Egypt is constantly on the news, 24/7 coverage. Everyone is talking about it, and from what I can tell (with my limited understanding of Arabic), people in Jordan are supportive of the Egypt protesters,” Rebecca Kissel (SFS ’12), who is also in Amman, said in an email.
Jordan is not the only place affected, however. Following the successful revolution in Tunisia in mid-January, protests have also broken out in other Middle Eastern countries such as Yemen, Lebanon and Algeria.
“There are a lot of discussion … about the possibility of a ‘domino effect’. There is little doubt that Tunisia inspired the on-going protest and social uprising currently going on in Egypt as we speak,” Wadhah Al Shugaa (SFS ’12), who is currently studying at the School of Foreign Service in Qatar, said in an email. “If the ‘people’s revolution’ in Egypt succeed, there is little doubt that that will inspire civil societies and grassroots activists across the Arab world to plan similar protests.”
For students at the SFS campus in Qatar — where the Georgetown students from Egypt landed on Monday — there is no fear of the protests spreading to Doha itself, but the impact has been felt.
“In Qatar, the situation in Egypt seems so close. I was in Cairo only three weeks ago and would never have imagined the scenes I am seeing on the news now. Not only do the events seem physically closer from our vantage point in Doha, but many students at SFS-Q are from Egypt,” Elisabeth Kent (SFS-Q ’11) said. “When I hear about something like looting in the streets of Cairo, it’s not just a news story. It’s something that the families of my close friends are facing and living through.”
The proximity has shaped students’ impressions of the unfolding situation, according to Solomon.
“It’s certainly affected my study abroad experience. It’s one thing to witness big events in the Middle East from Washington, D.C.; it’s quite another to witness them from an Arab country,” Solomon said.
SFS-Q Student Affairs Officer Patrick Lenihan (COL ’10) said the changes in the region have led to ramped-up political conversation on campus.
“SFS-Q has a natural affection for Middle Eastern politics, so between Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, the Sudan and Jordan, the professors are on the academic equivalent of a sugar high and the students more than a pixie stick behind,” Lenihan said, adding that the developments have led to a “very educational beginning of semester.”
Kent said that no matter if the Egyptian riots calm down or spur an overthrow of Mubarak, the future of the region hangs in the balance.
“There is no talk that these events would spread to Qatar. However, there is a general sense of instability and suspense about where the region is headed. I think all Arabs, including Qataris, are watching closely as these events unfold because they recognize that the Middle East of tomorrow may not be the Middle East that they have previously known.”

An amendment to D.C. Official Code went into effect Tuesday, placing harsher restrictions on disruptive noise and marking a major shift in the Metropolitan Police Department’s capacity to crack down on gatherings such as student parties.
The Disorderly Conduct Amendment Act of 2010 states that making unreasonably loud, disruptive noise between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. is now an offense punishable by 90 days in prison, a $500 fine, or both. The maximum fine has doubled from $250.
MPD will now arrest individuals in violation of the noise ordinance, the university’s director of media relations, Rachel Pugh, said on Tuesday. Since 2000, MPD had issued offenders 61D citations, which counted as arrests but did not result in detention.
MPD will enforce the law at all D.C. houses, regardless of whether they are university owned or privately leased off campus.
The university was informed of the changes by MPD over the weekend, university spokeswoman Julie Bataille said on Monday, and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson soon began preparing an email to students to update them on the greater severity of this disorderly conduct statute.
“We understand from our local MPD district commander that officers may make an arrest when, in the officer’s judgment, the officer has observed ‘noise that is likely to create a disturbance of the peace,” Olson said in the email, which was sent out on Wednesday evening.
Olson urged students to stay aware of the strict changes that lie ahead.
“Given that the law and MPD’s plans for enforcing it could have serious implications for you, we wanted to be sure you were alerted to it and to take this opportunity to remind you about the importance of thoughtful, respectful behavior in residential areas off campus at night.”
Moving forward, the university plans on working more with MPD and students to cut back on noise disruptions, disorderly conduct, and possible student arrests.
“[We] will continue our many proactive steps to work with students and MPD to address issues before they become a major concern,” Bataille said.

The semester may have just gotten into full swing, but for students planning on studying on campus during the summer, it’s pre-registration time again already.
Pre-registration kicked off today at 9 a.m. and will remain open until three days into each of the four sessions, according to the Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.
For the summer sessions, SCS offers over 250 courses in 35 different subject matters. Classes for undergraduates cost $1,074 per credit, with a variety of fees for fine arts, science and language classes for the use of various labs.
Caitlin Huntley, assistant dean of SCS, explained that coordinators hope to meet student demands by chronicling highly popular classes from the academic year in order to offer them again in the summer months.
“Georgetown Summer School runs mostly courses that also run in the fall and spring,” she said. “The popular courses are usually the introductory level courses or those that are required for majors. We review fall and spring enrollments carefully to determine which classes are most popular and close out or have high wait lists.”
The classes begin with pre-session on May 23. Sessions I and II are each about a month long, and an eight-week course called the cross-session — which runs from June 6 to August 29 — is also available.
This summer, the university plans to introduce two community-based learning classes into its catalogue by offering Introduction to Justice and Peace (JUPS-123) and Social Deviance (SOCI-030). The CBLs, as the classes are often called, pair classroom work with outside service so that students can wrestle with social justice issues in the metropolitan area.
“These classes will allow students to enjoy experiential learning while providing valuable community service and earning an extra credit towards their degrees,” Huntley said. “It is a great opportunity for students who are often too busy or overloaded during the fall and spring to take advantage of these classes.”
Though the majority of summer students are affiliated with the university, the SCS is also expecting hundreds of applications from students outside the university. International and even high school students, as long as they have maintained a B average and completed freshman year, can apply.
For the most part, professors for summer classes also hail from the university, although Georgetown does offer some visiting professors a chance to teach on the Hilltop.
“Occasionally, we have summer-only professors teaching,” Huntley said. “Some of these are visiting professors from other universities who like to spend their summers in D.C. Others are retired professors who simply want to teach over the summer.”
Classes can fill up quickly, Huntley warned, so she encouraged students to register early. All classes are assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis. Add/drop runs through the first three days of each session.
Students can take no more than four courses over the summer term and must have a minimum GPA of 2.0 — a C average — to qualify for enrollment. Students are limited to one class during the pre-session and to two for the first or second sessions.
For students with hefty major requirements, summer classes can create a more relaxed environment in which to finish their most stressful classes. Greg Ouellette (COL ’13) is considering tackling some of his required classes over the summer in order to complete his pre-med track on time.
“I’m trying to get pre-med requirements in before I graduate,” he said, adding that he hoped to avoid taking more than one pre-med requirement class each semester.
“I’m also trying to study abroad,” he said.
Athletes are also common participants. “It would be very hard to have a full schedule during season time,” said Jason Clark (COL ’12), a guard for the men’s basketball team. “Considering all the traveling athletes do in season, it would be almost impossible to keep up with work for more than four classes.”
Other students take summer classes for the different atmosphere that shorter class sessions and fewer students provide.
“Classes during the summer, I would say, are a lot more intimate and relaxed then the ones during the school year. My Chinese class for instance had only two to three students and we got to know the professors really well,” Carlos Cheung (MSB ’13) said.
He added that the increased attention from faculty members during these sessions almost equates to a having a personal, expert tutor.
“I think since professors are not teaching a lot of classes and [are] more relaxed in general — since it is summer,” Cheung said. “They tend to be more lenient with work and full of energy while teaching.”

As Georgetown’s self-imposed deadline draws closer, University Information Services workers are beginning to install wireless Internet service in the rest of the university’s residential facilities.
Associate Director of UIS Donna White DeLay confirmed that workers are currently cabling residence halls for wireless Internet, which University President John J. DeGioia said in a Sept. 1 interview would be fully implemented by springtime. DeLay has confirmed the university is still on track to meet this goal.
Delay wrote in an email that work on the installation in residence halls is scheduled to take place between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on the weekdays to avoid disrupting students at inconvenient times. UIS will notify students in each hall two weeks before their wireless service will be activated.
Though the university is forging ahead with planned installations, some students said that it has come too late.
“My public high school has wireless Internet, and I wasn’t paying $56,000 to attend. They won’t even let us set up our own hubs in the name of setting up their own plans, but their plan isn’t coming fast enough,” Evan Monod (COL ’14) said.
Others worry that the current lack of access to wireless Internet may reflect poorly on Georgetown’s reputation.
“It’s an embarrassment for such a good school,” Thomas Brooke (NHS ’14) said.
According to the UIS website, AirHoya – UIS’s name for the wireless network – currently provides full or partial wireless coverage to all academic buildings on the main and east campus except except Maguire Hall, the Edmund A. Walsh Building and the Rafik B. Hariri Building. Residential buildings without at least partial wireless coverage include Henle Village, LXR Hall, Nevils Building and Village A.
Since many of the academic buildings that do boast wireless Internet access guarantee it throughout the entire building, UIS’s remaining work remains largely concentrated on the residential buildings, where Ethernet cords are still widely used by students looking to surf the internet from their rooms.
As for a final schedule, Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh could not give a definite timeline.
“The schedule for finalizing when wireless will be available is dependent on the completion of the required installation of additional power,” she said.

In an effort to improve Department of Public Safety transparency, the GUSA Senate passed a resolution Sunday that aims to create a guide to DPS policy that would give students access to various public safety protocols.
Some of the proposals on the table include guidelines regarding entry to and searches of student residences, refusal of identification and conditions of arrest. The procedures would not only be written down, but also publicly available; with this measure the Georgetown University Student Association intends to clear up the facts about DPS’s jurisdiction.
The bill, proposed by Michael Barclay (COL ’12), GUSA senator, calls for DPS to institute a “transparent and accountable method” so that students can report violations of DPS protocol.
“This bill originated from the many calls from students unsure of their rights and confused about DPS’s jurisdiction on campus,” Barclay said. “A codified list of DPS policies would allow students to educate themselves about their rights and make for a [better]-informed student body as a whole.”
DPS is willing to engage GUSA in a conversation about the new bill, according to DPS’s Associate Director Joseph Smith.
“I have not yet seen the language of the bill just passed, but I have been in communication with Senator Barclay and will continue to work with him,” Smith said.
GUSA is currently working on updating a “Know Your Rights Pamphlet” to inform the student body on their rights and responsibilities as students in the District, according to GUSA Senator Josh Mogil (SFS ’11), which will complement the bill.
“When procedures and rights are not codified in an organized fashion, there is the potential for abuse. GUSA encourages DPS and other campus organizations to codify their policies to ensure that student rights are safeguarded,” Mogil added.
Smith stressed how much DPS values administrative protocol and legal jurisdictions.
“DPS greatly respects rule of law and due process, whether that is within the context of federal law, local statutes or university rules and regulations,” Smith said.
Student reaction around campus appeared to be in favor of the bill, but many remain curious about what the legislation actually entails.
“Yes and no,” Juman Khweis (SFS ’13) answered when asked if she supported the proposal. “I feel like with something like that it would depend on who is actually is going to read it. But it’s good for people to be aware of their rights. I don’t see any harm in that.”
Safety was not the only item on the agenda at Sunday’s meeting, however. GUSA also passed a second bill, called the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which caps GUSA’s annual budget at 15 percent of the total amount of funding allocated to campus organizations at the spring’s Budget Summit. During last spring’s Budget Summit, GUSA was allotted 7.8 percent of the total Student Activities Fee budget.
GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee member Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) said that the bill is meant to showcase GUSA’s financial restraint. The measure comes at the heels of last semester’s student body referendum, which approved a gradual hike in the Student Activities Fee over two years.
“By approving SAFE Reform, the student body has given GUSA a great deal more responsibility,” Malkerson said. “It is important to demonstrate that with this increase of money, we will not spend it all on ourselves. Putting a cap on our own budget affirms our promise that SAFE Reform was about getting more money to student life rather than just GUSA.”
The bill also stipulates that the senate can only use Student Activities Fee money for official business that directly affects GUSA’s public initiatives. The money cannot be used to fund private GUSA dinners, food at meetings or other comfort expenses, according to Malkerson.
“[This part of the] bill reaffirms what is already in our bylaws about not spending money unless it has an effect on students. The intent of GUSA is to serve students, and I believe that this bill is a step in ensuring that,” said Fin/App Chair Greg Laverriere (COL ’12).
GUSA’s budget has been steadily rising, from $18,950 in the 2008-2009 academic year to $20,000 last year. The allocated budget this year is $28,000.

When John Garvey was inaugurated as president of Catholic University last Tuesday, the school rejoined the ranks of a growing number of Catholic colleges and universities — including Georgetown — whose current presidents are not members of the clergy.
Garvey is Catholic’s third lay president, and the first since 1982. The new president, who has been performing the duties of the office since July, is seen by many as a liberal figure due to his political centrism. He sanctioned the university’s invitation to a congressman who had supported abortion rights to speak at the university’s law school commencement in 2007, drawing criticism for multiple religious hardliners. Additionally, he used profanities in a recent classroom lecture on controversial speech, according to The Washington Post.
In his inaugural address, Garvey discussed the role that Catholicism should play in a modern university. He reflected on the tension between reason and religious beliefs but also emphasized the ways in which religion can enhance education.
“The intellectual life of a Catholic university is something that is unique among institutions of higher education,” Garvey said in the address. “The Catholic University of America is a university, a community of scholars united in a common effort to find goodness, truth and beauty. … The intellectual culture we create is the product of our collective effort.”
Garvey’s words echoed those spoken by University President John J. DeGioia when he was inaugurated 10 years ago as the first lay president of the school.
“As a Catholic and Jesuit university, we heed the Church’s call to powerfully engage the world, human culture, the environment, all ways of knowing. This creates a second set of questions and dynamic tensions … the relationship between faith and reason, nature and grace, reason and revelation, natural and the supernatural,” DeGioia said during his inaugural speech. “But I believe at the deepest level of reality of our tradition is a spirituality with a deep resonance with the mission of a university.”
According to Fr. Alexei Michalenko, a chaplain at the Georgetown Law Center who graduated from Catholic University with a master’s in theology in 1969, appointing a lay president to run a Catholic university raises questions among students and faculty about the role that religion will play in university life, themes present in both Garvey and DeGioia’s addresses.
“Some people will see it as some sort of loss … but there is nothing un-Catholic about having a lay president,” Michalenko said. “Instead, I think that a layman who can combine faith with education and science is a very powerful symbol.”
Director of Campus Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., agreed that lay administrators positively contribute to Catholic schools.
“It is a sign of vitality for a Catholic university to appoint a qualified lay president,” O’Brien said. “It shows that the gifts of the church are shared.”
Other Catholic universities that have recently named lay presidents include Seton Hall in New Jersey, Loyola Marymount University and the University of Detroit Mercy. The latter two schools welcomed their first non-clergy leaders at the end of 2010, while Seton Hall hired its first lay president in over two decades on Jan. 11.
Catholic University’s first lay president, Clarence Walton, began his term in 1969, more than three decades before DeGioia took the presidency at Georgetown, according to the university’s website.

A year after its implementation, the five cent tax on paper and plastic bags in Washington, D.C. has significantly reduced plastic bag use, according to The Washington Post. Consumer reviews of the law, however, remain mixed.
Enacted on Jan. 1, 2010, the Anacostia River Clean Up and Protection Act directly contributed to an 80 percent decrease in plastic bags contaminating the Anacostia river and its tributaries. The Washington Post reported that 55 million plastic bags were used in 2010, a sharp decrease from the roughly 270 million bags used in the year prior to the law’s passing. Additionally, the legislation accrued two million dollars in tax revenue, which will be utilized for further conservation efforts.
Not all consumers approve of the tax, which applies to businesses selling food and alcohol, however. Chris Olarte, an employee at Wisemiller’s Deli, observed that the decline in plastic bag use went hand in hand with customers’ complaints.
“A lot of people do not like [the law] very much,” Olarte said.
The effects of the tax can also be seen on campus, where the university’s Grab-n-Go stations now offer reusable bags as an alternative to plastic.
Nicholas Fedyk (SFS ’14) utilizes the Go Green bags on a daily basis because he feels it is important to be environmentally conscious.
“It’s only five cents, but it brings awareness to the [environmental] issues,” he said
Of the five cents charged for each bag, businesses keep one cent, or two if they offer rebates for consumers who bring their own bags. The remaining revenue goes to a government fund that supports cleaning and conservation of the Anacostia River as well as a reusable bag program administered by the District Department of the Environment, according to the Green D.C. website.
The government has set itself a lofty goal — making the Anacostia watershed entirely trash-free by 2013, according to the Anacostia watershed trash reduction plan
Inspired by a December 2008 study conducted by the Anacostia Watershed Society, which found that disposable plastic bags were one of the largest sources of litter in the river, the bag law is the first of its kind in the United States, according to the website. Nearby states have recently started to follow the District’s lead. The Virginia state house will consider legislation that calls for a five cent tax on plastic bags and Maryland lawmakers are discussing implementing similar environmental laws, according to The Washington Post.

Law school-bound Georgetown undergraduates who dread the thought of taking another standardized test may be able to put their fears to rest.
According to The Daily Pennsylvanian, the American Bar Association is currently looking at a proposal to make the oft-dreaded Law School Admission Test optional. If passed, this proposal would alter the system of law school admissions that has been in place since the first administration of the LSAT in 1948.
Many students, however, feel that while the LSAT may have its flaws, there is currently no better option to replace the role of the test in comparing the qualifications of students from different schools and backgrounds.
Avni Mehta (SFS ’11), who took the LSAT in October 2010, said that the test is the closest measure to unbiased assessment for law school candidates.
“While I agree that the LSAT often discriminates against some students and that it may not be a fair assessment of a person’s worth or talent, it is certainly the only measure we currently have to gage a student’s ability to succeed in law school,” Mehta said in an email. “Until a new, unbiased form of testing can be put into place, there is currently no better way to gauge a student’s ability to perform in such a demanding profession.”
Mehta said that she does not feel that the test is an easy one by any means; however, she does believe it is possible to prepare for it and to increase one’s chances of a high score.
“It is meant to be a test of one’s skill set and ability to think logically,” Mehta said in an email. “That being said, there are ways to improve your chances of doing well, i.e., taking a course … [however] the cost of a course is not in everybody’s budget, which tends to skew results in favor of those who can afford a course, who have time to study for two to three months and/or who simply have raw talent.”
Mehta also expressed concern that students who are not good test-takers may underperform on the LSAT despite solid logical skills.
Evan Monod (COL ’14), who is considering a career as an attorney, believes that the cost of the test itself, test preparation and the long hours of studying serve as a deterrent to students who might otherwise enter the legal profession.
“I would definitely support making it optional because I think it would increase the number of kids able to go to a good law school and participate in a profession that we desperately need bright people in,” Monod said.
The LSAT is intended to help law schools evaluate their applicants on a nationally standardized scale, according to the website of the Law School Admission Council, the group responsible for the administration of the LSAT.
According to an article in The National Law Journal, a number of the members on the committee reviewing the LSAT believe the current provision requiring law school applicants to take an admission test should be dropped. Despite the potential change, many law schools may still require their applicants to submit LSAT scores even if the Bar Association does not require it, just as some undergraduate universities are test-optional while others are not.

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a bill on Jan. 20 that would prohibit the use of federal tax money for funding abortions in the District of Columbia. Since the federal government has oversight over the D.C. government and budget, the bill would also prohibit D.C. tax dollars from being used for the same purpose.
Passage of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act would represent a reinstatement of a similar ban repealed in 2009.
Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) is spearheading the effort with the support of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus and 161 co-sponsors.
“President Obama has said he wants abortion to be rare,” Smith said in a Jan. 20 press conference. “To Mr. Obama I say, ‘here is a bill for you’… Studies show that when abortion is not publically funded, abortions in the covered population are reduced by roughly 25 percent.”
Many Democrats, however, feel the specific provisions in the bill that target D.C. are really just partisan politics at work.
“The new Republican majority has spent its first three weeks preaching about the need to reduce the federal government’s power,” Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said in a press release. “Yet the third bill they introduced this Congress prohibits a local jurisdiction from spending its own funds.”
This is not the first time that representatives of the District have felt its political autonomy compromised regarding abortion as well as other areas. Special restrictions prohibited funding for medical marijuana, needle exchange programs and abortions in D.C. until the Democratic majority in Congress repealed them in 2009. It would be legally impossible to impose similar provisions on a state government.
Some D.C. groups see this bill more as an issue of District autonomy than one of abortion policy.
“[The Republicans in Congress] act as if the District doesn’t exist — as if it’s an agency of the federal government,” said Ilir Zherka, executive director for D.C. Vote, an organization that works to secure full representation for D.C. residents. “We are worried about the bigger ramifications of what it says about the intentions of the House leadership.”
Zherka anticipates that the bill will not be the last attempt by the Republicans to roll back the city’s authority.
The bill does not apply to cases of forcible rape, incest involving a minor or situations in which pregnancy puts the mother’s life in danger.

Facebook has recently become more than the perfect excuse for creeping on friends: Now companies can creep on you.
The website has begun to blend its traditional advertising techniques with the information streaming across the newsfeed, encouraging users to “like” pages chosen by their friends.
Having recently harnessed the popular power of product-based pages to increase revenue, Facebook Marketing Solutions allows businesses to sponsor these pages, which will now appear as links on the user’s sidebar as sponsored advertisements. These short blurbs allow Facebook users to view pages selected by their friends and possibly to like them as well.
The new strategy is a departure from the advertisements individually tailored to interests listed on one’s personal page. The prominence of ads now relies on companies’ willingness to dish out money to the social network.
Facebook’s newest addition, the combination of paid sponsorship and the organic ability to affirm one’s support for a company by making a simple click, mimics word-of-mouth advertising. The experience is analogous to a friend’s personal recommendation of the product, enabling better name recognition and retention.
“It’s the whole basis of social commerce,” Anthony Hurtado (MSB ’12) said. “People trust their friends more than some random advertisement.”
Other students see the advertisements as an extravagance to the website.
“Just because someone clicks ‘like’ on something doesn’t mean that I would ‘like’ it,” Alanna McAuley (COL ’13) said. “It’s not the same as a friend actually recommending something.”
The new sidebar advertisements are also visible longer than they would be in the traditional newsfeed. The duration of advertisement is determined by the amount of money paid by the company.
Facebook users have the opportunity to create their own advertisements featuring some of their events or interests. The website provides easy instructions on the creation process, and spots are available for a minimum of one dollar a day.
These advertisements can be targeted to a variety of audiences based on gender, age, interests, location and language.
Facebook also announced a location-based deal yesterday that combines elements of  sites like Foursquare and LivingSocial. Facebook Deals combines elements of other popular networking sites by offering coffee or restaurant deals that the user can obtain by “checking in” on Facebook. The new service is now available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Germany and Italy.
Facebook assured its users that the advertisements are in accordance with their privacy settings and do not share any information that is not already available to one’s friends or the public.

Mothers have a new reason to make their children eat their greens, and it is not just “because I told you so.”
A recent article published by Georgetown researchers in The Journal of Medicinal Chemistry suggests that cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and watercress contain compounds that may block the growth of cancer cells.
The compounds — called isothiocyanates, or ITCs — work by binding to defective p53 proteins, which are found in approximately half of all cancer types. While normal p53 proteins are found in healthy human cells and prevent abnormal cell growth, mutated p53 proteins can create conditions favorable for the genesis of tumors, especially in cancer patients.
The study was conducted at Georgetown’s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center by first-time co-authors Anthony J. Di Pasqua, Ph.D., and Xiantao Wang, Ph.D., both of whom worked  under the guidance of ITC expert  Fung-Lung Chung. Georgetown graduate Charles Hong (COL ’10), was an assistant for the study.
Explaining the research to The Hoya, Di Pasqua said that the study noted that certain kinds of ITCs were especially resilient in fighting only abnormal protein cells, leaving healthy p53 proteins intact.
“We concluded from our studies that depending on its structure, ITCs can robustly deplete mutant p53 protein, and that this depletion appears to be specific to mutant forms of p53,” Di Pasqua said. “This is important because approximately half of all cancers carry p53 mutations, and there is evidence that mutant p53 promotes tumor genesis.”
Seventeen different types of ITCs, both natural and synthetic, were examined in the study. Of those, a synthetic ITC called 2,2-diphenylethyl ITC was one of the most successful at depleting mutant p53 proteins. It also induced the greatest extent of apoptosis — self-destruction by a cell — in breast cancer cells containing mutant p53.
“Several natural ITCs did perform very well in tests, particularly garden cress and other dark green leafy vegetables,” Di Pasqua said.
Previous studies had observed that ITCs seemed to prevent the growth of cancer cells, but researchers now recognize the way in which ITCs bind to mutant p53 proteins, preventing them from instigating abnormal cell growth.
With a more developed understanding of ITC abilities, doctors may make the use of natural or synthetic ITCs an important component in the treatment of certain types of cancer in the future. Di Pasqua believes that the compounds have the potential to be used as chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents.
In addition to the preventative properties found in ITCs, cruciferous vegetables offer a number of other documented elements that aid in cancer treatment.
“Another benefit of consuming cruciferous vegetables is that they contain fiber, lutein and carotenoids along with the ITCs, and all of these substances fight cancer as well,” Di Pasqua said.

The McDonough School of Business’s full-time MBA program was ranked 17th in the country and 38th in the world Monday by the Financial Times 2011 survey.
The school’s national ranking moved up two slots after the program was ranked 19th in the 2010 survey. Its full-time MBA program also ranked third in the world for international business this year, according to a MSB press release.
The Financial Times ranking method used questionnaires from both the school and from alumni who graduated in 2007. Programs were also evaluated on their average alumni salaries after three years, career development, international engagement and faculty research.
This year, the average MSB alumni salary three years after they have graduated from the MBA program was reported at $127,539 following adjustments to account for salary variations between industries. Eighty-eight percent of graduates reported employment within three months of graduating, with 19 percent finding employment outside the United States.
London Business School came out on top in the global rankings, followed by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and Harvard Business School.
