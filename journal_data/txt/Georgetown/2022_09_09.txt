Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturning Roe v. Wade, people across the nation have mourned the loss of the constitutional right to an abortion and have fought diligently to secure state-level abortion rights.
While abortion is currently legal in Washington, D.C., the District’s laws are subject to congressional intervention; that is, the United States Congress reviews all legislation before it becomes D.C. law and can modify or overturn all legislation. Therefore, if the Republican Party takes control of Congress after this year’s midterm elections, abortion access in the District may be in jeopardy.
With the future of abortion access at risk across the nation, The Hoya has compiled information about how Georgetown University community members can access abortion care and contraceptives both on- and off-campus, as well as the District’s current and potential abortion laws.
Abortion Access on Campus 
As the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institution in the United States, Georgetown University aligns itself with the values and beliefs of the Catholic Church, including those that condemn abortion and contraceptives as “immoral” in all cases. 
The university’s Catholic identity and adherence to these principles have historically led to administrative struggles, as the institution attempts to balance its devotion to faith and tradition with its commitment to protecting free speech and providing an inclusive environment for students of all backgrounds.
Although abortion access is legal in the District, the Georgetown University Medical Center does not perform abortions because of religious restrictions. 
As a Catholic hospital, MedStar Georgetown is not permitted to perform abortions in accordance with the “Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services.” The Georgetown University School of Medicine also does not offer abortion training in its curriculum.
Additionally, university employees cannot refer students to abortion clinics because of the Catholic Church’s stance on abortion.
On the main Georgetown campus, H*yas for Choice (HFC), a pro-abortion rights student group, continues to work on advancing the abortion conversation. While abortions are prohibited at MedStar Georgetown, many HFC members work as volunteer clinic escorts for Planned Parenthood and similar abortion-providing organizations in the District. 
In recent weeks, HFC launched a #nochoicenodonations campaign in collaboration with the Georgetown University Law Center chapter of If/When/How, a national nonprofit network of lawyers and law students focused on providing legal support for reproductive justice issues including abortion. 
The campaign asks community members to join a “no donation” pledge, which seeks to withhold certain donations to the university endowment to pressure the university into changing its policies on reproductive rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. 
HFC plans to continue its pledge until Georgetown supports its fight for reproductive justice and family autonomy at the university. It hopes to see Georgetown provide students access to contraceptives on campus, funding for pro-choice groups and events, access to online classes for pregnant students or new parents and the end of administrative support for anti-choice events.
Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) emphasized the university’s commitment to open and respectful discourse on the decision in a statement to the Georgetown community June 27.
“This case involves complex questions of moral judgment in the context of decisions that are very personal, intimate, and often very painful,” DeGioia wrote in the statement. “In the days ahead, we will draw on our resources as an academic community as units across the university host events and convenings to explore the issues raised by the Court’s decision.”
Facilities in the District that do offer abortion include the Carol Whitehill Moses Center, which houses Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C. The center offers abortion pills for people less than 10 weeks into their pregnancy and in-clinic abortions for people up to 19 weeks and six days into their pregnancy. Escorts, interpreters and support staff are also available to assist patients with additional needs.
D.C.’s Planned Parenthood Center also offers over 15 kinds of contraception. In addition, mental health care, HIV testing, pregnancy services, primary care and STD testing and treatment are available.
Contraceptive Access on Campus
HFC is the sole contraception provider on campus and tables weekly, Monday through Friday, in Red Square to give out safe-sex supplies including condoms, lube, dental dams and emergency contraception for free. 
HFC also provides information on sexual health, pregnancy, sexual assault, birth control, LGBTQ+ resources and abortion services.
Campus stores, such as those operated by student-run business The Corp, are not permitted to sell contraceptive products. However, the stores are permitted to sell pregnancy tests. The Women’s Center also provides pregnancy tests for free.
The university’s Student Health Center (SHC) is permitted to prescribe hormonal contraceptives, but there must be an underlying medical need for the prescription, such as acne, cramps, polycystic ovary syndrome and heavy or irregular periods.
Georgetown offers a variety of reproductive services through SHC, which include STI screenings, gynecological care and annual exams. SHC also offers free, at-home pregnancy testing, as well as counseling and support for matters relating to pregnancy and sexual health. 
The university’s premier healthcare plan, which is affiliated with United HealthCare (UHC), is required by the federal government to cover all FDA-approved contraceptives. United HealthCare provides separate payments for students enrolled in the university health insurance plan to use for contraceptives. The university, however, said that it is not involved in the process of referring, administering or funding contraceptive services that are covered by the plan.
Abortion Rights in the District
Abortion is currently legal during every stage of pregnancy in the District, including third trimester abortions. The District serves as a safe haven for individuals seeking abortions, as out-of-state residents constituted 68.7% of reported abortions in Washington, D.C., in 2019. 
Abortion providers and healthcare professionals in the District are also protected from discrimination through a 2020 law passed by the Council of the District of Columbia.
Although abortion is currently legal in the District, Congress has placed limitations on abortion, despite strong support for reproductive rights laws among District residents.
Nadia Brown, a Georgetown government professor and director of the women’s and gender studies program, said abortion restrictions in the District tend to disproportionately affect marginalized communities, including transgender and non-binary people. 
“This is where the nation experiences high levels of poverty as well as high levels of affluence and luxury,” Brown said in an interview with The Hoya. “Those women that can afford private medical services continue to do so, and abortions will be open to them in ways that will not be for a majority of people who are living below or at the poverty line.”
Brown also said some local legislation hurts women in poverty; for example, the 1989 Dornan Amendment prevents Medicaid funds from being used to fund abortions in D.C.
“People that are accessing public services would probably be the ones that would also need public assistance in terminating a pregnancy whether it is unwanted, at the risk of the mother’s health or a byproduct of rape or incest,” Brown said.Low-income individuals and people of color have historically struggled to access abortion services because of financial difficulties, lack of quality sexual health education resources, inability to provide proper identification and difficulty accessing abortion facilities.

Transphobic social media group “Libs of TikTok” posted threatening videos on their accounts falsely claiming Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., provides gender-affirming hysterectomies to transgender minors.
In a video posted on Twitter Aug. 25, Brooklyn real estate saleswoman and “Libs of TikTok” (LOTT) founder Chaya Raichik is heard asking two hospital phone operators whether they would be willing to perform a hysterectomy on her fictional 16-year-old transgender son. The operator asks Raichik how old her child is, and when Raichik says they are 16, the operator says the child is “in the clear.”
A hysterectomy is a medical procedure that removes a patient’s uterus as well as, in some cases, their ovaries and fallopian tubes. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health does not currently recommend hysterectomies for minors.
In the tweet, the group claims that the hospital was willing to perform the procedure on a minor.
“@ChildrensNatl admits in damning audio recording that they do ‘gender affirming’ hysterectomies on minors including 16-year-olds and ‘younger kids,’” the tweet accompanying the video reads. 
A spokesperson for Children’s National told The Hoya that the hospital does not provide hysterectomies to minors, in accordance with a Washington, D.C. law prohibiting the hysterectomies on minors without a court order.
“We do not and have never provided gender-affirming surgery for anyone under the age of 18,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “We do not provide hormone therapy to children before puberty begins.” 
On Aug. 27, Twitter suspended the group’s account for a week on the basis that it violated the platform’s standards for “hateful conduct.” In a blog post Sept. 3, Raichik threatened to sue Twitter if the account were to be permanently banned and attached a letter from her lawyers to the Head of Legal, Policy, and Trust at Twitter two days prior.
In the letter, Raichik’s representation claims her tweets did not constitute hateful conduct, arguing that they were not directed toward “a person or group of people” as outlined in Twitter’s hateful conduct policy.
“Even assuming LOTT’s reporting did incite others to “target” the hospitals — a demonstrably false allegation our client strenuously denies — it is unclear how that would violate Twitter’s hateful conduct policy since hospitals are corporate entities,” the letter reads. 
Though the operators heard on the call gave inaccurate information, the Children’s National spokesperson said operators do not provide care to patients at the hospital.
“None of the people who were secretly recorded by this activist group deliver care to our patients,” the spokesperson wrote. “Care is individualized for each patient and always involves families making decisions in coordination with a team of highly trained pediatric specialists.”
Children’s National does provide primary and specialty care to transgender youth that is in accordance with the standards of care outlined by the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH), including hormone replacement therapy, STD/STI treatment and individual and family therapy.
Conservative news outlets Fox News and The Daily Signal, as well as many individual users on social media, shared the story without fact-checking with Children’s National, according to the spokesperson. 
After the recording was posted, the hospital became the target of mass harassment on and off social media, according to the hospital spokesperson.
“Since the spreading of misinformation on Twitter, we have been the target of hostile and threatening phone calls and emails,” the spokesperson wrote. “We stand strong with our clinical teams and the transgender community.”
Some Twitter users suggested the hospital should be bombed and that hospital workers were “demons” and “groomers” who deserved death for being involved in the procedure.
The incident is one of several recent transphobic attacks by the group. In August, Boston Children’s Hospital faced similar transphobic threats after “Libs of TikTok” made similar claims that the hospital was providing gender-affirming hysterectomies to young children. Like Children’s National Hospital, however, Boston Children’s also does not provide hysterectomies to minors. LGBTQ+ care programs at hospitals in Pittsburgh and Phoenix have also been targeted by the same group. 
In an Aug. 25 tweet, Children’s National Hospital publicly reaffirmed their dedication to supporting their young transgender patients. 
“We foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, serving our LGBTQ+ patients and families in the full spectrum of their care,” Children’s National wrote in the tweet.

The Georgetown University McDonough School of Business (MSB) will launch an online program for students to earn a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from anywhere in the world.
The new online option will be offered to students enrolled in the Flex MBA program, an alternative to the traditional MBA meant to accommodate students who balance working full time alongside a business course load. The Flex MBA Online program, which is set to begin in the Fall 2023 semester and, will be the university’s third online business master’s degree, alongside online options for the Master of Science in Finance and Master of Science in Business Analytics. Students have between 24 and 60 months to complete the degree. 
After adapting to remote learning conditions during the 2020-21 academic year, university administrators felt confident developing a successful virtual option for Flex MBA students, according to Prashant Malaviya, professor of marketing and senior associate dean of MBA programs.
“When deciding to develop a virtual modality for the Flex MBA program, it was important that we maintained the academic rigor and enriching community our MBA programs are known for, while maximizing the convenience and flexibility of online learning,” Malaviya wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The online format was intentionally designed for working professionals who desired the Georgetown MBA experience but needed greater flexibility to balance their work and life commitments.”
The online program will make the Flex MBA more accessible for graduate students who are also working, as well as those who live around the globe and cannot pursue a Georgetown degree in person, according to Malaviya.
“We are hopeful that many students in the online program will be able to take additional in-person courses of their choice and participate on campus in the many exciting Georgetown and McDonough events and activities,” Malaviya wrote. “We are confident that these elements of the program design will ensure the online students build meaningful relationships with their classmates and peers, and gain exposure to the global perspectives that define the Georgetown MBA.”
Ensuring students of the online program experience the same bonding and support network as those studying in person was a priority when designing the degree, according to Shelly Heinrich (GRD ’18), associate dean of MBA admissions and director of marketing in the MSB. 
“The two week-long D.C. residencies and Global Business experience will allow students to continue building on those relationships they’ve established through the cohort-modeled program. There will be select student and career experiences created just for the virtual community,” Heinrich wrote to The Hoya. “Additionally, online students who are able to come to campus will be able to participate and have access to all MBA student and career programming opportunities.”
Flex MBA Online will encourage connections across the student body through synchronous cohort classes, two in-person weeklong residencies at Georgetown, team-based learning strategies and the MSB’s Global Business Experience consulting project.
Following success with previous online programs at Georgetown and given the advancement in technological resources, providing more online classes is the natural step forward, according to Nathan Miller, an associate professor of strategy and economics at the MSB.
“I think that there’s always going to be a demand for high quality business education, and what’s changed is that Georgetown has developed the capabilities to deliver that, to meet that demand,” Miller told The Hoya. 
Miller said the pandemic reshaped the way he understands the value of virtual learning and the efficacy of online programs.
“Through our experience with using technology over the pandemic and even before that, it’s given us the capabilities to provide high quality programs online,” Miller said. “It makes sense to try to provide that to students who are less able to get to campus.”
The new Flex MBA Online program is built from Georgetown’s past experience with offering remote courses and should become a significant asset for future MSB students, according to Malaviya. 
“We believe that in the near future, the Flex MBA Online program will be a significant offering of the school, and it will only grow in size and reputation,” Malaviya wrote.

Georgetown University plans to launch a transit program that will give randomly selected  students a $100 credit toward Washington, D.C. transit passes.
Any full-time undergraduate or graduate student can apply for the “Hoya Transit Pilot” program; 2,500 randomly selected applicants will receive the funds toward their SmarTrip accounts for the Fall 2022 semester, according to an announcement from Senior Vice President and Interim Chief Operating Officer David Green and Vice President for Sustainability Meghan Chapple that was emailed to students Sept. 6.
Georgetown created the pilot in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and marks the university’s first mass transit program. Applications for the fall phase of the program close Sept. 12, and funds will be distributed to enrolled students’ SmarTrip accounts Oct. 1. 
Sayrin Kang (COL ’23), whose hometown is in Northern Virginia, said the program will make it easier for her to visit family.
“Sometimes I GUTS to the Metro station and take the Metro home, so it would be really convenient for me to go home for the weekend,” Kang said in an interview with The Hoya. “It would personally be really nice.”
The Georgetown University Transportation Service (GUTS) provides free weekday shuttle service to Arlington, Va., the Dupont and Rosslyn Metro Stations, the Georgetown Downtown Campus, the Georgetown University Law Center and university offices along Wisconsin Avenue for those affiliated with Georgetown and Medstar Georgetown University Hospital. 
Former Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate Vice Speaker Rowlie Flores (COL ’22), who worked with university administration members on similar transit programs during his tenure, said the pilot supports GUTS’ offerings well.
“The program will complement what we already have with the GUTS program and just allow students to travel at longer lengths and not be limited to where GUTS buses are located,” Flores told The Hoya. “It’s a really great start.”
Ella Boasberg (COL ’25) signed up for the pilot program immediately after seeing the Sept. 6 email and said that, if selected, she plans to take the metro more often. 
“With the option of free public transportation I think people will be more inclined to use it,” Boasberg told The Hoya. 
Kang also said the program will make it easier for students to take advantage of the museums and landmarks in the District.
“My friends and I wanted to get out of the bubble to just explore parts of D.C. because I feel like that’s a big part of going to Georgetown,” Kang said. “Looking back, it would have been really nice if we had [the program], so I think it would be a nice help for the community.”
Boasberg said the pilot program would be improved by the Georgetown University Transportation Services buses running on weekends, as the buses are the only free university-provided transportation directly to a Metro station.
“Ideally, we would have a system to be able to get to the Metro during the weekends,” Boasberg said. “But I think this has actually opened a lot of options, and with not having to pay for the Metro, once you’re there it just makes it even more convenient and accessible.”
In May 2021, the GUSA Senate passed a referendum urging the university to implement the WMATA University Pass Program, with 84.03% of students voting in favor. GUSA unanimously voted in March 2022 to reaffirm the results. 
A university spokesperson said the goal of the program is to respond to student input calling for a transit program during the 2021-22 academic year.
“In order to determine how best to support our student populations, we will gather data and feedback related to overall ridership, transit type, trip duration, frequency and geographic area,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya. “This data and student feedback will be used to inform the University’s transportation options and offerings in the future.”
Flores said the university should be more clear about the specifics on the ways data is going to be used.
“How are they going to measure usage of the program — is it by how many students have used the program out of that one year pilot program, or is it an average of how many students use the program, how many rides they take on the Metro, buses and the train?” Flores said. “I think there needs to be more transparency on how they’re going to report this and how they’re going to judge how useful and efficient the program actually is for a permanent implementation.”
The university also intends to run the program for the Spring 2023 semester using the same randomized selection process. Students who participate in the fall pilot will not be barred from participating again.

September 9, 2022 by Katie Hawkinson 5 Comments 
From the potential rescission of Rudy Giuliani’s (H ’02) honorary degree to Georgetown University’s lack of abortion care resources in the wake of Dobbs v. Jackson, university president John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) sat down with Katie Hawkinson (COL ’23), The Hoya’s editor in chief, to discuss updates from across the Hilltop.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Rudolph Giuliani’s (H’02) Honorary Degree
Hawkinson (KH): Giuliani is currently being investigated regarding alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Giuliani also had his law license suspended in New York in 2021, and he is set to attend a disciplinary hearing in D.C. in October for charges related to the 2020 election. Yet, Giuliani continues to hold an honorary degree from Georgetown University. Does the university have any plans to rescind his honorary degree?
DeGioia (JD): We’re tracking the external reviews that are taking place. We’re aware of what has unfolded in New York, we’re aware of the hearing that will be here in Washington, D.C. and we’re aware of what’s unfolded in the January 6th hearings. We will likely watch what unfolds over the next few weeks to see if it calls for action on our part. Ultimately, rescission requires me to bring a recommendation to the board of directors. Ultimately, it’s their decision. 
Abortion Care Access
KH: While abortion is still legal in D.C., how is Georgetown hoping to support students with access to reproductive health care, especially students who come from states across the country that are stripping away those rights after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision?
JD: We’ve been guided as a university by the ethical and religious directives on Catholic health services that the U.S. Catholic Bishops put forward. At an overarching level, we’ve been guided by what in Catholic moral teaching would be referred to as the consistent ethic of life, where we regard the protection of life, from conception to end of life care, along a continuum of profound respect for the dignity of life. I think our role will be to ensure we can provide a forum for the richest and the most engaged dialogue possible. We have always had a unique role to play in those kinds of discussions. I would say that those decisions regarding the need for access to different kinds of resources would fundamentally be made within the relationship between the doctor and the patient. 
KH: So, the university would not provide any resources or information for students to learn about abortion access in the District? 
JD: No.
Updates on GU272+ Initiatives
KH: What updates can you provide regarding the university’s current work with the descendants of the GU272+ and activists in the university community?
JD: Our student group, which is composed of students across our university, including undergraduates, students recommended by GradGov and folks from the Black Law Student Association at the Georgetown University Law Center, began its work last spring, and they will be prepared to distribute some of this year’s funds pretty soon. They’re in consultation with an advisory group of descendants in this ongoing conversation about how best to utilize these resources. Our commitment has been $400,000 a year, we had 500 people contribute to the fund this past spring. So we’re pretty confident we’re going to be able to hit our target year in and year out. 
Financial Aid Lawsuit
KH: Nearly eight months ago, Georgetown University was sued for allegedly using a shared methodology to limit and calculate applicants’ financial aid packages. Do you have any updates on how you plan to rebuild trust with Georgetown students amid these allegations?
JD: While we’re engaged in this litigation, it’s very hard to take steps to earn the trust of our students. When all the dust settles, and this case is over, I think our students will see that our policy of being need blind is meaningful. We did so in a way where we validate methodology in consultation with others. This has ensured that more students have had more access to this university than any alternative policy could have ever provided.
Affirmative Action Amicus Brief
KH: Georgetown University filed an amicus brief advocating for the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold affirmative action. Could you walk me through the story of this brief, as well as why it was an important issue to you and the university at large?
JD: We’ve had a deep commitment to the practice of affirmative action for a half-century. That’s about how long it’s been an intentional part of higher education. I felt that it was very important for us to find the most appropriate way to ensure that multiple voices were heard in these cases. We felt that there was an argument that we could add that complements the argument that Harvard makes their case. I was very proud of the work that emerged that we should provide that leadership, and that our peers joined in and found it to be worthy of their signing on to. Also, we took all of our senior leadership team away for a retreat in late May, early June focused on affirmative action. We took everybody through those 50 years of cases, our practices here and what’s at risk. We did the same with our board of directors. The intent is always to ensure alignment.

wow, this interviewer is bad at asking questions! nobody cares about guilani’s honorary degree, and a catholic university was never gonna support abortion. waste of space asking. amongst the few questions that did matter, interviewer failed to draw any meaningful info from degioia or ask ANY follow-up questions. what a joke!

Hoya2018 says 
September 10, 2022 at 4:06 pm
It appears the previous commenter missed “This interview has been edited for length and clarity” disclaimer or perhaps didn’t understand it (I suspect it’s the latter).
Great interview by the Hoya, asking DeGioia tough and relevant questions. Giuliani’s honorary degree should be revoked by the Board of Directors. And in the wake of Dobbs this question absolutely needed to be asked and put on the record!

Kelly says 
September 10, 2022 at 4:09 pm
Wow, could the interviewer have been more of a leftist? What a ridiculous set of questions!

HoyaParanoia24 says 
September 15, 2022 at 2:21 pm
Unless your comments were edited for length and clarity, you don’t provide anything to back up your opinion.  In what way is the interview “leftist”?  And why were the questions ridiculous and what questions would you have liked to have asked?  
I am glad just to hear from the Administration — about anything.  Hoping for more Q & A with DeGioia and other administrators about decisions, goings-on, and explanations of policy.

Lou S. says

I wonder if Giuliani’s honorary degree would crack GU students’ top 150 school issues.

Georgetown University reaffirmed its support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the importance of protecting undocumented students. 
In an Aug. 26 statement, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) voiced the university’s support for efforts by the Biden Administration to codify and continue the DACA program. DeGioia’s statement follows a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulation that strengthens DACA by preserving the right of eligible noncitizens who arrived via irregular migration in the United States as children, also referred to as “Dreamers,” to remain in the country. 
A university spokesperson directed The Hoya to a statement published on the Georgetown University website that says the regulation arose in response to conservative Supreme Court justices’ attempts to rule the DACA program unconstitutional.
“The new federal regulation aims to protect the DACA program from ongoing legal challenges, most recently from a U.S. District Court judge, who ruled DACA ‘unlawful’ in July 2021 and blocked new applicants to the program,” the statement reads. “The DHS regulation, which will go into effect on Oct. 31, 2022, retains the existing DACA policy that the Obama Administration first outlined with minor changes. The freeze on new applications is still in place.”
The university stands in support of the DHS rule and encourages further measures to codify DACA and safeguard the rights of Dreamers, according to DeGioia.
“We welcome all efforts to protect the DACA program, including the Administration’s action yesterday, and we will continue to advocate for permanent protections and for expanding the DACA eligibility criteria for these young people and adults who have contributed so much to our campus and to our nation,” DeGioia wrote in the Aug. 26 statement.  
The DACA policy has helped more than 700,000 young adults since 2012 by temporarily protecting them from deportation and authorizing them to work in the United States. More than 1.3 million DACA-eligible Dreamers currently live in the United States. DACA recipients must pass an extensive background check as a part of the application process and must renew their application every two years to remain in the program.
The university has historically endorsed DACA, as Georgetown joined 20 other universities in a December 2021 amicus brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals calling for the reversal of a Texas federal judge’s injunction of the program. The contributions that Dreamer students provide to the Georgetown community are commonly emphasized in the university’s statements on DACA.
Abel Cruz Flores (GRD ’21), a DACA recipient who came to the United States at the age of 15, received his Ph.D. from Georgetown as a result of these protections. He said the next step for policymakers is to pass permanent legislative solutions to prevent further judicial challenges of the program. 
“The DACA policy implemented in 2012 gave me the opportunity to pursue higher education and ultimately become a professor in 2021,” Cruz Flores wrote to The Hoya. “The ruling of the Supreme Court in favor of DACA on June 18, 2020 legitimated our efforts to live and work in the only place we call home without fear of deportation. Now we must strive for a system that keeps the premises of DACA as we know it for future generations to come.”
Georgetown provides undocumented students with legal, financial and emotional support  through Undocumented Student Services (USS), according to the program’s associate director Jennifer Crewalk, who directed The Hoya to a USS informational handout. 
“USS is available to UndocuHoyas to discuss experiences and access resources,” the handout reads. “The Associate Director supports UndocuHoyas by navigating complex issues, celebrating successes, and building community.”
As federal legislative discussions surrounding the future of DACA continue at the federal level, DeGioia said Georgetown recognizes the program’s importance to the lives of many Hoyas and will continue to fight for its enforcement.
“The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has provided important protections for many Georgetown students over the past decade,” DeGioia wrote in the Aug. 26 statement. “These young people are integral members of our community, and we remain deeply committed to ensuring they are supported as they pursue their education here at Georgetown and as members of our alumni community.”
