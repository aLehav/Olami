Robert Triefus, the CEO of Gucci Vault and Metaverse Ventures, spoke to the Georgetown University community about the future of fashion in the digital age and how Georgetown students can become involved in the fashion retail industry.
The Georgetown Retail & Luxury Association, a student-run club dedicated to educating students on retail sectors including high-end fashion, and the McDonough School of Business hosted the March 14 event. Triefus discussed the potential for luxury brands such as Gucci to explore the untapped opportunities provided by metaverse, the gaming industry, and Web3, a potential new phase of the internet that would enable users to read, write and own webpages.
Triefus, who has worked at Gucci for nearly 15 years, said Gucci’s extensive history can expand its legacy even further by pursuing a future in the metaverse.
“Gucci is 102 years old, so it’s good to put that into perspective when you talk about the metaverse,” Triefus said at the event. “Gucci has always made it quite a bit of its DNA to be constantly thinking about reinvention, to a degree, disruption and how its brand can remain relevant to its community.”
Despite its reputation as an older brand, Triefus said Gucci has historically capitalized on modern changes within the industry and disruptions within society to successfully reinvent themselves.
“Back in the 2000s, Gucci was one of the pioneers in luxury e-commerce at a time when it was really questionable to offer a luxury experience online,” Triefus said. “At that time, as today, and as over the last 102 years, the brand and its custodians wanted to make sure that it would lean toward opportunities.”
Triefus said critics have doubted Gucci’s experimentation with digital media platforms such as Facebook in the past.
“There is the question of whether luxury brands should be active on social media,” Triefus said. “Back in 2008, when we opened our Facebook account, I had an intern running a social media account. We were looked at as potentially doing something wrong, something that wasn’t appropriate for luxury brands.”
But Gucci now operates and markets its products across multiple social media platforms and has rallied more than 40 million followers on Instagram.
Triefus said Gucci is still looking to breach new frontiers with augmented reality (AR) and other emerging digital platforms.
“We were one of the pioneers in using AR to help our customers with try-on experiences, first with shoewear. It has been very successful, and now we have try-on experiences for eyewear and makeup,” Triefus said.
“Again, what we’re doing is trying to have a deeper engagement with our customers and ultimately making the technology work for a purpose,” Triefus added.
Triefus said the gaming industry is another source of new ventures for luxury brands. Gucci Vault most recently collaborated with gaming companies and platforms like Roblox; the Sandbox, a virtual world where players own their characters as NFTs; and Yuga Labs, a blockchain technology company that develops NFTs like the Bored Ape Yacht Club.
Triefus said Gucci Vault’s initial gamble on collaborating with the widely played game Roblox was unexpectedly a resounding success.
“We opened a Gucci experience in Roblox for two weeks, and we sold an unlimited amount of digital assets,” Triefus said. “There was this Gucci handbag that was selling in the secondary market of Roblox for more than the physical product. It shows that there is an appetite for digital luxury products.”
Triefus said the gaming and entertainment industries provide a great opportunity for Gucci to grow its brand in the era of digital evolution, as they open the brand up to a vast number of potential clients.
“As we think about how brands engage with different audiences and communities, the gaming community is unequivocally the most important community that is presenting to brands for the future,” Triefus said.
Outside of gaming, Triefus said he sees more opportunities to expand the brand by embracing similar developments, such as NFTs, with an open mind.
“We are looking at new experiments with technologies that will have potentially embedded NFTs,” Triefus said. “There’s enough evidence that our physical and digital sales are continuously merging for a lot of different reasons. Gucci has always been willing to experiment, test and learn to plot a path to the future.”

Cardinal Michael Czerny, S.J., one of Pope Francis’ closest collaborators, spoke about the pope’s legacy in the 10 years since his appointment and what the Georgetown University community can learn from his tenets at a Mar. 13 event.
The Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, which studies the impact of religion on diplomacy and globalization, and the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, a program that fosters discussion about Catholic social issues, hosted the event. Czerny highlighted the message of “Fratelli Tutti,” Francis’ October 2020 encyclical that called for international unity to prevent wars, in a series of questions and answers moderated by John Carr, the founder of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life.
Czerny said Francis has focused on helping displaced people as part of his goals mentioned in the encyclical.
“He has chosen these migrants and refugees because of their great need and suffering, but also because they so effectively symbolize all those who are marginalized,” Czerny said at the event. “I find the four verbs Pope Francis articulated striking because they apply to every marginalized group: welcome, protect, promote and integrate.”
In 2022, Francis appointed Czerny as prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, a department of the Roman Curia that focuses on serving forcibly displaced and marginalized populations. Czerny said the actions that define Francis’ global leadership over the past 10 years are those of mercy, including the opening of the Holy Door in St. Peter’s Basilica in 2015 for the Jubilee Year.
By opening the Holy Door, Francis initiated the Catholic Church’s “Year of Mercy,” a project that aimed to bring mercy to both Catholics and nonbelievers. Among other changes, the Year of Mercy permitted priests to absolve people who have had abortions.
Georgetown does not provide students with contraception materials and is committed to stay in line with the Catholic Church’s values, as seen when the university hosted the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life, a student-run anti-abortion conference.
Czerny said helping those in need, such as individuals experiencing poverty, benefits everybody.
“One of the big challenges is to recognize that our generosity in responding to the cry of the poor is also an act of self-preservation,” Czerny said. “If we don’t respond, we’re not going to reestablish a common home for ourselves. We’re going to tear apart what we received from God.”
Halfway through the event, three additional speakers joined Czerny on stage: Anthony Annett, author of “Cathonomics: How Catholic Tradition Can Create a More Just Economy”; Joan Rosenhauer, executive director of an international refugee service dedicated to serving forcibly displaced people; and Gulzeyin Sharipova-Khalibaeva (GRD ’24), a graduate student from Kyrgyzstan.
Rosenhauer said “Fratelli Tutti” inspired her to further serve her community in any way possible.
“We can all do things in our daily lives that help people on the margins, such as working with Catholic charities,” Rosenhauer said at the event. “We may feel that we’re not changing the world or being the good Samaritan that is known globally, but we can all play our part.”
Given the recent one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Czerny addressed his previous trips to Ukraine and Francis’ goals for the nation.
“Pope Francis is making every effort to help make peace possible by treating everyone involved with humanity,” Czerny said. “Despite the fact that some people are completely wrong or extremely violent, it doesn’t mean they have lost their humanity.”
Carr said the kind manner with which Francis treated migrants and refugees during his visit to the United States is the most tangible demonstration of his character and mission to lead by example.
“He stood at the podium in our Capitol and challenged us to look at the faces of migrants,” Carr said. “Instead of enjoying a fancy lunch afterwards, he went to cafeterias and had a meal with the hungry and homeless in D.C. He told us what to do but more importantly, showed us what to do.”

The Georgetown University film and media studies program and the Free Speech Project — an independent, nonpartisan initiative focusing on free speech in the United States — hosted a March 14 panel regarding Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, a site known for publishing high-security news and classified media.
Assange, an Australian citizen who remains in Belmarsh prison, a high-security prison in southeast London, was indicted in the United States on 17 espionage charges for allegedly conspiring to obtain and disclose national defense information: an offense that carries a maximum prison sentence of 175 years. The indictment follows WikiLeaks’ publication of classified materials obtained from U.S. soldier Chelsea Manning, formerly convicted of violations of the Espionage Act for disclosing classified and sensitive military documents.
Sanford Ungar, director of the Free Speech Project, moderated the panel, which featured Assange’s brother Gabriel Shipton and his father John Shipton.
Gabriel and John Shipton presented the trailer for their 2021 documentary, “ITHAKA,” which depicts the campaign to free Julian Assange. Gabriel Shipton said he was inspired to create the documentary after visiting his brother in prison.
“I’ve never seen Julian in a state like that before,” Shipton said at the event. “And I left that day feeling that I might not see him again.”
Allison Stanger, professor of international politics and economics at Middlebury College, and Jane Turner, whistleblower and former special agent for the FBI, also spoke at the panel.
The panelists said the debate surrounding Assange’s situation relates to his case’s potential legal precedent. Many journalists have expressed concerns that if Assange faces charges, they could face similar charges for reporting on national security.
The repercussions of the case depend on whether Assange is considered a whistleblower, according to Turner. Turner said a whistleblower is an insider who exposes evidence of illicit activity to the authorities or media outlets, a definition that she said does not fit Assange.
Turner said Assange is a publisher and therefore a part of the media, which gives him the right to publish classified information without the risk of criminal charges that, on the contrary, whistleblowers would face.
“Journalists and the media are protected under the First Amendment, which John Shipton referred to, which is extremely important, but we can’t get whistleblowing mixed in with the media,” Turner said at the event. “That’s just not how it works.”
Stanger brought up Assange’s alleged connections to Russia, which resulted in strong feelings from the audience members and other panelists, who began to speak over one another.
Jacob Sowers (CAS ’23), a contributing writer for the Free Speech Project, said the panel served as a chance to bring together different perspectives into an engaging discussion.
“The panel was a great opportunity to hear from four excellent speakers about their opinions on a complex and controversial subject,” Sowers wrote to The Hoya. “I’m proud that Sandy Ungar (director of FSP) and John McCabe (program manager/editor of FSP) were able to bring together such a fascinating and diverse group of opinions to produce healthy debate on an issue that has worldwide Free Speech implications.”
Sowers said he could tell emotions were running high among panelists and audience members.
“For me, one thing that was interesting to see was the emotion that was flowing throughout the room at all times — it was evident that the audience, as well as the family members of Julian Assange, were very invested in this issue and felt very strongly, one way or another, about Julian Assange’s case,” Sowers wrote.
The harsh conditions Assange faces in Belmarsh — including being held incommunicado, or denied access to family members, an attorney or an independent physician — are affecting his mental state, according to Gabriel Shipton.
Turner asked why Assange has not agreed to go to trial in the United States to escape these conditions. Stanger responded, saying the U.S. government has offered to allow Assange to carry out his sentence in his home country of Australia if he is convicted, and he would not have to reside in a maximum security facility.
Josh Rushing, an American broadcast journalist, said at the event that it makes sense that Assange does not want to go to trial in the United States because of a lack of trust in the justice system. Assange’s family and several audience members said they agreed with this assessment. 
“What you see is a guy who’s in the harshest prison in the U.K., for publishing the truth, and when now having been prosecuted for anything is persecution before prosecution,” Rushing said. “And you’re asking that same individual, ‘Trust the U.S. system and come here, you’ll get a fair shake.’ You can see why he might be dubious of that.”

Over 400 students signed a Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) petition published on Feb. 9 urging the Office of Residential Living to end laundry charges.
The GUSA Department of Financial Accessibility and the Free Laundry Committee’s petition calls for Residential Living to establish free laundry for students and argues that laundry charges harm students — especially those who are low-income. The petition has gained traction in recent days, with at least 405 students, two staff members and 30 Georgetown organizations indicating their support.
Laundry costs $3.50 for one wash and dry load, meaning it costs $59.50 to do laundry once a week for a semester, according to the petition. The university only allocates $42 per student for laundry, forcing students to pay out-of-pocket expenses if they do laundry weekly. 
GUSA President Camber Vincent (SFS ’24) said that GUSA is seeking either free laundry services or reduced costs per load so each semester’s laundry fund lasts longer.
“The main goal of the free laundry service will be to expand access to the number of cycles a given semester either by receiving free service or services at a reduced price that allows for more cycles on the limited laundry budget given as a part of the price of attendance,” Vincent wrote to The Hoya.
Earlier this semester, as the university replaced washing machines and dryers, laundry was temporarily free for students from Jan. 11 to Feb. 1.
“The temporarily free services demonstrated two things: 1) that demand roughly stayed the same and did not drastically increase even though the service was free, and 2) the cost is manageable for the university’s residential services team,” Vincent wrote.
Noriko O’Shea (SFS ’25), a member of the GUSA Department of Financial Accessibility, said GUSA has several strategies planned to make laundry cheaper and more accessible for students.
“Our proposed strategies, if not a complete abolition of transactional laundry, include a ‘swipe’ system where students are granted multiple full cycles (including wash+dry) per week for the entire semester, an increase in the allotted ‘budget’ to fully cover at least one full cycle per week, or the decrease of machine prices to ensure that the current budget is sufficient,” O’Shea wrote to The Hoya.
The committee is currently working with administration in the facilities, auxiliary, student affairs and financial aid departments to improve laundry services for students, according to O’Shea. 
“Given the mass student support and input on the laundry initiative, we are moving forward with working out logistics of current and potential systems, as well as with continued transparency to and input from our peers and community,” O’Shea wrote. “Georgetown admin can and will listen to student needs and ultimately works for our best interest.”
GUSA conducted a survey of the student body in January 2023, in which over 140 undergraduates said that the cost of laundry is a concern for them. 
O’Shea said many respondents reported that the temporary free laundry helped alleviate their stress and allowed them to do laundry more often. 
“Students cited improvements to mental health, roommate relations, physical health, and improved financial security and comfort in academic and professional opportunities,” O’Shea wrote. 
Simone Guite (CAS ’26) said she signed the petition because laundry charges pose a financial barrier to students on top of Georgetown’s already significant cost of attendance, which the university recently raised.
“I have been lucky enough to afford to put more money in my laundry account when I run out, but I know not all students are as fortunate,” Guite wrote to The Hoya. “If Georgetown removed the payment barrier, the financial burden of laundry would be alleviated for many students.”
The petition cites the rapid rise in Georgetown’s endowment from approximately $2.59 billion in 2021 to $3.2 billion in 2022, as well as Georgetown’s Jesuit values, as reasoning to eliminate laundry fees.
“We believe that eliminating the fee to use campus laundry facilities for students in need is both reasonable, achievable, and necessary to support our low-income student population,” the petition reads. “The University has already demonstrated that offering laundry services free of charge poses no barrier to their operational capacities.” 
“Having guaranteed and secure access to laundry services on campus, students benefit from not only clean clothes but also improved mental and physical health, more focus and opportunity in academics and professional development, and increased financial security for necessities like food,” O’Shea wrote.
