The McDonough School of Business’ undergraduate program shot up 13 spots to 10th in the nation in Bloomberg Businessweek’s 2011 rankings.
To select its “Best Undergraduate B-Schools” roster, Bloomberg Businessweek judged the programs based on criteria such as seniors’ evaluations of satisfaction, teaching and facilities, as well as recruiter feedback and the business schools’ self-critiques of difficulty and post-graduation statistics. To finalize the 2011 numbers, which were published Thursday, the newsmagazine averaged the new data with the survey results from the last two years.
“We are pleased and proud that Businessweek has recognized the excellence of Georgetown’s undergraduate business program, which combines an innovative curriculum and leading faculty to provide a high-quality academic experience for our students,” said George Daly, dean of the MSB, in a press release. “Our alumni, parents and friends also have contributed to our success, from funding our wonderful new building to providing essential programmatic support.”
According to the university press release, Georgetown, ranked 23rd last year, made the greatest leap in student satisfaction and recruiter evaluations this year.
“We strive to provide an academically strong undergraduate program that is rich in student engagement,” said Norean Sharpe, undergraduate dean of the MSB, in a press release. “The success of our program is reflected in our high marks for student satisfaction and our reputation among employers for preparing our students to succeed in the workforce.”
Along with the state-of-the-art Rafik B. Hariri Building, which opened in the fall of 2009, the MSB’s addition of a first-year seminar, an entrepreneurship fellows program, a business minor for students in the College, new international partnerships and increased opportunities for service to the community all contributed to the rise, according to Sharpe.
Notre Dame’s Mendoza School of Business took the top spot for the second year in a row, while University of Virginia’s McIntire, Emory’s Goizueta, University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton and Cornell’s Dyson Business Schools rounded out the top five undergrad programs. Villanova’s program also surged to number seven from the 20th spot it held in the 2010 rankings.
The Businessweek ranking stated that students in the MSB typically spend 16.5 hours a week on class work, while 87.6 percent of those students intern. The newsmagazine also reported that the median starting salary rests at $60,000, with top employers like PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bank of America and Credit Suisse frequenting the campus.

A 36-year-old woman died after sustaining traumatic injuries today while working on construction underneath the Leavey Center, according to D.C. Fire spokesman Pete Piringer.
The woman had been operating a device similar to a forklift when she became pinned in an elevated area between scaffolding and a railing, coworkers told Piringer. Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service and D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services were called to the scene, which Piringer described as an underground loading dock area, shortly after 8 a.m. to respond to a report of an injured person.
When D.C. Fire and EMS emergency services arrived, the injured woman’s co-workers had removed her from her trapped position and were performing first aid and CPR techniques on the woman, who was positioned on the ground. D.C. Fire and EMS paramedics proceeded to perform advanced life support interventions and continued their attempts to revive the woman in the GERMS ambulance that rushed her to The George Washington University Hospital, a level one trauma center, for her priority-one injuries. She was pronounced dead after arriving at the hospital.
“The injuries [she sustained] were consistent with what the co-workers [had] described happened,” Piringer said.
GERMS President Colin Brody reiterated that emergency protocol by both GERMS and D.C. Fire and EMS was strictly followed in their response to the injury.
“Our crews work with DC Fire & EMS routinely, and this was no different,” he said. “An engine company from DC Fire arrived first and began treatment, followed by a GERMS ambulance.  Additional units arrived immediately thereafter.”
Piringer added that the Metropolitan Police Department will be partnering with Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a government agency focused on prevention of work-related injuries and deaths, to conduct an investigation of the incident.
OSHA spokesperson Leni Fortson said the investigation could last up to six months and OSHA cannot comment on an open investigation until it is officially closed.
The woman was a contract worker for the science center construction that Whiting-Turner Construction  is managing,  Spiros Dimolitsas, a senior vice president and the chief administrative officer at Georgetown, said in an email about the incident. Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said that the company had not released the name of the woman to the university.
Dimolitsas added that Georgetown was in communication with Whiting-Turner to determine the appropriate timeline for continuing the science center’s construction.
“Out of respect for the needs of workers, the jobsite has been shut down for the day,” Dimolitsas said. “At this time it is not clear whether the injuries were work related or due to some kind of medical emergency.  Our thoughts and prayers remain with the individual’s family, coworkers and personnel impacted by this sad news.”
Whiting-Turner Construction declined to comment.
