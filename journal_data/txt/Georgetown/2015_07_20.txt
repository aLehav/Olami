Student employees have begun to log their hours on an electronic timesheet under a new system implemented by the Student Employment Office today.
The Hourly Student Time Tracking system was announced on June 27 in a university-wide email, then described in detail in an email on July 17. Under the new policy, student employees are required to indicate their time in, time out and break times on an electronic timesheet via the Georgetown Management System, rather than through a paper timesheet as mandated by the current policy.
Student workers can access the electronic timesheet on a mobile app called “Workday.”
SEO will host a series of sessions at the Healey Family Student Center to answer students’ questions about the new feature from July 22 to 31.
Assistant Director of Student Employment Programs Stevie Hegge said that electronic time tracking is beneficial to both employees and employers on campus.
“The new time tracking feature in [the Georgetown Management System] was put into place to make time entry easier and more accurate for hourly student employees,” Hegge wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This update is a feature that student employees and staff members have been asking for, and [the Student Employment Office] is happy to be a part of rolling out this feature on campus.”
