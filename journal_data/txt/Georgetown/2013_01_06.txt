Georgetown University professor Chuck Hagel will reportedly receive President Obama’s nomination for Secretary of Defense on Monday, according to a Washington Post article.
Hagel, a Vietnam War veteran and Republican senator from Nebraska from 1997 to 2009, has taught at Georgetown since 2009. His course is titled “21st Century Geopolitical Realities.”
Hagel has taken many positions in opposition to the majority of his party, and as a senator, he was an outspoken critic of President Bush’s handling of the Iraq War. He also praised Obama’s foreign policy during this election cycle.
Both Democrats and Republicans say that they would support the former senator, but criticism has risen from both sides since rumors regarding his nomination surfaced in December.
Hagel would be the second Republican to serve as Secretary of Defense in the Obama administration, the first being Robert Gates, who was appointed during the Bush administration. President Obama himself, through the drone program and the Bin Laden raid, has challenged the traditional stereotype of Democrats taking a dovish stance of foreign policy.
