In light of student and alumni advocacy efforts opposing his selection as the School of Foreign Service commencement speaker, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson met with university administrators and members of the Georgetown community — including undocumented students — during a three-hour visit on campus Monday.
During the meetings, which were organized by the SFS Dean’s Office, Johnson reportedly spoke with 12 students about their concerns regarding current immigration issues and his forthcoming speech. Selected by the Dean’s Office, the group consisted of graduating student leaders from a variety of backgrounds.
In an interview with The Hoya, Johnson, who will also receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the SFS on Saturday, said he found the discussion to be constructive.
“I would say that it was an informative meeting,” Johnson said. “I told them that their voices are voices that deserve to be heard, that they inform policy and that I admire and respect the passion of their commitment.”
In addition, Johnson met with administrators including SFS Dean Joel Hellman and University Provost Robert Groves.
Groves supports Johnson’s selection and honorary degree, according to Chief of Staff to the Executive Vice President and Provost Ali Whitmer.
According to Hellman, Johnson had planned on visiting campus prior to the backlash surrounding his selection to meet with students and better understand the community — a procedure that Johnson said he tries to follow for all his speaking engagements at universities.
During the meeting, Johnson said he explained to students the difficulty of balancing his personal beliefs with his professional obligations.
“When I go to the southern border and I encounter a lot of unaccompanied children who have been apprehended by our border patrol — there are hundreds of them — as a father and a Christian, I want to scoop them up and bring them home with me, but I know I can’t,” Johnson said.
Johnson said he also emphasized the importance of enforcing border control and regulations.
“There are lots of other considerations that go into border security and the enforcement of our immigration laws, and so to the fullest extent possible, I want to account for my personal convictions and my personal compassion, but I also have to enforce the law, consistent with our priorities,” Johnson said. “We don’t have an open border to illegal migration, and if we don’t prioritize those apprehended at the border, then we effectively have an open border.”
Throughout his tenure, Johnson oversaw the expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which increased the number of deportation exemptions for immigrants who entered the country illegally before their 16th birthday, and the creation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans policy, which grants deferred action to individuals who entered the country illegally but have children who are American citizens or legal permanent residents. The two acts, which resulted in several lawsuits filed against the United States by states with Republican governors, are now in litigation before the Supreme Court.
Edwin Lopez (SFS ’16), who participated in a meeting between student leaders and Johnson, said the meeting was an important step forward.
“I think the university has given both Secretary Johnson and the people who oppose him coming a place in the conversation. That’s the best thing they could have done and Secretary Johnson coming to meet people was a very positive step. At least all voices were heard and the forum was open,” Lopez said.
Johnson’s selection sparked ire across the university community. After the university announced the selection two weeks ago, advocacy group UndocuHoyas delivered a letter to the SFS Dean’s Office requesting that the university rescind the speaking invitation. The letter received support from Hoyas for Immigrant Rights, while the Georgetown University Student Association also expressed its support for the right of UndocuHoyas to express their disagreement with the selection.
A change.org petition started by Hemly Ordonez (SFS ’08) May 9 also called for the university to cancel Johnson’s speech and revoke his nomination for an honorary degree. The petition has amassed 742 signatures as of 8 p.m. Thursday.
Ordonez, who is from a mixed-status family, supported student advocates by providing her consultation as a digital strategy professional specializing in cause marketing.
According to Ordonez, the meeting between Johnson and the students is unlikely to change the emotional responses from undocumented students and their families during commencement.
“It still doesn’t take away this hurt that some of the students and their families may be experiencing during this graduation cycle. It still doesn’t take away the fear that the students experience when encountering anyone from homeland security,” Ordonez said. “One meeting does not remedy that.”
Although the university currently has no plans to rescind the invitation, Ordonez said she would like the university to apologize for selecting Johnson as the commencement speaker.
“I think that they need to issue an apology to the students and their families for causing undue harm on a weekend that’s supposed to be a celebratory weekend for all of the graduates,” Ordonez said.
Ahead of commencement, Hellman said he is in favor of students expressing their personal viewpoints and experiences symbolically during the ceremony.
“We want to highlight the achievements of undocumented students, and we don’t want to do anything to suggest that they don’t have the full support of the community,” Hellman said.
Clarification: An earlier version of this article stated that the Georgetown University Student Association supported UndocuHoyas’ letter to the SFS Dean’s Office to rescind Johnson’s invitation. GUSA’s statement supported UndocuHoyas’ expression of frustration and disappointment.

In other words, she’s a professional activist.

What to think of the 30 students who revile Johnson because he enforced the law? If you think they are not borderland brain dead, think again.

One-sided article.  Thank goodness for the comments section for balance.  There are also Hoyas “across the campus” who do not agree with the activists described in the article.

Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, United States Agency for International Development Administrator Gayle Smith, Humana CEO Bruce Broussard, National League for Nursing CEO Beverly Malone and National Geographic Social Environmental Advocate Alexandra Cousteau are among 11 speakers addressing students during Georgetown’s commencement weekend.
A total of 10 ceremonies will be held for Georgetown’s schools. Smith addressed students in the McCourt School of Public Policy yesterday evening, while Disability Rights International founder and Executive Director Eric David Rosenthal (LAW ’72) will address students graduating from the Georgetown Law Center on Sunday at 2 p.m. in the weekend’s final ceremony.
Smith said she hopes students will understand the role they can play in making the world a better place after her address.
“The graduates will have so many opportunities to do good in the world. I hope they remember what an extraordinary privilege that is, and I hope they pursue opportunities that challenge and stretch them, and that leave the world a better place than when they found it,” Smith wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Johnson will address students from the School of Foreign Service at 6 p.m. Saturday. Johnson, who previously served as general counsel of the Department of Defense from 2009 to 2012, has sought to improve the department’s ability to respond to threats and has overseen the Obama administration’s laws. Johnson will receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.
Johnson’s planned address and honorary degree conferral have been met with resistance by undocumented students and allies. As of 8 p.m. Thursday, 742 students, faculty and alumni have signed an online petition launched by Hemly Ordonez (SFS ’08) asking the university to rescind Johnson’s invitation due to the Department of Homeland Security’s role in the deportation of individuals, while 442 people have signed an online petition headed by Reed Howard (COL ’17) pushing for the university to keep Johnson as commencement speaker on the grounds of free speech as of 8 p.m. Thursday.
SFS Dean Joel Hellman said the school expected passionate responses given Johnson’s role as a public servant.
“That’s what we can hope and expect of our best public servants: that they’re trying to find ways to move issues forward in a very very complex environment where they’re going to gain a lot of opponents and supporters,” Hellman said. “We knew that any cabinet secretary we select will have deep and passionate supporters and deep and passionate opponents and that that’s part of the business of public service that we’re training and engaging students in the SFS to do.”
Hellman said Johnson’s work in the Department of Homeland Security is particularly important for graduating students from the SFS.
“The issues that Jeh Johnson is working on — migration, international and homeland security, disaster response, the Ebola crisis, a whole range of things — we felt that these were some of the most important and pressing issues globally and in the United States. And so we thought it was a good time for us to highlight the importance of those issues,” Hellman said.
Johnson — who writes his own speeches — will use input from meetings held with undocumented students and student leaders Monday in developing his remarks, according to Hellman.
“He created a remarkable environment for our undocumented students to actually talk to him, the cabinet secretary responsible for immigration policy and issues, about sharing their experiences and sharing their concerns,” Hellman said. “And I believe — and we’ll see what happens on Saturday — but I believe that’s had an impact on what he wants to talk about and how.”
Hellman said he hopes students will better value the balance between their personal beliefs and making political progress after Johnson’s remarks.
“Namely the types of moral and ethical dilemmas that a public servant has in trying to make progress in a very, very complex political environment on very difficult and sensitive issues. And often — and he discussed this in detail with students — that requires choices that he’s had to make in the course of his life that actually sometimes go against his own personal conviction but were necessary to make incremental progress in the areas that he was working on,” Hellman said.
Cousteau, who is the daughter of renowned filmmaker Jacques Yves-Cousteau, will address students in the College at 9 a.m. Saturday. Cousteau’s career has centered on environmental issues; she founded EarthEcho international, an organization that helps young people develop solutions to environmental problems, with her brother Philippe Cousteau in 2000. Cousteau also founded Blue Legacy, a charity that seeks to use storytelling to encourage environmental protection, in 2008.
College Dean Chester Gillis said Cousteau’s work with the environment makes her a particularly suitable speaker for Georgetown.
“It could be public policy, it could be from the natural sciences, it could be from a legal perspective, it could be from the historical perspective, that this is an important element of our curriculum, it’s an important element of what we do at Georgetown,” Gillis said. “So it fits academically with what we do, as well as ethically. And I do think it’s something students are very interested in.”
Gillis said he expects Cousteau’s address to leave a lasting impression on graduating students.
“I think it’s one of the most intimidating things for any speaker to be asked to give a graduation speech, because the stakes are so high, and because the expectations are so high. And we want it to be memorable, we want it to be inspiring, we want it to touch the entire audience if possible,” Gillis said. “All that’s again a tall order to do. I think she’ll do it.”
Cousteau, who will also receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree, could not be reached for comment before 8 p.m. Thursday.
Malone, the former general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing in the U.K., will address students from the School of Nursing and Health Studies at 12 p.m. Saturday. Malone has advocated on the shortage of nurses and nurse educators in the United States, as well as the importance of nursing in serving diverse communities.
Malone said her speech will focus on the importance of decision-making and leadership skills.
“I’ll be talking about sort of the fork in the road,” Malone said. “Robert Frost speaks about how it’s a nice time to have that opportunity of [asking], ‘Which way do I go?’ And the excitement that goes with it, and at the same time, the [tugging] of the heart and how should I choose which way and if I am going to make the right decision. All of those things. And leadership of course, because I think that that’s always a big part of life.”
Malone said she hopes students take away the importance of caregivers taking care of themselves.
“I always think about while you’re taking care of others, make sure you take care of yourself. And that those who take care of themselves will have more to give for people that they care for. And if you don’t take good care of yourself, you have less to give to those you are providing services to and for,” Malone said.
Malone will receive an honorary Doctor of Science degree.
Undergraduate students in the McDonough School of Business will hear from Broussard at 3 p.m. Saturday. Broussard has worked in the health care industry for almost 30 years. Broussard became President of Humana, a health insurance company, in 2011, before being appointed President and CEO in 2013. Before joining Humana, Broussard was  the chairman and CEO of McKesson Specialty/US Oncology, Inc.
Broussard said his address will focus on the importance of perseverance and service to others.
“I will share some of the highs and lows of my journey, particularly how critical the lowest points in my life were to shaping who I am today. These experiences pushed me to discover what really matters in life, they taught me about courage and how sometimes you must ‘put it all on the line’ to stand for what you believe,” Broussard wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I also discovered the power of serving others and the unmatchable reward and joy this brings: life-changing for everyone involved.”
According to Broussard, graduates from the MSB will play an important role in altering the role businesses play in society.
“It’s the business leaders of the future who will play a key role in leading a paradigm shift — to a business model that takes a more holistic approach, and one that enables companies to do well by doing good. This shift requires a new leadership approach. I believe Georgetown puts all the necessary tools in the toolbox to develop the leader characteristics necessary for this new approach,” Broussard wrote.
Broussard will receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.
Smith featured in the commencement ceremony for the McCourt School. Before her appointment as USAID director in 2015, Smith was a Special Assistant to the president of the United States and senior director for development and democracy at the U.S. National Security Council. Smith also received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.
Elena Poniatowska Amor — a journalist, novelist and poet and the first woman to receive Mexico’s National Journalism Award — will address students graduating from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences today at 9 a.m. Daniel Pink, author of The New York Times bestsellers “A Whole New Mind,” “Drive” and “To Sell is Human,” will address graduating students in the School of Continuing Studies at 3:30 p.m. today, and Penny Pritzker, the U.S. secretary of commerce since 2013, will address MBA students at 12:30 p.m. today.
Stanford University professor of medicine Kelley Michael Skeff will feature in the Georgetown School of Medicine’s commencement ceremony at 11 a.m. Sunday.
Rosenthal and World Trade Organization Appellate Body Member Zhang Yuejiao will receive honorary Doctor of Laws degrees, while Skeff will receive an honorary Doctor of Science degree. Amor, Pink and Pritzker will receive honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degrees.
Correction: This article previously stated Broussard joined Humana as CEO in 2011; Broussard joined Humana as President in 2011 and became President and CEO in 2013.

Georgetown University’s admissions yield for the Class of 2020 remained steady, increasing slightly to 48 percent from last year’s rate of 47.6 percent, as of May 2.
The admissions yield refers to the number of accepted students who choose to enroll in the university.
The target enrollment for each class is 1,580 in accordance with the 2010 Campus Plan agreement. This year, out of the 3,276 students offered places in the Class of 2020, 1,574 accepted.
Due to the expected fluctuations in acceptances of admissions offers because of deferrals or withdrawals of acceptances, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said around 50 students will come off the waitlist and be offered admission.
Early action yield, which came in this year at 51 percent, tends to vary from the regular acceptance yield. This year, early action yield came in lower than last year’s rate of 56 percent.
At 52 percent, the yield for those not requesting financial aid was higher by 11 percent compared with those requesting financial aid, whose yield stands at 41 percent. Georgetown commits itself to meeting full demonstrated financial need for students requesting financial aid.
Deacon attributed this difference to the disparity in ability of various socio-economic classes to afford Georgetown’s tuition of around $48,000 per year, before room, board and fees are included.
“If you were to look at demographics, in many ways what you see here is a microcosm of what’s happening in the country. It does say that Georgetown truly is a national university and it does reflect that changes of the country. It is still skewed toward the more affluent, because of the price tag and because the highest-achieving population is the more affluent population,” Deacon said. “That’s why the pressure is on all of us to try to level the playing field and provide more upward mobility for students of lower-income areas.”
The yield for the 150 students admitted into the Georgetown Scholarship Program, the goal of which is to level that playing field by assisting students receiving scholarships, stands at 67.31 percent. GSP Program Director Missy Foy attributed the high yield rate to the benefits provided by the program, which assists many first-generation college students.
“We are very pleased with the results,” Foy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We’re increasingly hearing that GSP students’ enhanced scholarships as well as the assurances of a robust program make a significant difference in college choice.”
Additionally, Georgetown’s yield fluctuated in various minority groups. For black students, the yield stands at 40 percent, in the Asian-American community yield is at 37 percent and in the Latino and Hispanic community yield is at 46 percent.
Despite the overall lower yield for minority groups, Deacon said the number of applications the university received from these groups increased.
“The applicant pool itself was a little over 20,000, which is up about 3 percent from last year, but it was up primarily from students of color,” Deacon said. “The majority population, which is the white population, is continuing to go down and is being replaced actually, more than being offset, by the increasing students of color.”
According to Deacon, the slight increase in overall yield from years past is due in part to Georgetown’s location. The yield has increased by 5 percent  since 2009.
“The Georgetown brand is getting better,” Deacon said. “I think that we are situated in a very desirable location and essentially we are the school to apply to.”
Deacon added that social media as well as the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program’s open houses for admitted students has helped increase yield.
“At the end of the day, the GAAP open house has really sealed the deal for a lot of people,” Deacon said.
Deacon added that yield tends to vary by geographic location, which is due to factors such as students with legacy status or recruited athletes because these students tend to come from closer geographic regions.
“California is by far the largest state in terms of applicant pool. New York is the second and New Jersey is the third,” Deacon said. “But our yield rate is better in New Jersey and New York than it is in California.”
Despite the increase from last year, Deacon said Georgetown might compete better if the university were able to dedicate more money toward helping those in the middle income range. Deacon attributed the deficit in this population to the prospective students’ financial aid need that might not be covered by Georgetown.
“If there were a place we would really need to work at to really do much better, it would probably be in that middle-income population where financial aid is a particularly difficult issue,” Deacon said. “Would we compete better if we had more money? I think probably, we would.”

A total of seven students — including a record four students from Georgetown College  — will be honored as valedictorians and Dean’s Medal recipients for their GPAs this weekend.
Adam Barton (COL ’16), a Spanish and Portuguese studies major with a minor in education, inquiry and justice, Adam Jacobson (COL ’16), a computer science and math major, Chandini Jha (COL ’16), a women’s and gender studies and government double major and Grace Funsten (COL ’16), a classical languages and French double major all tied with perfect 4.0 GPAs to be named as valedictorians for the College.
Barton and Jha will give a joint speech in the College’s Tropaia ceremony today after they submitted a speech to the College Dean’s Office for consideration.
Rahul Kaul (SFS ’16), an international economics major, and Jeff Haake (NHS ’16), a human science major, will both be awarded Dean’s Medals for their 3.99 GPAs. The School of Foreign Service and School of Nursing and Health Studies do not name valedictorians.
Jack Harrington (MSB ’16), a marketing and finance major with a minor in sociology, maintained a 3.99 GPA to be named as valedictorian from the MSB.
Barton said the four-way tie in the college is representative of the school’s academic culture.
“It wasn’t a fight to the death at the end to find the one valedictorian or the one salutatorian, but rather we have four people who are all carrying the banners together in some combination, which I think is pretty reflective of the Georgetown experience,” Barton said.
Jha said her and Barton’s speech will reflect on the last four years with a more casual structure.
“We met with [Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J.], and that’s why our speech is — we all agreed we wanted to look at reflecting over the four years — a lot of discernment.  The format of the speech is essentially a conversation between two friends — which it is,” Jha said.
According to Harrington, his speech will focus on both academics and business ethics.
“My draft right now is about intellectual curiosity …  and about ethics in business, which are two topics I think that MSB kind of hits home and that I think are valuable as we all leave Georgetown and go into these different fields, whether it’s banking or consulting or marketing or whatnot,” Harrington said.
Jha said it is important for students to find enjoyment in even the seemingly boring moments on campus.
“I would say my advice would be to really enjoy every moment even though you might sit there and wonder what you’re doing,” Jha said. “I think that’s what helped me a lot in my classes. Even though sometimes you’re there in classes and you really want to go check your email for the 150 clubs you’re involved in as a Georgetown student, per the stereotype, sometimes it’s better to be present in that moment and actually pay attention.” Jha said.
Funsten said her time at Georgetown helped her discover an often underappreciated and misunderstood department in classics.
“A lot of people don’t know what it is. I’ve had a lot of people come up to me and say, ‘Oh, classical literature?’ And I explain, ‘No, Latin and Greek.’ It’s a lot bigger than people think, and it’s a pretty tight-knit group, which is really nice,” Funsten said.
Barton said he has learned the value of perseverance and optimism on his path to becoming valedictorian.
“Everything won’t necessarily work out just because you take a step back, but every time things seem to be falling apart, they’re going to be put back together in some way, even if it’s in a way that you don’t like, even if it’s a way that’s scary. But through that you’re going to learn something,” Barton said.
Kaul said knowing he could not achieve a perfect 4.0 GPA after his freshman fall ended up helping him on his road to earning a Dean’s Medal.
“After I got an A-minus freshman fall, I actually was relieved of any pressure to have a perfect GPA and just sought out to do the best work possible in interesting classes,” Kaul wrote in an email to The Hoya.
According to Haake, his success stemmed not from a desire for good grades, but to learn as much as possible.
“Initially, it was like, ‘OK I want to get these good grades so that I can go to medical school,’ but then it really did turn into, ‘I want to get as much out of my education as I can,’ — that’s something that I think you’ll definitely come to appreciate,” Haake said. “And a lot of the times those things do come in parallel.
Taking a lot from the class, learning a lot from the class, and then doing well and being successful in the class, and actually learning the information from the subject.”
Haake said a clearer vision of what he wanted to do after college — driven by a year off between his freshman and sophomore years spent volunteering in a Palestinian refugee camp — helped motivate him academically.
“I do feel I think sophomore year on, sort of coming back from that experience I definitely do think that my academic rigor, discipline, whatever you want to call it, was driven by sort of this future idea that I knew what I wanted to do in terms of medicine and health care,” Haake said. “I knew that in order to make the biggest impact I would just have to work my hardest from here on out, and I was OK with that.”
Harrington said approaching his education with an open mind helped him academically.
“I’m pretty open to different subjects and stuff like that, and I’d say intellectually curious. I did marketing and finance, which are kind of two opposite disciplines in the MSB but I didn’t really feel the need to shoehorn myself into one, or I don’t think I’m really stronger at one or the other,” Harrington said.
According to Jacobson, academics were not the most valuable part of his Georgetown experience; the people at Georgetown were.
“Honestly, I’d say it was the people in general. The people who applied and get accepted to Georgetown [are] a lot of very, very interesting people. People who are fun to talk to, have classes with, intellectually interesting to talk with,” Jacobson said.
Hoya Staff Writers Jess Kelham-Hohler, Kshithij Shrinath and Emily Tu contributed reporting.

Student leaders and university administrators in the Georgetown Community Partnership expect to announce the 2017 Campus Plan’s framework — which will include plans to prioritize student housing renovations — for public consultation in early June.
The draft plan is set to be submitted to the Office of Zoning by July 1, before the final plan is submitted to the Office of Zoning Sept. 1. In Washington, D.C., campus plans are the formal structure for universities in residential areas to plan anticipated growth and development. This new plan will last until 2037.
The GCP serves as a forum for consensus-based decision-making among university administrators, students and members of the community to develop the framework for the 20-year plan. Georgetown University Student Association President Enushe Khan (MSB ’17), Advisory Neighborhood Council 2E Commissioner Kendyl Clausen (SFS ’16) and Advisory Neighborhood Council 2E Commissioner Reed Howard (SFS ’17) serve on the GCP.
The GCP was formed in 2012 as part of the implementation of the 2010 Campus Plan, following a lengthy legal battle between several Georgetown resident associations and the university during the plan’s negotiations.
Khan  said student leaders have a framework for an agreement with university administrators and neighborhood representatives for the draft of the plan, which will focus heavily on student housing and renovations.
“For students, we have made it very clear that our number one priority in terms of housing is renovations. That is something that we are working toward getting into an agreement,” Khan said. “It is essentially saying that renovations will be a priority and that the university’s emphasis will be to create quality housing on campus, which is a win for students, so that students then choose to live on campus, which is then a win for neighbors.”
In addition to housing, the campus plan will also aim to create new campus facilities, including a student life corridor with restaurants and study spaces for students, which will run from the Leavey Center to Village C West, new academic spaces, an updated Yates Field House and recreation fields. The plan will also continue to upgrade the bus turnaround by McDonough Arena, seek to minimize the impact of buses travelling through neighborhood streets and enhance pedestrian walkways.
Khan said GUSA will co-sponsor a public information session with university and neighborhood leaders to share the plan’s framework with students and community members in early June. The university will also announce a period for the public to comment on the plan and submit ideas or concerns, which could be incorporated into the draft in June.
Khan emphasized that the plan in its current stage is not final.
“Right now, nothing is final. We have a framework for agreement and the next step is to show what we have been discussing to the various constituencies, to the students, to the neighbors. We want to share what the GCP has been discussing,” Khan said. “After that, once we have public comment, we can go into the finalizing stage where GUSA will be there to answer any and all questions.”
Clausen said renovations are expected to be a part of the final agreement.
“Housing renovations have been a priority for students during the Campus Planning process. An agreement is starting to take shape as the process nears its conclusion, and I am happy to report that renovations are looking like a main priority in the agreement,” Clausen wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Assistant Vice President for Strategic Communications Stacy Kerr said the administration is working to prioritize renovations.
“The university also agrees that doing renovations is an important priority,” Kerr said. “Renovating on-campus housing is consistent with what students have been telling us that they want to live on campus, but they want to live on campus not because of a physical location but they want it to be attractive, because they want good housing.”
The summer housing study authorized by the university will highlight the campus locations in need of most renovations, according to Khan. Administrators and students will take university contractors from architecture firm Ayers Saint-Gross and subconsultant Brailsford & Dunlavey on tours of campus to survey dorms, who will then provide feedback on how to maximize campus space and improve student life.
According to Khan, junior and senior housing are in greatest need of attention, particularly Henle Village, Village A and Alumni Square.
Khan said the study is important to show the flaws of the last campus plan, which prioritized new construction over renovations of existing student housing.
“Because of the last campus plan, to meet that bed requirement, we focused so much on building new dorms that all that money, hundreds of millions of dollars, was spent to build new beds and dorms,” Khan said. “That was money that should have been spent on ongoing renovations that need to occur that just didn’t because the university’s focus was on building new beds and maintaining existing ones.”
Kerr said renovations are part of the master planning goal to create more vibrant student life on campus.
“If we’re renovating housing and prioritizing junior and senior housing, that is consistent with what we’ve been saying about creating these corridors for student life and making it attractive to live and study on campus,” Kerr said.
Vice President for Government Relations and Community Engagement Chris Murphy (GRD ’98) said the GCP has given student leaders an opportunity to advocate for student concerns in drafting the new plan.
“Working through the Georgetown Community Partnership, students have worked closely with university administrators and neighborhood leaders to develop a thoughtful framework for the next campus plan.  The process has helped us identify our shared interests and a promising way to move forward together,” Murphy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Student leadership — whether serving on the GCP, as ANC Commissioners, or participating in regular meetings with senior university leaders — has been critical to getting us to where we are today.”
Kerr said the final plan would show the success of the GCP model.
“The elements of this campus plan are the result of consensus-based planning. It’s a unique model that no one else in the country is doing,” Kerr said. “It’s really been about advocating and finding alignments about where the university and the neighborhood and the students all share priorities.”

In a commencement ceremony featuring the Qatari royal family and main campus officials, the School of Foreign Service in Qatar graduated its eighth and largest cohort May 5.
The graduating class numbered 68 students, with 44 women and 24 men receiving the same Bachelor of Science in foreign service degrees conferred upon students at the D.C. campus, with available majors in international politics, international economics, international history and culture and politics.
Her Excellency Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the sister of the ruling emir of Qatar, delivered the commencement address at the ceremony. Sheikha Al Mayassa is a prominent art collector who serves as the chairperson of Qatar Museums and co-chair of the SFS-Q’s Joint Advisory Board. Three of her siblings in the royal family attended the School of Foreign Service in Qatar.
“Already, your fellow Hoyas have made a mark in Qatar and worldwide,” Sheikha Al Mayassa said in her address. “Tonight you join Georgetown’s extensive orbit of graduates.”
In the speech, Sheikha Al Mayassa referenced the impact left by SFS-Q graduates, offering the upcoming FIFA World Cup to be held in Qatar in 2022 as an example. The chairman of Qatar’s bid to win the World Cup — a hotly debated event featuring allegations of bribery and migrant worker abuse — graduated from SFS-Q.
“If a Hoya could bring the FIFA World Cup to Qatar, I have no doubt you can achieve great things,” Sheikha Al Mayassa said. “No matter where you go, you will always be a part of Qatar Foundation and Qatar’s narrative.”
Officials from the D.C. campus were on hand to participate in the ceremony. SFS Dean Joel Hellman, in his first commencement ceremony since assuming the position last July, presented the candidates and University President John J. DeGioia conferred the degrees on the 68 graduates.
“During your time on campus, you’ve come to know the practice of pilgrimage, the commitment to a journey,” DeGioia said in his closing reflections at the event. “We celebrate today a significant moment in your lives, the beginning of great things to come. Congratulations on taking the next step in your journey.”
The ceremony was the final commencement presided by SFS-Q Dean Gerd Nonneman, who assumed the position in 2011 and will step down in June, returning to the faculty as a professor of international relations. Senior Associate Dean of the SFS James Reardon-Anderson will replace Nonneman and serve from July 2016 to July 2018.
Last February, when the school celebrated its 10th anniversary, Nonneman reflected on the impact of SFS-Q graduates in an interview with The Hoya.
“The Jesuit enterprise has always been about going out there and engaging on the frontiers,” Nonneman said. “In the broader debate that goes on within Qatar about how they want to take that society forward … we’re a small fish, but I think we’re a small and exquisitely formed fish that actually has an impact which is bigger than its numbers imply.”

Counseling and Psychiatric Services will form a support group for students returning from a medical leave of absence as part of a series of recommendations from Georgetown’s Mental Health Advisory Board seeking to improve the medical leave of absence process, according to a campus-wide email Wednesday.
Currently, students returning to campus from medical leaves of absence are required to check in with Health Education Services before their arrival and to arrange requests for academic accommodations with the Academic Resource Center individually.
Will Emery (COL ’19), who will co-chair the MHAB next year, said the new CAPS services will better help students during a particularly challenging time.
“There are few situations more challenging for a student than a voluntary MLOA. It is great to see CAPS offering students avenues of support when they return,” Emery wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Returning students will also be able to provide CAPS with their preferred support outreach group — such as Campus Ministry or deans — to reach out to them when they return to campus.
In addition, CAPS will develop a document to support students on MLOA in finding care at home.
Director of Residential Ministry Rev. Jonathan Rice, who co-chairs the MHAB, said the changes are designed to better support students throughout the MLOA process.
“We hope the recommendations we’ve made will help students from the time they decide to take a medical leave, throughout their care, until they successfully re-integrate back into campus life,” Rice wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Emeritus Counseling Director at the University of Delaware Dr. John Bishop will also publish a report on Georgetown’s MLOA processes in the next two weeks after consulting students who took MLOA, deans and university mental health professionals this year.
The MHAB has made additional recommendations this year, including changes to peer-oriented student support services, sexual assault protocol, deans’ efforts to better support students and services provided by HES — including the Stall Seat Journal — and feedback mechanisms for HES and other campus services.
In that vein, during its first year, the MHAB created an online client satisfaction survey for students to submit feedback to CAPS in lieu of the existing paper form in the waiting room.
The MHAB, which comprises eight students and eight adult members from the community, was formed this year by the Division of Student Affairs to ensure an ongoing conversation about mental health, according to Rice. Department heads from services related to mental health, such as CAPS, were chosen to serve on the board, while former Georgetown University Student Association Undersecretary of Mental Health Ben Johnson (NHS ’17) nominated students to serve on the board.
Rice said MHAB is committed to improving both mental health resources and the campus climate toward mental health.
“The Mental Health Advisory Board is a newly formed team of students and professionals committed to evaluating mental health support organizations, student mental health organizations and changing the conversation about mental health on campus in a more positive direction,” Rice wrote.

Just a note, the following is not true: 
“Currently, students returning to campus from medical leaves of absence are required to check in with Health Education Services before their arrival and to arrange requests for academic accommodations with the Academic Resource Center individually.”
Most medical leaves are taken on a case-by-case basis! Students work with their deans and sometimes with CAPS or Case Management staff upon return to campus.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) released a draft of a potential District constitution May 6 that delineates the steps for elevating the nation’s capital from a federal district to a state tentatively called New Columbia.
The New Columbia Statehood Commission, a facet of the D.C. Council, will hold a convention June 17 and 18 to finalize the constitution before a citywide ballot in November to petition Congress and the incoming president to establish the District as the nation’s 51st state.
In her remarks from Lincoln Cottage, where President Abraham Lincoln drafted his Emancipation Proclamation and spent his summers during the Civil War, Bowser highlighted the plight of District residents who argue a lack of Congressional representation relegates them to a second-class status.
“We chose this site because of the significance of Lincoln being here and writing the document that freed people across the United States,” Bowser said. “It’s a fitting reminder that we are not fully free. We don’t have full democracy in the District of Columbia.”
Advocates for D.C. statehood argue that the District deserves full autonomy and representation in Congress as Washington boasts a population of 670,000, greater than either Vermont or Wyoming. D.C. residents contribute more in federal taxes than 22 states.
Under the new constitution, the city would become its own state, excluding federal land devoted to the United States Capitol, the White House, the Supreme Court Building, Union Station, the Kennedy Center, the Navy Yard and Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling.
Executive power would be vested in a governor rather than a mayor, who will nominate judges to form a judicial branch. The city’s current 13-member D.C. Council would become representatives in a new legislative body, the House of Delegates, and residents would elect two senators and a representative to serve at the federal level.
Currently, Congress has final oversight over the District’s laws and the distribution of its tax revenue as the seat of the federal government. District residents vote for a Congressional representative, currently Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), who sits in the House of Representatives but does not vote on legislation.
Congress has occasionally used its legal authority in Washington, D.C., to turn the District into a proxy battleground over politically divisive issues. Earlier this year Congress changed budget allocations to prevent the full legalization and taxation of recreational marijuana, despite 64 percent popular support in a referendum vote on the issue.
Kotryna Jukneviciute (COL ’18), executive officer of the Georgetown University Student Association senate, said D.C. statehood should be addressed with a bipartisan approach.
“It’s ultimately a civil rights issue. You have 700,000 people in the District of Columbia who don’t have a voice,” Jukneviciute said. “We have people of very different political opinions in our office, and what’s really important to understand is that everyone in the office is behind this. Regardless of political views, we try to take the politics out of such a controversial issue and try to make it not as controversial, because it’s ultimately people having a voice and a say in what goes on.”
The push for statehood has encountered resistance from conservatives, including former presidential contender Governor John Kasich (R-Ohio), who said D.C. statehood would skew the balance of political parties.
“What it really gets down to, if you want to be honest, is because they know that’s just more votes in the Democratic Party,” Kasich said in an interview with The Washington Post.
Democratic presidential candidates former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have both expressed support for D.C. statehood. Sanders was one of 16 co-sponsors of the New Columbia Admission Action, a bill initiated last June to make the District a state.
Clinton penned an editorial for the Washington Informer published May 11 demonstrating solidarity for statehood.
“As president, I will be a vocal champion for D.C. statehood,” Clinton wrote. “Washingtonians are Americans, too, and it’s time they had a say in their own status.”
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has not yet taken a definitive stance on the issue, though he stressed the difficulties present in the push for statehood.
“I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C.,” Trump said to The Washington Post. “I don’t have a position on it yet. I’d like to study it.”
Cheryl Liu (COL ’19), secretary of GUSA’s D.C. statehood body, a branch formed this year, emphasized the need to consolidate the constitution in order to make statehood a reality, regardless of the presidential election outcome.
“From the point of view of the federal relations office, we’re much more focused on the issue at a local level,” Liu said. “While we obviously do follow national politics and pay close attention to what candidates are saying, that’s not really our focus, and regardless of who is elected in November, if the referendum passes we hope that we can present that package to the next Congress.”
Liu highlighted the relevance of the issue to Georgetown and the opportunity it provides to students to become actively involved in the wider D.C. community.
“We talk a lot about being a school about social justice and getting involved in the community, and I think that as Georgetown students, we are in a very good position to advocate for the rights of the people around us,” Liu said. “I think it’s only right that we as a school very focused on social justice take this issue under our wing.”
