Secretary of State John Kerry and actor and environmentalist Adrian Grenier joined youth environmental leaders in Gaston Hall to advocate for increased awareness and regulation of the world’s oceans as part of the “Our Ocean, One Future Leadership Summit”, held in parallel with the third annual “Our Ocean Conference” held throughout the District on Thursday and Friday.
The School of Foreign Service, U.S. Department of State and Sustainable Oceans Alliance sponsored the “Our Ocean, One Future Leadership Summit,” which aimed to engage the next generation of leaders in a dialogue about ocean conservation. The “Our Ocean Conference “was started in 2014 by the State Department to help develop ways to protect the world’s oceans.
The conference hosted a series of events across the District, including speeches by actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Prince of Wales.
Kerry highlighted the vital role the ocean plays in sustaining the world’s population in a discussion with Grenier moderated by SFS Dean Joel Hellman on Friday.
Grenier founded the Lonely Whale Foundation in 2015 to raise awareness for protecting the oceans and marine life.
“We have almost 50 percent of the planet dependent on food from the ocean, and 12 percent of the world’s workforce depends on the oceans for their livelihood,” Kerry said. “This is life and death. This is national security. It is international security.”
Other summit speakers included Judith G. Garber, U.S. Department of State acting assistant secretary for cceans and international environmental and scientific affairs; underwater exploration robot manufacturer OpenROV founder David Lang; and environmental nonprofit the Nature Conservancy Global Managing Director for Oceans Maria Damanaki.
A selected group of 150 students from colleges around the country participated in the summit through breakout sessions on topics including “Science, Research, the University and Problem Solving” and “Moving Policy Forward.” In a statement to The Hoya, Sustainable Ocean Alliance Co-Presidents France Farrell (COL ’17) and Mimi Troxel (COL ’17) said the breakout sessions were key to reaching the summit’s purpose of engaging young leaders.
“In our minds, the breakout sessions were perhaps the most powerful portion of the summit because we were truly able to see innovative and collaborative discussions between speakers and participants,” Farrell and Troxel said. “Giving the leaders of tomorrow a platform to get together and talk about today’s ocean issues, on a global scale, provides promise for the future.”
Both Grenier and Kerry stressed the importance of security and enforcement regarding protected waters and the need to eliminate illegal fishing activity. President Barack Obama announced Thursday that he would create the Atlantic Ocean’s first U.S. marine monument off the coast of New England to help protect the area.
“I’d like the next administration to increase the amount of water space by tenfold at least. I also think it’s one thing to designate an area as protected but I think we also need to look at how are we going to make sure that we actually have areas that are being taken care of,” Grenier said.
Kerry said climate change deniers are the biggest challenge he and other politicians advocating for environmental issues face.
“We still have people who have run for president of the United States who deny it,” Kerry said. “We are in a race against time, that’s what science tells us. Remember the old saying, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts.”
A shift in mindset is a necessary next step toward advancing the ocean protection cause, according to Grenier.
“We need to change who we are as a culture, we need to re-evaluate how we imagine our future to be,” Grenier said. “We have to recognize that we are part of this interconnected global community and we have to act accordingly.”
Kerry said while significant work remains to create sustainable use of the oceans, the world today is on the brink of making important steps in environmental protection and sustainable living.
“When we started this conference two years ago, only 10 countries in the world had signed onto the port state Measures Agreement and you needed 25 countries in order to make a law,” Kerry said. “Now today as we come here again, we have 60 who have signed up for the port state measures.”
Port state measures are legal tools to protect local ports from illegal fishing.
According to Grenier, ocean conservation benefits a wide variety of populations.
“If we change what we value away from materialism and conspicuous consumption and toward what is really valuable, the preciousness of the planet, the future that we all can enjoy will be that much better,” Grenier said.
Before the discussion with Kerry and Grenier, a panel discussed the current state of ocean conservation policy. The panelists included Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for International Development Cooperation and Climate of Sweden Isabella Lövin, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship of Argentina Susana Malcorra, climate change conference COP 21 President Ségolène Royal and Panama’s Vice President and Minister of Foreign Affairs Isabel de Saint Malo.
Saint Malo said young people must take action to protect the oceans.
“This is an effort we will only overcome by a coalition: a coalition of youth, of private enterprises, of student societies,” Saint Malo said. “I ask you to take your passion as young leaders, and to mobilize ever more people in this quest that is really a need for sustaining our communities.”
Lövin said protecting the ocean was an urgent issue and required instant action.
“We need to have more cooperation, we need to take leadership on this issue because we can’t do it later,” Lövin said. “Later it would be absolutely too late.”
Sohil Shah, a student at at the University of North Carolina and a summit attendee, said the event was inspiring.
“It was awesome to meet Secretary Kerry and Adrien Grenier, and really just understand from them what we can do as the next generation because as they move on, it’s our turn,” Shah said.
Christian Mesa (COL ’19), who attended Friday’s portion of the summit, said the event imparted upon him the need for immediate conservation action.
“A big problem we have in our system is the fact that our government tends to wait until a crisis is serious to deal with it instead of dealing with problems ahead of time,” Mesa said. “Secretary Kerry and Mr. Grenier underscored the fact that we need to do something now about climate change, not in 20 years when our cities are underwater.”

The Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department apprehended and arrested a suspect for third-degree sexual assault on the 3300 block of Prospect Street on Saturday at around 1 a.m.
The arrest came after a series of four sexual assaults in the Georgetown area reported between Aug. 3 and Sept. 12. The Aug. 3 assault targeted a Georgetown University Medical Center student and occurred on the 1600 block of 35th Street NW, with the perpetrator carrying a knife. An assault targeting an undergraduate student occurred Aug. 24 as the student was entering her residence in Village A. Another student was assaulted Sept. 6 on Potomac and N Streets NW. A fourth student was sexually assaulted on 35th and N Streets NW.
Georgetown University Police Department Chief Jay Gruber said although the apprehended suspect matches some of the descriptions given by victims of these assaults, it is still unknown whether he was definitely involved with all the assaults.
According to a statement by MPD, 34-year-old Sergio Waldo Velazquez-Cardozo from Falls Church, Va., was detained after Second District police officers observed him closely following and groping a woman around 1 a.m. Saturday. Gruber sent a notice to all students that afternoon.
“At approximately 1:03 a.m., members of the Second District were oheightened patrol in the area, when they observed a female walking on the sidewalk. They immediately observed the suspect following closely behind her,” the statement reads. “Within seconds, the suspect ran up behind the victim and groped her. The victim ran off, as did the suspect. Officers were able to stop the suspect and he was subsequently placed under arrest.”
The Georgetown community has seen increased MPD and GUPD patrols after being notified of the four assaults in the past two months involving students, which are currently being investigated by MPD’s Criminal Investigations Division Sexual Assault Unit.
“[Velazquez-Cardozo] matches the description of a couple of the assaults,” Gruber said. “We think that this person is responsible for several of them, but we’ll have to wait and see to see if the crimes continue.”
Although there has been an uptick in reports of assaults involving students, Gruber said he does not believe there is an increase in danger to students or members of the Georgetown community because the four recent assaults are believed to be connected.
“I’m not particularly concerned about the uptick in general,” Gruber said. “I think sometimes you get a peak in these types of crimes and sometimes you have nothing for a long period of time; there’s no real pattern to it. You have one perpetrator doing this and committing multiple assaults, so you see a big spike. It’s not like we have a rash of these things from multiple people, but one person can cause the statistics to rise.”
With regards to on- and off-campus security, Gruber said there has been an increase in patrol officers by both GUPD and MPD following the series of incidents.
“We have a lot of tools already in place, but when we do see an uptick in crimes like this, we take more of our human resources and put them in the areas of concern,” Gruber said. “We’re still going to keep our heightened posture in the neighborhood and the Second District Metropolitan Police Department is going to keep their heightened posture as well.”
According to GUPD crime log archives, there have been six sexual assaults involving students so far in 2016, including the four recent attacks. There were three reported assaults in 2015 and four in 2014.
Health Education Services and Sexual Assault Response and Prevention Services Associate Director Jen Luettel Schweer said she believes the increase in reported assaults may reflect a more comfortable environment for survivors who want to report an attack.
“When reports go up, we think that it is a positive thing, because it means that more people are aware of the systems and resources that are in place to respond to the needs of survivors,” Schweer said.
Georgetown University Student Association Safety and Sexual Assault Team Policy Chair Maddy Moore (SFS ’17) said an increased number of students has voiced concerns about sexual assault.
“I have noticed many students asking questions and raising concerns about the recent campus alerts, demonstrating that this is an issue the community cares about and wants to address,” Moore wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Moore added that GUSA is planning to facilitate a discussion with GUPD leadership ito better inform GUSA.
“Over the next month, GUSA is hoping to host a GUPD Roundtable with the Department’s leadership to learn more about the current climate and what changes have been made,” Moore wrote.
Apart from increasing the number of patrol officers, Gruber also encouraged students to use tools Georgetown offers such as Safe Rides, the LiveSafe app and the police escort service to ensure their own safety in a campuswide email. Additionally, Gruber advised students to take personal precautions when travelling between campus and the Georgetown neighborhood.
“Use common sense. If you’re going to be walking from campus and into the neighborhoods or vice-versa, try to do it with a friend or a roommate. Walking in groups is much safer than walking by yourself,” Gruber said. “Also, walk on established routes. Don’t cut through alleys or areas that aren’t well-traveled. Stick to the main streets. There are usually cars driving by and just much more visibility on those main streets.”

Georgetown Scholarship Program students can now receive all Counseling and Psychiatric Services mental health resources for free, and schedule appointments with a CAPS staff psychologist specifically assigned to supporting GSP students as of the beginning of this academic year through a partnership funded by an anonymous donor this summer.
GSP students who visit CAPS psychologists or request a psychiatric follow-up will be able to bill the recently reduced appointment fees of $10 and $15 respectively directly to GSP.
CAPS staff psychologist Daniel Phillip has been appointed as GSP’s in-house wellness advisor, or counselor, and is available for GSP students during office hours Monday, Tuesday and Friday afternoons in the GSP office. Phillip is one of 15 staff psychologists at CAPS and will assume other responsibilities as a staff psychologist outside of his GSP work.
Previously, GSP students could place a request for a grant from GSP to cover a medical expense.
GSP Program Director Melissa Foy (COL ’03) said the donation will also provide CAPS with resources to improve response times and flexibility for all students.
“It is important to note that this donation was hopefully a little helpful to CAPS in allowing them to hire another person,” Foy said. “We [GSP] have him for 10 hours of his time, they [CAPS] get the other 30 hours, but their budget was also increased to hire more folks in general. That is really important for students to know. If you went in the past and told there was a wait, those issues are not going unnoticed.”
The hiring of Phillip was made possible by the donation, according to CAPS Director Phil Meilman. Foy declined to provide the value of the donation.
“[Phillip’s] presence helps make CAPS a more user-friendly service, and it gives us the ability to reach out to an important campus constituency,” Meilman wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Foy said the donation will help alleviate stresses about finances that GSP students face, particularly around medical expenses.
“Georgetown is a stressful place,” Foy said. “If you look at the national stressors of college students, financial is the number one or number two consistently.”
The donation came in the form of a current-use gift — a donation that can be used at the discretion of the university. GSP worked with CAPS, the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, the Division of Student Affairs and Health Education Services to determine the best way to use the donor’s contribution.
“[The donor] approached me and he said he’d like to make a gift that will help alleviate some of the mental health issues that our students encounter,” Foy said. “I went on a wild goose chase and tried to figure out how to use the funds with my lack of expertise.”
Foy said she ultimately decided to follow the CMEA’s model of offering students a trained professional who becomes part of the program staff. CAPS Assistant Director John Wright currently spends a day a week supporting students at CMEA as part of a program launched last year.
“[Wright] is embedded within the fabric of this program so students are seeing him as a member of our team which I think was really important to everybody,” Foy said.
Foy said students who have had negative experiences with CAPS will notice improvements in its services.
“If you had a bad experience with CAPS in terms of waiting in the past, or getting in, I think that we are going to see improvements in those areas by the increased bandwidth and capacity of their staff,” Foy said.
Phillip said his presence in the GSP office is intended to help establish trust with students.
“Whenever I spend time in the GSP lounge or at the front desk or attend some of the social events, I humanize the role of mental health practitioner. This reduces any hesitation students may have regarding help-seeking, as students can drop by and talk informally,” Phillip wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Bserat Ghebremicael (MSB ’17), a GSP student, said Phillip’s office hours in the GSP office provide students with a more intimate experience than visiting the CAPS office in Darnall Hall.
“Having Dr. P come to the GSP office offers students a much more comfortable space to share thoughts in,” Ghebremicael said. “GSP itself is a home away from home and over the past 11 years, the staff have done an incredible job in keeping GSP as a safe space for students. Bringing Dr. P here allows us to maintain that.”
Correction: This article previously stated there are six CAPS staff psychologists; there are 15.

While Sept. 13 saw Georgetown reclaim a spot as the No. 20 top college in the U.S. News and World Report’s 2017 national universities rankings, it was absent from the institution’s list of best colleges for veterans — which saw Georgetown in first place just two years ago and 16th last year — due to a change in ranking methodology.
The U.S. News and World Report rankings evaluated data collected from universities based on 15 measures of academic quality, with graduation and retention rates carrying the most weight in the methodology at 30 percent of overall ranking.
Georgetown clinched No.  20 in a three-way tie with Emory University and the University of California at Berkeley. This moved Georgetown up one spot from last year among national universities, along with No. 34 among best value schools and No. 10 in high school counselor rankings. Last year, Georgetown ranked eighth in high school counselor rankings.
According to U.S. News Chief Data Strategist Robert Morse, Georgetown remained relatively stable in its national ranking. However, the implementation of an update based on the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education — the most widely accepted classification of higher education data — resulted in 12 percent of ranked schools moving from regional rankings to national rankings, or vice
versa, compared to last year.
To be eligible for placement in the list, universities must be certified for the GI Bill, which finances tuition for service members and veterans, and participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program, which provides additional funds available to supplement the GI Bill. Universities must further enroll a minimum of 20 students using GI Bill benefits to qualify.
Veterans Office Director LeNaya Hezel said despite Georgetown’s 120 undergraduate students’ receiving GI Bill benefits last year, a change in U.S. News’ process for collecting and submitting data and an error in submitting the data for 2017 resulted in an incorrect number of students not being recorded with Georgetown’s submission. This resulted in Georgetown’s failing to meet the 20-person threshold needed to qualify for the ranking in the data used by U.S. News.
“I am disappointed in this year’s U.S. News & World Report process of collecting information and their decision, but it is important to focus on our campus community contributions to supporting our service members, veterans, and their families and our efforts in advancing our services and programs,” Hezel wrote in an email to The Hoya. “What has been consistent is Georgetown’s commitment to provide opportunities to military-connected students to pursue higher education at any point in their career.”
When asked about Georgetown’s absence in the rankings for best colleges for veterans, Morse did not respond to a request for comment.
Currently in the overall best colleges rankings, Princeton University tops the list, followed by Harvard University and a two-way tie for third between the University of Chicago and Yale University.
Morse said U.S. News further changed the way it factors class size — a metric considered into its rankings — by creating one index to better reflect varying class sizes across campus.
“Research shows that smaller classes foster a productive and positive learning environment,” Morse wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This change enabled us to take full advantage of all the class size data schools provide, while still rewarding schools that make an effort to better serve their students with smaller classes.”
Morse extolled the ranking as a definitive measure of academic quality, which can guide families in making the decision when selecting a college.
“In addition to considering factors like location, cost, course offerings and activities, families should pay close attention to graduation and retention rates,” Morse wrote. “The Best Colleges rankings measure academic excellence, and we believe that students and their families should strongly consider academic quality when choosing a college.”
Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon disputed the veracity of U.S. News’ findings, arguing it neglects to examine outcome-driven data, such as student incomes one decade after graduation or the number of leading alumni in an industry.
“Generally we believe that the way U.S. News produces its ranking is essentially a lagging indicator,” Deacon said. “I don’t happen to agree that they are using all the best factors, and I think and have argued and will continue to argue that there are other things you can use that Georgetown will do a lot better.”
The Department of Education ranked Georgetown the third highest on its College Scorecard last year for graduates with the highest median earnings, behind the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University.
Georgetown University Student Veterans Association President Cristine Starke (SFS ’18), who served five years in the Marine Corps as an Arabic linguist, said the rankings are misleading, as they do not reflect the broader resources available to veterans on campus. These resources include a designated veteran’s chaplain and a Vet Allies program, which introduces faculty and student leaders to challenges that confront student veterans.
Starke said she chose to attend Georgetown despite being offered admittance at Stanford, which is currently ranked first for best colleges for veterans.
“I didn’t view the rankings as being really reflective of the best colleges for veterans, I just thought it seemed to be more about the best colleges that also might have veterans, as though that was their only metric,” Starke said. “I thought it was so funny, I had to choose between Georgetown and Stanford, and I was specifically not drawn toward that university and picked Georgetown over Stanford because I felt that I might not have as much of a community there.”

Upperclassman students were met by an earlier recruitment process when they returned to campus this fall, as the annual recruiting cycle for jobs and internships at financial institutions and many consulting firms moved from the spring semester to the fall semester for the first time.
In previous years, recruiters from firms such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bain & Company, McKinsey & Company, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Deloitte visited campus to host information sessions, meet-and-greets and on-campus interviews during the spring semester. This year, these firms, and many others, shifted recruiting to the fall after investment banks initially moved up their recruitment season.
Financial institutions shifted the schedule to allow themselves more time to staff their summer internship classes and conduct the advance planning that goes into their programs, according to Cawley Career Center’s Executive Director Mike Schaub. The new schedule also allows employers to connect with Georgetown students earlier in the year and increase outreach.
According to the Career Center’s 2015 First Destination Report, the top two hiring industries were financial services and consulting. Companies in these two industries hired 25 percent and 17 percent of students who graduated with full-time job offers that year, respectively.
Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers each hired 33 students, employing the most Georgetown students that year.
Schaub said Georgetown was originally asked to adjust to the fall hiring schedule last year, but only implemented it this year to better support students studying abroad.
“A number of schools accommodated this request during the 2015-2016 academic year. At Georgetown, we asked our recruiters to postpone this shift until the 2016-2017 academic year so that study abroad students would have full access to recruiting and to give the Career Center time to help students prepare for interviews,” Schaub said.
Students, deans, academic advisors and staff were first notified of changes in the recruiting timeline last September.
Although many companies now recruit earlier in the year, the process itself has not changed significantly, according to students like Dalric Fields (MSB ’18), who is currently recruiting for an internship.
“I think recruiting would be stressful at any time during the year,” Fields said. “But I do think having it directly at the beginning is definitely different, but it’s just adversity that everyone goes through in life.”
Maximilian Fiege (SFS ’18) said strong networking skills are essential for recruiting – especially because information sessions can be attended by over 200 students..
“For the majority of nights, you see yourself devoting two to three hours a night to the process. Information sessions take 45 minutes to an hour, and if you’re doing productive networking, that usually adds on another half hour,” Fiege said. “On top of all that, the follow up emails and phone calls — all of these auxiliary things that kind of float around the term ‘information session.’”
Some students — especially those who attended recruiting events in previous semesters — think the earlier schedule is problematic.
Hayden Jeong (MSB ’17) who attended recruiting events last spring and interned at PwC over the summer, said the new schedule excludes students who might need more time to prepare for the recruitment process.
“Recruitment isn’t supposed to attract only those who are positive they want to go into the industry — it’s supposed to provide a platform for students to learn more about it and ask questions from a point of view where they are still undecided about whether the industry is right for them,” Jeong said.
The Career Center has adapted its services to better support students with an earlier recruitment schedule. The Career Center no longer requires students to attend an on-campus interview workshop to prepare for recruiting season; however, some finance internships required students to attend an information session and sign confirmation forms in applicants’ sophomore Spring. Instead, students must review a PowerPoint presentation that describes the recruiting process and outlines expectations for participating students and answer a series of questions on the process to be considered eligible to participate in on-campus interviews.
Schaub said he believes both financial services and consulting will remain popular career paths at Georgetown. However, it is too early to say how the new recruiting schedule will affect the number of students pursuing these types of jobs and internships.
“Banking is appealing to many Georgetown students because it offers opportunities in which they can apply their coursework to a business setting and they are stimulated by the fast pace and competitive culture,” Schaub said. “As for consulting firms, they look for students with demonstrated analytical, quantitative, problem solving, communication and team skills. These are skills that students develop across all majors at Georgetown due to our emphasis on providing a liberal arts education.”

Secretary General of the Organization of American States Luis Almagro stressed the need to address the Latin American human rights crisis in countries such as Cuba and Venezuela – which Freedom House currently rates as only partly free and not free, respectively – as he was awarded the 2016 Mark Palmer Prize for human rights diplomacy by Freedom House and Georgetown University Institute for the Study of Diplomacy in Copley Formal Lounge yesterday.
Following Almagro’s keynote, Wilson Center fellow Diana Villiers Negroponte moderated a discussion on the human and civil rights issues facing the Americas.
The Organization of American States was founded in 1948 to promote regional solidarity and cooperation among countries in North and South America. The OAS has no access to military force.
Almagro said the upholding of international human rights conventions in the region was his primary concern during his tenure as Secretary-General of the OAS.
“A government cannot judge itself, it must be judged by its people. This is the vital role that citizens on our continent must play,” Almagro said. “Accountability comes from the outside and the right of the people to elect their leaders must not be infringed. With this system in place, the people are less likely to seek violent and destructive ways to force change.”
The Americas are facing systemic inequality that must be addressed as soon as possible, according to Almagro.
“Even today, our hemisphere remains one of the most unequal regions,” Almagro said. “The unequal distribution of income, access to basic goods and services is a constant factor that directly affects the full enjoyment of our citizens’ political, economic, social and cultural rights.”
Almagro also addressed current issues in the region, including Cuba, Venezuela and Columbia’s turbulent political climates.
Almagro said the Cubans – who are not currently a member of the OAS – are welcome as long as they make a commitment to satisfy certain human rights standards.
“The decision to lift the suspension of Cuba from the OAS in 2009 gave the Cubans the invitation to re-enter the organization. So far they have not done that,” Almagro said. “The thing is that it will not be a short process. It will take a while for the Cubans to adapt to these international human rights standards.”
Venezuela has faced significant economic challenges as the price of oil has declined. According to Almagro, a referendum on whether Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro should remain in power would do the greatest good toward attaining stability in the country.
“We have to be strong and firm and keep the pressure and ensure the referendum takes place this year,” Almagro said. “That is the most important step in Venezuelan democracy.”
Almagro said he supports the peace deal signed between Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – a terrorist group that has been plaguing the country with violence for decades – despite FARC’s alleged links to international drug trafficking.
“This deal has given Colombians a chance to live in peace and they should take it,” Almagro said.
Arjun Mehrotra (SFS ’20), who attended the event, said it was both enjoyable and enlightening.
“This was very informative for me because I personally did not know too much about the OAS, and having an opportunity to hear from the Secretary General and recently announced winner of the Mark Palmer Prize, Mr. Luis Almagro, was honestly a privilege,” Mehrotra said.

As part of an effort to renovate nearly 20 of Washington, D.C. libraries, the newly reconstructed Woodridge Neighborhood Library, located in Ward 5, is set to open Sept. 28, three years after the old library closed.
The $16.5 million project, which marks the 16th completed venture, covers 20,000 square feet and includes a new large meeting room, two conference rooms and seating for 200 visitors.
In addition to 40,000 books, CDs, DVDs and 40 computers equipped with high-speed Wi-Fi, the Woodridge Library will be the first in the District to have a roof terrace serving as a space for library programming.
According to James Jones, the assistant project manager for construction and development firm Blue Skye, the construction provides a series of benefits including an open interior rich in natural light and great views of the park and neighborhood.
“There are several engaging features of the library, the exterior concrete sloped concrete walls accompanied by the orange metal panel areas creates a nice contrast to go along with the steel canopy at the roof level,” Jones wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I believe the library just enhances what is already present in the neighborhood but provides new perspectives to view it from while also providing a place to continue helping the community to learn, grow, and flourish together.”
The building is also equipped with a series of environmentally friendly features including the provision of achieving at minimum a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Certification, which ranks projects as either certified, silver, gold or platinum. The project also includes a green roof to keep the building cool in the summer and reduce runoff during storms.
Library officials and community members selected the Woodridge Library’s architects, Wiencek & Associates and Bing Thom Architects, through a competitive bid process.
The Woodridge Library will be the first library Bing Thom Architects, well-known for its innovative design of the Surrey City Centre Library in Surrey, British Columbia. Wiencek & Associates will serve as the architect of record, and has also served as the architect of record for the new Francis Gregory and Bellevue libraries.
Coakley Williams, Inc. and Blue Skye Development handled the construction of the library and partnered to build it with the library’s mentor-protege program, which was developed with the D.C. Department of Small and Local Business Development. The mentor- protege program works to pair small, local businesses with larger businesses in order to get smaller businesses working on more government contracts. Through this program Blue Skye was contracted by Coakley Williams to provide additional construction management.
Furthermore, local high school students from the NAF Academy of Engineering, Phelps Architecture and Construction and Engineering High School had the opportunity to be directly involved with the construction of the Woodridge Library through an internship program.
Friends of the Woodridge Library President Sharon Turner pushed for the creation of the internship program and set up a meeting with library and school officials to facilitate its inception. To Turner, the program is just a natural consequence of Ward 5’s working as a community.
“I’m a native Washingtonian and I live in Ward 5 and Phelps is a high school which was very close to where I grew up,” Turner said. “And so it just seemed like Phelps is in Ward 5, the library’s in Ward 5, I spent most of my life in Ward 5, let’s see what we can put together here.”
Jones supervised the interns’ work on the project and emphasized how he particularly enjoyed sharing a contractor’s perspective with them.
“It was also gratifying to see them get hands on and successfully completing the same daily tasks and assignments as the project team in the office or field. Being able to witness their growth and hearing their plans to use their experiences they gained through the internship during their next school year was also rewarding,” Jones said in an email to The Hoya. “They were able to contribute to the library in their own neighborhood and show pride in that.”
Former program intern Williams Djepeno, a Morgan State University student, expressed how this opportunity provided him with essential insight into construction and architecture, his fields of interest.
“It impacted me a lot because it let me know what kind of direction that the people that are out there on this field [have] and how important communication is when it comes to the architect,” Djepeno said. “It showed me the responsibility that the architect must have, because he has to deal with the contractors on a day-to-day basis.”
With current construction coming to a close, the library staff is getting ready to celebrate with a grand opening party Oct. 1.

The School of Nursing and Health Studies eliminated its printing budget for students — which provided students around $50 a year for printing use — beginning this fall.
The printing budget, which previously cost the NHS $64,500, was cut by NHS Dean Patricia Cloonan’s administrative team, which considered how the other schools at Georgetown manage their printing budgets. Neither the School of Foreign Service nor the College provides a printing budget for its students, while all printing in the McDonough School of Business is free as part of tuition.
“We’re really trying to take a look at how can we better get in line with the rest of the university on this issue in a way that is fiscally responsible,” Cloonan said.
The funding came previously from an alumni donation which ran out two years ago, according to Cloonan. The NHS self-funded the program last year.
Cloonan said she hopes students who are upset by this change will share their views with her and the rest of the NHS administration.
“We’re deeply committed to trying to be responsive to students’ concerns. I would hope that if students have concerns about this or anything else, they can certainly feel free to bring their concerns here,” Cloonan said. “We are more than happy to have a conversation with them about that and to really think through what makes sense for our school and for our instance in the future.”
Saumya Kasliwal (NHS ’19) said the printing budget cut is cost-efficient for both students and the university.
“Last semester I just did not use $25 worth of printing a semester and that money was taken onto my tuition package,” Kasliwal said. “So it’s actually pretty beneficial that now we aren’t restricted to that one lab. If I only end up printing $10 a semester, that’s fine.”
JJ Larkins (NHS ’19) said eliminating the built-in printing budget was an improvement.
“Before, we were almost forced to use $25 to print in this one lab in the basement of St. Mary’s, so I kind of like that we don’t have it anymore,” Larkins said.
