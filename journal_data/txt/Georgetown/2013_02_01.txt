 A smartphone application that will allow users to track SafeRides and GUTS buses will be launched this semester after more than a year of research and planning by GUSA Senate and DoubleMap, a GPS service provider.
The student association team, comprised of former president and vice president Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) and Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) and Secretary of Information Technology Michael Crouch (MSB ’13), opted to partner with DoubleMap after extensive research into competing vendors. This process, along with uncertainty about the scope of project, led to a slower progression than initially anticipated.
“Obviously I was hoping that it would have been sooner than this. However, we understood that it had to go through a typical university protocol looking at multiple vendors, etc.,” Laverriere said.
Discussions about implementing a tracking device program began about a year and a half ago in response to student complaints about inefficient transportation. After Meaney, Laverriere and Crouch publicized interest in pursuing the project, DoubleMap approached Crouch about installing their service for free at Georgetown.
“We thought it would be a great idea, in a day and age where everyone is on their smartphone, to allow students to see where the buses are in real time,” Laverriere said.
Moving forward, GUSA members attended meetings with members of University Information Services, the Office of Transportation Management, Department of Public Safety, Facilities Repair and Maintenance, and representatives from the office of Chris Augostini, senior vice president and chief operating officer.
In November 2012 GUSA began to test the GPS software on Georgetown University Transportation Shuttles.
Crouch is looking forward to releasing the app to students.
“I think that students are often hesitant to go out into D.C. because they aren’t familiar with transportation methods and don’t know how GUTS works or feel that they don’t follow regular schedules. The DoubleMap application will enable students to manage their schedules more effectively,” Crouch said. “But over and above that, I think the greatest benefit will be with SafeRides vans. It will not only keep noise off the street but enable people to leverage the program more easily.”
Once launched, the tracking device will be available through the transit link on the Georgetown University Mobile App. The software resembles a classic map interface, but also has color-coded routes and dots that follow the vehicles in real time.
“Now [students] have the ability to see where the vans or GUTS buses are, adding and improving efficiency across the board,” Laverriere said. “If you look on your phone and see it’s a block away, it reduces street noise, increases safety [and] accounts for traffic. Things like that really help make student lives simpler.”
Students, too, are excited about DoubleMap.
 “I’ll definitely be more willing to use Georgetown transportation now. Especially on the weekend, it will be really helpful to know when to leave or whether I should take a taxi,” Katie Kissinger (COL ’15) said.

 With interview season for prestigious consulting firms in full swing and application deadlines drawing near, many Georgetown juniors are entrenched in the competitive scramble for summer employment.
“The entire process can be overwhelming and confusing at times. It was a whole new world for me,” Peter Prindiville (SFS ’14) said.
After weeks of meticulous preparation, Prindiville landed an interview with the consulting firm McKinsey & Company last week. He said careful preparation is key in any field, but especially when it comes to consulting, an industry whose interviews are notoriously thorough. These interviews generally revolve around a “case,” or hypothetical situation through which the candidate must work.
“My friends, who were going through it too, were very supportive even though we were sometimes applying to the same job,” Prindiville said. “We would proofread each other’s cover letters and practice interviews.”
One of those friends was Ethan Chess (COL ’14), who had a second-round interview with an investment bank in Chicago on Monday following an initial phone interview that took place over the December break. Chess, who applied to 15 internships in total, seven of which were at investment banks, had two additional interviews on Tuesday.
“It can be a bit much, but it’s nice that this happens at the beginning of the semester, so that it’s manageable with the lighter workload,” Chess said.
Chess stressed the importance of the Cawley Career Center’s help and wealth of information regarding common firms and companies. Chess, who has been preparing for months, is representative of a large part of the junior class.
“Juniors take advantage of career center services including career counseling, employment advising, mock interview preparation, workshops, networking events, pre-law advising and employer presentations,” Michael Schaub, Cawley Career Center executive director, said. “The process of applying for internships can take a lot of time and energy.”
This comes as no surprise, as internships are increasingly considered a valuable work experience.
“Employers now expect seniors to have some work experience under their belts by the time they graduate from college,” Schaub wrote in an email. “Results from the Class of 2011 Senior Survey show that 86 percent of seniors had at least one internship experience before graduation.”
As a result, juniors, worried that this summer may be their last chance, are attending various information sessions, on-campus recruiting boutiques and networking opportunities offered by the career center. This week alone, there were 13 events scheduled, with topics ranging from careers in academia to investment banking to international internships.
In addition to hosting the Hoya Career Connection system, the Career Center also participates in the iNet Internship Network, an internship-posting site built by a consortium of leading universities that share internship opportunities. The network includes Duke University, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University and Georgetown.
“The network is intended to supplement the HCC and provide students with greater industry and geographical options in the internship search,” Schaub wrote.
The career center has historically seen a large amount of traffic at this time of year, when students attempt to use all available resources to improve their chances and to hone their interview skills.
In contrast to the current craze, some students have had their summer internships planned out for over a year. Several juniors have return offers from previous internships, affording them a degree of stability and background knowledge for the coming summer summer.
Amy Yang (MSB ’14) will intern for accounting firm KPMG in New York City this summer.
“I secured the internship last summer, which means that I don’t have to go through the interview process again this semester,” Yang said. “Seeing my friends who are interviewing now, I definitely feel a lot of empathy for them.”
While internships in the financial sector generally require the most notoriously in-depth interviews, students interested in other career paths are also participating in similar employment searches.
Shayna Benjamin (NHS ’14) recently found out that she would be working in a Georgetown University Hospital Intensive Care Unit. Nursing students planning on entering the clinical field after graduation seek summer “externships,” specialized positions in hospitals that provide practical training in a specific unit, such as oncology or intensive care.
“Most hospitals will only hire new graduate nurses if they’ve had some type of prior experience,” Benjamin said. “I’m hoping to improve my nursing skills … and affirm the type of nurse I always thought I would be — try to find my niche.”
Staying in Georgetown, Benjamin has the added benefit of familiarity with her surroundings and with many of her coworkers. She will sublet a house in Burleith with friends from Georgetown.
 Don Jayamaha (COL ’14) is also staying on campus, hoping to work as a research assistant for at least part of the summer.
“The professors I’ve met with have been extremely supportive in pointing me toward possible projects and organizations,” Jayamaha said. “If you look hard enough and talk to enough people, there are opportunities available.”
Jayamaha is also considering other possibilities for this summer beyond research.
“I hope to spend the first part of my summer working on a research project … then I’m hoping to go back to Sri Lanka and do more hands-on work [in economic policy],” Jayamaha said. “But I haven’t got my summer completely planned out yet.”
With his uncertainty, Jayamaha is not alone among the junior class. For many, there remain questions of offers and opportunities. Prindiville, for example, also has interests in law and government, but he said that he tries not to get overwhelmed.
“People sometimes get caught up in it,” Prindiville said. “They might apply to [an internship] just because their friends mention it regardless of their qualifications. It can be a little awkward later if one of us does better [than the other], but I try to find a balance.”
For him, there are more important things.
“In the end, I just want to have a good summer,” Prindiville said.

Amid grumbles that Georgetown has been slow to utilize 21st-century technology, the university has ramped up efforts to maximize use of social media in the past year.
In March 2012, the Office of Communications created a cross-campus, collaborative Social Media Working Group to develop a unified institutional identity to grow and organize Georgetown’s online presence. The working group has about 40 members and meets once a month to discuss social media strategies.
“There really is no precedent for developing a strategy around social media at a university like Georgetown,” communications officer Rob Mathis said. “We’ve really found that Georgetown is a leader in this area.”
In a list of U.S. universities compiled by social media analytical company Klout, Georgetown is ranked as the 17th most influential user of social media.
Mathis stressed the importance of engaging audiences, which include students, faculty, alumni and the community-at-large.
“In order to be authentic, content needs to be developed with your target audience, not just for them,” Mathis said.
As such, each networking platform has a designated purpose and audience. While the university’s Facebook page, which recently surpassed 50,000 “likes,” delivers news from the university, the Georgetown Twitter feed, with more than 16,000 current “followers,” shares general updates and encourages more audience interaction.
In addition to these efforts, several university offices and departments operate separate accounts on a variety of platforms. A landscape analysis conducted six months ago revealed 400 accounts with a combined reach of 1.6 million people.
“Because there are so many audiences, I don’t think one account on its own could do justice,” Mathis said. “I’m more interested in making sure we [have] great approaches.” Anupam Chakravarty (SFS’10), senior manager of interactive communications at the Office of Advancement, echoed the importance of this approach, citing the Office of Advancement’s Tumblr page.
“Tumblr is a platform that we’ve increasingly used [for] temporary moments in the Georgetown experience that we really want to highlight,” Chakravarty said.
Posts on the Tumblr account have included birthday wishes addressed to the university, a yearbook-like tribute to the 2012 Commencement ceremonies and images for use as Facebook cover photos.
The Office of Advancement was also responsible for the “Hoya Holidays” card and the Dec. 19 “Georgetown Moments” YouTube video, which has nearly 16,000 views on YouTube.
The Office of Advancement found its social media efforts integral to its work with alumni outreach and the Campaign for Georgetown.
“People are able to share in the Georgetown story, especially alumni, who like seeing pictures of things like [Regents Hall], which wasn’t there when they were here,” Chakravarty said.
Chakravarty added that alumni are often curious about student life because of their own memories of Georgetown. The Georgetown Alumni Twitter feed was created one year ago and had 2,384 followers at press time.
“It’s important to let social media be authentic, unpredictable, in the moment,” Chakravarty added.
The university has used Pinterest and Foursquare and partnered with video-streaming platformUStream to produce live webcasts integrated with Facebook and Twitter. President of AfghanistanHamid Karzai’s Jan. 11 speech in Gaston Hall was the first webcast, drawing 170,000 viewers.
Georgetown’s Center for Social Impact Communication, founded in 2008, also shows the university’s commitment to social media and its impact on social issues.
“Our mission is very much tied into the university’s about making a positive difference in the world,”CSIC Deputy Director Julie Dixon wrote in an email. “We work with a lot of smaller nonprofit organizations in the D.C. area, for whom figuring out how to best use social media can be a real challenge, usually because they don’t have the staff, time or resources to devote to sustaining that engagement.”
This drive to provoke thought and increase engagement can also be seen in other initiatives, such as University Provost Robert Groves’ blog. Groves’ blog posts are sent out to students in university-wide emails and published on the Office of the Provost’s website.
Groveshas also attempted to take advantage of Twitter, using his personal account to promote his blog posts and occasionally interact with followers. He has 543 followers, compared to Georgetown University’s 16,392.
Student organizations, like Students of Georgetown, Inc., have used similar platforms to reach out to the student body.
However, Corp Director of Marketing Keaton Bedell (COL ’13) said that younger people are less likely to comment than older users like those targeted by the Georgetown Alumni Association — a challenge for an organization largely focused on engaging the current student body.
Social media is especially useful to exceptionally large student organizations, like the International Relations Club, that have trouble reaching all their members. IRC is planning to revamp its communications in an effort to improve contact between high-level members and its 400 due-paying members, according to IRC Marketing Director Connie Yang (SFS ’15).
This problem represents one that the university experiences on a larger scale. The Alumni Association currently has approximately 160,000 members around the world, while the university has more than 6,300 undergraduates.
Mathis hopes to see Georgetown extend its social media reach to connect with these student groups and wider audiences in the next few years.
“The voice of an institution doesn’t just belong to the institution itself. It belongs to all of the people that make it up,” Mathis said. “Anything we can do to empower that and give the people the tools and resources they need to be an advocate of Georgetown … that’s where I’d like to see the university go.”

Despite a recent string of burglaries that hit multiple dormitories, a faculty office and the Alumni Square Residence Hall Office, total crime dropped significantly last month compared to January 2012.
The six burglaries in 2013 represented a 45 percent decrease from the same period last year. There were 14 thefts last month, a 36 percent drop from last January.
The most recent high-profile burglary occurred when a­n unknown suspect stole three packages from the Alumni Square RHO on Saturday night. Since there was no evidence of forced entry, investigators believe an unlocked door allowed the burglary.
While thefts in dormitories are relatively common, RHOs have seldom, if ever, suffered burglaries.
“This is the first time I’ve heard about an RHO being burglarized in the six months since I’ve been here,” Department of Public Safety Chief of Police Jay Gruber said.
Despite the stolen packages, the housing office said it has no plans to heighten its security measures.
“We have reviewed our security protocols and determined they are appropriate considering the hundreds of thousands of packages we distribute each year and the very few reported missing packages,” Robin Morey, vice president for planning and facilities management, wrote in an email. “We are reinforcing our security procedures with our staff to avoid another security breach.”
The RHO has already informed the students whose packages were taken about the incident and plans to reimburse them.
Gruber believes that the RHO theft is unrelated to the recent rash of burglaries that hit Harbin, Copley and McCarthy Halls Jan. 28 and 29. Based on security footage, DPS believes that the same individual was responsible for all of those burglaries, but the department wants to investigate the matter further before publicly releasing images of the suspect.
After theft and burglary, drug violations were the next most commonly reported type of crime. The four incidents reported this year represent a 43 percent drop from last January.
This month, no alcohol violations were reported, down from six in January 2012.

In sharp contrast to the speedy and near-unanimous Jan. 29 confirmation of Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) for secretary of state, Georgetown professor and former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) faced a contentious first day of questioning Thursday at his hearing for secretary of defense.
Hagel testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which consists of 14 Democrats and 12 Republicans. Although Hagel is a Republican, some of his most vocal critics since Obama nominated him Jan. 7 have been fellow party members. Some Democrats on the committee also voiced concern with Hagel’s nomination at the hearing.
The first criticisms of Hagel came in the opening statements from committee chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and ranking member Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).
While Levin noted Hagel’s service in the Vietnam War, he also criticized the former senator’s willingness to engage in talks with Iran as well his stance on U.S. relations with Israel.
Inhofe expressed dissent towards the nomination, saying that he and Hagel are “too philosophically opposed.”
“Sen. Hagel’s record is deeply troubling and out of the mainstream,” Inhofe said.
Hagel had support, however, from former Chairmen of the Armed Services Committee Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and John Warner (R-Va.), who introduced him prior to his own remarks.
“War for Chuck Hagel is not an abstraction,” Nunn said. “I’m confident that if he is confirmed, he will ask the tough questions.”
If confirmed, Hagel would be the first enlisted person and first Vietnam War veteran to be secretary of defense.
In his opening statement, Hagel said that as secretary of defense he would focus on counterterrorism and training Afghan forces in addition to enforcing his policy of prevention —as opposed to containment — of Iranian nuclear capability.
He also stressed his commitment to the men and women in the armed forces.
“Their safety success and welfare will always be at the forefront of the decisions I make,” he said.
Once the committee began its questioning, the hearing atmosphere became more heated.
Several senators grilled Hagel on Israel, but he emphasized that his record shows a clear support of the country and said that he had never voted against Israel in his 12 years in the Senate.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) countered Hagel’s statements by bringing up a letter that expressed support for Israel.
“The lack of signature [on that letter] by you sends chills up my spine,” Graham said.
Another recurring theme was Iran. Hagel came under fire following his nomination for his beliefs that the United States should engage with Iran, which has been called a state sponsor of terrorism.
“Engagement is not appeasement. Engagement is not surrender,” Hagel said at his hearing.
.Nuclear disarmament, particularly Hagel’s involvement with Global Zero — an  organization pushing for the elimination of nuclear weapons — and a report co-authored by him in 2012 was called into question by several senators.
“I’m uneasy about that vision expressed in your committee report,” Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said.
However, Hagel’s most difficult moment may have been Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) questioning regarding the military surge in Iraq, which sent over 20,000 troops abroad in 2007.
“I’m not going to give you a yes or no answer,” Hagel said on whether the surge was correct or incorrect. “I’ll defer that judgment to history.”
“I think history has already made a judgment on the surge and I think you’re on the wrong side of it,” McCain said.
Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) was one of the few senators today who openly expressed support for Hagel and said that he would vote for the nominee.
If Hagel’s confirmation is approved by the committee, it will be brought to a full vote in the Senate, where politicians from both parties have pledged support. The Wall Street Journal predicts that Hagel’s confirmation may take several weeks. Proceedings will continue next Thursday.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority  is examining proposals to construct two new tunnels for subway trains — one under the Potomac River connecting Rosslyn and Georgetown and one under10th Street to Thomas Circle — to relieve commuter traffic.
WMATA officials brought the idea for expansion to their board of directors Jan. 24 but say that the plan is only in the preliminary stages.
“Last week’s plan was a draft, and these are basically ideas we’re trying to get input from the public, from our board on those priorities and ultimately if we know where we’re heading in terms of a longer-term outlook,” Director of Long-Range Planning Tom Harrington said.
The addition is part of Metro’s Regional Transit System Plan, a 30-year projection for area transportation, and Momentum, a 10-year expansion plan.
“It’s really again to help us figure out those shorter-term priorities for the next 10 years,” Harrington said. “If we know we’re going to be looking at Metrorailexpansion in the long term, what are the projects we could do to get us set up to get there?”
Georgetown students’ main complaint with Metro is often its inaccessibility, especially on weekends, when Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle buses run less frequently.
“I think it’s too many stops and it doesn’t end up in Georgetown, so I usually just take a taxi,” Benito Skinner (COL ’16) said. “If the Metro was close to Georgetown, I would definitely use it.”
Tunnels under the Potomac and 10th Street would split the blue and orange lines, which intersect from Rosslyn to Stadium-Armory, and the green and yellow lines, which currently meet at theL’Enfant through Greenbelt stops, respectively, Harrington said.
The tunnel under the Potomac will also defuse congestion from the silver line, which will provide Metro service to Dulles Airport and Tysons Corner. The first phase of the silver is due to be completed in late 2013 while a start date for the second phase has not yet been set but is estimated to be completed by 2018.
According to Harrington, Momentum projections also seek to up the Metrorail fleet in addition to expanding train lines, because it is expected that Metro ridership will reach one million people a day by 2040.
“If we don’t expand our fleet beyond what we have today … we’re going to expect some serious crowding issues by 2020,” he said. “The first thing we should do is maximize the capacities we have today by running longer trains and adding station capacity. Even if you do all that, by the time you get out to 2040, you’re still showing … lines above capacity.”
Harrington said that the main issue inhibiting the expansion is cost.
Metro’s budget is composed of two parts: the day-to-day operating budget, funded by fares, and the Capital Improvement Program, which is funded by federal, state and local dollars. While the annual budget under CIP is about $900 million a year, revamping Metro’s system will require $26 billion over the next three decades, according to The Washington Post.
WMATA officials are still discussing how to attain the necessary funding.
“It’s the starting-point of a discussion about options that are out there in terms of funding and where it could come from,” Harrington said. “But, clearly, we’re exploring new sources of funding to look ahead to a bigger expansion of the system.”
Students say they have noticed overcrowding problems while riding Metrorail, particularly whentravelling to Verizon Center for basketball games.
“We went to a game and the train at Metro Center that we wanted to take to Gallery Place didn’t come,” Rui Hao Puah (SFS ’16) said. “There were too many people.”
Ron Lewis, chair of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E, said he would strongly support Metro service to Georgetown, though he thinks the expansion is unlikely in coming years.
“I think it will be a very long time coming, because I don’t think they have the money to do it in any near term,” Lewis said. “I would like it just as soon as possible. … It would be good for everyone.”

During her middle and high school years, it was not uncommon for Fabianna Pergolizzi (COL ’13) to arrive at school to find her locker filled with McDonald’s hamburgers or discover nails in her car tires.
“I went to my school dean 100 times and nothing was done,” she said.
After these experiences with relentless bullying in her adolescence, Pergolizzi was inspired to establish Project Anti-Bully, a student-run nonprofit that seeks to raise awareness of bullying in schools through community-based research, in 2006.
“[If you can] take the fear away from the bully … if you intimidate them by doing positive things and being strong, they can’t touch you,” Pergolizzi said.
Inspired by a study of bullying in middle schools by Child Abuse Prevention Services, Pergolizziconducted a survey in her hometown of Naples, Fla., about bullying. Working with a statistician,Pergolizzi found that 86 percent of students surveyed reported suffering from some form of bullying daily. Pergolizzi and her team submitted a synopsis of their research to the American Psychiatric Association in 2006 and later presented their findings to the APA.
Project Anti-Bully, which has 150 members in 13 countries, now has its research published in the Journal of Medicine, the Journal of School Violence and International Journal of Adolescence Medical Health.
Pergolizzi receives letters from students around the world about their bullying experiences. ThoughPergolizzi and her team make it clear that they are students, not lawyers or counselors, they try to give bullied students an outlet to speak openly.
Children who have been bullied and are interested in joining the nonprofit are offered spots on the organization’s team.
Some students join the group to express solidarity with friends and family who have been bullied. Matt Denicola (COL ’13), the project’s graphic designer, joined after his younger sister was bullied while he was away at Georgetown.
“Just because I couldn’t be there for my sister, I want to try to be there for someone else,” he said. “I wanted to give back in any way that I could [and] try to make a difference in someone’s life.”
Project Anti-Bully has been active on Georgetown’s campus, organizing a Sandy Hook candle vigil after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn.
“[I am]  … trying to really embrace kids and get them to notice the whole project and what we do,”Denicola, who is one of 15 students currently involved at Georgetown, said.
Pergolizzi said that the university’s Jesuit community supports the Project Anti-Bully’s work on campus, and the group aims to reach out to the broader campus community.
In addition to providing education on different types of bullying, including cyberbullying, in the form of intervention programs in schools, the organization is working on a documentary titled “Kids Are Mean” and beginning two campaigns to increase bullying awareness. The project also operates an anti-bully hotline.
