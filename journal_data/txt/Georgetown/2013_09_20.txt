In order to increase Georgetown students’ participation in Washington, D.C. government, the Georgetown University Student Association has created a new cabinet department for D.C. Relations.
Undersecretary of D.C. Relations Thomas Moakley (SFS ’17) aims to help students to apply to Mayor Vincent Gray’s mayoral advisory boards, which are open to all D.C. residents. The boards meet monthly and are geared toward particular topics, such as homelessness, disabilities, domestic violence and human rights issues.
“The fact that we’re here at Georgetown, I think, is reason enough to try and give back to the community, and this a great way to do it,” Moakley added. “I’d hope that Georgetown would have a strong presence, although I’m sure all the schools will have representation.”
Although students have always been able to serve on these boards, GUSA President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) made it a priority. Tisa stressed the importance of expanding the voice of Georgetown students and of connecting with the local government.
“Serving on D.C. mayoral boards is great for the individual, it’s a good experience in government [and] it’s a good experience talking about issues outside of the Hilltop,” Tisa said. “It’s also good for students at Georgetown and everywhere else in D.C. because it increases the student voice and it helps make D.C. an easier place for students to live.”
Moakley agreed and emphasized the benefits of working outside of Georgetown, particularly because of the boards’ minimal time commitment.
“Obviously, the lives of students can be very busy between classes and other activities, but these boards really offer a chance … for students to not only have experience in advocating for issues that are important to them but also just to see a little bit about how local government works,” Moakley said. “In this case, it’s the city government, but the principles can apply to any sort of local government in the sense that people are really concerned about their own community.”
“There’s going to be boards that appeal to different people depending on their interests,” Moakley said.
In particular, Moakley encouraged students to apply for a new task force about students in higher education. Because the task force is relatively new, Moakley said the opportunity for growth and participation would be particularly strong.
“Anyone who got involved in that could really be on the front lines for the improvement of the college experience here in D.C.,” Moakley said.
Several students are excited to take advantage of this opportunity, including Eamon Johnston (SFS ’15).
“I really like local politics, and I’ve never really gotten the opportunity to participate in any of it,” Johnston said. “I don’t know too much about D.C., but I want to learn more.”
Johnson expressed particular interest in the higher education task force because of its relevance to Georgetown students, although he is also applying to the Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Juvenile Justice Advisory Group.
The boards are accepting applications on a rolling basis.

In response to a severe racial discrepancy among those arrested for marijuana-related offenses, D.C. Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) introduced a bill Tuesday that would legalize recreational usage of marijuana in the District.
If passed, the Marijuana Legalization and Regulation Act would permit people over the age of 21 to possess and use up to two ounces of marijuana, which could be purchased from licensed distributors. All marijuana sales would carry a 10 percent excise tax, the proceeds of which would go toward substance-abuse prevention programs.
An American Civil Liberties Union study released in June showed that D.C. has a higher marijuana-related arrest rate per capita than any state in the country; 846 out of 100,000 D.C. residents were arrested for marijuana-related arrests in 2010, and the Metropolitan Police Department has reported a steady rise in marijuana-related arrests from 2009 to 2013. A 2010 National Drug Use survey found that approximately 15 percent of both black and white populations in the United States use marijuana, but the ACLU found that black residents are 8.05 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana than their white counterparts.
Medical marijuana is already legalized in the District. Additionally, the Department of Justice announced Aug. 29 that it would not interfere with decriminalization or legalization laws proposed at the state and local level, provided that businesses are tightly regulated.
Grosso’s efforts follow a bill introduced in July by Councilmember Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) andcouncilmember and mayoral candidate Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6) that would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Wells and Barry plan to re-introduce the bill this fall and are holding a public hearing in early October.
The decriminalization bill, which has six co-sponsors, would reduce the punishment for possession of marijuana from a criminal offense to a civil penalty. Currently, the punishment for possessing less than one ounce of marijuana is six months in prison and a $1,000 fine; Wells and Barry’s bill would reduce the penalty to a $100 fine.
But while Grosso supports the decriminalization movement, he argued that it would not do enough to solve the racial component of marijuana-related arrests. He has also introduced another bill, the Marijuana Possession Act of 2013, which would seal the records of all people whose only criminal offense is possession of marijuana.
“The war on drugs has not worked,” Grosso said in a press release. “It has been a war on people of color. … I want to remove the opportunity for MPD to disproportionately arrest African Americans for non-violent drug offenses. This is a matter of justice.”
ALCU organizer Seema Sadanandan agreed and said that MPD officers target black residents by using use the city’s stop-and-frisk policy, which leads to marijuana-related arrests.
“We hear a lot of issues where many people are confronted by police officers and stop-and-frisk tactics. This forces them to live in a hyper-vigilant state which creates a dangerous dynamic in the community,” Sadanandan said. “This essentially disenfranchises an entire section of the community from full enjoyment of many of their rights.”
Adam Eidinger, a pro-marijuana activist who used to run the Capitol Hemp stores — stores that sold clothing and accessories made from hemp — is seeking to propose a ballot referendum in favor of legalization. Eidinger previously proposed a decriminalization referendum in early 2013 but withdrew it early this month following several objections from D.C. Attorney General Irv Natahan. According toEidinger, the objections were procedural, in that the referendum called for the appropriation of city money, but District lab prohibits referendums from doing so. Eidinger told The Washingtonian that he planned to submit a legalization referendum in time to get it on the 2014 general election ballot.
Even if the D.C. Council passes marijuana-related legislation, Congress has authority over D.C. laws — a power that it has exercised in the past. A 1998 referendum that approved medical marijuana was defeated on Capitol Hill.
Grosso, however, expressed confidence that Congress would not block the implementation of a council-approved bill. He said approximately 100 constituents have expressed their support, but an April Public Policy Polling survey found that 75 percent of District voters support the decriminalization of marijuana and more than 60 percent would support some sort of legalization initiative.
“The mood is turning, the tide is turning,” he told U.S. News & World Report.
Although Mayor Vincent Gray has not taken a position on decriminalization, a spokesperson in the mayor’s office told The Hoya that Gray welcomes the discussion of the issue.

Many at Georgetown were introduced to Frank McCourtJr. (CAS ’75) through his record donation to the university this week, yet this staggering generosity also prompts curiosity about the man and his money.
McCourt, who majored in economics at Georgetown — where he met his ex-wife Jamie McCourt (CAS ’75) — founded the McCourt Company in 1977, which specialized in real estate and construction, particularly with parking lots.
McCourt’s grandfather was a part-owner of the then-Boston Braves (now the Atlanta Braves baseball franchise), and Frank McCourt continued that tradition. He unsuccessfully attempted to buy the Boston Red Sox, the former Anaheim Angels and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football team before acquiring the Los Angeles Dodgers for $430 million in 2004. McCourt took out a $205 million loan to buy the team and used his own South Boston property as collateral to finance the acquisition.
In order to balance the debt and increase the team’s viability, McCourt increased ticket and concession prices each year. By 2009, Forbes reported that the team’s assets had increased in value to $722 million, thanks to McCourt’s heavy investment in improvement, but the team had also become mired in $600 million of debt.
McCourt separated from his wife in 2009 and fired her as CEO of the Dodgers. Jamie McCourt, who had been the first female CEO of a Major League Baseball team, filed for divorce soon thereafter, leading to an expensive proceeding with the Dodgers in the middle.
McCourt accused his wife of having an affair with her driver and subsequently attempted to take sole ownership of the Dodgers by pointing to the couple’s post-nuptial marital property agreement. In 2010, however, a judge invalidated the agreement based on inconsistencies between various versions of the document.
McCourt then attempted to use other legal avenues to establish sole ownership, while Jamie McCourtcontinued to say that the team was community property. After two years of extensive and heavily publicized legal maneuvering, the McCourts reached a divorce settlement in 2011 in which JamieMcCourt received $131 million but relinquished her claim to the Dodgers in what The Los Angeles Times reported was the most costly divorce in California history.
This divorce, however, was not the end of McCourt’s legal and financial troubles.
In 2010, then-California Attorney General Jerry Brown investigated the Dodgers’ Dream Foundation, the team’s second-largest charity, for improper expenditures totaling $361,432 in 2007 and 2008. Based on tax returns, Brown found that the funds had been used primarily for the benefit of JamieMcCourt, as well as a bonus payment of approximately $240,000 to Dodgers executive HowardSunkin.
According to Georgetown’s press release announcing the McCourt School for Public Policy, McCourtis still involved with ThinkCure!, the Dodgers’ largest charity, which raises money for cancer research.
Following reports in 2011 that McCourt had needed to obtain a personal loan in order to cover the team’s payroll for two months, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig appointed a representative to oversee Dodgers operations out of concern for the team’s finances. The Washington Post reported that league officials were also critical of McCourt’s ownership, and despite McCourt’s protests, pushed him to sell the team. The Dodgers officially filed for bankruptcy in June 2011 and were subsequently placed on the market.
The team was eventually sold for $2 billion in 2012 to a group consisting of former Los Angeles Laker Magic Johnson, former baseball executive Stan Kasten and financial services firm Guggenheim Partners — more than double what any MLB franchise had ever sold for. The land around the team’s stadium was also sold for $150 million to the same group, which inherits the team’s massive debt.
According to The Los Angeles Times, McCourt profited more than $1.2 billion from the sale, and Guggenheim Partners agreed to invest as much as $650 million in his investment fund.
McCourt still receives $7 million a year from Dodger Stadium parking lots.

A gift of $100 million from former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt Jr. (CAS ’75) will help create the McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown’s ninth school and its first new school since the School of Business Administration in 1957, the university announced Wednesday.
McCourt’s gift is the largest Georgetown has ever received, breaking a 2010 record set by Harry Toulmin Jr.’s $87 million endowment to support medical research granted through a charitable trust established in his will. The son of Rafik B. Hariri, for whom the new business school building is named, donated $20 million to the university.
The McCourt School was first conceptualized during a conversation between McCourt and University President John J. DeGioia at a 2006 Board of Directors meeting. It will incorporate the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, which is currently part of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, in its emphasis on a data-driven study of public policy through a Center for Politics and Policy at the McCourt School, a Massive Data Institute and the McCourt Fellows Program.
“Following the first World War, we created our Walsh School of Foreign Service to contribute to global peace by preparing young diplomatic leaders,” DeGioia told reporters Wednesday morning. “In 1957, we started what is now our McDonough School of Business as a recognition of America’s place in a growing world economy. And now, we have the ability to build on our existing strengths once again to meet the needs of the complex and evolving field of public policy and its application in solving global challenges.”
The Massive Data Institute will focus on data from government agencies in its policy analysis, emphasizing the role of data in informing work on healthcare, education, poverty and other policy areas, while the fellowship program will offer full scholarships to students and five endowed faculty positions along with other faculty openings, including interdisciplinary and inter-school appointments.
“It is clear that the problems facing this country and many other countries in the world don’t come packaged in little boxes that can be solved only by economists or only by political scientists with their knowledge of their discipline, but what we need really are interdisciplinary teams,” Provost Robert Groves said.
“We have at this moment in the country — because of the rise of the Internet, because all of the records that used to be on paper from government agencies of the federal, state and local level are now digitized — vast data resources that can guide the analysis of what works and what doesn’t work in very practical ways, so answers to the puzzling questions of how can we as a society approach these knotty problems now have information resources we didn’t have before,” added Groves, who previously served as director of the U.S. Census Bureau.
The McCourt School will initially be housed in Old North, which is currently the home of GPPI, andGPPI Dean Edward Montgomery will be dean of the new school. DeGioia said that the university plans to look for a location “in the heart of the policy-formation part of the city” for the McCourt School in the long term.
Many current GPPI faculty members also teach undergraduates, and a move downtown could make crossover between the school and main campus difficult.
“That’s going to be one of our main challenges for many of us who also work with undergraduates,” said Mark Rom, a GPPI faculty member and co-director of undergraduate studies in government. “The farther we move away from campus, the harder it will be to maintain our true relationship with main campus.”
McCourt, who is president of the real estate development firm McCourt Global, served on Georgetown’s board of directors from 2005 to 2011 and co-chaired the university’s Third Century Campaign in the New England region. His family ties with Georgetown are extensive; his father, two brothers and one of four sons are also alumni. A member of the McCourt family, Alexandra McCourt, is a current undergraduate.
Nationally, he is best known for his eight-year tenure as owner of the Dodgers, which took the team into bankruptcy in 2011. McCourt fired his wife, Jamie McCourt, as the team’s chief executive in 2009 and then battled her in a messy divorce before selling the team in 2012.
His gift to Georgetown marks a milestone in the university’s Campaign for Georgetown, which aims to raise $1.5 billion by 2016 and reached the $1 billion milestone last March.
“Me and my family have had the real privilege of being part of this world-class institution, in my case literally my entire life,” McCourt said Wednesday. “We’ve had an 82-year-old relationship that grows and thrives. … Georgetown is part of my family.”
DeGioia emphasized the serendipity of McCourt’s interest and Georgetown’s renewed focus on public policy.
“Our announcement today represents the convergence of the right idea, the right university, the right family and the right city at the right time,” DeGioia said.
The McCourt School’s official launch will occur at an academic ceremony on Copley Lawn on Oct. 8 at 5:30 p.m., with a larger event featuring members of Congress and other D.C. figures to follow Oct. 9.

GU Fossil Free — a student campaign asking Georgetown to divest from investments in fossil fuel companies — has gathered 1,400 signatures on a petition to hold a student-wide referendum on the issue later this fall.
The group launched its divestment campaign last January by presenting a proposal to University President John J. DeGioia, which outlined a plan for the university to abandon its investments in fossil fuel companies. Details of the university’s investments are not public.
However, after meeting with administrators, including Chief Investment Officer Michael Barry, Chief Operating Office Chris Augostini and Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson last spring, GU Fossil Free has modified its position to focus on staged divestment.
“They wanted to initiate a dialogue with us to figure out how to move this conversation forward in a positive way,” Patricia Cipollitti (SFS ’15), a student involved in GU Fossil Free, said. “They basically told us divestment is very difficult logistically but that’s it feasible in the future.”
While referendums have traditionally been brought forth by Georgetown University Student Association leaders and through the GUSA senate, GU Fossil Free is pursuing a referendum independently of the student association, though it must gain GUSA senate approval. The “One Georgetown, One Campus” campaign against a satellite residence, though led mainly by GUSAmembers, has also emphasized its status as distinct from GUSA as a way of reinforcing its relevance to the student body.
Though GU Fossil Free initially planned on joining the upcoming Sept. 26 ballot, which will includeGUSA senate elections and a referendum on a proposed satellite residence, it was unable to get senate approval before the body went into recess Sunday. It is standard protocol for the GUSA senate to approve a referendum for a proposal with more than 300 signatures.
Daniel Dylewsky (COL ’15), a student involved in GU Fossil Free, acknowledged that concurrent referendums would have increased visibility and turnout for GU Fossil Free, if for the wrong reasons.
“I think it’ll be more difficult to generate the same amount of turnout, but this will give us more time to make people more aware of the issue,” Dylewsky said. “Maybe we’ll get more people voting who have a stronger opinion on the issue, rather than it just being next to the issue they really care about on the ballot.”
Fossil Free members hope to have a referendum before Thanksgiving and are looking to engage students further on the issue over the course of the semester through campaigns, speakers and panels.
“We will have a more targeted campaign, one that is more inclusive of other student voices because we want this to be a productive conversation with everyone,” Cipollitti said.
Regardless of its timing, GU Fossil Free members hope the referendum will bolster their cause with the student body and the administration.
“Our hope with the referendum is if we have official student support of the cause it’ll bolster our case with the administration,” Dylewsky said.
GUSA senate Speaker George Spyropoulos (COL ’14) supported the referendum, but noted that it would be more contentious than past referendums, like those gaging student support of Student Activities Fee Endowment reform and raising the evidentiary standard for on-campus disciplinary violations from “more likely than not” to “clear and convincing.”
“I think people will be more divided than they have been on other issues,” Spyropoulos said.
GUSA Secretary of Sustainability Gabe Pincus (SFS ’14) sees the referendum as an opportunity to raise awareness of sustainability issues on campus.
“We think it’s an important conversation that needs to be had about divestment, and if the referendum brings this to the forefront of the campus conversation, I think that’s fantastic,” Pincus said. “There needs to be a lot of conversation about what divestment entails both environmentally and also financially for the university.”
However, Pincus is wary of students voting on an issue they might not fully understand.
“I do think that the university responds to students when student voices are strong and unified,” he said. “My worry is that the campus hasn’t been engaged fully on the subject in a meaningful way where students are aware of all of the implications, of what divestment actually entails.”
Some students, including members of Young Americans for Liberty oppose divestment.
“I think the argument that we should divest the endowment of fossil fuels is an overreaction meant to embarrass the fossil fuel industry,” YAL President Mitchell Tu (SFS ’17) said.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh clarified the university’s continued consideration of GU Fossil Free’s proposal.
“Our Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility is currently reviewing the proposal from the Fossil Free group, and senior leaders continue to engage in thoughtful dialogue with the group. Georgetown is very proud of its record on sustainability both in its business practices and academic initiatives,” Pugh wrote in an email.
GU Fossil Free will be able to renew their referendum efforts when the new GUSA senate is elected and sworn in over the next few weeks.

Rather than complaining about Lauinger Library’s architecture, students will now be able to give more constructive feedback through the Student Library Council, an initiative started by library staff this year.
The council is open to undergraduate and graduate representatives from the four undergraduate schools, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Continuing Studies. Graduate students and undergraduates will be equally represented and will serve alongside four library staff members.
Currently, the main campus library system, which governs Lauinger, Blommer and Woodstock, receives suggestions through the Georgetown Ideas online platform, from the student representative on the Faculty Advisory Committee and individual students who approach staff members.
“[It was] very ad hoc,” Library Coordinator of Communications, Outreach and Programming Jennifer Smith said. “We wanted people to know where they could go so we can hopefully take a more proactive approach in responding to them.”
The council, which will meet once a month, will have three primary roles. Members will relay student ideas, provide feedback and address needs; serve as liaisons between the student body and the library system; and discuss effective communication on both sides.
“The agenda will be very student driven,” Smith said, adding that the council will elect a president and vice president.
The library seeks to add 20 students to the committee, which will have appointed representatives from the Georgetown University Student Association and the Graduate Student Organization. SCS is included, though it moved to a new location downtown this semester, as the school’s library is included in the main campus system. The Georgetown University Law Center has its own library, with a student advisory council that served as a model for main campus.
“The focus of the council seems to be for advocacy. Students recognize changes need to be happening,” Seamus Guerin (COL ’16), the appointee to the council, said. “There’s also more potential for programming. They cited that Club Lau is the only programming going on here.”
A mix of majors and interests will be represented in the council, whose inaugural meeting will take place Oct. 7. Applications are due Friday.
Smith said the difference between the nascent council and the Faculty Library Advisory Committee is that the latter is focused on issues related to research and the tenure track, whereas the new body will focus more on student needs and space.
Applicant Dan Silkman (COL ’15) expressed excitement over the library’s move.
“I just saw the library as being one of the places on campus where admins were really responsive, and I thought it was inspiring,” he said. “The formalization is really cool because it’s nice to take the ideas from [Georgetown Ideas], but it might not be enough to have those conversations as to how we can improve the academic life and capacity of the library.”
Silkman pointed to specific areas of improvement.
“I would prioritize study space, sort of a small breakout room, upkeep,” he said. “I think this is a great thing that the library is doing and I can only see good things coming from it.”

Two active-duty soldiers will finish a 185-mile, seven-day run on Copley Lawn on Saturday to raise money to assist wounded veterans.
Since the event’s inception four years ago, two soldiers, accompanied by a bicycle support group, have annually run the entire length of the C&O Canal Trail, a 185 mile-long path. The two runners will speak at Saturday’s event, along with other veterans, followed by a performance by the U.S. Army Silent Drill Team. This year’s runners are David Brown and Michael Rychlik.
“I have been a support guy for infantry units almost my whole career and I know many soldiers that have been injured or have made the ultimate sacrifice,” Rychlik said in a statement on the 185 for Heroes blog. “I could not pass up the chance to give back to them for all they have given us.”
185 for Heroes works in conjunction with Georgetown University Running Club leadership to coordinate the event, which raises money and awareness for Operation Second Chance, an organization that assists wounded servicemen and servicewomen at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and helps them transition back to civilian life.
“I am always in awe of the work and dedication of our military service members,” said GURC member James Allen (COL ’16), who organized the event. “As college students, we are so removed from the reality that faces many people our age. Every year, the 185-mile runners approach this seemingly impossible task with an attitude of total confidence and an inability to accept failure.”
The Georgetown University Student Veterans Association has partnered with 185 for Heroes and the Running Club to help publicize the event among the veteran population, which includes 500 students across the undergraduate and graduate schools.
“We’re really more of a support role,” GUSVA President Zach Zimmerman (MSB ’14) said. “We hope to see at least 20 to 40 people there; last year, we had about 100.”
Allen said that the event provides perspective for students who may not be familiar with the experiences of veteran soldiers.
“They approach all obstacles with this mentality and are an inspiration to me in my daily life which seems trivial by comparison,” Allen said.
Allen said he hopes to expand the annual event in the future so the work of servicemen can continue to be recognized and honored.
“I hope to make this event bigger every year and eventually make it the premier military tribute for Georgetown’s academic year,” Allen said.

Former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan Ryan Crocker and Chair of the International Relations at Boston University Andrew Bacevich weighed the pros and cons of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and cautioned against going to war too quickly at an event in Lohrfink Auditorium on Tuesday.
The event was held at the invitation of School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster and the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Vice President for New Initiatives Aaron David Miller and was the first discussion in a series to be co-sponsored with the Woodrow Wilson Center that will address key foreign policy challenges facing the United States.
Robin Wright, a Wilson Center distinguished scholar at the United States Institute of Peace, moderated the event, which explored how to bring clarity and honesty to discussion of war and intervention.
Wright began by citing Crocker’s and Bacevich’s personal experiences with service in Iraq and by asking them if the war in Iraq was justified.
Crocker, who is also dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, said that the future trajectory of Iraq is unclear.
“I am not sure that we have placed enough emphasis on the strategic framework agreement that might help Iraq deal with its problems,” Crocker said. “There are no short answers. These are complex questions. Is everything ever worth that number of casualties? It’s a hard thing to answer.”
Bacevich, who wrote “Breach of Trust: How Americans Failed Their Soldiers and Their Country,” firmly believes that the Iraq war was not worth it.
“We should judge a war by the purpose by which the war was undertaken and whether that purpose is fulfilled,” Bacevich said. “Are we making the region more stable? Are we making the region more democratic? Are we persuading the people who live in that part of the world to hold the United States in warm regard? I think the answer to those questions is obvious: No.”
Bacevich and Crocker also discussed what should be done in Syria. Wright asked them what they would say in a memo to the President.
Crocker said that the United States must proceed with caution. He emphasized containment over intervention, a point with which Bacevich agreed.
“We do not know the ground rules in Syria. It is an enormous human tragedy that we cannot fix militarily, and we would be fools to try.” Crocker said. “When it comes to national interest of the United States, Mr. President, I think you’d rather be considered heartless than mindless.”
The rest of the discussion focused on other complex issues in the region, such as problems in Iran and Israel. Bacevich and Crocker focused on the necessity of careful consideration before policy formation, understanding of adversarial forces and what constitutes American credibility in foreign affairs.
“Wars are evil,” Bacevich noted. “There can, however, be necessary wars.”
As a Syrian citizen, Sebastian Nicholls (SFS ’16) found the discussion of issues in the Middle East relevant and necessary and welcomed the event’s nonpartisan nature.
“[It] provided a very thoughtful discussion of wars, presenting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as they are, without the glory that politicians attribute and with a clarity that is rarely, if ever, seen in the media,” Nicholls said. “It was a frank discussion, and the conversation allowed essential points to become clear.”

Chelsea Clinton was among a group of global leaders who convened in Riggs Library on Wednesday to cap the World Economic Forum’s 2013 Global Agenda Council on Values, where experts drafted a document that proposed ways to rebuild trust between business, government and society earlier this week.
The event, “The New Social Covenant: Committing to Human Dignity and Common Values in the Global Economy,” which was sponsored by the World Economic Forum, marked the conclusion of a two-day symposium.
To write the New Social Covenant, various experts privately convened at Georgetown Monday and Tuesday to work on the literature that was first presented in Davos, Switzerland in January. The covenant calls for businesses, government, religious groups and citizens to agree to universal ethical values, reduce inequality in the workforce and prioritize environmental concerns.
“The historic social contract between business, government and society seems to be broken, and the legitimacy of corporations has reached a low point,” the covenant reads.
The event’s three conversations in Riggs highlighted different aspects of the collapse and intended rebuilding of a social contract.
Council Vice Chair Michael Gerson, a columnist for The Washington Post and senior advisor to the ONE Campaign, interviewed Diana Farrell, director of McKinsey & Company and former deputy director of the National Economic Council. Farrell spoke about economic policies, especially in relation to corporations, whose social responsibility departments, she said, merely plastered over problems.
“The most important thing is inequality within wage compensation,” Farrell said. “It’s a technology story, an automation story, but I would argue that it’s a societal tolerance story.”
Farrell described a shift from a society that has a market economy to a market society, where all aspects of life are reduced to numbers and monetary values.
“People who have less have even less access,” she said.
Farrell said that these pressing issues are increasingly being raised but that too few resources exist to meet these challenges. She highlighted the importance of innovation and trust-building in government.
“The strength and weakness of the U.S. system is that government was established here as the trustee of the status quo,” Farrell said.
After Farrell and Gerson spoke, University President John J. DeGioia conversed with Clinton, who was representing the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. The two discussed the role of philanthropy in relation to the New Social Covenant.
“Delineating the responsibility of government versus business versus philanthropy is really important,” Clinton said. “What gets rendered unto whom is important … because we can hold these institutions accountable.”
Clinton, who expressed her initial desire to follow a different path from her parents’ political careers, largely discussed the work of the Clinton Foundation as an example of philanthropic responsibility.
“I don’t think we’re short on optimism or ambition, admittedly. I think we have a sense of things we can’t do, though,” she said. “We try to be really judicious [and try] to have other people solve problems [when] we’re not the right actor.”
The last conversation took place between keynote speaker Jim Wallis, the president of Sojourners magazine and council chair, and Stewart Wallis, the executive director of the New Economic Foundation, of no relation to Jim Wallis.
Stewart Wallis spoke about the degradation of values in the economic system.
“I would say we’ve got markets as religion and I think that’s very dangerous,” he said.
Jim Wallis advocated a “wisdom-based economy.”
“Let’s not have a values seminar every year at Davos and then go back to our places of work and not see anything change,” he said. “I’ve learned most about the world from being in places I wasn’t supposed to be or with people I wasn’t supposed to ever meet.”

Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who headed the Bureau for 12 years until Sept. 4, will be Georgetown’s first distinguished executive-in-residence, a position created specifically for him.
The new position will not be affiliated with any specific academic department. Mueller will serve as a resource for faculty and will advise University President John J. DeGioia, who personally interviewed Mueller before hiring him. Mueller will not receive a salary.
“The distinguished executive-in-residence is really meant to confer that he’s going to be a resource for our community, rather than calling him a professor,” said Joseph Ferrara, DeGioia’s chief of staff. “He will engage with the leadership of the university, with our faculty, with our students.”
Mueller said this engagement would focus on the issues he dealt with as director of the FBI, according to a university press release.
“There are four areas that I’m interested in: national security, cyber security, organizations in transition and leadership,” Mueller said. “I’ve been very fortunate to have experience in these areas, and I’m looking forward to having the opportunity to discuss these issues with students and faculty.”
Mueller took office as FBI director seven days before the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. His tenure as director was extended by Congress from the usual 10 years to 12 for his distinguished service running the organization. Before serving as director of the FBI, Mueller was in the Marine Corps in Vietnam and worked as a lawyer for the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney’s Office.
Bruce Hoffman, director of Georgetown’s Center for Peace and Security Studies and the Security Studies Program, described Mueller as one of the FBI’s most effective directors.
“His assumption of a new key leadership role at a time of national crisis is inspirational and contains important lessons for Georgetown students who will go forth to assume important responsibilities at a time of other formidable challenges,” Hoffman wrote in an email. “Speaking for the Security Studies Program, we can’t think of anyone better to have on campus to teach and interact with our students and serve as a role model as they forge their own careers.”
Ferrara said Mueller has expressed interest in teaching, although his experience running an organization like the FBI will be an asset to the university outside of the classroom.
“He can be an executive resource to help advise our president, our board,” Ferrara said. “He has a lot of expertise dealing with, for example, cyber security issues.”
Mueller will also return to practicing law in the Washington, D.C. area and will be settling into Georgetown in the next few weeks.

To encourage students to reflect on how they can best serve others, Campus Ministry has invited author Jay Sullivan to share his experiences volunteering at an all-boys orphanage in Jamaica on Monday.
After graduating from Boston College, Sullivan volunteered teaching high school in Jamaica through the Boston College Volunteer Corp, now the Jesuit Volunteer Corp, and eventually moved into the Jamaican orphanage.
“In every Jesuit high school, the students have to do social outreach work, even in a poor country like Jamaica,” Sullivan said. “I started bringing my students to Alpha Boy’s School … and after a year I asked the nuns if I could just move in. It was a way to immerse myself in working with the kids.”
Together with a handful of nuns and staff members, Sullivan helped care for more than 250 children during his time in Jamaica. After returning to the United States and becoming a lawyer, Sullivan resolved to find a way to support the orphanage.
“I decided I should just write a book about the work that goes on at the orphanage,” Sullivan said. “It’s about how different people who pass through the orphanage try to make a connection, and make a difference.”
Sullivan’s memoir, “Raising Gentle Men: Lives at the Orphanage Edge,” recounts his experiences volunteering at the Alpha Boys’ School, an orphanage in Kingston, Jamaica, between 1984 and 1985. All proceeds from the sale of his book will go to the orphanage.
To promote the book, which came out in March, Sullivan reached out to various Jesuit colleges and universities, and was eventually invited by Georgetown’s Campus Ministry to give a talk on campus.
Sullivan’s talk is being organized by Josh Evans, the chaplain-in-residence for Alumni Square and townhouses. Evans said that Sullivan’s story is in line with Georgetown’s mission and values.
“The event is an occasion for people to come and hear a story of someone who dedicated a couple of years of his life to serving others,” Evans said. “Through that, students can see a way to understand their own lives. By hearing someone’s story, you can place yourself in it and see how it relates to your own life. The idea is to provoke students to think about their own lives and how they can serve others.”
Evans added that the book addresses racial and class issues, which may be of interest to students.
“He weaves the story in with a lot of themes related to social justice,” Evans said. “He tries to say that this experience reveals a new perspective on how to talk about our identities.”
Sullivan said that he plans to incorporate themes of identity, purpose and community into his talk Monday, and to discuss the relevance of his book to college students.
“College is that in between period when you’re going to be out on your own for the first time,” Sullivan said. “It’s a huge time when people are doing a lot of soul-searching, so you’re realizing, I have to start having an identity on my own.”
Sullivan will speak Monday at 7 p.m. in White-Gravenor Hall 211.

In order to alleviate resident-student tensions, The George Washington University has instituted a mandatory “good neighbor” tutorial for students.
Using a platform similar to AlcoholEdu, the tutorial teachesGWU students about city laws and guidelines for proper neighborly behavior. The GW Hatchet reported that the university instituted the tutorial in response to neighbors’ complaints that students needed to behave in a more adult manner.
This is the GWU administration’s latest move in addressing neighbors’ concerns over rowdy student behavior. Over the summer, GWU instituted a policy that, starting with the Class of 2018, students must live on campus for three years. Forty percent of GWU students currently live off campus after their sophomore year.
Georgetown, despite its often difficult neighborhood relations, has not implemented such an official tutorial, although, when asked about the tutorial, Interim Office of Neighborhood Life Director Cory Peterson expressed high hopes for his newly restructured office’s new approach to orientation, devised this summer.
Peterson has started introducing ONL representatives to floor meetings in freshman and sophomore dorms to educate younger students about off-campus life. All off-campus students must attend an orientation with the ONL focusing on safety and interactions with neighbors and police.
Associate Vice President for Community Engagement and Strategic Initiatives Lauralyn Lee added that, in comparison to the GWU policy, the ONL’s orientation aims to educate, not manage.
“We don’t view it as, ‘We need to have orientation so students can act like adults,’” Lee said. “We view it as, ‘Students are adults, and we want them to have the tools they need to operate in an adult world.’”
Peterson pointed to the office’s new Hoya Living Guide as an example, in which students learn basic rules of off-campus living such as trash pickup and emergency preparedness. With regard to noise and party control, apartment and townhouse residents must undergo mandatory “I Know How to Party” training prior to throwing parties.

The Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance Georgetown University Law Center professor Cornelia “Nina” Pillard’s nomination for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to the full Senate on Thursday, and Georgetown Law students have banded together to show their support through Hoya Lawyers for Nina Pillard.
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10-8 along party lines in favor of Pillard’s nomination. The full Senate must now approve Pillard’s nomination with at least 51 votes out of 100, although 60 votes are required to pass a cloture motion, which would protect the nomination from a filibuster.
Before the vote Thursday, Hoya Lawyers for Nina Pillard launched www.confirmpillard.com, along with a Facebook page, Twitter account and Google+ page. The website invites visitors to sign a statement of support.
According to group member Bradley Girard (LAW ’14), the group has expanded into the hundreds, although he was unsure of exact numbers, and the statement has received a similar number of signatures.
Although Hoya Lawyers for Nina Pillard has not formed any official partnerships with on-campus organizations, Girard said that several groups have offered support. In particular, several faith groups have organized to write an interfaith letter of support.
Girard added that the group had been confident that Pillard’s nomination would pass the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the group believes Pillard would pass the full Senate vote as well.
“She has a broad base of support, including some pretty prominent conservatives and people who fall on all sides of the ideological spectrum,” Girard said. “Not only is she a highly accomplished lawyer and really fair-minded, she’s very committed.”
In contrast, the Blog of LegalTimes reported that several Republican members, such as ranking member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), were wary of Pillard during the committee vote.
Grassley said that he thought President Barack Obama was attempting to “pack” the D.C. Circuit Court, with Pillard as the second of three Obama nominees to the D.C. Circuit court.
“The justification for moving forward with additional D.C. Circuit nominees appears to be a desire and intent to pack the court in order to determine the outcome of cases this court hears,” Grassley said during the vote. “It is no secret that this is the president’s intent.”
Democrats, however, have countered that filling vacancies is not “packing” the court. Rather, they claim that it is filling a need and alleviating the workload on the remaining members of the 11-judge court.
According to the LegalTimes, if the Republicans threaten again to filibuster or block Obama’s current three nominees to the D.C. Circuit court, Senate Democrats will threaten to change the Senate’s filibuster rules with regard to confirmation votes.
Regardless of Obama’s intent, however, other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee were wary of Pillard’s qualifications. Although Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said he respected Pillard’s skills as an attorney and that he attempted to avoid party loyalty biases, he said he thought Pillard’s views were too “political activist.”
“Her writings … do not simply take a liberal position but adopt a rigid ideology that clearly drives not only her view of the law but even her understanding of social facts,” Hatch said during the vote.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), however, argued that the same could be said of previous Republican nominees. Possessing strong political opinions is not paradoxical to being a fair judge, Feinstein said.
“I guess Republicans tend to believe the Democratic nominees who have a position on controversial issues cannot be fair judges, and yet, when the reverse happens, they all believe activist Republicans can be a fair judge,” Feinstein said. “I voted for some of [those Republicans], there’s no question of that, because I believe they can.”
The date for Pillard’s vote in front of the full Senate has not been announced.
