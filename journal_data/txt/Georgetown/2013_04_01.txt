The space that formerly housed Chinese restaurant Mie N Yu will reportedly be occupied by an Irish pub.
According to local blog the Georgetown Metropolitan, an Irish pub chain is planning to take over the location at 3125 M St. N.W., which has been empty since October 2012.
Mie N Yu closed last year after nearly ten years of business in Georgetown and was one of several eateries that shut its doors in 2012.
