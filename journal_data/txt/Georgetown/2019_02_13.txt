About 85 students are being relocated from their top-floor apartments in Alumni Square to the Georgetown Hotel and Conference Center this week after university administrators informed them about potential structural issues in their apartment roofs Monday morning.
The university decided to relocate students after a structural engineering firm conducted roof inspections last week because of concerns over moisture buildup and pressure on the roof in the case of snow or strong winds, according to a Monday email to all affected students from University Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Geoffrey Chatas and Provost Robert Groves.
Although the students in the top floor apartments are facing no immediate concerns, they are being relocated as a precautionary measure to ensure their safety, according to Vice President for Facilities and Management Benjamin Kuo.
“Structural engineers identified that heavy loading on the roof, such as significant snow or extreme high wind events, may place pressure on the rafters,” Kuo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Because of the unpredictability of future weather, we have decided to relocate these residents and begin repairs.”
Students must leave their dorms by 6 p.m. on Friday. Relocated students who do not receive scholarship aid for housing are set to be refunded housing credit for the spring semester, according to Monday’s email.
Students living on lower floors in Alumni Square are safe to remain in their apartments, according to Kuo.
“Structural engineers have confirmed that there are no structural concerns impacting the lower units,” Kuo wrote. “As repair work commences, we will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the work is minimally disruptive to lower-level occupants.”
A separate email was sent Monday to Alumni Square residents living on lower floors informing them that roof inspections of their buildings will be conducted on a daily basis.
Facilities has also reviewed all other residence halls on campus and did not find any similar issues, according to Kuo.
Administrators informed students of initial roof inspections of their apartments in an email last fall. This earlier email did not mention the possibility of relocation in the spring.
Relocated students have been given the option to move off campus for the remainder of the semester, or can choose to move out of the hotel to off-campus housing at any point in the semester without needing to pay the university. This option is not feasible because of the short notice of the relocation, even if students do have the funds to afford off-campus housing, said Tim Coan (SFS ’20), an Alumni Square resident being relocated.
“They only gave us four days to find off-campus housing, which they should know is not realistic,” Coan said. “They didn’t have any answers as to why they are moving us out now and why they had waited so long.”
Coan, who studied abroad last semester, said he did not understand why the university would place students coming back from their semester abroad into housing that had already experienced issues in the past.
“The university will come to us and tell to us to our face that they really care about us as people, but when it comes down to it, they generally don’t really care about our housing situations, and they haven’t shown any signs of fixing that,” Coan said. 
Following an information session and question and answer period held Monday, the university sent an email Tuesday extending the deadline for moving out by five hours and offering on-campus, long-term and mailing storage options the university will underwrite.
The university is also offering affected students the All Access 7 Meal Plan, the most expensive meal plan option, for free for the rest of the semester as well as an additional $200 in flex dollars. Students also have the option to convert this meal plan option entirely into flex, Stephanie Lynch, assistant dean of student affairs, said at the Monday session.
Jeremy Cohen (SFS ’20), who has lived in his top-floor Alumni Square since last fall, said the relocation speaks to a larger infrastructure issue on Georgetown’s campus, which has already caused many difficulties for students.
“The fact that this isn’t the sort of issue that can wait until the end of the semester shows the gravity of the infrastructure problems Georgetown has,” Cohen said. “Georgetown needs to do whatever it needs to do to keep people safe, but then ultimately they aren’t recognizing the degree to which the switch really negatively impacts the side of student life.”
Georgetown has faced an increasing number of housing problems in student residences over the past year. Facilities responded to 361 mold-related work requests in residences between August and October of last year, more than double the number reported during that time frame in 2017, and students in Darnall and Reynolds Halls reported malfunctioning elevators this past fall.
Students who receive scholarships or financial aid will not be receiving a housing credit following the relocation.
Aleida Olvera (COL ’20), Georgetown University Student Association vice president-elect, was not affected by the Alumni Square relocation, but attended Monday’s information session for relocated students.
The university should be doing more for low-income students affected by the relocation, Olvera said.
“3.1 percent of the students come from the bottom 20 percent, and it’s ridiculous that the administration is not caring about this 3.1 percent, when we are students here at Georgetown,” Olvera said. “We are going to be working really hard to ensure that this is something that’s going to be addressed and that the university will be held accountable.”
Cohen agreed the university has underestimated the full burden of the relocation on students, financially or otherwise.
“I think the level of compensation that they’re giving is sort of the barebones financial side of it, whereas ultimately people aren’t paying for just the material housing, but paying for everything that comes with it,” Cohen said. “No one wants to be a junior or a senior living in what’s effectively worse than freshman housing.”

The representation of Yemeni women in peace negotiations is necessary to put an end to the Yemeni conflict, Yemen’s former Minister for Human Rights Amat Alsoswa said at an event Friday.
Hosted by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, the event, titled “Prospects for Peace in Yemen,” was held in Riggs Library. The event was moderated by former U.S. Ambassador to Yemen Barbara Bodine and former U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues Melanne Verveer. 
Although women in the Middle East are often portrayed by Western media as voiceless and powerless, international acceptance of these generalizations as being the norm only further entrench inequality, according to Alsoswa.
“Yemeni women are unfortunately sometimes not seen the way they are. They are projected only within those stereotypical features about them, especially that most of the Yemeni women choose to wear — when they choose, of course — to wear this long black cover to cover their bodies with it,” Alsoswa said. “When they picture them like this, they think of them as very passive, very backward.”
In 2011, Yemeni community organizations moved against then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s rule during the Change Square protests. Yemeni women participated in these protests, which included advocacy for issues such as maternal mortality and ending child marriage in addition to anti-regime action, the New Yorker reported. 
Stereotypical characterizations of Yemeni women are inaccurate and overshadow the efforts of women who participated in civil disobedience prior to 2015, according to Alsoswa. 
“And they forget to see that Yemeni women, prior to the war for example, were participating, not only in the Change Square. I mean, their participation in the Change Square was just the latest wave of this massive woman movement,” Alsoswa said.
The Yemeni conflict escalated in 2015 when a group of Houthis, Zaydi Shia muslims from Northern Yemen, forced Yemen’s president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, out of the capital city, to the city of Aden. Saudi Arabian involvement in the conflict began with Hadi’s exile and has since led to naval blockades that exacerbated humanitarian crises, such as a 2017 outbreak of cholera. The physical conflict as well as infrastructure problems and attacks by the Islamic State have led to the displacement of three million people and over 5,900 civilian deaths, according to Amnesty International.
Political dialogue in the country cannot move forward unless women are granted a seat at the negotiating table, a step forward that both the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels have refused to take, Alsoswa said. 
“The parties, most of the time, resist. They say, ‘No, no, no. It is not really the time for women to be brought here,’” Alsoswa said. “The Yemeni women are not going to accept that. And definitely, there will be no peace agreement that is going to be fully implemented or implemented to start with if women are not accepted.” 
Seventy-six percent of displaced Yemeni people are women and children, and approximately 21 percent of displaced households are run by women who are under the age of 18, according to a 2018 report by the United Nations Population Fund. Reports of gender-based violence in Yemen also increased by 36 percent in 2017.
As neither party in the conflict seems to have any invested interest in combating gender inequalities and human rights abuses towards women, it is paramount that women join the conversation, Alsoswa said. 
“The fighters now are not unfortunately those who believe in equal rights or women’s rights, but rather sectarian lines where women are unfortunately not respected too much or politicized at best,” Alsoswa said. “But Yemeni women were teachers at universities. They were lawyers. They were judges. They were journalists.”
While Yemeni women must take individual initiative in agitating for greater representation and rights, the international community must take action not to perpetuate the conflict as well, according to Alsoswa. 
Alsoswa argued that the inclusion of women in the conversation should give both Yemenis and the international community a reason for hope although conditions in Yemen may not seem conducive to long-lasting peace.
“The resistance you get from civil society organizations and young females in Yemen is really stronger than ever. Yes, they need a lot of help, but they are going to continue to work,” Alsoswa said. “They are truly going to be the ones who will really build peace.”

Ted Leonsis (CAS ’77), founder and owner of Monumental Sports and Entertainment, donated $100,000 to help cover the costs of conducting repairs to the Fort Dupont Ice Arena, Washington, D.C.’s only full-size skating rink.  
The NHL and MSE, which owns and operates the Washington Capitals, D.C.’s professional ice hockey team, will also each donate $100,000 for a total of $300,000. The proceeds are supplemented by a GoFundMe, launched Feb. 3, and will go toward a half-a-million-dollar fundraiser designed to help the nonprofit organization Friends of Dupont Ice Arena, which operates the rink. 
The Fort Dupont Ice Arena, which is located in Ward 7, was set to receive $25 million from the city, according to The Washington Post. However, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) asked the D.C. Council to reallocate funds originally intended for the rink to cover emergency repairs at District schools and recreation facilities Jan. 25. 
A council vote on the issue was delayed until Feb. 19 as a result of negotiations with the Bowser administration, according to the D.C. Council website. 
While fixing facilities issues at public schools is necessary, providing a safe place for low-income students to go to after school is equally vital, according to Jimmy Lynn, a Georgetown adjunct professor in the McDonough School of Business who was a mentee of Leonsis. 
“It’s a rundown neighborhood and is pretty dangerous,” Lynn said. “With the help of organizations like the Capitals and the Nationals, though, they become areas where kids and families can go after school and it provides a safe environment. The area becomes an anchor.”
Leonsis’ background serves as an example of why support for community projects should be a priority, according to Lynn.
“Ted grew up in Brooklyn to a family of Greek immigrants and was lost at Georgetown at first but was mentored by a Jesuit Reverend Joseph Durkin and eventually graduated first of his class in 1977,” Lynn said. “He never forgot to give back.” 
The Fort Dupont Cannons, the oldest minority hockey club in North America, rent their ice time at the Fort Dupont Ice Arena. The Cannons helped form the NHL’s “Hockey Is for Everyone” initiative in the 1990s with the aim of fostering positive social change.
Currently, 40 program centers participate in the Cannons’ initiative, providing 8,000 children an opportunity to play hockey annually, according to Kim Davis, NHL executive vice president of social impact, growth and legislative affairs.
“The ripple effect of the program, particularly inside the Beltway, is so strong and consistent that the rise of support for this initiative is unsurprising. In hockey, safe and welcoming infrastructure is necessary for providing and expanding programming for our youth,” Davis wrote in an email to The Hoya.  
The Fort Dupont skating rink and other communities around the country with similar stories will continue to be funded by the NHL, according to Davis. 
The NHL recognizes Leonsis’ involvement in community building and seeks to recognize the diversity of its fanbase, Davis said. 
“We are living in a time where people are looking for real, authentic relationships. The Capitals and Ted Leonsis are a great example of doing well and doing good,” Davis wrote. “The Club has worked diligently to cultivate new community partnerships that will build trust and loyalty to their brand over time.”
This article was updated Feb. 13 to correct the relationship between Leonsis and Lynn.

The International Spy Museum is set to move from its former location in Penn Quarter to L’Enfant Plaza in May to accommodate recently acquired artifacts as well as updated intelligence technology. 
The museum’s previous location closed Jan. 1. L’Enfant Plaza will most likely become the museum’s permanent location, according to Aliza Bran, public relations and marketing coordinator for the museum. The new location is expected to receive around 700,000 visitors this upcoming year, an uptick of 100,000 visitors from last year’s estimates, according to the Washington Business Journal. The new location is planned to open May 11.
These artifacts will join the museum’s collection of intelligence technology and memorabilia. Additions to the collection include a piece of the Berlin Wall and displays of updated cyber-technology systems, according to an Oct. 3 news release. The new location is also slated to feature an additional educational room and a larger event hall than the previous location.
Along with receiving physical upgrades, the museum also plans to revamp internal infrastructure to approach the topic of intelligence with more depth, according to Bran.
“We will be able to take on the topic of intelligence in a bit more of a holistic way, looking at the intelligence process and how that works,” Bran said in an interview with The Hoya. “We get to talk about analysis, what analysts do. That’s of course a big part of the intelligence process, and we didn’t really have the space to get into it in our last home.”
The museum intends to restructure current exhibits to create a better flow between the permanent exhibits. The larger space will allow the museum to rotate temporary exhibits more frequently to cover a wider range of intelligence topics, according to Bran.
In addition to the exhibit space, the museum also plans to offer new and updated versions of educational programs and workshops for varying ages. Topics for these educational programs include a look at revolutionary war spies and their contribution to American victory in the war, according to Bran. The workshops are expected to be a continuation of the programs from the previous location where various skills, such as how to create invisible ink, were taught to visitors.
With the new space, the Spy Museum is also undertaking new programs that were unavailable at its former location. Initiatives include a new volunteer program that allows students to work directly with the museum and get involved with former intelligence officials and officers who now work at the museum. A volunteer open house is currently set to be held Feb. 27, according to the museum’s website.
The museum also plans to revitalize its summer camp program for children in the summer of 2020, as the process of moving the museum forced the museum to stop the camp for the first time since its creation, according to Bran.
The Spy Museum previously served as a resource to bring new investment into the Penn Quarter, according to Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D).
“The District of Columbia is very pleased to bring an expanded Spy Museum to L’Enfant Plaza- permanently,” Bowser said in a 2016 news release. “We are fortunate to be able to retain this important resource that was such a catalyst for new investment in Penn Quarter.”
News of the museum’s turnover comes after the recent announcement that the Newseum, another paid museum in D.C., was searching for a new home after Johns Hopkins bought the museum’s former building.

A bill that mandates federal workspaces to provide a designated nonbathroom space for guests and visitors to pump breast milk passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Feb. 6. 
The bill was introduced by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) on Jan. 30 and is the second breastfeeding-specific bill to ever pass the floor of either house of Congress as a standalone measure, according to the United States Breastfeeding Committee, a nonprofit that seeks to expand support for breastfeeding. 
The Affordable Care Act, a 2010 law which overhauled the health care system and expanded medical coverage, already requires federal buildings to provide employees with lactation spaces.
Unsupportive work policies and a lack of parental leave are potential causes behind the 60 percent of reported mothers who did not breastfeed for as long as they intended to, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The benefits of breastfeeding for both mothers and babies warrant expanding access to lactation spaces in federal buildings to visitors, according to Norton. 
“Given the significant health benefits of breastfeeding for both baby and mother already recognized in Federal policy, my bill is a logical step to ensure that visitors to Federal sites have access to clean, hygienic and private spaces to nurse or pump,” Norton said in a Feb. 2 news release. 
The proposed legislation, titled The Fairness For Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2019, would not require any additional spaces to be built, only that space be set aside for visitors as needed, Norton said in a Feb. 6 House session. 
Providing spaces for visitors to breastfeed and pump milk will highlight the necessity of supporting women and families, according to Michelle Stulberger. Stulberger is the director of business operations for Metropolitan Breastfeeding, a D.C. provider of breastfeeding support and consultation.
“The health benefits of breastfeeding are well-documented, and by providing space for visitors to federal buildings to pump or breastfeed we as a society continue to affirm the importance of supporting breastfeeding families,” Stulberger wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The bill was previously passed by a House of Representatives composed of a Republican majority in 2017 before failing to pass the U.S. Senate. The bill has garnered support in the current house, which has a Democratic majority. 
Norton’s law also requires lactation spaces to be accessible to individuals with disabilities under the Architectural Barriers Act, which requires federal spaces and buildings to be accessible to individuals with disabilities whenever possible. 
The bill includes exceptions for buildings that do not already contain a lactation room for employees or any space that could be repurposed at a reasonable cost. 
The high volume of visitors Washington, D.C., experiences annually makes it crucial that federally owned buildings have lactation spaces for nursing mothers, according to Norton.
“Considering that millions of people visit federal sites across the country, particularly here in the nation’s capital, it is essential that we ensure nursing mothers have access to designated, private and hygienic lactation spaces in our federally owned or leased buildings.” Norton said in a Feb. 6 news release. 
The first bill introduced specifically on breastfeeding was the Breastfeeding Promotion Act of 2003, which proposed an amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include lactation as a protected civil right. The bill was later referred to the House of Representatives subcommittee on employer-employee relations.
