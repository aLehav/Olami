D.C.’s Department of Health gave O’Donovan Hall a level three, or “moderate risk,” rating after its most recent inspection of the cafeteria, citing six critical violations of the D.C. Health Code.
According to the DoH’s report, six critical violations would typically result in the immediate closure of a facility. Georgetown’s dining hall was able to remain operative because it corrected two of the violations — improper separation and protection of different foods and the absence of a advisory notice warning diners about raw or undercooked foods — during the course of the inspection.
Other violations identified during the Sept. 4 inspection included unclean food surfaces, improper temperatures for holding cold food, the fact that some employees did not wear hair restraints, worn-out cutting boards, a lack of chemical strips for testing sanitizing solutions and a broken walk-in cooler. Of these, two were deemed “non-critical” violations.
Leo’s was also given a level three risk rating at its previous inspection, conducted in September 2010. According to the District of Columbia Register, a level three rating indicates extensive handling of raw ingredients and the preparation or processing of potentially hazardous foods.
