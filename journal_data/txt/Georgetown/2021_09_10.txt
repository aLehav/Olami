Jack Buckley (MSB ’22) was standing outside the restaurant Clyde’s of Georgetown on M Street two weeks ago when he felt something suddenly hit the side of his body. 
To his surprise, it was a raw egg, splattered all over his clothes. 
The attack took place shortly after 11 p.m. on Aug. 26, according to Buckley, who said the unidentified perpetrator threw the egg out of the passenger side of a car window while driving past the restaurant. Buckley was not seriously injured, and he told The Hoya that amid the confusion, he was unable to identify the egger before they sped away in a red sedan. 
“I was drenched in egg yolk,” Buckley said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Clyde’s could not provide footage from their security cameras by the time of publication.
Buckley is not the only person who has recently gotten egged in the Georgetown neighborhood. Since June, The Hoya has verified at least six separate egging incidents, five of which have occurred in the last two weeks. Students and community members alike have become victims of these eggings. 
A more recent egging attack took place Sept. 2 outside Foxtrot Market on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown. Just before 9:15 p.m., Bobby Smallman (COL ’24) was sitting at a table outside the market when something flew past him, grazing his neck. He was shocked to realize it was a raw egg when it landed on the sidewalk nearby. 
The egg left a minor scrape, according to Smallman, who also witnessed a red sedan driving away after the attack. 
Smallman said he was surprised by the ambush. 
“I was just totally shocked. It didn’t even occur to me that I could get egged,” Smallman said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Smallman said he wishes he could have identified his attacker. 
“If I was picking a way to get egged, I think I’d rather see the person who egged me, to look him in the eyes,” Smallman said. 
A few minutes after Smallman was egged, Ben Finkelstein, a senior at Georgetown Day School, was also egged about four blocks up Wisconsin Avenue from Foxtrot. 
“It was just a wow-I-really-just-got-egged type of moment,” Finkelstein said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
On top of the Georgetown University students, Adam Veldman (SFS ’22), a host at the restaurant Clyde’s, reported to The Hoya that at least two people have also gotten egged on two separate occasions near the restaurant since the beginning of the fall semester.
Some Georgetown students have taken it upon themselves to identify the perpetrator. 
Jane MacRae (MSB ’23), a friend of Smallman’s, helped organize a stakeout at Foxtrot Market the night of Sept. 9 in hopes of identifying the perpetrator. Six Georgetown students, including Smallman and MacRae, attended. 
Although some students have found the situation comical, egging can have severe consequences. In some cases, egging has seriously injured people, including leaving some egging victims blinded. Bacteria in raw eggs, like salmonella, also presents the risk of illness. At minimum, perpetrators who egg other people can be charged with simple assault, according to Brianna Burch, a public affairs specialist at the Metropolitan Police Department. 
Cities only thrive when there is basic respect for each other, according to Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Commissioner Kishan Putta. 
“Whatever their intent is, the effect is clear,” Putta said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It makes people feel unsafe. It makes people feel on edge, which is exactly what we do not need during a pandemic.” 
Students in the neighborhood should take safety precautions, including avoiding walking alone at night and requesting a SafeRides safety shuttle; the university is also in contact with the Metropolitan Police Department, a university spokesperson told The Hoya. 
“We take these reports very seriously and urge any member of the Georgetown community who has been the victim of this, or any other criminal act, to report them to GUPD or reach out to the Metropolitan Police Department,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Smallman hopes to find the perpetrator quickly. 
“This isn’t an isolated event. We need to do something,” Smallman said.

We were walking on Reno road just now, just north of Porter, when a black Honda (I think a Civic) which had the new car paper license platea tried to egg my wife and I. Egg went right between us and missed.

I was egged today on the key bridge walking back from the AMC theater in Georgetown to Arlington. I believe it was a red hatchback instead of a sedan. The car had paper plates and I got a good look at the guy who did it.  I reported it to the police department so hopefully they catch the people who did it.

What if the egger is on the right side of justice, and we’re not.

Health Education Services has postponed required Sexual Assault Prevention trainings and AlcoholEdu, an alcohol safety course, for incoming students until mid-September.
HESs postponed the two online safety trainings for first-years and incoming transfer students until the week of Sept. 13, a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. In past years, HES required incoming first-years to complete these online workshops prior to arriving on campus. Now, incoming first-years will not receive these online trainings until the fourth week of classes.
The trainings are a part of the HoyUS program, a tiered educational module about interpersonal violence designed for incoming undergraduates and student leaders. The trainings, which students complete asynchronously, seek to educate students about how to build safe, healthy interpersonal relationships, as well as safely navigate alcohol and other substances.
Currently, some first-year students do not know how to report sexual assault on campus, according to first-year student Steven Chung (COL ’25).
“I barely have any insight or any information on where to get help for sexual assault, where to report sexual assault or where to go,” Chung said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Students are the most at risk for experiencing sexual assault during their first year on campus, and more than 50% of all sexual assault on college campuses takes place between August and November, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. Further, students are particularly vulnerable to binge drinking and unsafe alcohol practices during their first six weeks on campus, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
Many first-year students are also unfamiliar with U.S. legal procedures and resources, according to Chung, who is from South Korea.
“For international students who don’t really know a lot about American culture, ways that we can deal with sexual assault or just where to get help or deal with law, we’re just thrown into the deep end, and we don’t know what to do, and we have to kind of figure out on your own,” Chung said.
Upperclassmen are also uneasy about the delay. According to New Student Orientation Captain Elena Evans (NHS ’22), who organized orientation programming for incoming students, alcohol safety training is also imperative to first-years’ safety. 
“Especially this year knowing the dangers of alcohol is critical because many students have been cooped up and unable to go out and test their limits. Many students experience alcohol for the first time in college so they may not know that it needs to be used with care,” Evans wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Resident Assistant Lily Rubinstein (COL ’22) said the university should provide students with the proper sexual assault reporting training prior to beginning classes.
“They’re morally and ethically obligated to teach students so that they know, whether it’s for themselves or a friend,” Rubinstein said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Those are really important things to know when you get on campus, and it’s something that I’m really glad that I know so well and have been able to learn from other people.”
Due to the virtual 2020-21 academic year, all first-years, sophomores and transfer students — who had not yet experienced an in-person semester — will also be required to complete in-person bystander training. In the past, only first-years and transfers were required to attend. The university will host bystander trainings this semester, though the university has not set an exact date, according to a university spokesperson. 
Sara Collina, professor of women’s and gender studies and Title IX expert, said these trainings should take place at the beginning of each semester. 
“I think that the very first week of school would be the ideal time or in the context of orientation,” Collina said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The fall 2021 New Student Orientation occured in-person from Aug. 19 to 24. The schedule listed panels about racial justice, Jesuit values and health and wellness, but no events were explicitly devoted to sexual assault prevention or alcohol safety training. 
The sexual assault and alcohol safety trainings are important tools to help keep students safe and to help students support their peers, according to Rubinstein. 
“It’s super important that students are receiving that training to not only keep themselves safe, but part of bystander training was learning how to be a pro social bystander and support your peers — your friends,” Rubinstein said.
UPDATE: On Sept. 16, a university spokesperson emailed The Hoya to clarify why HES was unable to host trainings before students arrived on campus.
“The online training programs referenced in this article were delayed due to operational matters outside of Health Education Services’ (HES) control, including changes to the third-party training platform that required additional training and technical updates to ensure a high quality education program,” a spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Georgetown University will pilot a graduate student housing initiative fall 2022 following years of high housing costs through D.C. and calls from student leaders for university-sponsored housing.
Currently, the School of Continuing Studies offers an online platform through the Office of Neighborhood Life to direct graduate students to off-campus housing, as well as a housing fair that allows students to tour local apartment communities. The School of Medicine requires students to find off-campus housing on their own, while the Georgetown University Law Center offers on-campus housing for incoming law students. 
The Georgetown University Graduate Student Government believes affordable student housing in D.C. is a necessity and has called on the university to offer additional housing to graduate students, according to GradGov Chief of Staff Henry Watson (GRD ’24).
“Not only is housing in D.C. expensive, it can also be a real challenge to find appropriate housing and connect with roommates, especially for international students,” Watson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “University-sponsored housing would greatly reduce these difficulties.”
In 2019, the university approved funding for a residential building at 55 H St., near both the Georgetown University Law Center and the School of Continuing Studies. The building will accommodate 476 undergraduate and graduate students and offer students a closer location to many D.C. neighborhoods, including Capitol Hill. The building’s construction is expected to finish Feb. 2022, in time for use during the 2022-23 academic year. 
While the new residence will provide students access to more neighborhoods in D.C., the building is almost five miles from Georgetown’s main campus, so without university-provided metro passes for Georgetown students, it could cause accessibility difficulties for students, according to Watson. 
“Of course, a new downtown housing option does raise some transportation questions, and increases the impetus for a Georgetown U-Pass, another GradGov priority,” Watson wrote.
University housing is often very expensive and can create tensions between the university and students, so the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees does not support the university-sponsored graduate housing initiative, according to Jewel Tomasula (GRD ’22), chair of the GAGE Bargaining/Research Committee and Jeffrey Tsoi (LAW ’23, GRD ’26), GAGE’s secretary. 
“We can see from other urban universities that university-owned grad student housing is very expensive and creates the exploitative relationship where our employer is also our landlord,” Tomasula and Tsoi wrote. “Providing housing is a way for universities to get back the money they pay student workers.”
The housing initiative could also contribute to gentrification in D.C., according to Tomasula and Tsoi.
“For Georgetown-provided grad student housing to be an equitable and positive addition to the D.C. community, the project would need to center grad students with financial need and offer rent well below the current D.C. average,” Tomasula and Tsoi wrote. 
Administrators plan to release specific information regarding university housing to current and prospective students in the coming months, according to a university spokesperson.
“Georgetown plans to offer some apartment-style graduate housing in downtown DC next Fall,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This space is expected to shift over time and may serve different audiences in the coming years.”
Instead of funding housing, Tomasula and Tsoi hope the university will direct funding towards increasing Ph.D. stipends and hourly wages for master’s students.“During our 2020 contract campaign, we brought attention to how the majority of Georgetown grad student workers are rent burdened, and the majority spent over 50% of their pay on housing costs,” Tomasula and Tsoi wrote. “Our union membership has prioritized fighting for higher PhD stipends and hourly wages for Masters student workers, instead of Georgetown-owned grad student housing.”

Despite anticipation of an in-person homecoming weekend following virtual events last year, Georgetown University announced it would cancel celebrations because of concerns over the spread of COVID-19.
University administrators made the decision to cancel the annual celebration after Georgetown Vice President and Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Ranit Mishori (MED ’02) recommended all on-campus events limit size to mitigate any possible exposure to COVID-19. Typical celebrations often featured throngs of students congregating on the Village A rooftops, in addition to other graduate-related events, like distinguished graduate panels.
Administrators were principally concerned with COVID-19 safety protocols when making decisions around the event, according to an email to students announcing the cancellation of the event.
“In support of these guidelines and out of an abundance of caution, we have made the difficult decision to forego Homecoming Weekend this fall. Please know we remain committed to engaging and celebrating you and our alumni,” the email reads. 
While Elle Santry (COL ’21) understands the decision to cancel the event, she will still miss the opportunity to reunite with friends from her time at Georgetown.
“I understand that they don’t want COVID being spread to the campus but I feel like Georgetown keeps deciding to cancel instead of making any effort to make something work for us,” Santry wrote in a text message to The Hoya. “I was really looking forward to seeing all my friends who had graduated and finally being able to celebrate my time on campus in person after being online for a whole year.” 
While the move is disappointing for current students, the cancellation is especially frustrating for seniors who graduated last year, according to David Guttierez (SFS ’22). 
“Even outside of my class, the people that have graduated, they’re extremely frustrated with this too,” Gutierrez said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “They just graduated, they spent a year and a half in limbo, and they’re being told their first year out, ‘You don’t even get a graduation, you can’t even come back to campus to enjoy the one event that’s designed to bring you back to campus.” 
The move to cancel the 2021 celebrations marks the second year in a row that the annual festivities have been impacted by COVID-19. The 2020 homecoming celebrations were held from Oct. 22 to Oct. 25 and featured an all-virtual lineup of events. 
The typical scale of homecoming and the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic would have made it difficult to safely hold in-person events for seniors, according to Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22), a board member of the Senior Class Committee, which plans social events for the senior class, including programming during homecoming.
“We really try our best to make sure that all events we put on and anything we advertise is accessible, the most way possible, and that includes following COVID-related protocols,” Sanchez said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “So honestly, it would have been very difficult for us to execute any safe senior events anyway for homecoming given the scale and the amount of people traveling.” 
In place of the in-person celebrations, the university will offer online graduate engagement events throughout the year, according to the email announcement.
Despite the precautions, however, many students will probably still return to the D.C. area to celebrate homecoming, according to Gutierrez.
“I think it’s a poor decision because when you think about it, people are going to be coming back to campus no matter what, regardless of whether or not the university is hosting any event,” Gutierrez said. “But by them not hosting any event on campus, you’re just pushing people to go out into the district, and it’s literally a public safety and public health concern.” 
Although seniors won’t get the homecoming experience they were expecting, the alternatives offered by the university and the SCC will still provide a memorable experience, according to Sanchez.
“Hopefully even though homecoming won’t necessarily happen in the normal way, hopefully, the extended orientation events would help ease that gap in the senior experience,” Sanchez said.

First-time homeowners in a Southeast Washington, D.C. condominium are being told to evacuate their residences after developers and city officials ignored structural problems with the building. 
Homeowners at the River East at Grandview Condominiums on Talbert Street were first advised to evacuate the building Aug. 16 after residents hired an outside engineer to assess structural issues that residents claim to have persisted since the building’s erection in 2017. Despite the evacuation notice, several residents have remained in the building. However, before the evacuations, nine residents filed a lawsuit against the building developers.
Stanton View Development LLC, the condominium developer, constructed the building as part of the Home Purchase Assistance Program, a city initiative that assists with loans, down payments and closing costs so people with low and moderate incomes can become homeowners. Stanton View Development LLC filed for bankruptcy in March of this year. 
Soon after buying her condominium in 2017, Robin McKinney, a resident of the building who sits on Advisory Neighborhood Commission 8A, began to notice that walls were cracking, the air conditioning unit was not functioning and her door was shifting in its frame. Other residents noticed similar problems with the housing units.
The issues were unsettling given that the building was only a few years old, according to McKinney.
“I would respect it more if I was there 20 or 25 years and the issues started happening,” McKinney said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It’s not even five years in, and I’m out of my dream home that I purchased.”
The developers were able to take advantage of the situation and let the dangerous structural issues go unchecked because both Ward 8 and the residents of the Talbert Street building are predominantly Black and low income, according to May.
“Had the population living in the building looked differently — had they not been Black folk — we wouldn’t have gotten this far,” May said.  
Many residents contacted the developers for assistance with the structural issues soon after they moved in; however, none of the concerns were taken seriously, according to LaRuby May, one of the lawyers representing the group of residents in the Talbert Street lawsuit.
“The developers were kind of brushing them off and saying, ‘Hey, this is normal settlement. You’ve never been a homeowner, so you don’t understand that in every new home and new construction there’s settlement,’” May said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “They discounted the repeated request of the residents to address the core issues.”
City officials did not adequately ensure that the condominium was of a livable quality and did nothing to address the residents’ concerns, according to Je Yon Jung, the lead attorney on the Talbert Street case. 
“They should have done a better job at making sure what they were building in Ward 8 was sufficient for habitability and for the health and safety of the people they were putting in there,” Jung said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “They didn’t do that.”
In response to the evacuations, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) launched the Talbert Street Task Force through the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development to help affected residents.
The task force helps residents address issues they may be facing because of the evacuation of the building, according to the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development. 
“The multi agency task force is helping the homeowners navigate their insurance claims, to alleviate loan obligations to the District while preserving their ability to access ﬁrst time homebuyer programs, and to address relocation needs,” the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The Talbert Street Task Force does not do enough to help the residents of the building, who still have payments to make even though their homes are not safe to live in, according to Jung.
“These women still have to pay mortgages, they still have to pay their insurance and they have no place to live,” Jung said. “The task force has not come to resolve that.”
While McKinney waits for the lawsuit to proceed, she remains appalled by the lack of support and extreme impacts that she has felt because of the issues with the building.
“No matter where I go, what ends up happening is that I have to pay my mortgage, because I don’t want my credit to get messed up,” McKinney said. “I’ve worked too hard for it.”

The Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service will only operate on weekend nights and will not accept new members for the fall 2021 semester because of various complications related to COVID-19.
The on-campus volunteer, student-run emergency medical service announced Aug. 21 that it will only operate from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, instead of its usual 24-hour service. Additionally, GERMS announced in a separate post that it is not hiring new members during the fall 2021 semester. 
Both changes result from a lack of training for current members during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Ashley Rensted (COL ’22), GERMS’ vice president of staff.  
“GERMS’s structure is dependent on having members who are qualified to serve as drivers and crew leaders, and both of these positions require comprehensive internal training processes,” Rensted wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
GERMS responds to student illnesses, injuries and intoxication as well as medical issues for any community members in the surrounding West Georgetown, Burleith and Foxhall neighborhoods. 
Training for members includes a combination of review sessions and realistic simulations to ensure members know how to respond to a variety of situations, according to Rensted. Current GERMS members continued their required education to maintain standing as certified EMTs throughout the pandemic, even while GERMS was out of service.
“Attending these training sessions is mandatory for our members to maintain good standing in the organization, and continuing education as a whole is an integral part of GERMS as an institution,” Rensted wrote. 
Although GERMS did not operate between March 2020 and June 2021 because of the pandemic, it hired 11 new members during the pandemic who will begin full-time service after completing training this fall. The addition of these members adds to GERMS’ inability to accept new members this fall, according to Rensted.
Because of the decrease in service hours, students who call GERMS outside of its operating hours will automatically be forwarded to the Georgetown University Police Department. GUPD will then dispatch D.C. Fire and EMS services, according to Faith Kean (COL ’22), a current member of GERMS. 
While GERMS has fewer operating hours, students will still have access to FEMS and GUPD in case of emergencies, according to a university spokesperson.
“We expect GERMS to be able to recover to pre-pandemic staffing levels and regular service as soon as training and certification requirements allow,” the university spokesperson wrote. 
FEMS services will uphold GERMS’ medical amnesty policy for students, according to FEMS Director of Communications Jennifer Donelan. The policy ensures that students receiving GERMS treatment face no disciplinary consequences from the university for underage drinking or drug use that results in medical treatment. 
“We abide by all existing medical privacy laws for all patients we serve,” Donelan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We do not report alcohol consumption other than to hospital staff when medically necessary for treatment by a physician.”
However, while GERMS typically receives two to three calls per weekday and four to five calls on weekend nights, FEMS typically receives over 400 calls a day. 
Further, GERMS ambulance transportation is free for students, but FEMS charges between $428 and $735 for its services. Transportation and care costs will apply to Georgetown students who use the service, according to Donelan.
“As far as billing for medical transport, our procedures are the same for any citizen or visitor to the District of Columbia who utilizes our service,” Donelan wrote.
For students like Allegra Lubar (COL ’23), the fact that FEMS may not be able to respond to student emergencies as quickly as GERMS is concerning.
“I don’t think we should take them for granted, but I do think that their limited hours makes Georgetown less safe,” Lubar wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
GERMS leaders are working hard to return the organization to its normal operating schedule by focusing on training current members for crew leader and driver positions, according to Rensted. 
“We recognize the importance of GERMS being a resource available for our campus community 24/7, so we are putting lots of energy and time into promoting current members into these positions so that we can expand our hours,” Rensted wrote.
Despite this semester’s changes, GERMS is still confident it can assist the Georgetown community, according to Kean.
“We are maintaining a high quality of care with limited operating hours and are still effective and efficient given the limited resources we have,” Kean wrote in a statement to The Hoya.

The Georgetown University Law Center launched a pair of commitments Aug. 30 to help individuals facing housing insecurity throughout Washington, D.C., after the national eviction moratorium expired.
The initiatives come after the Supreme Court blocked a renewal of the national eviction moratorium, originally established because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under one of the initiatives, students from the Law Center are working directly with the office of D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine to provide legal advice for D.C. tenants facing eviction. In addition, the Georgetown Law Health Justice Alliance Clinic, a partnership between the Law Center and the Georgetown University Medical Center, repurposed a program to provide legal advice and free health screenings to D.C. residents simultaneously. 
Many D.C. tenants are not aware of the government assistance that is available to them throughout the eviction process, according to William Treanor, dean of Georgetown Law. 
“At Georgetown Law, we’re focused on two things mainly: what we can do to help people get money from the government program and if the moratorium is lifted in D.C., if there is anything that law students can do to help,” Treanor said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
After the original national eviction moratorium expired July 31, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attempted to re-establish the eviction pause with an Aug. 3 order. The renewal was subsequently blocked by the Supreme Court Aug. 26. 
D.C.’s eviction moratorium is still in place but will end Oct. 12. Congress has allocated over $46 billion to rental relief programs around the country, of which $200 million has been allocated for residents of the District. Many residents are unaware of the program’s existence, according to Treanor.
Under the Law Center initiative with the Office of Attorney General for the District of Columbia, law students work directly with tenants in the District. The students fill out the necessary aid applications from the rental relief programs and provide technical assistance to help residents. 
Even with the help of the law students, the process of filing for rental assistance is still difficult for residents who may be on the verge of eviction, according to Erica Hashimoto, associate dean for clinics and experiential learning at Georgetown Law. 
“For instance, you need a computer, and if a resident doesn’t have a computer, it’s hard for them to fill this form out,” Hashimoto said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Even in D.C., where the process is a little easier, it’s still very difficult for people, especially with getting the word out, particularly because we’re back in the middle of the pandemic.”
As a result of the eviction crisis, D.C. took steps to simplify the application process, offering an accessible application along with a guide for eligibility and a hotline. The Office of the Attorney General also asked for volunteers outside of the Law Center partnership to help with legal clinics around the city.
In addition to collaborating with the Office of the Attorney General, Law Center students are also providing general legal assistance to D.C. residents through legal “checkups” provided by the HJA Law Clinic. The HJA also provides residents with free medical checkups, according to Hashimoto. 
The medical-legal partnership not only provides free medical services for D.C. residents but also helps Law Center students to proactively help tenants prepare for possible evictions, according to Marta Beresin, a visiting professor of law in the clinic. 
“We’re able to get families in contact with lawyers before they get their eviction notice from their landlord and intervene upstream to assist families in getting eviction prevention funds,” Beresin said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Normally, a low-income family in D.C. would not connect with a lawyer until they receive a notice to quit from their landlord or an eviction notice calling them to court because that’s when they first realize they need a lawyer.”
The HJA Law Clinic provides assistance to patients of the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital Division of Community Pediatrics’ KIDS Mobile Medical Clinic, which parks in public housing complexes to provide care for children. The clinic also visits health centers at Anacostia High School and Roosevelt High School to provide assistance to local families.
The Law Center will continue striving to help D.C. residents and will launch further initiatives as the eviction crisis continues to unfold, according to Treanor.
“Our focus right now has been much more on what we can do with getting the word out on this emergency rental assistance program and helping people fill out the forms,” Treanor said. “I think we’re starting to think through what law students can do once landlords start filing evictions, but we’re only really starting to think through that.”

The Georgetown University Law Center has trained over 150 police agencies nationwide in active bystandership over the past year in an effort to prevent harm and encourage intervention in instances of injustice or violence.
The Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement program is a partnership between Georgetown Law’s Innovative Policing Program and the global law firm Sheppard Mullin. The “Train-the-Trainer” event, hosted by the program, invites police officers and departments from across the country to participate in a four-day program with classroom instruction, practical training and real-life situations to bring back to their own departments. 
The Law Center developed ABLE after seeing the failure of bystanders in instances of police violence, particularly the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, according to Christy Lopez, one of the program’s founders.
“When George Floyd was murdered on May 25 of last year, one of the things that jumped out at many of us was not just Derek Chauvin’s knee on his neck for so, so very many minutes,” Lopez said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It was all the officers standing around who didn’t really do anything at all. We’re never going to prevent harm that could be prevented unless we focus on the bystanders who are in a position to intervene and make sure they actually intervene.” 
ABLE currently uses a train-the-trainer model, which aims to instruct individuals who can then pass what they have learned to other officers in their own departments to increase the volume of participating officers and departments. Typically, roughly 30 individuals participate in the class at Georgetown before returning to their respective cities and implementing the training throughout their departments, according to Lopez. 
“There’s actually a fairly strong argument for the train-the-trainer model, because this type of training is actually much better received if delivered to people by people from their own agency,” Lopez said. “This is a kind of training where you really have to get that officer to trust that they can do this, and it will work.”
Over one year after the program was founded in May 2020, 111,800 officers throughout the United States work in departments that have completed the training. 
While many departments have been receptive to the training, however, it can still be difficult to enact change in institutions such as police departments, according to Lisa Kurtz, ABLE’s project director. 
“I think with anything, cultural change is difficult to achieve,” Kurtz said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Any kind of organization that has an existing culture is going to take time, and it’s going to take effort to change that.”
The program is a 20-hour course delivered over one week, starting with an orientation day to introduce the officers to the curriculum. Following days include lessons on the program’s content, homework and training for practicing skills and techniques, and teach backs, during which the officers in the program teach other officers the course materials, according to Lopez.
Georgetown’s ABLE project builds upon the New Orleans Police Department Ethical Policing Is Courageous Peer Intervention Program and the work of Ervin Staub, founding director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Psychology of Peace and Violence Program.
According to Staub, the program is designed to eliminate inaction among bystanders, thereby decreasing the rate of violence during officer and citizen interactions. 
“I have studied what leads people to help others, what leads to active bystandership, and what stops them from active bystandership,” Staub wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I also studied violence by groups against other groups, and how the passivity of bystanders allows the development of hostility, and lesser violence to lead to more intense violence.”
ABLE differs from other training for police departments because it focuses significantly more on tangible skills for prevention than others, such as implicit bias training, according to Kurtz.
“The reason that we focus so much on facing those very realistic situations that officers might find themselves in is so that we give them an opportunity to practice these skills in a low-stress environment, to build the muscle memory for intervention,” Kurtz said.
In the end, the main goal is to reduce violence and fix interactions between police and the communities they serve, according to Staub.
“The result I hope to see is much less unnecessary harmful behavior by police officers — really a transformation of policing in America, and at some point beyond the U.S.,” Staub wrote. “I hope to see a much better relationship between police and their communities.”

CW: This article references violence in Afghanistan. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
“A new Afghanistan is still to come,” a hopeful Roya Rahmani said during a talk with Georgetown University students and faculty Thursday morning. 
Despite a tide of bleak news flowing out of the country in recent months following a hasty U.S. withdrawal and the Taliban’s takeover, Rahmani, Afghanistan’s ambassador to the United States until July 2021, urged the U.S. government and public to fight to preserve the progress the country has made over the past two decades. 
“I feel that now, we need to continue to work, to do groundwork for that change to come with all the people we have invested over time in, whether they are inside or outside of Afghanistan,” Rahmani said. 
Rahmani was Afghanistan’s first female ambassador to the United States. Appointed to the role in December 2018, Rahmani represented a generation of educated and globally minded Afghan leaders ushered into positions of power following the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. Before being sent to Washington, D.C., Rahmani served as the ambassador to Indonesia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
The Sept. 9 event, hosted by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, took place two days after the Taliban officially established a new government, replacing the U.S.-backed regime it had toppled less than a month earlier. The event also fell two days before the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that provoked the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. 
The decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan was hotly debated. Proponents of the withdrawal insisted the United States’ longest war — one that had cost the lives of 2,352 U.S. service members and trillions of dollars — had to draw to a close. 
Critics of the withdrawal argued the United States’ presence in the country in recent years was limited, yet sustainable — enough to prop up Afghanistan’s fragile regime and military. Pulling out suddenly, they warned, would enable a Taliban resurgence, leaving the country’s government on the brink of collapse and endangering women and non-Pashtun minorities. 
Rahmani had critiqued the swiftness of the U.S. withdrawal in past interviews. During the event, Rahmani insisted the United States must not abandon the Afghan civil society and those vulnerable Afghans it had promised to empower. 
“The first practical thing that needs to happen is to ensure that connectivity is not lost. The minute that the cameras are turned away, the minute that women cannot get on the internet, the minute that there is no electricity and mobility, then you are making this black hole,” Rahmani said. 
Without a foreign presence in the country, maintaining communication with and interest in Afghanistan is still important for the world, specifically the media and international leaders, according to Rahmani.
“Civil society will remain vibrant so long as they have a way to communicate and be supported,” Rahmani said. “The biggest plea I would have to everyone is to not abandon Afghanistan. You all can do what you can with your devices in your fingertips or by the contributions that you are making to refugees or advocating for those who are remaining behind.”
Over recent weeks, U.S. government agencies and nonprofits have organized frantic rescue efforts in Afghanistan to evacuate American nationals and Afghans who provided assistance to the United States during the country’s occupation. Charitable organizations across the country have also mobilized to resettle and provide aid to refugees. Georgetown pledged to support vulnerable Afghan academics and civil society members through its Scholars at Risk network, and students are working to collect necessary supplies and raise funds for refugees.
The international community, however, cannot ignore the Afghans who remain in the country, Rahmani said.
“It is basically looked at as if everything we did is rolled up — the attention or the achievements moving forward would be how many people we evacuate and that’s it, while not so much attention is given to the millions of people that will remain,” Rahmani said. “With that, you should also not forget about the progress that we have all made together in 20 years, which was absolutely massive.”
Despite a tumultuous few months, Rahmani is optimistic Afghanistan can still undergo positive change, she said.
“When you have the desire to change, there is always hope. In these gloomy dark days, I am still optimistic. I know that this is not going to be forever. I know there will be a change, and we must prepare for it.”

Sophomore students report feeling isolated and excluded after arriving at Georgetown University with few official orientation events for the Class of 2024. 
Due to the virtual 2020-21 academic year, incoming sophomores and transfer students did not experience a traditional New Student Orientation. The university hosted the Summer Hilltop Immersion Program, a five-week on-campus residential and academic experience designed for rising sophomores and incoming transfer students, in July. However, the program was optional, and 800 of the roughly 3,000 students in the Class of 2024 attended, leaving over 2,000 students arriving on campus for the first time this fall. 
The Class of 2024 experienced a virtual NSO in fall 2020 after the university moved to remote operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Students reported technical glitches and communication barriers in the virtual environment that hindered programming. 
Jenna Thomas (COL ’24) reported feeling excluded from campus life after arriving without a formal orientation. 
“I don’t know the solution, but it’s definitely weird because I definitely felt very isolated coming here even though I was technically a sophomore,” Thomas said in an interview with The Hoya. 
NSO did not have the time or capacity to plan a second orientation for rising sophomores, according to NSO Student Coordinator Brendan Omaña (SFS ’23). 
“Planning NSO for just one class of new students is a very large undertaking, and our team just did not have the bandwidth to coordinate both this fall’s NSO and develop programming for last year’s new students,” Omaña wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Thomas, who did not attend SHIP, reported feeling left out of the social aspect on campus. 
“It was very easy for me to figure out where everything is, but in terms of just socially I feel like everybody has these set friend groups, and it’s very hard to make a good group of friends that isn’t already preestablished,” Thomas said. 
While sophomores and transfer students did not experience exclusive in-person NSO programming, the university did host a New Student Convocation for the Class of 2024 on Cooper Field. 
According to Bridgitte Isom (NHS ’24), the convocation was not enough to orient incoming sophomores who did not attend SHIP. 
“I think it would have been beneficial to have had maybe an afternoon of orientation to help us know where buildings are located and how to take advantage of the resources that are present on campus, like, what’s available at the library, the career center, how can we get medical care if we needed,” Isom said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “Both things like that, that you wouldn’t know how to do right off the bat when you’re living on campus.” 
The university has also marketed Georgetown Weeks of Welcome, six weeks of large-scale programming designed to welcome new students, to the Class of 2024 in particular, according to a university spokesperson.
“These events are designed to help students connect to Georgetown traditions, the campus community, the broader community, and each other,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Isom, who also did not attend SHIP, said she has struggled adjusting to the demands of an in-person college experience after completing her first year virtually. 
“I feel as though if I had done SHIP I would have been able to get used to those daily interruptions that come with communal life on campus, while balancing studying and socializing,” Isom said. “And then that would have primed me for more ease of the transition right now, because right now I’m kind of going through a little bit of a rough learning curve.”
Despite not having an in-person orientation, Isom said she has felt generally supported in her transition to campus life so far. 
“People have just been so kind, so supportive overall,” Isom said. “If I had a question about something, I didn’t know how to figure something out, I always know who to turn to, which has been really lovely.”

The Georgetown University Law Center saw a record-breaking number of applications and a significant increase in overall diversity of the incoming class during the historic 2021 admissions cycle. 
Despite the virtual academic environment that many students endured amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Law Center received 14,052 applications for the incoming class of 2024, a 41% increase from the 2020 admissions cycle. This increase marked the most applicants out of any accredited U.S. law school in history; notably, there was a 12.6% increase in law school applications nationwide during this cycle. 
Of the incoming class, 40% identify as people of color, an 8% increase from the last admissions cycle; furthermore, 54% identify as women. First-generation college students make up 11% of the class. 
According to Jade Baker, president of the GULC Bar Association, the school will benefit greatly from this increase in diversity. 
“Diversity is one of our greatest strengths, and the more perspectives we have in the law school, the better lawyers of tomorrow we’ll all be,” Baker wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The class includes 110 Opportunity Scholars, a designation for students with high academic achievement and significant financial need. The Opportunity Scholarship Program, which was established in 2009, has nearly doubled the amount of participating students in the last decade, according to Andrew Cornblatt, dean of admissions at the Law Center. 
“We’ve very much focused on fundraising for that, and we’ve had great success, and the number of Opportunity Scholars has dramatically grown over time,” Cornblatt said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
The past year’s political climate and prevalence of law in current events contributed to the increase, according to Cornblatt. 
“There was this incredible focus on law-related things from July or August of 2020 through March and April of 2021,” Cornblatt said. “There was this constant, constant impact of people of the law and courts and judges and justices impacting everything. They were the guardrails of what people could get away with. Everything was law related: immigration, criminal justice, elections.”
Young people are realizing the importance of preserving constitutional democracy and working within the legal system, and see Washington, D.C., as a prime place to pursue law, according to William Treanor, the dean of the Law Center. 
“There’s also a recognition that Georgetown is a place that’s focused on service and it’s Washington, D.C., and so as applications surged nationally, we increased at a dramatically higher level than other schools,” Treanor said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
Even with the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting the typical application cycle, the Law Center still saw a three-point increase in the median Law School Admission Test score of incoming students and a median GPA of 3.85, both of which set the highest record in the school’s history. 
COVID-19 also changed the way the Law Center interacted with applicants, yielding positive results that might change how the Law Center conducts admissions, according to Cornblatt. 
“This year, with Zoom, I went to six continents, I went to 50 states, I went to 37 countries, and I never left my dining room, and so I was able to expand the geography of all this,” Cornblatt said. “That was very exciting and I met almost 3,000 applicants, so that allowed more personal input into the admissions decision.”
The Law Center’s efforts to admit a geographically diverse group of students reflect an overarching commitment to diversity in the admissions process and a focus on building a global class of students from varied backgrounds, according to Treanor. 
“Our focus is on making sure that the most qualified people are at Georgetown Law and that every voice is in the room,” Treanor said. “We think that that’s a very important part of education as students: Hear perspectives and people with different backgrounds and engage in dialogue.”
Cornblatt said that even though students enter the Law Center with a variety of backgrounds, they are all united by a desire to drive change amid anxious times.
“They were looking for the future, because where they were right now felt a little dark, and they were ready just to sort of spread their wings,” Cornblatt said.

President Joe Biden has nominated Georgetown University professor Adriana Kugler as the U.S. executive director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Kugler is a professor of Public Policy and Economics in the McCourt School of Public Policy. If confirmed, she will represent the United States and its interests on the Board of Directors of the World Bank Group.
Kugler’s research has informed policymakers and shared analysis of critical issues with the public, according to McCourt Dean Maria Cancian. 
“Dr. Kugler’s nomination serves to highlight her tremendous expertise and distinguished history of contributions to the policy debate,” Cancian wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The faculty of the McCourt School of Public Policy are deeply engaged in developing rigorous evidence to inform public policy in the U.S. and across the globe.”
Kugler has previously worked in the federal government, serving as the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor during the Obama administration, according to an Aug. 31 McCourt news release. She was also a policy volunteer for Biden’s presidential campaign.
Kugler was unable to respond to The Hoya’s request for comment because she is preparing for upcoming Senate confirmation hearings that will take place in the next few weeks.
While Kugler is awaiting a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations committee, she is set to undergo a series of background checks from various federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service. After final votes are held in the committee, Kugler’s nomination will be brought before the entire Senate for debate and a final vote.
The executive director position is one of the U.S. presidential appointed positions at the World Bank, alongside the governor and both positions’ alternatives, that require Senate confirmation.
Kugler holds a B.A. in economics from McGill University and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. Much of her research focuses on public policy, unemployment and immigration. Her published works include a co-authorship on a paper about peer educational effects on children in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and a co-authorship on a paper about the impact of immigrants in U.S. labor markets.
Kugler was deeply interested in understanding how labor markets operate, according to David Levine, chair of the Economic Analysis and Policy Group at UC Berkeley, who helped advise Kugler’s doctoral dissertation. Her knowledge of theory and strength in empirical methods will make her an asset at the World Bank, according to Levine. 
“Since leaving Berkeley I have followed her career successes with pleasure, but not surprise,” Levine wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Adriana combines a deep understanding of complex topics with the ability to explain them clearly. She is an excellent choice.”
The Biden administration announced its intent to nominate Kugler on Aug. 4 alongside eight other nominations to leading roles in foreign policy and national security. Kugler is one of many Georgetown community members nominated by Biden for notable positions in government. 
In November 2020, then President-elect Biden named 11 Georgetown graduates and faculty to serve in prominent positions in his administration, including Ron Klain (CAS ’83), who now serves as the White House chief of staff. In January 2021, the Biden administration selected 12 Georgetown University Law Center graduates and four faculty members to serve in various upper-level government positions, including Avril Haines (LAW ’01) as the first woman to serve as the Director of National Intelligence.
Kugler’s experience in research, education and public service makes her qualified to take on this demanding role, according to Cancian.
“Her decades-long career, working to improve labor market outcomes and policies for citizens across the globe, has undoubtedly prepared her for this important role,” Cancian said in the Aug. 30 McCourt news release. “On behalf of the entire McCourt School community, I wish to congratulate Professor Kugler and thank her for her service.”

Students have expressed frustration over significant delays in receiving packages from the Georgetown University mailroom.
The Georgetown University Mail Services Department has experienced delays after receiving an unprecedented amount of packages, sorting through more than 3,000 packages a day since classes began last month, according to a Sept. 8 email sent to the Georgetown community from Marc Fournier, vice president for Auxiliary Business Services. 
“We have experienced unprecedented package volume at the start of this semester. Our staff members are working overtime, including weekends and holidays, to process and sort each package that comes in, but there will be delays between the shipment and your receipt of packages,” Fournier wrote in the email. 
When asked for comment, a university spokesperson redirected The Hoya to Fournier’s email.
On March 5, 2020 — just days before the transition to online classes March 11 — the university announced it would be eliminating Residential Hall Offices and converting to smart lockers for package distribution. These offices were staffed by students and carried out a variety of responsibilities, including distributing packages and leasing dorm appliances. Community members raised concerns about the subsequent loss of student jobs; the issue was never fully resolved as the COVID-19 pandemic caused the shutdown of on-campus operations. 
Now, package distribution is streamlined through the Mail Services Department and three smart locker locations on campus. To help alleviate mailroom service delays, the university has set up a temporary Amazon parcel pickup center in the Georgetown University Hotel and Conference Center. Students will receive an email directing them to retrieve their packages from the conference center location once their mail has been processed.
Delays have been particularly frustrating for Bernard Medeiros (COL ’24), who waited days to receive his medication after it arrived in the mailroom. 
“I think it sat in the mailroom for six days after having arrived,” Medeiros said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “And that was after it got lost in the mail for a bit. So I was without my medication for maybe two or three weeks.”
Although he received confirmation from the U.S. Postal Service that his package had been delivered, Medeiros said Mail Services would not allow him to pick up his package or expedite the process.
“I tried going to the mail people after it arrived to see if there was any way to expedite the process even though it was backed up. They said no, and I just had to wait,” Medeiros said.
Other students have experienced similar issues receiving their packages, including Elizabeth Smith (COL ’24), who has not received her textbooks after the Postal Service confirmed her package was delivered in August. 
“My mom sent me my textbooks on the day I left. So it was August 19th, and I still have not received them or gotten an email that they’ve been received by Georgetown, even though my mom says they got here August 23rd. So it’s been a while,” Smith said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Smith said she is anxious about using mailroom services in the future to have items shipped to her, including her medication, which must be refrigerated. 
“I am nervous about using the mailroom for any future shipments, especially ones like my medicine because it has to be refrigerated and it’s very expensive,” Smith said. “If it were to get lost or sit somewhere for a while I couldn’t use it anymore so I don’t really trust the mailroom with that, but I don’t know what the other option would be.”
The university has asked students to retrieve packages as soon as possible after they receive an email notification that their mail is available for pickup and has recommended students purchase items in the same shipment to help ease the strain on the mailroom, according to the Sept. 8 email. 
While Medeiros understands the mailroom is experiencing backup issues, they would appreciate more communication from the university on the status of package retrievals, he said.  
“Obviously things are backed up, but it’s more than a little opaque how backed up things are, how long we have to wait for things, and I think people have been trying to figure those things out for themselves,” Medeiros said.

The Georgetown University School of Medicine welcomed its Class of 2025, which it is calling the most diverse class in the school’s history.
The School of Medicine received nearly 18,000 applications for the Class of 2025, with a 40% increase in applications from students who self-identified as being underrepresented in medicine. At a 2.39% acceptance rate, this year’s incoming class is made up of 203 students, including 62 who self-identify as underrepresented. Furthermore, this academic year marks the first time the School of Medicine will be led by a person of color: dean for medical education Dr. Leon “Lee” Jones.
Including people from diverse backgrounds creates an environment where the whole class can better learn from each other, according to Jones.
“In medicine, we know that diversity matters — in the delivery of care by our future physicians and importantly, in their foundational development,” Jones wrote in an email to The Hoya. “When we have more diversity, we are able to bring critical perspectives to learning. It is especially important that we have physicians in our workforce who come from the same backgrounds as the many patients we treat.”
Diverse identities among health care professionals are essential both to the medical profession and society as a whole, according to Lawrence Gostin, professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and faculty director at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.
“Patients should be able to see physicians who look like them and who understand their needs and desires,” Gostin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This requires a fully inclusive medical education system.”
This school’s claim of increased diversity comes in the second year after Georgetown established the Racial Justice Committee for Change, a panel chaired by medical students and faculty members to enact change for racial equity and justice at the School of Medicine. The committee’s mission stressed recruiting a diverse student body and developing curriculum changes that emphasize the intersection of identity and medicine. 
According to Jones, the RJCC has especially focused on listening to student activism regarding university support of the GU272 referendum, and the School of Medicine is working toward actively addressing student activism around the referendum.
“Uniformly the response has always been that every place has work to do, and that’s not news to us. What was enticing to us is that you were actually admitting it, working on it and trying to move forward with it,” Jones said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya.
The School of Medicine strives to create an inclusive and welcoming campus for students of all identities, according to Edward Healton, executive dean of the School of Medicine. 
“In alignment with the Georgetown mission, we intend to be the medical school of choice for underrepresented students seeking a holistic education with a focus on social justice,” Healton wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The School of Medicine is also working to adjust the financial aid and admissions process to promote the inclusion of students from diverse financial backgrounds, according to Jones. 
“We are now combining the financial aid office and admissions into a unified office so that we can more efficiently get people’s financial packages out to them in a quick way and then really address who it is that we want to bring here because the diversity of the class is so important,” Jones said.
Currently, the School of Medicine offers need-based institutional financial aid and subsidized student loans. 
In line with the university’s values, the School of Medicine strives to promote justice and equality in the world of health, according to Gostin. 
“I think the future of medicine at Georgetown is one that focuses on health inequalities based on race and socioeconomic status,” Gostin wrote. “Thinking about justice in health is part of our Jesuit tradition. I believe we will continue to see Georgetown’s students being highly diverse in the coming years.”
